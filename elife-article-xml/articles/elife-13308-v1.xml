industrialized countries and is increasing in prevalence. The pathomechanisms, however, are poorly understood. This study assessed the unexpected role of the Hedgehog pathway in adult liver lipid metabolism. Using transgenic mice with conditional hepatocyte-specific deletion of Smoothened in adult mice, we showed that hepatocellular inhibition of Hedgehog signaling leads to steatosis by altering the abundance of the transcription factors GLI1 and GLI3. This steatotic 'Gli-code' caused the modulation of a complex network of lipogenic transcription factors and enzymes, including SREBP1 and PNPLA3, as demonstrated by microarray analysis and siRNA experiments and could be confirmed in other steatotic mouse models as well as in steatotic human livers. Conversely, activation of the Hedgehog pathway reversed the &quot;Gli-code&quot; and mitigated hepatic steatosis. Collectively, our results reveal that dysfunctions in the Hedgehog pathway play an important role in hepatic steatosis and beyond.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13308.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13308.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13308.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The liver is one of the main organs responsible for processing everything that mammals eat and drink. Nutrients absorbed by the gut like sugars and lipids (fats) are processed by the liver and are stored or distributed to provide energy to other organs. Sometimes these metabolic processes become unbalanced. This can lead to lipids accumulating in the liver – a process known as steatosis, which is a feature of human non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><p>In organs like the liver, cells are instructed how to behave via signaling pathways. A protein outside the cell signals to specific proteins inside, which switch on a set of target genes. One such pathway is the Hedgehog pathway, which primarily regulates tissue regeneration and the development of embryos. A component of this pathway is the Smoothened gene, which indirectly switches on proteins called GLI factors that regulate metabolic genes, including those involved in lipid metabolism. The Hedgehog pathway has been found to control the metabolism of lipids in fat tissue but it is not known whether it is important for lipid metabolism in the liver.</p><p>Matz-Soja et al. investigated this possible role of the Hedgehog pathway in the liver using mice with a Smoothened gene that could be deleted specifically in that organ. This deletion disrupted Hedgehog signaling and led to lipids accumulating in the liver and eventually to steatosis. These changes were associated with an increase in the amounts and activityof several enzymes (and the proteins that regulate these enzymes) that help to synthesize lipids. Steatosis was also associated with low amounts of two of the three GLI factors; indeed, this seems to be key for triggering problems with lipid metabolism. Human livers with steatosis showed the same changes in levels of the GLI factors.</p><p>Increasing the amount of GLI factors in liver cells taken from mice with steatosis reduced the accumulation of lipids and brought lipid metabolism back to its normal balance. A focus of future studies will be to understand how the Hedgehog signaling pathway interacts with other signaling pathways known to regulate liver lipid metabolism, such as insulin signaling. This knowledge will help clinicians to design new treatments for lipid-associated diseases like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

western countries and a disease with an increasing prevalence, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the subject of many investigations and studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dongiovanni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang and Lu, 2015</xref>) to identify unknown risk factors and new treatment strategies. Hepatic steatosis is the hallmark feature of NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enomoto et al., 2015</xref>) and has the potential to develop into more severe steatohepatitis (NASH), which can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis and cancer. Steatosis occurs when the rate of fatty acid delivery exceeds the rate of fatty acid removal (oxidation and export). A comprehensive knowledge of the hepatic lipid metabolism and its control mechanisms is crucial for preventing and treating liver steatosis. To date, these control mechanisms, e.g. the factors governing hepatocyte heterogeneity in lipid metabolism, remain largely unknown and have not yet received adequate attention in the discussion of NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Postic and Girard, 2008</xref>). Metabolic zonation of the liver is of considerable importance for the optimal integration and regulation of the plethora of different hepatic functions and metabolic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gebhardt, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gebhardt and Matz-Soja, 2014</xref>). Recently, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was recognized as a master regulator of the zonal distribution of nitrogen metabolism in the adult liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benhamouche et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gebhardt and Hovhannisyan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Monga, 2015</xref>) and it influences the balance between the anabolic and catabolic functions of glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chafey et al., 2009</xref>). The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling cascade is another important pathway that determines embryonic patterning, cell growth and tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Omenetti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gu and Xie, 2015</xref>), and often acts in close crosstalk with Wnt/beta-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Toku et al., 2011</xref>). Similar to Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, the Hh pathway can act in canonical and non-canonical manners, as explicitly described by Teperino et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Teperino et al., 2014</xref>). To activate canonical Hh signaling in mammals, the ligands Sonic, Indian and Desert Hedgehog (SHH, IHH and DHH) interact with the surface receptors Patched 1 and 2 (PTCH1 and PTCH2) which remove their inhibition of the co-receptor Smoothened (SMO). Active SMO triggers the activation of the GLI (Glioma-associated oncogene) transcription factors (TFs) (GLI1, 2 and 3) by preventing the conversion of GLI2 and GLI3 into transcriptional repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ruiz i Altaba, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Infante et al., 2015</xref>). According to Ruiz I Altaba et al., the 'Gli-code', i.e. the combinatorial and cooperative function of the repressing and activating forms of all GLI factors, forms the basis of the integration of Hh signals (as well as of multiple other morphogens and cytokines) in embryogenesis and carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ruiz i Altaba, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ruiz i Altaba et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2007</xref>). To date, Hh signaling has been found to play a considerable role in various scenarios of adult liver regeneration from progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sicklick et al., 2006</xref>) and in the regulation of the compensatory outgrowth of progenitors and myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jung et al., 2010</xref>). Regarding liver metabolism, we recently showed that the regulation of the IGF-axis (insulin-like growth factor) in mature hepatocytes is controlled by Hh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matz-Soja et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, we were also able to show that the TFs GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3 form a unique self-stabilizing network in hepatocytes and regulate several metabolic genes, including lipid associated factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schmidt-Heck et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, in this study, we have focused on the alterations in lipid metabolism as a consequence of hepatic Hh signaling modulations in vivo and in vitro. To address this aim, a mouse model with a conditional hepatocyte-specific deletion of <italic>Smo</italic> in adult mice was established, in order to avoid interference with developmental effects of Hh signaling. For the in vitro investigations, we used RNA interference (RNAi) technology to knock down several genes of the Hh pathway in cultured hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Böttger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schmidt-Heck et al., 2015</xref>). The results of our investigations clearly show that the Hh pathway is a strong regulator of lipid metabolism in the adult liver. Furthermore, we show that impaired Hh signaling leads to increased expression of lipogenic TFs and enzymes with different zonal preference which finally results in steatosis. Conversely, we demonstrate that slight activation of the pathway by Sufu knockdown, small molecule agonists or GLI overexpression can mitigate lipid accumulation in steatotic livers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Breeding of transgenic mice</title><p>As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, triple transgenic mice which have a conditional hepatocyte-specific ablation of <italic>Smo</italic> in response to doxycycline (abbreviated SLC mice) were generated.

The H&amp;E and fat red staining clearly showed lipid droplet accumulations, which are most prominent in the midzone to periportal zone, but occasionally encompassed the entire parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Quantification of the fat red staining revealed a 7-fold increase in the SLC-KO mice compared with the WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

These results were confirmed on the metabolic and the transcriptional level. Metabolically, we demonstrated the increased accumulation of triglycerides and the significant increase of VLDL particles, which are a hallmark of hepatic steatosis and NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fon Tacer and Rozman, 2011</xref>). On the transcriptional level, we showed that a large set of lipogenic TFs and enzymes were significantly up-regulated following the deletion of <italic>Smo</italic>.

For instance, increased <italic>Acaca</italic> but not <italic>Acacb</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chow et al., 2014</xref>) and increased <italic>Elovl6</italic> expression, particularly when coupled to the down-regulation of <italic>Elovl3</italic>, should trigger lipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jakobsson et al., 2005</xref>). The genome-wide dimension of the role of Hh signaling in controlling central transcriptional events of NAFLD formation and progression was revealed by our microarray studies. In particular, the GSEA revealed that many regulated genes in SLC-KO mice belong to the top 50 abundant changed genes associated with NAFLD tested in 100 unique inbred mouse strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hui et al., 2015</xref>). Intriguingly, one of these changes concerned the increased expression of <italic>Pnpla3</italic> which has frequently been found to be associated with steatosis where it acts as a downstream gene of SREBP-1c to promote lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smagris et al., 2015</xref>). Our observation that liponeogenesis is further increased in the presence of high glucose concentrations adds another piece of the puzzle. Thus, Hh signaling may also influence carbohydrate metabolism in the presence of excess glucose, possibly by increasing <italic>Chrebp</italic> expression.</p><p>Another important result of our investigation is that the Hh pathway appears to play an important role in liver zonation, which is shown by the completely changed zonation of FASN in response to the loss of <italic>Smo</italic>. This result points to a deeper impact of this pathway not only on lipid metabolism but also on Metabolic Zonation as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schleicher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Most importantly, the strong enhancement of SREBP1 und PPRAG protein expression in the SLC-KO mice occurred in the pericentral zone which is in line with published data from mice fed with a high fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu, 2012</xref>). For SREBP1 it was shown that this protein has binding sites at -7000 bp and -500 bp of the <italic>Fasn</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amemiya-Kudo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morishita et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore it was also shown that overexpression of SREBP1c, an isoform of SREBP1, lead to significant upregulation of <italic>Fasn</italic> gene expression in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dentin et al., 2004</xref>). Obviously, SREBP1 does not act alone but in combination with several other TFs such as the NFYs and SP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reed et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>To identify the downstream signaling pathways that lead to the observed lipid accumulations in hepatocytes, we extended our previous work on the Gli TFs, which form a self-stabilizing network in parenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schmidt-Heck et al., 2015</xref>). This network mediates the prominent up-regulation of lipogenic TFs (e.g. <italic>Ppara, Pparg</italic> and <italic>Srebf1</italic>) when hepatocytes are treated with <italic>Gli3</italic> siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schmidt-Heck et al., 2015</xref>). In our current study, we revealed additional <italic>Gli</italic>-dependent transcriptional effects. Even more importantly, we found that the expression of <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Gli3</italic> were significantly reduced in the SLC-KO mice. This indicates that a specific transcriptional signature within the <italic>Gli</italic> TF network which can be termed the 'steatotic Gli-code' lead to the observed steatosis <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.This signature is characterized by reduced expression of <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Gli3</italic>, while <italic>Gli2</italic> is unchanged (or slightly increased), which can be abbreviated as <italic><sub>Gli1</sub>/Gli2/<sub>Gli3</sub></italic>. Using different mouse models with strong steatosis by hyperphagy or leptin deficiency (e.g. MC4R and <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice), we observed the same direction of the regulation of the <italic>Gli</italic> TF’s. This was also supported by measurements of <italic>Gli</italic> expression in liver samples from human patients with steatosis. These results indicate that the postulated “steatotic Gli-code” is universal across several strains and species promoting lipid accumulation in hepatocytes regardless of the manner of the etiology of steatosis. Based on the different functional possibilities of the GLI proteins, Ruiz I Altaba has originally postulated the concept of the 'Gli-code', which describes the combinatorial and cooperative function of the GLI transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ruiz i Altaba, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ruiz i Altaba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2007</xref>). This concept has proven useful in connecting different levels of Hh signaling with the regulation of cell fates and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stecca and Ruiz i Altaba, 2010</xref>). Because the GLI proteins are also regulated by other signaling pathways, e.g. EGFR-MEK/ERK, RAS/AKT, TGF-beta and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernandez-Zapico, 2008</xref>]), the 'Gli-code' may reflect the outcome of integrating different signaling pathways. Regarding lipid metabolic processes, Suh and co-workers found similar changes in the expression of the <italic>Gli</italic> factors during adipogenic induction of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Suh et al., 2006</xref>). These similarities lead us to hypothesize that the transition from the normal GLI-code (GLI1/GLI2/GLI3) to the postulated 'steatotic Gli-code' (<sub>GLI1</sub>/GLI2/<sub>GLI3</sub>) provides a novel paradigm for the regulation of lipid metabolism in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). In case of down-regulated <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Gli3,</italic> prominent lipogenic transcription factors (e.g. <italic>Ppara/g, Srebf1</italic>) are up-regulated and influence an entire network of several genes associated with lipid metabolism which finally ends up with hepatic steatosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). This concept is considerably supported by the finding that the combined overexpression of GLI1 and GLI3 (but not of each GLI factor alone) is able to significantly lower the lipid content of hepatocytes from steatotic ob/ob mice.</p><p>In order to illustrate the complexity of the downstream gene sets affected by the GLI factor network the 55 overrepresented GO categories identified in the ClueGO analysis were reduced to 13 groups by grouping similar GO categories. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref> shows the 7 selected groups (out of the 13) that are related to lipid metabolism only. Besides direct GLI-dependent regulation also possible indirect mechanisms may be included.</p><p>Using ChIP experiments we could provide first hints for a direct regulation of <italic>Srebf1</italic> gene expression via binding sites for the GLI3 protein in its promotor region. However, given the complex interactions of the GLI factors with regulatory binding sites of target genes and the lack of reliable antibodies for full length, truncated and/or phosphorylated GLI factors the results of the CHIP analysis deserve confirmation by detailed analyses using different molecular techniques. Importantly, work by Gurdziel and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gurdziel et al., 2016</xref>) published during revision of our manuscript supports our findings by identifying a comprehensive library of enriched GLI binding motifs in which among else the promotor regions of <italic>Srebf1</italic> and <italic>Pnpla3</italic> are predicted to harbor Hh activity via GLI binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gurdziel et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Even the down-regulation of IGF1 which we observed in the SLC-KO mice and the closely related SAC mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matz-Soja et al., 2014</xref>) may cause indirect alterations in the transcriptome in the liver and in other organs. Whether these effects lead to hepatic changes in the expression of <italic>Chrebp</italic> which does not seem to be a direct target of the GLI factors remains to be established.</p><p>The relevance of our findings for the human liver is emphasized by our observation that increased lipid droplets occur in human hepatocytes when the Hh pathway was inhibited by cyclopamine. This fits to similar results reported for HepG2 cells . Furthermore, the obvious down-regulation of <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Gli3</italic> in human livers with steatosis supports the universality of the postulated 'steatotic Gli-code' and reveals new insights in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism. In addition, the strong up-regulation of <italic>Pnpla3</italic> also correlates with the expression changes observed in human NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Romeo et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, we would like to point out that the already published changes in the IGF-Axis due to impairment of Hedgehog signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matz-Soja et al., 2014</xref>) are even a hallmark for human steatosis. Both, the dramatic down-regulation of hepatic <italic>Igf1</italic> expression and the upregulation of <italic>Igfbp1,</italic> which were reflected in changes of the serum levels of these proteins, were observed in several clinical studies and are strongly associated with NAFLD and the metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Völzke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alderete et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mallea-Gil et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The central role of the Hh signaling pathway in liver steatosis is emphasized by our findings in vitro that activation of Hh signaling via the <italic>Sufu</italic> siRNA, recombinant SHH, the Hh agonist SAG and the combined overexpression of GLI1 and GLI3 was able to significantly reduce the expression of <italic>Srebf1</italic> and mitigate the accumulation of lipids in steatotic hepatocytes. These findings suggest possible new therapeutic strategies for NAFLD. However, a limiting factor may be that high over-activation of Hh signaling may enhance the risk for carcinogenesis .</p><p>Collectively, our study reveals an important role for Hh signaling in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism and its zonation. These findings suggest a new paradigm for the development of liver steatosis. The potential of impaired Hh signaling to trigger steatosis independent of nutritional changes suggests that malfunctions in this pathway may pave the way for the development of NAFLD long before other cues may lead to further aggravation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample-size estimation</title><p>When the study was being designed the appropriate sample size was computed using the Sigma Plot software with a power of 0.8 and alpha = 0.05.

You show attenuation of the Hedgehog pathway in mouse liver, causing enhanced lipid accumulation, appears to be associated with altered abundance of the transcription factors GLI1 and GLI3. In turn, the &quot;steatotic Gli-code&quot; operates by modulating sets of other transcription factors and target enzymes to cause lipid synthesis.</p><p>The major problem raised by the reviewers is the lack of mechanistic data addressing the specific pathways by which the Gli factors actually modulate the downstream transcription factors purported to mediate the effects observed. Have ChIP experiments been performed to assess this issue? Related to this, and equally important, what are the mechanisms by which the specific lipogenic enzymes are regulated? For example, are SREBP or ChREBP or both (or others?) mediating the regulation of FASN? These mechanistic gaps in the study are of major importance in assessing impact of the study, which at this point falls short of publication. Such mechanistic data is considered necessary for publication, and we are hopeful you will be able to provide a revised version of the paper that includes such data.</p><p>Other issues that should be directly addressed in a revised manuscript include: is insulin resistance associated with the steatosis in SLC-KO mice and what are the parameters of insulin signaling in this model?

Is <italic>Gli3</italic> overexpression in ob/ob liver sufficient to overcome the steatosis?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13308.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>The major problem raised by the reviewers is the lack of mechanistic data addressing the specific pathways by which the Gli factors actually modulate the downstream transcription factors purported to mediate the effects observed. Have ChIP experiments been performed to assess this issue?</p><p>We fully agree that mechanistic data addressing how the Gli factors modulate the downstream transcription factors to mediate the effects of Hh signalling observed in our study is scarce. So far, however, this is an unsatisfying situation for GLI-dependent transcriptional regulation in general. In part, this is due to the enormous complexity of this kind of regulation, involving not only two different forms – a full-length activator and a truncated repressor form in the case of GLI2 and GLI3, and an activator form only in case of GLI1 –, but also different phosphorylated states of all these forms. An additional drawback is the lack of suitable tools, e. g. the lack of reliable antibodies for distinguishing these different molecular entities.</p><p>Despite these unfavourable conditions, we have taken the request of the reviewers as a motivation for performing a ChIP experiment with GLI3 according to what we have published for the regulation of <italic>Igf1</italic> expression by GLI3 (Matz-Soja et al. 2014). The results of these experiments are now provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> and give a first hint that direct binding of GLI3 to a binding site predicted by MotifMap in the promoter region of Srebf1 (at -1156 bp) might be involved in transmitting GLI factor activity to the expression of SREBP1. No such hint was found, however, in the case of <italic>Fasn</italic> (at the predicted binding site at -1767 bp) and of <italic>Ppara</italic> (at the predicted binding site at -2674 bp)suggesting that these genes are not primary, but secondary targets of GLI3 (mediated among else by SREBP1). Fortunately, our results are confirmed by recent work of Gurdziel and coworkers (Gurdziel et al. 2016) published during revision of our manuscript, who used RNA sequencing and other techniques to show enriched GLI binding to binding motifs in the promotor regions of (among else) <italic>Srebf1</italic> and <italic>Pnpla3.</italic></p><p>Although all this data is valuable information favoring a direct regulation of <italic>Srebf1</italic> (and possibly of other lipogenic TFs) by GLI3, we are aware that additional work is needed to corroborate these findings and to clearly differentiate them from an indirect one via, for instance, GATA4 as suggested by Suh et al. (Suh et al. 2006) for adipocytes. However, we hope the reviewers will understand that such work cannot be done as a simple addendum to the present study.</p><p>The results of the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments are now provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>. Accordingly, technical details were given in the Methods section and the results were presented in the text and discussed. Furthermore, we cited the confirming work of Gurdziel et al. and added this paper to the reference list.</p><p><italic>Related to this, and equally important, what are the mechanisms by which the specific lipogenic enzymes are regulated? For example, are SREBP or ChREBP or both (or others?) mediating the regulation of FASN? These mechanistic gaps in the study are of major importance in assessing impact of the study, which at this point falls short of publication. Such mechanistic data is considered necessary for publication, and we are hopeful you will be able to provide a revised version of the paper that includes such data.</italic> We apologize for not having addressed this point in the original manuscript with the necessary care. Unfortunately, we cited only one (Reed et al. 2008) of the many studies that have demonstrated in detail that important enzymatic genes of liver lipid metabolism (e.g. <italic>Fasn</italic>) are regulated via transcription factors like SREBP1, ChREBP and others. For instance, it was already shown that SREBP1 has binding sites at -7000 bp and -500 bp of the <italic>Fasn</italic> gene (Amemiya-Kudo et al.; Morishita et al. 2014). Furthermore it was also shown that overexpression of SREBP 1c, an isoform of SREBP1, lead to the significant upregulation of <italic>Fasn</italic> gene expression in hepatocytes (Dentin et al. 2004). Obviously, SREBP1 does not act alone but in combination with several other TFs such as the NFYs and SP1 (Reed et al. 2008). For ChREBP the situation is similar (Morishita et al. 2014). Apart from these major publications a lot of additional evidence in favor of such regulation was published by many other groups (reviewed in (Postic und Girard 2008; Morishita et al. 2014), although mainly in adipose tissue. Thus, we think that giving enough credit to this work in our manuscript should sufficiently answer the point raised by the reviewers even for the specific case of the liver.</p><p>Furthermore, we have discussed in more detail that we do not consider ChREBP as a direct target of the GLI factors, because it is changed in the SLC-KO mice, but not in response to the siRNA interference of each single Gli transcription factor. In contrast, we assume an indirect regulation that deserves thorough investigation in the future. An attractive candidate for a mediating signal is the IGF axis which we found to be directly influenced by the <italic>Smo</italic> knockout in SLC-KO mice (Matz-Soja et al. 2014).</p><p>Concerning the regulation of lipogenic enzymes, references to Amemiya-Kudo et al.; Morishita et al. 2014; Dentin et al. 2004 were added to the Discussion and the reference list. The specific situation of ChREBP was discussed in more detail.</p><p>Other issues that should be directly addressed in a revised manuscript include: is insulin resistance associated with the steatosis in SLC-KO mice and what are the parameters of insulin signaling in this model?</p><p>The question of whether insulin resistance is associated with steatosis in SLC-KO mice is highly relevant. However, from the fact that the serum concentrations of insulin in SLC mice obviously were not changed due to the Smo-KO (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), we concluded that insulin resistance is not associated with the steatosis in SLC-KO mice. This view is further supported by additional parameters of insulin signalling in the SLC model. For instance, we have measured the expression of insulin receptor (<italic>Inrs</italic>), insulin receptor substrate 1 (<italic>Irs1</italic>) and insulin receptor substrate 2 (<italic>Irs2</italic>) via qRT-PCR and found no significant differences. Furthermore, we have performed GTT (glucose tolerance tests) and an ITT (insulin tolerance test) in male SAC mice (a slightly different model to SLC-KO mice) and found no differences between KO and WT animals. Collectively, these results make it rather unlikely that the SLC-KO mice suffer from insulin resistance, at least during the first 5 weeks after <italic>Smo</italic> knockout.</p><p>The results of the qRT-PCR were added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. Accordingly, they were shortly mentioned in the text.</p><p>Also, protein contents of Gli1 and Gli3 as well as ChREBP and SREBP should be provided since the mRNA values may not reflect the actual machinery that modulates the observed effects.</p><p>We agree that mRNA levels alone cannot reflect the actual machinery that modulates the observed effects in the transgenic mice. Therefore, we have determined the protein content of GLI3 by western blotting and show that it is significantly reduced in response to Smo KO. To visualize the protein amount and particularly the distribution of the GLI1 and GLI3 protein in the liver parenchyma of the SLC mice, we performed immunohistological stainings of GLI1 and GLI3 as well. This is important, since Hh signalling is heterogeneously distributed in liver parenchyma (Gebhardt und Matz-Soja 2014)(Gebhardt und Matz-Soja 2014). The results clearly demonstrate that both transcription factors, GLI1 and GLI3, are well detectable in hepatocyte nuclei in SLC-WT animals, but are absent in nuclei of SLC-KO hepatocytes. In SLC-KO livers, these TFs are only present in non-parenchymal cells, e.g. bile duct epithelial cells.</p><p>Similar stainings were performed for the transcription-factors SREBP1 and PPARG. SREBP1 protein showed a slightly pericentral and rare nuclear preference in liver parenchyma from SLC-WT mice and was very strongly enhanced in the pericentral zone of livers from SLC-KO mice. In particular, the frequency of nuclear staining in pericentral hepatocytes was much higher in these mice compared to control mice.</p><p>Likewise, PPARG protein was much more frequent in hepatocyte nuclei of SLC-KO mice than in SLC-WT mice. Also with PPARG a heterogeneous distribution of the protein was obvious.</p><p>In essence, these results demonstrate that the changes seen in the amount of protein for all these TFs reflect those of the mRNA levels. Moreover, they provide valuable additional information about the zonal expression and the functional characteristic (e. g. nuclear localization) of the GLI factors and the lipogenic TFs.</p><p>We have now added the protein content of GLI3 determined by western blotting to the manuscript in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. The results of the immunohistological stainings of GLI1 and GLI3 were added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The results for protein expression of the transcription-factors SREBP1 and PPARG were combined in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Accordingly, all the additional results were described and discussed in the text.</p><p>Is Gli3 overexpression in ob/ob liver sufficient to overcome the steatosis?</p><p>We agree that the overcoming of the steatosis in ob/ob mice via GLI overexpression is very interesting and challenging because of the completely different mechanism by which the steatosis is induced in ob/ob mice.</p><p>We have performed GLI overexpression experiments in isolated hepatocytes from three male ob/ob mice. The cells were transfected either separately with each of the appropriate plasmids alone or with a combination of the plasmids for GLI1 and GLI3. 72 h post transfection we quantified the mRNA expression of human <italic>Gli1, Gli2</italic> and <italic>Gli3</italic> and performed fat red staining to depict and measure the changes in lipid content. Interestingly, our results demonstrate that <italic>only</italic> the combined overexpression of GLI1 and GLI3 (but not of each Gli factor alone) is able to significantly reduce the lipid content in the hepatocytes from ob/ob mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9 D, E</xref>). These findings emphasize the strong influence of the GLI-code and, thus, the mediating function of Hh signaling in an animal model of steatosis of completely different origin (i.e. leptin deficiency).</p><p>The results are shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. Accordingly, all the additional results were described and discussed in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
