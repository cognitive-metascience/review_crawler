delivery of transgenes presents a persistent experimental challenge in neuroscience. Recent advances demonstrate whole-brain gene delivery by retro-orbital injection of virus, but slow and sparse expression and the large injection volumes required make this approach cumbersome, especially for developmental studies. We developed a novel method for efficient gene delivery across the central nervous system in neonatal mice and rats starting as early as P1 and persisting into adulthood. The method employs transverse sinus injections of 2–4 μL of AAV9 at P0. Here, we describe how to use this method to label and/or genetically manipulate cells in the neonatal rat and mouse brain. The protocol is fast, simple, can be readily adopted by any laboratory, and utilizes the widely available AAV9 capsid. The procedure is adaptable for diverse experimental applications ranging from biochemistry, anatomical and functional mapping, gene expression, silencing, and editing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transverse sinus injection</kwd><kwd>whole-brain expression</kwd><kwd>neonate</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>rat</kwd><kwd>viral vector</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F32EY028869 - 01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hamodi</surname><given-names>Ali S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY015788</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crair</surname><given-names>Michael C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY023105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crair</surname><given-names>Michael C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 NS094358</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crair</surname><given-names>Michael C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 EY026878</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crair</surname><given-names>Michael C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH111424</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crair</surname><given-names>Michael C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new viral injection method targets the transverse sinuses to achieve robust whole-brain delivery of single or multiple genes in multiple mammalian species early in development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are commonly used vectors for <italic>in vivo</italic> gene delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Foust et al., 2009</xref>), and recent work demonstrates whole-brain gene delivery by retro-orbital injection of AAV9 and other engineered AAV variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2017</xref>). However, the onset of robust systemic expression of genes through AAVs traditionally occurs several weeks after the time of injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2017</xref>). This presents a particular challenge for experiments requiring gene manipulation early in postnatal development. In addition, current gene-delivery methods, such as retro-orbital injections, are difficult and particularly disruptive in young neonates. Other options, such as intravenous administration of virus through the tail or temporal vein, require excessively high injection volumes (100 μL) that are expensive and disruptive, and still produce inefficient transduction (15–18%) of target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Foust et al., 2009</xref>). Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections can yield strong expression in neonatal brains using small quantities of virus, but results in non-uniform expression across the cortex and requires penetrating both brain hemispheres with a 32-gauge needle, which leads to substantial damage to the cortex and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McLean et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Passini and Wolfe, 2001</xref>). Traditional alternatives, such as targeted gene expression through the creation of transgenic mice, are limited by the burden of interbreeding, which typically necessitates complex and time-consuming breeding schemes to drive conditional expression in desired cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daigle et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To remedy these limitations, we developed an easy and efficient method of transgene delivery through the transverse sinus in neonatal mice, which we refer to as ‘n-SIM’ (neonatal sinus injection method). The transverse sinus is easily accessible along the posterior edge of the forebrain and convenient for virus injection in neonates when the skin and skull remain quite thin. AAV9 is very well suited for this approach given the proclivity of AAV9 to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), especially in young animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Foust et al., 2009</xref>). The position and proximity of the transverse sinus to the brain also makes it particularly well suited for gene delivery to the brain. Indeed, transverse sinus injection of as little as 2–4 μL of AAV9 (1 × 10<sup>13</sup> vg/mL) into neonatal mice results in robust and widespread gene delivery to the brain. With virus injection at P0, we observe dense labeling in cortex, thalamus, midbrain, and hippocampus as early as P4-P5 that persists into adulthood. Sinus injections with AAV9 were successfully tested in both mice and rats but are likely suitable for any mammalian species.</p><p>This method enables the targeting of distinct cell populations at early stages of development and permits the delivery of multiple viral constructs at the same time across the whole brain. n-SIM will dramatically accelerate the application of novel molecular technologies without the need to generate costly transgenic strains or generate complicated crosses. Sinus injections also circumvent the caveats of direct injections into the brain parenchyma, which can cause tissue damage and variable gene expression. This is especially important for neurodevelopmental studies, but the approach is also applicable to older animals as the expression persists in adults. Our method provides an easy and fast way (10 min per pup) to express a wide variety of transgenes across the extent of the brain using the easily accessible AAV9 capsid. Finally, sinus injected animals show no deleterious health effects, either from the injections or as a result of high expression levels typically associated with early embryonic expression in transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daigle et al., 2018</xref>). We describe below in detail how our method is performed and demonstrate its utility in carrying out experiments in neonatal mice and rats to answer fundamental questions that were previously impractical or impossible.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AAV9 n-SIM yields robust whole-brain expression of transgenes during the first postnatal week</title><p>Transduction of neurons in the mouse brain following neonatal injection of AAV9 in the transverse sinus (‘n-SIM’) was robust and widespread.

First, we performed widefield calcium imaging at P9 to assess the quality of functional imaging using this approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). We observed that domains of activity are much brighter in the caudal/middle parts of cortex relative to the anterior parts.

The ability to simply and efficiently label and genetically manipulate brain cells very early in postnatal development provides a ready method to understand how different cell types interact and shape each other’s integration into cortical circuits. For instance, little is known about how different interneuron subtypes functionally integrate into circuits in the developing cortex, and sparse interneuron populations are difficult to access early in development. Vip interneurons, for example, account for less than 2% of cortical neurons and are difficult to label, manipulate or examine physiologically during the first postnatal week as they arrive in the cortical plate at P1 but do not finish migrating until P7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Miyoshi and Fishell, 2011</xref>). This makes it difficult to study Vip interneurons in relation to surrounding pyramidal or other inhibitory neuron cell types, or to conditionally manipulate interneurons in young neonates, as few of them have arrived at the cortical plate by P0-P1 to transfect through traditional viral injection methods (i.e. cortical injections). n-SIM circumvents the methodological challenges of labeling sparse neuronal populations while preserving the ability to combine functional imaging with genetic labeling, as it transfects migrating interneurons more robustly through blood circulation before they finish migrating and sorting into the cortical plate.</p><p>Using n-SIM, it is now easily possible to make inter-species comparisons of development that were previously difficult or inaccessible. For instance, though spontaneous neuronal activity prior to eye opening is thought to instruct cortical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huberman et al., 2006</xref>), it is not clear if common rules govern cortical development prior to the onset of sensation in different species. With n-SIM, we are readily able to examine the patterns of spontaneous cortical activity in developing rats prior to eye opening (~P12), making direct comparisons to similar developmental timepoints in mice.</p><p>One major advantage of n-SIM over ICV is that n-SIM circumvents the need to advance a 32-gauge syringe needle through both brain hemispheres to inject the virus, which is associated with massive damage to the cortex and cell death, and potentially elevated immune response which may alter brain development. This is a particular concern for experiments that are done in neonates, when little time may lapse to repair cortical damage. n-SIM offers a far less invasive way to achieve whole-brain expression without damaging the cortex, which is especially vulnerable during this early point in development. In addition, ICV injections involve applying a large amount of pressure on the brain during the process of advancing the syringe needle to penetrate through the skull and brain, which can be damaging to the developing brain. n-SIM circumvents this problem by not applying any pressure on the brain, due to the transverse sinuses being located posterior to the cortex, and the bone tissue above the sinuses is much thinner than the bone tissue above the rest of the brain, thus requiring less pressure to penetrate with a micropipette. In summary, n-SIM provides a way to achieve whole-brain expression without touching the brain and damaging it with a large syringe needle or applying any pressure. Another advantage of n-SIM is the accessibility of the transverse sinuses and the ability to easily visualize the injection site, whereas visual confirmation of the efficacy of ICV injections is very difficult (injections are done ‘blind’), and rely on a coordinate system and waiting a period of time to find out whether the injection was successful. Furthermore, ICV coordinates rely on the ability to visualize Lamda through the skin, which can be difficult to do as the skin becomes thicker after the first postnatal day, resulting in failed injections. We believe that the high success rate (~90%) of n-SIM is attributed to the easy accessibility and the ability to clearly visualize the sinuses. This feature also makes it possible to perform multiple injections into the same sinus to achieve more efficient expression of multiple viral constructs if desired by avoiding mixing before injecting. This approach yields significantly brighter expression for each viral construct in the same brain. Performing multiple injection entries into each hemisphere using ICV would subject the brain parenchyma to greater tissue damage, reducing its feasibility. Furthermore, ICV injections appear to result in patchy and non-uniform expression across cortex in our hands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McLean et al., 2014</xref>), whereas n-SIM results in more uniform expression across cortex.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Additional applications of n-SIM</title><p>We anticipate that n-SIM will be useful for a wide range of applications, in addition to the experiments described above. For instance, with n-SIM it is possible to edit single as well as multiple genes across the whole neonatal rodent brain <italic>in vivo</italic>, persisting into adulthood, without the time-consuming generation of transgenic animals. n-SIM may also be combined with AAV-mediated CRISPR-Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Swiech et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>) to provide a rapid and powerful technology for precise genomic perturbations in specific neuronal subtypes or circuit elements using the Cre-Lox system, thereby enhancing the ability of CRISPR-Cas9 to dissect gene functions in brain processes early in development. n-SIM may also be used to selectivity silence genes in neonates (e.g. via shRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Yang et al., 2012</xref>).

Our study provides a proof of concept for a powerful tool for widespread gene expression that may also be of significant clinical relevance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57BL/6J</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory Stock #000664</td><td>IMSR Cat # JAX: 000664; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR">IMSR</ext-link> JAX:000664</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Ai9(RCL-tdT)</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory <break/>Stock #007909</td><td>IMSR Cat# JAX: 007909, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR">IMSR</ext-link> JAX:007909</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Vip</italic>-IRES-cre</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory <break/>Stock # 010908</td><td>IMSR Cat# JAX:010908, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR">IMSR</ext-link> JAX:010908</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Nkx2.1</italic>-cre</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory <break/>Stock # 008661</td><td>IMSR Cat# JAX: 008661, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR">IMSR</ext-link> JAX:008661</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Sst</italic>-IRES-cre</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory <break/>Stock #013044</td><td>IMSR Cat# JAX: 013044, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR">IMSR</ext-link> JAX: 013044</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>R. norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>Long Evans rat</td><td>Charles River <break/>Stock # 006</td><td>Strain Code: 006</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-GFP (Rabbit monoclonal, Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate)</td><td>Thermo Fisher</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A-21311, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_221477">AB_221477</ext-link></td><td>1:500</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-NeuN (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Millipore</td><td>Millipore Cat# MAB377, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2298772">AB_2298772</ext-link></td><td>1:500</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat anti-mouse (Mouse polyclonal, Alexa Fluor 555 conjugate)</td><td>Thermo Fisher</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A-21422, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2535844">AB_2535844</ext-link></td><td>1:250</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pAAV.Syn.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40 (AAV9)</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23868258">23868258</ext-link></td><td>Addgene #100843; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_100843">Addgene_100843</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pAAV.CAG.Flex.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40 (AAV9)</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23868258">23868258</ext-link></td><td>Addgene # 100842; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_100842">Addgene_100842</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pAAV.Syn.NES-jRCaMP1b.WPRE.SV40 (AAV9)</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27011354">27011354</ext-link></td><td>Addgene # 100851; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_100851">Addgene_100851</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pAAV.hSyn.iFluSnFr.WPRE.SV40 (AAV9)</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23314171">23314171</ext-link></td><td>Addgene # 98929; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_98929">Addgene_98929</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>All experimental procedures are in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and approved by Yale Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Animals are treated in compliance with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Yale University School of Medicine. To validate our method and test its applicability, we describe experiments employing immunohistochemistry and <italic>in vivo</italic> two-photon and widefield calcium imaging in mice and rats we’ve injected using the n-SIM method, with cross-method validation and control experiments.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Neonatal transverse sinus injection method (n-SIM)</title><p>As described previously briefly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barson et al., 2020</xref>), P0-P1 pups were removed from their cages and placed on a warm pad. Each pup was anesthetized on an ice-cold surface for 2–3 min before being transferred to a cooled metal plate. A light microscope was used to visualize the transverse sinuses (located on the dorsal surface of the mouse head, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Next, sterilized fine scissors (Fine Science Tools, CA, USA) were used to make two small cuts (~2 mm) in the skin above each transverse sinus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>To inject the virus, we used capillary glass tubes (3.5’ #3-000-203-G/X, Drummond Scientific Co, PA, USA), pulled using a P-97 pipette puller (Sutter Instruments, CA, USA) to produce fine tips with high resistance. The sharp pipettes were filled with mineral oil (M3516, Sigma-Aldrich, NY, USA) then attached to a Nanoject III (Drummond Scientific Co). Most of the mineral oil was ejected using the Nanoject. Next, the vector solution was drawn into the pipette. For accurate movement of the Nanoject-attached-pipette, we used an MP-285 micromanipulator (Sutter Instruments).</p><p>The pipette was gently lowered through the skull and into the sinus until the tip of the pipette was observed (using the light microscope) to break through the sinus vessel wall. The pipette tip was retracted until it was 300–400 μm below the surface of the skull, such that the tip resided within the lumen of the sinus. With no delay, 2 or 4 μL of virus was injected at a rate of 20 nL per second. Following a 5 s delay, the pipette was retracted, and the same loading and injection procedure was repeated targeting the opposite hemisphere. The total volume of AAV9-syn-GCaMP6s (Addgene, MA, USA; titer of 1×10<sup>13</sup> vg/mL) virus injected per mouse pup was 4 μL. For RCaMP experiments, we co-injected a total volume of 4 μL of 1×10<sup>13</sup> vg/mL of AAV9-CAG-flex-GCaMP6s (Addgene) and AAV9-syn-jRCaMP1b (Addgene) (1:1 ratio) at P1. For iGluSnFr experiments, we co-injected a total volume of 4 μL of 1×10<sup>13</sup> vg/mL of AAV9-syn-iGluSnFr (Addgene) and AAV9-syn-jRCaMP1b (Addgene) (1:1 ratio) at P1. A successful injection was verified by visualizing viral solution flow in the blood stream evidenced by blanching of the sinus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C’,C’’</xref>). After the injection, the skin was folded back, and a small amount of VetBond glue was applied to the cut. The pup was then placed on a warming pad. After the whole litter was injected, the pups were returned to their home cage and gently rubbed with bedding to prevent rejection by the mother.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mice</title><p>To label different interneuron subtypes, we used <italic>Nkx2.1</italic>-Cre, <italic>Sst</italic>-IRES-Cre, <italic>Vip</italic>-IRES-Cre, LSL-tdTomato (The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) strains 008661, 013044, 010908, 007909, ME, USA) mice. All mice were housed on a 12 hr light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. For histological validation of sinus injections, we used C57BL6/J mice (JAX 000664). For rat experiments, we used Long-Evans rats (strain code: 006, Charles River, MA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Perfusion</title><p>After allowing time for expression (4 days minimum), neonatal mice were anesthetized with a Ketamine/Xylazine/Acerpromazine mix (37.5 mg/mL, 1.9 mg/mL, and 0.37 mg/mL, respectively). The anesthetic dose for this combination cocktail was 2.0–3.0 mL/kg administered via intraperitoneal (IP) injection. Next, mice were transcardially perfused with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at room temperature and then with freshly prepared, ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution at 5, 9, 13, or 20 days post-injection. Brains were then removed, immersion fixed in 4% PFA overnight, then rinsed with PBS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Comparison of AAV9 n-SIM to other methods</title><p>To compare the efficacy of AAV9 n-SIM (AAV9-syn-GCaMP6s) at P1 relative to other AAV serotypes, we injected the same volume (4 μL) of either AAV1-syn-GCaMP6s (titer: 1×10<sup>13</sup> vg/mL, Addgene), AAV5-syn-GCaMP6s (titer: 1×10<sup>13</sup> vg/mL, Addgene), or AAV-PHP.eB-syn-GCaMP6s (titer: 1×10<sup>13</sup> vg/mL, Gradinaru Lab, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2017</xref>). All injection conditions were the same as described above. To compare n-SIM to temporal vein injections, the latter was performed using the same anesthesia procedure described above. Next, we made a small cut to expose the temporal vein, and we used a Nanjoject to inject the virus into the vein. After injecting the temporal veins on each side, the cuts were sealed with Vetbond (Vetbond, 3M, MN, USA) and the pups were returned to their home cage.</p><p>For comparison of n-SIM to ICV injections, the latter was performed using the same anesthesia procedure described above. Next, we performed ICV injections as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kim et al., 2014</xref>. Briefly, AAV-syn-GCaMP6s solution was loaded into the Nanoject pipette. Next, the injection sites were identified as 0.8 mm lateral from the sagittal suture, and 1.5 mm from lambda. The pipette was positioned at these coordinates, and then it was advanced through the brain until it reached 1.7 mm below the surface of the skull, then retracted to 1.5 mm before injecting 2 mL of virus solution into the ventricle. Then, the pipette was slowly withdrawn, and the contralateral ventricle was injected using the same procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). After completing the injections into both hemispheres, the pups were placed back on the warming pad. The pups were returned to their home cage once their body temperature and skin color returned to normal and the pups began to move.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Histological processing, immunohistochemistry and imaging</title><p>To validate and quantify the levels of expression after n-SIM, neonatal brains were sectioned into 150 μm coronal or sagittal slices using a Leica VT1000S vibratome (Leica, IL, USA). Slices were transferred into 0.04% Triton solution, then blocked overnight with 10% goat serum at 4°C. After blocking, primary antibodies were diluted in the blocking solution (1:500), and slices were incubated in the primary antibody solution for 5 days at 4°C. The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-GFP conjugated to AF488 (ThermoFisher), and mouse anti-NeuN (Millipore). Next, slices were washed with PBS (3×15 min), and incubated in secondary antibody diluted in blocking solution (1:500) overnight at 4°C. The secondary antibody used was goat anti-mouse AF555 (ThermoFisher). Next, slices were washed with PBS (3×15 min), incubated in anti-DAPI antibody diluted in PBS (1:1000) for 15 min, washed with PBS (3×15 min), and mounted on glass slides using Flouromount G (Vectashield, Vector Laboratory, CA, USA) then cover slipped. For display purposes and assessment of overall brightness, slice images were captured using a Zeiss Apotome microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with exposure time and contrast settings described in the figure legends. For quantification, slices were imaged using a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 800) equipped with EC Plan-Neofluar 10×/0.3 (Working Distance = 5.2 mm, Zeiss) and Plan-Apochromat 20×/0.8 (Working Distance = 0.55 mm, Zeiss) objectives to determine co-localization between GCaMP6s+ and NeuN+ signals. Signal quantification was done using ImageJ software. Briefly, images were binarized, regions of interest (ROIs) were selected, and the percent overlap between GCaMP6s+ and NeuN+ cells was manually counted twice by multiple blinded observers to minimize bias.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> imaging</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Surgical preparation</title><p>To prepare the animals for functional imaging, mice and rats were anesthetized using 1–2% isoflurane and maintained at 37°C using a water heating pad for the duration of the surgery. The scalp was cleaned with povidone-iodine solution, then topical lidocaine applied and Maloxicam (0.3 mg/kg) administered IP. The skin and fascia layers above the skull were removed to expose the entire dorsal surface of the skull from the posterior edge of the nasal bone to the middle of the interparietal bone, and laterally between the temporal muscles. The skull was thoroughly cleaned with saline, and the edges of the skin incision secured to the skull using Vetbond glue.</p><p>To head-fix the animal, we used a custom headpost which consists of two screws (0/80 × 3/16 MS24693-C420 Phillips Flat Head 100° 18/8 Stainless Steel Machine Screws, Mutual Screw and Supply, NJ, USA) placed upside down on the skull (i.e. base first) and secured onto the interparietal and nasal bone with Vetbond, and transparent dental cement (Metabond, Parkell, Inc, NY, USA). To reduce motion and exposure of bone to air, a thin layer of dental cement was applied to all exposed skull. Once the dental cement was dried, it was covered with a thin layer of cyanoacrylate (Maxi-Cure, Bob Smith Industries, CA, USA) to provide a smooth surface for imaging. The head-screws were threaded through the holes of a custom-made metal bar and secured with metal nuts. For two-photon imaging, we made a 3 mm diameter cranial window over visual cortex of the right hemisphere using a dental drill (Ram Products, Inc, NJ, USA), and the cranial window was covered with a double coverslip (Small round cover glass, #1 thickness, 3 mm + Small round cover glass, #1 thickness, 5 mm, Warner Instruments LLC, CT, USA) and sealed using Maxi-Cure. All mice were allowed to recover from head-post surgery for a minimum of three hours before imaging.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Widefield and two-photon calcium imaging</title><p>To validate functional expression of GCaMP across the cortical mantle, widefield calcium imaging was performed using a Zeiss Axiozoom V.16 with PlanNeoFluar Z 1×, 0.25 NA objective. Epifluorescence excitation was performed using a LED source (X-cite TURBO XLED, MA, USA) with 450–495 nm illumination for GCaMP6s and 540–600 nm for jRCaMP1b through a Fitc/Tritc filter cube (Chroma, 59022, VT, USA). Epifluorescence emissions were filtered with Semrock FF01-425/45-25, Semrock FF01-624/40-25, and Semrock FF01-593/LP-25 (Semrock Inc, NY, USA). Emissions were recorded using a sCMOS camera (pco.edge 4.2) with 512×500 resolution after 4×4 pixel binning, and 100 ms exposure. Images were acquired using Camware software (PCO, MI, USA).</p><p>To validate the ability to resolve single cells for functional imaging under the two-photon microscope at different cortical depths, we used a Movable Objective Microscope (MOM) and galvo-resonant scanner (Sutter Instruments). Two-photon excitation was performed using a Ti:Sapphire laser (MaiTai eHP DeepSee, Spectra-Physics, CA, USA) with built-in dispersion compensation. Laser intensity into the microscope was controlled using a Pockels cell (Conoptics, CT, USA) and the laser was expanded with a 1.25 × Galilean beam expander (A254B-100 and A254B+125, Thorlabs, NJ, USA). The laser was focused on the brain using an objective with a 1.7 mm WD and 1 NA (Plan-Apochromat 20x, Zeiss). Fluorescence emissions from the brain were reflected into the emissions path by a FF735Di-02 dichroic mirror (Semrock), filtered with an ET500lp long pass filter (Chroma), and then split by a T565lpxr dichroic mirror (Chroma) into two GaAsP PMTs (H10770PA-40, Hamamatsu, NJ, USA) with ET525/50 m-2p (Chroma) and ET605/70 m-2p (Chroma) filters for detection of green and red emissions, respectively. The two-photon microscope was controlled using ScanImage 2017 (Vidrio Technologies, VA, USA) and images were acquired at 512×512 resolution without bi-directional scanning.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Calcium imaging data analysis</title><p>Two-photon data were motion corrected for x-y displacements by rigid body registration using the moco toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dubbs et al., 2016</xref>) in ImageJ (NIH). Motion-corrected frames were tophat filtered across time to compensate for whole frame changes in brightness. ROIs are manually selected, and neuropil signal is removed from each ROI’s fluorescence signal as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lur et al., 2016</xref>). ΔF/F was calculated for each cell using the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile as the baseline. For widefield imaging data, ΔF/F for each pixel was calculated by setting the baseline to the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile value for each pixel across time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistics</title><p>Microsoft Excel 2016 and GraphPad Prism 7.01 (GraphPad Software, CA, USA) were used for data analysis and graph generation. Data are represented in figures as Mean ± SEM. Animal group sizes were chosen based on preliminary data that suggested a large effect size. One animal from each group of mice was excluded from analysis after necropsy due to failed sinus injections. Final mouse group sizes are: AAV9 n-SIM at P1 (n = 10) and P4 (n = 4), AAV1 n-SIM at P1 (n = 4), AAV5 n-SIM at P1 (n = 4), AAV-PHP.eB n-SIM at P1 (n = 4), temporal vein injection at P1 (n = 4), ICV injections at P0-P1 (n = 10). For rat experiments, we excluded 4 animals from analysis due to failed injections (n = 4 rats analyzed). For statistical comparisons across groups, data distributions were found to be normal using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and the parametric t-test (unpaired; two-tailed) was computed using GraphPad Prism. Significance was set at p&lt;0.05 in all cases.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by NIH F32 EY028869-01A1, R01 EY015788, R01 EY023105, U01 NS094358, P30 EY026878, R01 MH111424.

sinus injections: A novel method for whole-brain vector-driven gene delivery&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by three peer reviewers, including Sacha Nelson as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The editors and reviewers have consulted regarding your manuscript and have raised an issue that we would like you to clarify prior to making a final decision.</p><p>The manuscript makes no mention of prior studies from the Jankowski lab at Baylor utilizing a potentially similar technique: specifically, intraventricular injection of AAV immediately following birth. Prior to the formation of the blood-brain-barrier, this may be functionally quite equivalent to venous injection and indeed at least one of these papers (2013, European J.

The editors and reviewers would like you to clarify how this prior method relates to that described in this manuscript and in your previously published paper. Please also indicate how you plan to revise the manuscript to make relevant differences clear to readers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is likely to be of broad interest to neuroscientists seeking to influence brain gene expression, provided the technique works robustly, and especially to the degree that other related approaches in neonatal animals are less robust or less effective for some applications.</p><p>The technique described is a deceptively simple modification of existing viral delivery methods but has the potential to be transformative presuming it works as well as it appears to. The problem of conveniently manipulating gene expression rapidly, persistently and extensively within the mammalian brain remains a major impediment to progress in systems and cellular/molecular neuroscience. The authors, by delivering AAV9 directly into the venous sinuses of the skull before the blood-brain barrier has fully formed (P1-P4) achieve extremely robust, rapid and widespread infection of the cortex, thalamus and midbrain with modest viral loads. During the review discussion, another reviewer pointed out the related work of Jankowski and colleagues who also demonstrated in a series of papers that widespread infection of brain neurons at high rates could be achieved prior to formation of the blood brain barrier. These studies, which are not cited in the present paper, make use of intraventricular injection. But this raises the issue of how different the approach actually is, since before formation of the BBB, blood stream and CSF are potentially in continuity. An additional potentially significant weakness of the paper is that the authors have already described the method (albeit somewhat briefly) in a Nature Methods article this year. The other article is mainly about a dual scale imaging technique. Figure 4A-G of that paper significantly overlaps Figure 1 of this paper. In addition, some of the data in Figure 5B, C of the prior paper overlaps that presented here in Figure 2. Although this reduces the novelty of the present paper, there are significant new results in the new manuscript including: 1) relatively detailed comparison with other existing delivery methods, 2) demonstration of the ability to simultaneously inject and express more than one virus (which greatly increases the utility), 3) a more thorough assessment of the duration of labeling and the required timing of injection, and 4) a demonstration of application to another species (rat).</p><p>The technical merit is strong. The authors have done a nice job of examining the distribution of labeled cells across structures and regions but have not addressed any biases that might be present in the cell types infected within a region (e.g. within neocortex).</p><p>Figure 3 makes an important point, about the ability to label all cells and a single cell types (via a cre driver) but a key issue is the degree to which expression of the syn-jRCaMP1b may be biased to particular cell types. Figure 1 also uses Syn promoter viruses, but does not address whether the labeled cells are pyramidal and interneurons in the approximately expected ratios or whether infection via the transverse sinus biases the towards one or the other. Simply co-staining for GABA could allow this issue to be addressed quickly and easily.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this paper, the authors described a method to express AAV in young mice by transverse sinus injection. The paper is clearly presented, and this method appears very useful for developmental studies. However, the authors have recently used this method in a different paper that contains much of the data similar to what's in this paper. It is therefore a major concern whether this manuscript in its current form justifies a new publication.</p><p>In a recent publication that they participated in (Barson et al., 2019), the authors used this sinus injection method to express AAV in young mice. The Nature Methods paper is about microscope design, whereas the current one is about virus expression. Thus, a separate paper is useful for readers to find details of the injection method and its effectiveness, etc. However, the current paper does not provide much new information beyond what's already in the other paper. The current Figure 1 is very similar to Figure 4 of the Nature Methods paper, and the Vip cell data in Figure 2 is in Figure 5 of the other paper. In fact, the Nature Methods paper seems to have more quantifications than the current paper.</p><p>It is true that the current paper contains new data showing that this method can be used to also express RCaMP (Figure 3) and it can be used in rats (Figure 4). Such new information is useful and necessary. Unfortunately, these data are presented without any quantification. This needs to be corrected.</p><p>Additionally, it would be useful to know how long the expression remains stable, possibly for functional studies in adult animals; and whether this method offers an advantage over transgenic mice in that several GCaMP6-expressing transgenic lines seem to display aberrant cortical activity (Steinmetz NA et al., 2017, eNeuro).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Hamodi and colleagues shows a convenient and powerful method for performing widespread transfection of the brain with AAV9 viruses in neonatal mice. The technique is sure to be widely used and cited and in my opinion will be of interest to the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. The authors are exactly right that there are few ways to cause viral expression of proteins in developing animals, and this technique looks like a real advance. The technique is well described and the outcomes are well characterized.</p><p>I have only one major suggestion for improvement. The authors are apparently unaware of the work of the Jankowski lab at Baylor, which has developed methods for intracerebroventricular injections in neonatal animals.

We have revised the manuscript to address the reviewer’s comments. In particular, we performed additional experiments to directly compare transverse sinus injections (n-SIM) and intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections. We note at the outset that ICV injections require that the injection needle penetrate through the brain (cortex) to reach the ventricle, whereas the transverse sinus injections leave the brain parenchyma intact. Moreover, n-SIM injections result in better transfection and significantly more uniform transfection across the cortex than ICV injections. We also revised the manuscript to address the other points raised by the reviewers (as described below). Again, we thank the reviewers for their insightful comments, which we think we have completely addressed, which has resulted in a significantly improved the manuscript. Thank you for the opportunity to present our revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is likely to be of broad interest to neuroscientists seeking to influence brain gene expression, provided the technique works robustly, and especially to the degree that other related approaches in neonatal animals are less robust or less effective for some applications.</p><p>The technique described is a deceptively simple modification of existing viral delivery methods but has the potential to be transformative presuming it works as well as it appears to.

However, this method still requires penetrating both brain hemispheres with a 32-gauge needle to inject the virus, which is associated with massive damage to the cortex and cell death, and results in highly non-uniform expression across cortical regions [Kim et al., 2013; McLean et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2014; Passini and Wolfe 2001].”</p><p>Added this section to the Results “Comparison of n-SIM to ICV: For direct comparison of n-SIM with a previously established method (ICV) for viral vector-driven gene delivery, we performed ICV injections of AAV9-syn-GCaMP6s (4μL per animal) at P0, and harvested brains at P6, P9, and P16. […] We found that ICV tends to label fewer Nkx2.1-positive interneurons and excitatory neurons compared to n-SIM (Figure 5G, Figure 5—source data 2; ICV Nkx interneurons labeled: 7 +/- 0%, n=2; ICV non-Nkx neurons labeled: 26 +/- 8%, n=2; n-SIM Nkx interneurons labeled: 20 +/- 6%, n=5; n-SIM non-Nkx neurons labeled: 30 +/-3%, n=5).”</p><p>Added this section to the Discussion: “One major advantage of n-SIM over ICV is that n-SIM circumvents the need to advance a 32-gauge syringe needle through both brain hemispheres to inject the virus, which is associated with massive damage to the cortex and cell death, and potentially elevated immune response which may alter brain development. […] Furthermore, ICV injections appear to result in patchy and non-uniform expression across cortex in our hands and in previous studies (Kim et al. 2013, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 7; McLean et al., 2014, Figure 1), whereas n-SIM results in more uniform expression across cortex.”</p><p>Added these references: Kim et al., 2013; McLean et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2014; Passini and Wolfe, 2001.</p><p>Added a new figure to show the ICV results “Figure 5”, along with the corresponding figure legend: “Figure 5. Comparison of ICV to n-SIM. […] G. Quantification of Nkx2.1 and non-Nkx2.1 neuronal labeling in mice ranging from P7-P14 injected using ICV or n-SIM at P0-P1. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean.”</p><p>Added quantification of overall labeling using ICV to Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><p>We added a description of how ICV was performed in the Materials and methods section: “For comparison of n-SIM to ICV injections, the latter was performed using the same anesthesia procedure described above. […] The pups were returned to their home cage once their body temperature and skin color returned to normal and the pups began to move.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An additional potentially significant weakness of the paper is that the authors have already described the method (albeit somewhat briefly) in a Nature Methods article this year.

We have addressed potential biases present in cell types infected within cortex by performing n-SIM of AAV9-syn-GCaMP6s into Nkx2.1-cre/flox-TdTomato to examine the percentage of interneuron and pyramidal neuron labeling. Nkx2.1 is a marker for all interneurons originating from the medial ganglionic eminence, which account for approximately 70% of all interneurons in the brain. We believe this is a more technically convenient approach than staining for GABA and is sufficient to address this point. We found that n-SIM labels 20 +/- 6% of Nkx2.1 cortical interneurons (n=5 animals), and 30 +/- 3% of non-Nkx2.1 cortical neurons (n=5 animals). We made the following changes to include these new results:</p><p>We added the description of this result in the “Comparison of n-SIM to ICV” section: “To test the degree to which infection and GCaMP expression via ICV or n-SIM under the synapsin promotor may be biased to particular cell types, we used Nkx2.1-cre/flox-TdTomato mice to examine the percentage of interneuron and pyramidal neuron labeling.

In our opinion, the first figure of this paper is necessary to bring the method into context. However, there is a substantial amount of information in Figure 1 of this paper that was not present in Figure 4 of the previous paper that both substantiates and expands the wide application of the n-SIM technique. In particular: 1) Description of widespread expression across the whole brain as early as P5 (Panels B, C) with our method, ‘n-SIM’. 2) The role of timing of injections (P1 vs. P4) in the efficiency of expression (Panel F). 3) AAV9 yields vastly superior expression than AAV-PHPeB (Panel G). 4) Description and quantification of %neuronal labeling in cortex and thalamus at P6, P9 after P1 injection, and P14 after P4 injection (Panel H). 5) Quantification of %neuronal labeling in a variety of cortical and subcortical brain regions (I). 6) AAV delivery via n-SIM yields robust expression across all cortical layers (Panel N). 7) Sample images showing robust expression in hippocampus (Panels T-W).</p><p>In our recent paper in Nature Methods, we used n-SIM to express AAV in <italic>juvenile</italic> mice (&gt;P16) and achieve pan-neuronal expression of GCaMP6s, allowing us to image calcium activity from Vip and excitatory neurons simultaneously. However, in our current paper, we describe the ability of n-SIM to achieve pan-neuronal expression in <italic>neonatal</italic> mice (P4), and we show the ability to achieve robust expression of AAV in interneurons during the first postnatal week, which is challenging to do as interneurons do not finish migrating into cortex until P7, thus making it difficult to label/manipulate them using traditional approaches (i.e. cortical injections). Therefore, the Vip cell data in Figure 2 of this paper does not overlap with Figure 5 of the previous paper. In addition, we show that all interneuron subtypes are labeled during the first postnatal week using n-SIM, and the expression is sufficiently bright to enable 2-photon imaging of deep cortical layers, in addition to superficial layers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is true that the current paper contains new data showing that this method can be used to also express RCaMP (Figure 3) and it can be used in rats (Figure 4).

We added a new panel to show these results in Figure 4F, along with the following description of these results in the “Multispecies compatibility of n-SIM” section:</p><p>“Quantification of neuronal labeling using n-SIM shows robust expression across different cortical and subcortical regions in the rat brain (Figure 4F; Figure 4—source data 1F, M1: 36 +/- 8%, n=4; S1: 33 +/- 10%, n=3; V1: 35 +/- 10%, n=4; RSA: 38 +/- 10%, n=4; thalamus: 40 +/- 5%, n=4; hippocampus: 30 +/- 14%, n=4).
