Cryofixation by high-pressure freezing offers optimal morphological preservation, as it captures cellular structures instantaneously in their near-native state. However, the applicability of cryofixation is limited by its incompatibility with diaminobenzidine labeling using genetic EM tags and the high-contrast <italic>en bloc</italic> staining required for serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM). In addition, it is challenging to perform correlated light and electron microscopy (CLEM) with cryofixed samples. Consequently, these powerful methods cannot be applied to address questions requiring optimal morphological preservation. Here, we developed an approach that overcomes these limitations; it enables genetically labeled, cryofixed samples to be characterized with SBEM and 3D CLEM. Our approach is broadly applicable, as demonstrated in cultured cells, <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory organ and mouse brain. This optimization exploits the potential of cryofixation, allowing for quality ultrastructural preservation for diverse EM applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryofixation by high pressure freezing</kwd><kwd>APEX2</kwd><kwd>CryoChem</kwd><kwd>genetic labeling</kwd><kwd>correlated light and electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>serial block-face scanning electron microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC015519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Chih-Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41GM103412</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ellisman</surname><given-names>Mark H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001692</institution-id><institution>Croucher Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsang</surname><given-names>Tin Ki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001201</institution-id><institution>Kavli Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015-004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Chih-Ying</given-names></name><name><surname>Ellisman</surname><given-names>Mark H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002836</institution-id><institution>Ray Thomas Edwards Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Chih-Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007911</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Diego</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Frontiers of Innovation Scholars Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsang</surname><given-names>Tin Ki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM086197</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boassa</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001201</institution-id><institution>Kavli Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016-038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boassa</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name><name><surname>Dulcis</surname><given-names>Davide</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A broadly applicable method that faithfully preserves genetically labeled cellular structures for 3D electron microscopy (EM) and correlated light and electron microscopy (CLEM).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The answers to many questions in biology lie in the ability to examine the relevant biological structures accurately at high resolution. Electron microscopy (EM) offers the unparalleled power to study cellular morphology and structure at nanoscale resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leapman, 2004</xref>). Cryofixation by high-pressure freezing (hereafter referred to as cryofixation) is the optimal fixation method for samples of thicknesses up to approximately 500 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dahl and Staehelin, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McDonald, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moor, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shimoni et al., 1998</xref>). By rapidly freezing the samples in liquid nitrogen (−196 °C) under high pressure (~2100 bar), cryofixation immobilizes cellular structures within milliseconds and preserves them in their near-native state. In contrast, cross-linking-based chemical fixation takes place at higher temperatures (≥4 °C) and depends on the infiltration of aldehyde fixatives, a process which takes seconds to minutes to complete. During chemical fixation, cellular structures may deteriorate or undergo rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Korogod et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Steinbrecht and Müller, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Szczesny et al., 1996</xref>) and enzymatic reactions can proceed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kellenberger et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sabatini et al., 1963</xref>), potentially resulting in significant morphological artefacts.</p><p>Cryofixation is especially critical, and often necessary, for properly fixing tissues with cell walls or cuticles that are impermeable to chemical fixatives, such as samples from yeast, plant, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doroquez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaeser et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiss et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McDonald, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Müller-Reichert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shanbhag et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shanbhag et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Winey et al., 1995</xref>). As cryofixation instantaneously halts all cellular processes, it also provides the temporal control needed to capture fleeting biological events in a dynamic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hess et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Watanabe et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">2013b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2014b</xref>).</p><p>Despite the clear benefits of cryofixation, it is incompatible with diaminobenzidine (DAB) labeling reactions by genetic EM tags. For example, APEX2 (enhanced <underline>a</underline>scorbate <underline>pe</underline>ro<underline>x</underline>idase) is an engineered peroxidase that catalyzes DAB reaction to render target structures electron dense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martell et al., 2012</xref>). Despite the successful applications of APEX2 to three-dimensional (3D) EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Joesch et al., 2016</xref>), there has been no demonstration that APEX2 or other genetic EM tags can be activated following cryofixation. Conventionally, cryofixation is followed by freeze-substitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Steinbrecht and Müller, 1987</xref>), during which water in the sample is replaced by organic solvents. However, the resulting dehydrated environment is incompatible with the aqueous enzymatic reactions required for DAB labeling by genetic EM tags.</p><p>EM structures can also be genetically labeled with fluorescent markers through correlated light and electron microscopy (CLEM). Yet, performing CLEM with cryofixed samples also presents challenges. Fluorescence microscopy commonly takes place either before cryofixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brown et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kolotuev et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McDonald, 2009</xref>) or at a later stage after the sample is embedded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kukulski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nixon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schwarz and Humbel, 2009</xref>). However, if the specimen is dissected from live animals, the time taken to acquire fluorescence images delays cryofixation and could cause ultrastructural deterioration. In order for fluorescence microscopy to take place after embedding, special acrylic resins need to be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kukulski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nixon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schwarz and Humbel, 2009</xref>) and only a low concentration of osmium tetroxide stain can be tolerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Boer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watanabe et al., 2011</xref>). Although one can in principle perform fluorescence microscopy in cryofixed samples after rehydration, fluorescence images have only been acquired in sucrose-infiltrated cryosections (300–500 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ripper et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stierhof and El Kasmi, 2010</xref>). Moreover, no protocol has been developed to prepare large cryofixed tissues expressing genetic CLEM markers for high-contrast EM imaging. These constraints limit the applicability of CLEM for cryofixed samples.</p><p>Another disadvantage of cryofixation is that <italic>en bloc</italic> staining during freeze-substitution is often inadequate. As a result, post-staining of ultramicrotomy sections is frequently needed for cryofixed samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shanbhag et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shanbhag et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>). However, post-staining could be labor-intensive and time-consuming, especially for volume EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ryan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). Critically, on-section staining is impossible for samples imaged with block-face volume EM techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Briggman and Bock, 2012</xref>), such as serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Denk and Horstmann, 2004</xref>). A large amount of heavy metal staining is necessary for SBEM to generate sufficient back-scatter electron signal and to prevent specimen charging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deerinck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kelley et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tapia et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it remains impossible to image cryofixed samples with SBEM or other techniques that require high-contrast staining.</p><p>To overcome these limitations of cryofixation, here we present a robust approach, named the CryoChem Method (CCM), which combines key advantages of cryofixation and chemical fixation. This technique enables labeling of target structures by genetically encoded EM tags or fluorescent markers in cryofixed samples, and permits high-contrast <italic>en bloc</italic> heavy metal staining sufficient for SBEM. Specifically, we rehydrate cryofixed samples after freeze-substitution to make the specimen suitable for subsequent aqueous reactions and fluorescence imaging. We successfully apply CCM to multiple biologically significant systems with distinct ultrastructural morphology, including cultured mammalian cells, <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory organ (antenna) and mouse brain. By overcoming critical technical barriers, our method exploits the potential of cryofixation, making it compatible with genetically encoded EM tags and any EM techniques that require substantial heavy metal staining. Furthermore, the versatility of CCM allows us to achieve 3D CLEM in a well-preserved mouse brain by permitting SBEM after fluorescent imaging of a frozen-rehydrated specimen.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Given that a key limitation of cryofixation arises from the dehydrated state of the samples after freeze-substitution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), it is imperative that our approach delivers a cryofixed specimen that is fully hydrated and can then be processed at higher temperatures (4 °C or room temperature) for enzymatic reactions and/or high-contrast <italic>en bloc</italic> heavy metal staining. It has been demonstrated that cryofixed samples can be rehydrated for immunogold labeling or fluorescence imaging following cryosectioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dhonukshe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ripper et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stierhof and El Kasmi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Donselaar et al., 2007</xref>), but these approaches only yield modest EM contrast. In addition, the methods are incompatible with volume EM techniques and have yet to be successfully combined with genetic labeling using APEX2.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35524.002</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the advantages and limitations of different sample preparation methods for electron microscopy.</title><p>The CryoChem Method (CCM) combines the advantages of chemical fixation and cryofixation.

CCM begins with high-pressure freezing of a sample, followed by freeze-substitution in an acetone solution with glutaraldehyde (0.2%), uranyl acetate (0.1%), methanol (2%) and water (1%), to further stabilize the cryo-preserved structures at low temperatures. After freeze-substitution, the sample is rehydrated gradually on ice with a series of acetone solutions containing an increasing concentration of water or 0.1 M HEPES. Once completely rehydrated, the cryofixed sample is amenable for imaging with fluorescence microscopy, DAB labeling reactions using genetically encoded tags, and the high-contrast <italic>en bloc</italic> staining (e.g. osmium-thiocarbohydrazide-osmium and uranyl acetate) normally reserved only for chemically fixed samples. Afterwards, the samples is dehydrated through a series of ethanol solutions and acetone, then infiltrated with epoxy resin and cured using standard EM procedures. To minimize volume artefact, epoxy resin is chosen because it causes minimal tissue shrinkage during embedding (&lt;2%) compared to other embedding media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kushida, 1962</xref>). The resin-embedded sample can be sectioned or imaged directly with any desired EM technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, see Materials and methods for details).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35524.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flowchart of the CryoChem method.</title><p>After cryofixation by high-pressure freezing and freeze-substitution, cryofixed samples are rehydrated gradually.

A hallmark of optimally preserved antennal tissues prepared by cryofixation is the smooth appearance of membrane structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shanbhag et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shanbhag et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steinbrecht, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Steinbrecht and Müller, 1987</xref>). In the insect antenna, auxiliary cells extend microlamellae to surround the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), forming the most membrane-rich regions in the antenna. We therefore focused on this structure to evaluate the quality of morphological preservation afforded by our method. In the CCM-processed antennal tissues, we found that the delicate structure of the microlamellae was well-preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>), unlike the chemically fixed counterparts in which microlamellae were disorganized and distorted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steinbrecht, 1980</xref>).

Of note, the CLEM accuracy was ensured by using a subset of DRAQ5-labeled heterochromatin structures and their corresponding counterparts in EM as finer fiducial points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>The fluorescent markers made it possible to identify the target cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>) in the SBEM volume. The high accuracy of correlation achieved by our 3D CLEM protocol is demonstrated by the successful alignments of multiple ultrastructures: the fine neuronal processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and a subcellular heterochromatin structure that was not used as a fiducial marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Lastly, we note that with CCM, fluorescence microscopy in cryofixed specimens takes place before <italic>en bloc</italic> EM staining. Therefore, our protocol does not require special resins for embedding and permits high-contrast staining with high concentrations of osmium tetroxide.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We described here a hybrid method, named CryoChem, which combines key advantages of cryofixation and chemical fixation to substantially broaden the applicability of the optimal fixation technique. With CCM, it is now possible to label target structures with DAB by a genetically encoded EM tag and deposit high-contrast <italic>en bloc</italic> staining in cryofixed tissues. In addition, with CCM, one can image cells expressing fluorescent markers before resin embedding and perform 3D CLEM in cryofixed specimens. Our method thereby provides an alternative to conventional cryofixation and chemical fixation methods.</p><p>The modular nature of CCM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) makes it highly versatile as researchers can modify the modules to best suit their needs. For instance, to prevent over-staining, one can replace the high-contrast <italic>en bloc</italic> staining step (osmium-thiocarbohydrazide-osmium and uranyl acetate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deerinck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tapia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">West et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Williams et al., 2011</xref>) with a single round of osmium tetroxide staining for thin section TEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>) or electron tomography. In addition, CCM is essentially compatible with a wide range of reactions catalyzed by EM tags other than APEX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellisman et al., 2015</xref>). For example, the protein labeling reactions mediated by miniSOG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shu et al., 2011</xref>) and the tetracysteine-based methods using FIAsH and ReAsH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaietta et al., 2002</xref>), or the non-protein biomolecule labeling reactions using Click-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ngo et al., 2016</xref>) or ChromEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ou et al., 2017</xref>). The versatility of CCM will likely expand the breath of biological questions that can be addressed using cryofixed samples.</p><p>In addition to using EM tags, we have also developed a 3D CLEM protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) that allows optimally preserved EM structures to be genetically labeled with fluorescent markers in CCM-processed tissues. In contrast to EM tags, fluorescent markers do not generate electron-dense products (e.g. DAB polymers) that can obscure the subcellular structures. Moreover, with multicolor CLEM, one can utilize multiple readily available genetically encoded fluorescent markers to label different target structures or cells. Using the 3D CLEM protocol, one could also pinpoint labeled subcellular structures (e.g., microtubules) or proteins (e.g., ion channels) in an EM volume with super-resolution microscopy. Furthermore, the ability to genetically label target neurons with fluorescent markers or EM tags in CCM-processed tissues can facilitate circuit reconstructions of identified neurons in optimally preserved specimens.</p><p>The advantages of CCM make it particularly suited for addressing biological questions that require optimal and rapid preservation of a genetically labeled structure. For example, to construct an accurate model to describe the biophysical properties of a neuron, it is essential to acquire morphological measurements based on faithfully preserved ultrastructures. CCM processing provides such an opportunity; we were able to obtain a 3D reconstruction of a genetically labeled <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORN at nanoscale resolution with quality morphological preservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In addition, by combining CCM with Flash-and-Freeze EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Watanabe et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">2013b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2014b</xref>) and electron tomography, it is possible to capture the fast morphological changes of genetically labeled vesicles in 3D during synaptic transmission.</p><p>Despite its versatility, multiple factors could potentially limit the applicability of CCM. First, given that the core fixation step of CCM is cryofixation, the size of the sample is constrained by the vitrification limit of up to approximately 500 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dahl and Staehelin, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McDonald, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moor, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shimoni et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, freeze damage due to ice crystal formation can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Korogod et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ripper et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shanbhag et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, one should be mindful of freeze damage when performing ultrastructural analysis. Moreover, CCM can only improve the temporal resolution of biological events captured if the specimen is frozen in the live state, but not when the sample was first chemically fixed (e.g. aldehyde-perfused mouse brain). Finally, there are also concerns that some molecules may be lost during rehydration if they are not properly fixed during freeze-substitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ripper et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, CCM is applicable to addressing questions in diverse tissue types, as demonstrated here with cultured mammalian cells or tissues of <italic>Drosophila</italic> antennae and mouse brains. Notably, identical solutions and experimental conditions were used for these different tissues in all core steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, the protocol described here can likely be readily adapted to cells and tissues of other biological systems. In addition, we demonstrated that CCM can further improve the ultrastructure of an aldehyde-perfused brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Given that aldehyde perfusion is often required for the dissection of deeply embedded or fragile tissues, the compatibility of CCM with aldehyde fixation further broadens the applicability of the method.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>Or47b-GAL4</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005</xref>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_9984">BDSC_9984</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>Or22a-GAL4</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dobritsa et al., 2003</xref>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_9951">BDSC_9951</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>10XUAS-myc-APEX2-Orco</td><td>this study</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">see Materials and methods</td></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>10XUAS-mCD8GFP-APEX2</td><td>this study</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">see Materials and methods</td></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>B6.Cg-Crht<sup>m1(cre)Zjh</sup>/J</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="bottom">031559 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:031559">IMSR_JAX:031559</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>B6.Cg-Gt.ROSA.26 <break/>Sor<sup>tm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze</sup>/J</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="bottom">007914 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:007914">IMSR_JAX:007914</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>TH-GFP</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kessler et al., 2003</xref>)</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>cell line</td><td>HEK 293T</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CRL-3216 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0063">CVCL_0063</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>DRAQ5</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>4084</td><td>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>recombinant DNA <break/>reagent (plasmids)</td><td>pcDNA3-Mito-V5-APEX2</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2015</xref>)</td><td>Addgene_72480</td><td/></tr><tr><td>recombinant DNA <break/>reagent (plasmids)</td><td valign="bottom">APEX2 DNA</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2015</xref>)</td><td valign="bottom">Addgene_49386</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>recombinant DNA <break/>reagent (plasmids)</td><td valign="bottom">APEX2-Orco</td><td>this study</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">see Materials and methods</td></tr><tr><td>recombinant DNA <break/>reagent (plasmids)</td><td valign="bottom">mCD8GFP-APEX2</td><td>this study</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">see Materials and methods</td></tr><tr><td>chemical compound, drug</td><td>paraformaldehyde</td><td>Fisher Scientific</td><td>04042–500</td><td/></tr><tr><td>chemical compound, drug</td><td>glutaraldehyde</td><td>Ted Pella</td><td>18426</td><td/></tr><tr><td>chemical compound, drug</td><td>sodium cacodylate</td><td>Ted Pella</td><td>18851</td><td/></tr><tr><td>chemical compound, drug</td><td>CaCl<sub>2</sub></td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>223506</td><td/></tr><tr><td>chemical compound, drug</td><td>glycine</td><td>Bio-Rad Laboratories</td><td>161–0718</td><td/></tr><tr><td>chemical compound, drug</td><td>BSA</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>9048-46-8</td><td/></tr><tr><td>chemical compound, drug</td><td>1-hexadecene</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>H2131</td><td/></tr><tr><td>chemical compound, drug</td><td>uranyl acetate</td><td>Electron Microscopy Sciences</td><td>22400</td><td/></tr><tr><td>chemical compound, drug</td><td>methanol</td><td>Fisher Scientific</td><td>A412-4</td><td/></tr><tr><td>chemical compound, drug</td><td>acetone</td><td>ACROS Organics</td><td>AC326800010</td><td/></tr><tr><td>chemical compound, drug</td><td>HEPES</td><td>Gibco</td><td>15-630-080</td><td/></tr><tr><td>chemical compound, drug</td><td>diaminobenzidine;

Auto-segmentation was followed by manual proofreading and reconstruction by two independent proofreaders. The proofreaders used elementary operations in IMOD, most commonly the ‘drawing tools’ to correct the contours generated by ‘imodauto’. Where ‘imodauto’ failed to be applied successfully, the proofreaders also used the ‘drawing tools’ to directly trace the outline of the labeled structure. The contours of ORNs generally do not vary markedly between adjacent sections.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor, who served as one of the reviewers, and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor.

This is an important methodological contribution that in principle would merit a publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, I have a few concerns that in my view need to be addressed:</p><p>1) The concrete applications of the improved protocol remain a little unclear. Especially it is not clear at what resolution and for which volumes correlated LM-EM imaging becomes possible with this approach. The authors show data that speaks for cellular level correlation, i.e. the identification of stained cell bodies which has been possible before (Bock et al.; Briggman et al.) and would not be a major improvement. A correlation at the level of subcellular structures while still being able to acquire large 3D EM volumes would be highly commendable but it is not clear whether that is in fact achieved. Moreover, numbers on dataset size, resolution, etc. are missing from the Results section. They can be found in the Materials and methods but for such a methodological paper it would be absolutely critical in this reviewer’s view to have the numbers on acquired 3D EM volumes, resolution etc. in the main text. It appears that the SBEM volume acquired has a z extent of about 50 micrometers, however at a section thickness of 70 nanometers. 70 nanometers of section thickness would not routinely allow for neuronal circuitry construction – neither in fly nor in mammalian brains. This should be addressed or clarified. Again, all of these points would profit from a clearer description of the concrete application examples.</p><p>2) The description is not extremely clear, for instance the usage of the word &quot;temporal&quot; in the Abstract comes as a surprise and is only understandable after realizing that the authors are referring to the time scale of fixations. This is just one example of several.</p><p>3) Along these lines the figures are not optimal. While they show some images that look plausible, more and better labeled panels may be needed to explain the application examples, potentially in a protocol sketch for each figure, making it clearer which possible application (which attempted imaging resolution, scope, LM-EM correlation at subcellular or cellular scale, cell bodies or dendrites or axons etc.) is shown.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Tsang et al. describe a hybrid chemical/freezing fixation method to results in specimens in an aqueous environment. The authors show this method allows subsequent enzymatic reactions, high-contrast en bloc staining, and correlative fluorescence microscopy. They also demonstrate the applicability in cultured cells, fly antennae, and acute mouse brain slices.</p><p>The methodological advance claimed by the authors is a rehydration step following freeze substitution. They compare their method to (van Donselaar et al., 2007), but there are uncited examples of hybrid protocols involving rehydration to achieve an aqueous environment for further tissue processing: Ripper, Schwarz and Stierhof, 2008; Stierhof and Kasmi, 2010.</p><p>Indeed, these studies demonstrate advances that Tsang et al. seem to be claiming as novel. For example, (Stierhof et al., 2010) explicitly show the ability to image GFP, YFP and RFP expression following rehydration.</p><p>I suppose the demonstration of high-contrast heavy metal staining and enzyme chemistry in an aqueous environment following freeze substitution is new, but not particularly surprising. Given the prior use of rehydration following freeze substitution for similar purposes, I doubt the presented method requires a new acronym (CCM).</p><p>Finally, one of the benefits claimed in the text and Figure 1 is the high temporal resolution of the method. For cell culture and fly antenna this is true but, in practice, this does not apply to the data presented from mouse brain in which chemical fixation by perfusion was first carried out.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper highlights a new approach – CryoChem Method (CCM), which researchers can use to perform 3D electron microscopy on large specimens (up to a scale of ~500 µm in each dimension); these samples are first frozen rapidly at high pressure in their native state, and then freeze-substituted with mild fixation, before being rehydrated. This rehydration step is the key aspect of the work: it improves ultrastructural quality, while also importantly maintaining the viability of proteins that can be subsequently imaged by fluorescent tagging, e.g., DAB-based labeling schemes, such as miniSOGs and DAB polymerization before staining and embedding for SBEM, or other 3D imaging techniques. Although the CCM might seem like an obvious extension of existing approaches, it is not yet widely known by the scientific community, and is therefore likely to be of considerable value to structural and cell biologists.</p><p>Many valuable new techniques have some limitations in addition to their important advantages. Perhaps the authors could discuss some potential limitations (if they exist). For example, presumably some molecules that are retained in standard freeze-substitution protocols might be lost in the rehydration step. Is this a concern? One of the most important applications of the CCM approach is its ability to provide correlative LM/EM on large specimens. However, the LM is performed in the liquid state after hydration before embedding, whereas the 3D SBEM is performed after embedding. What is the precision of the correlative imaging? Does the rehydration introduce swelling or the embedding introduce shrinkage? The only figure that illustrates the correlative imaging is Figure 6, but it is difficult to assess the precision of the registration between the SBEM and the confocal LM images in this example. Could the authors provide some estimate of this?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35524.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] While the reviewers see the merits of this work, they raised a set of key concerns, and after discussion decided to request the following points for the revision of this manuscript:</p><p>- Proper citation and discussion of the literature as indicated by reviewer 2; clarification of which additional advances were made compared to the published protocols.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #2 for pointing us to the two important studies that demonstrated the preservation of fluorescent signals in cryofixed-rehydrated thin cryosections (Ripper et al., 2008 and Stierhof and Kasmi, 2010). We have now referenced both papers accordingly. We also clarified that we are not the first group to make fluorescence imaging possible in cryofixed-rehydrated tissues. Furthermore, in addition to van Donselaar et al., 2007, we now cited Dhonukshe et al., 2007 for the development of rehydration protocols for cryofixed samples.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we also compared our approach to several existing methods. We described the key advances of our method in the Introduction and the Results sections. Although earlier methods permit fluorescent imaging in cryofixed-rehydrated samples, our method further enables (1) APEX2 labeling of target structures (2) and high-contrast EM staining in the same cryofixed specimen. (3) Importantly, our approach allows fluorescent imaging in large, whole-mount tissues, instead of 300-500 nm cryosections. Together, these critical advances allow one to perform 3D correlated light and electron microscopy (CLEM) in cryofixed tissues, as we demonstrated in the mouse brain (Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- More extensive discussion of the limitations of the approach (see reviewers 1 and 3).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that it is important to discuss the limitations of our method.

Since our CryoChem method (CCM) employs standard dehydration and embedding steps, we believe the degree of tissue shrinkage in CCM is comparable to that with standard EM protocols.</p><p>In addition, it is theoretically possible that the rehydration step could introduce swelling in CCM-processed tissues.

In response, we added 3 new images showing the correlation of a subcellular structure, heterochromatin (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), using our 3D CLEM protocol on a CCM-processed mouse brain. We note that this heterochromatin structure was not used as a fiducial marker. We also added a sentence to the Results section describing 3D CLEM: “<italic>The high accuracy of correlation achieved by our 3D CLEM protocol is demonstrated by the successful alignments of multiple ultrastructures: the fine neuronal processes (Figure 5E) and a subcellular heterochromatin structure that was not used as a fiducial marker (Figure 5—figure supplement 1)</italic>”.</p><p>In addition, we would like to point out that the primary objective of performing 3D CLEM on CCM-processed tissues is to enhance the quality of morphological preservation of the correlated structures. Although a better morphological preservation may help with image registration, the correlation accuracy is largely dependent on the correlation algorithm and the number of fiducial markers. To clarify this point, we added the comment “<italic>so that the correlation can be achieved in optimally preserved tissues</italic>” in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How does it combine with circuit reconstruction?</p></disp-quote><p>One key advance of CCM is its compatibility with volume EM techniques, such as SBEM.
