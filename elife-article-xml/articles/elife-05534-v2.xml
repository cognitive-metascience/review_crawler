Here we show that mRNAs encoding iterated lysine codons, AAA or AAG, differentially impact protein synthesis: insertion of iterated AAA codons into an ORF diminishes protein expression more than insertion of synonymous AAG codons. Kinetic studies in <italic>E. coli</italic> reveal that differential protein production results from pausing on consecutive AAA-lysines followed by ribosome sliding on homopolymeric A sequence. Translation in a cell-free expression system demonstrates that diminished output from AAA-codon-containing reporters results from premature translation termination on out of frame stop codons following ribosome sliding. In eukaryotes, these premature termination events target the mRNAs for Nonsense-Mediated-Decay (NMD). The finding that ribosomes slide on homopolymeric A sequences explains bioinformatic analyses indicating that consecutive AAA codons are under-represented in gene-coding sequences. Ribosome ‘sliding’ represents an unexpected type of ribosome movement possible during translation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05534.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05534.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05534.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes provide the instructions to assemble proteins from smaller molecules called amino acids. When a gene is ‘switched on’, the DNA that makes up the gene is copied into messenger ribonucleic acid (or mRNA) molecules, composed of building blocks called nucleotides. There are four types of nucleotides in mRNA molecules—commonly referred to as A, C, G, and U—and a set of three nucleotides is called a codon.</p><p>A molecular machine called a ribosome moves along an mRNA molecule translating the codons into protein. Each codon instructs the ribosome to add a particular amino acid to the chain of amino acids that will make up the protein. Some codons do not specify an amino acid but instead mark the point on the mRNA that the ribosome should stop and release the new protein. Most mRNAs have nucleotides beyond the ‘stop’ codon and these often contain a long stretch of A nucleotides, one after the other, which is known as the poly(A) tail.</p><p>Some mRNA copies may contain poly(A) tails before a stop codon, which can lead to the production of alternate and potentially harmful proteins. Cells have developed ways to identify and dispose of these mRNAs and their protein products. For example, in yeast and other eukaryotes, if an mRNA is missing a stop codon, the ribosomes will continue to translate along the mRNA into the poly(A) tail where they stall and are eventually removed. When this happens, the mRNA and protein are rapidly destroyed. However, it is not clear how this works.</p><p>Koutmou et al. studied the translation of a series of artificial mRNAs that contained different numbers of A nucleotides in codons of either AAA or AAG. Both of these codons specify the same amino acid, and should therefore be translated equivalently. The experiments show that the ribosomes read the AAA and AAG codons differently. When consecutive AAA codons are found in the mRNA, the level of protein production is significantly lower than when the mRNA contains iterated AAGs instead.</p><p>Koutmou et al. found that when ribosomes encounter consecutive AAA codons they undergo an unusual ‘sliding’ movement and are unable to accurately produce proteins. When a cell detects this abnormal sliding behavior, it rapidly triggers the destruction of the mRNA molecule. In contrast, when ribosomes encounter consecutive AAG codons, they slow down but do not slide, and therefore produce a correct protein.</p><p>Koutmou et al.'s findings also provide an explanation for why there are relatively few AAA codons within the regions of genes that encode proteins. The prevalence of alternative forms of mRNAs with poly(A) sequences before their stop codons suggests that ribosome sliding may contribute to an important pathway to control the activity of genes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05534.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05534.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>sliding</kwd><kwd>poly(A)</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 GM100608</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koutmou</surname><given-names>Kristin S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Molcular Mechanisms of Translation and Their Implications for Gene Regulation</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 GM059425</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ribosomes undergo an unanticipated movement (‘sliding’) while translating homopolymeric A sequences, which provides a biochemical rationale for the observation that iterated AAA codons are under-represented in gene-coding sequences.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts can contain errors that result in the production of incorrect protein products. Both bacterial and eukaryotic cells have evolved mechanisms to deal with such errors which involve (1) proteolytic degradation of the aberrant protein product, (2) mRNA decay and (3) ribosome rescue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shoemaker and Green, 2012</xref>). One such mRNA surveillance pathway in eukaryotes targets mRNAs that lack stop codons (Non-Stop-Decay or NSD). In these cases, actively translating ribosomes are thought to read into the 3′ terminal poly(A) sequence of the mRNA triggering ribosome pausing as poly(lysine) is translated, followed by the recruitment of ubiquitin ligases, mRNA decay and ribosome recycling factors (review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klauer and van Hoof, 2012</xref>). Given the substantial amount of premature (or alternative) polyadenylation that has been documented in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ozsolak et al., 2010</xref>), it seems that such an mRNA surveillance pathway might have considerable biological significance. Similarly, in bacteria, while no ‘NSD-like’ response has been characterized, it is known that poly(A) sequences are added to mRNAs in the process of being degraded (review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dreyfus and Régnier, 2002</xref>), and so ribosomes on these mRNAs may encounter similar challenges. The utilization in bacteria and eukaryotes of 3′ poly(A) tails as non-coding elements may reflect a common solution to the challenges for the ribosome in translating such sequences.</p><p>Most studies investigating how NSD works have been conducted in yeast using reporter constructs. Early studies in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> revealed that mRNAs lacking stop-codons are targeted for decay both in a reaction dependent on the exosome-associated factor Ski7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van Hoof et al., 2002</xref>) and in a more canonical degradation reaction involving decapping and 5′ to 3′ exonucleolytic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frischmeyer et al., 2002</xref>). Other factors involved in NSD have since been discovered; these include Dom34 and Hbs1 which facilitate ribosome rescue during NSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Izawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsuboi et al., 2012</xref>), Ltn1 and Not4 which ubiquitinate the protein products on non-stop mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dimitrova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>), and a number of other factors genetically identified as critical for poly(basic)-mediated stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuroha et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiabudini et al., 2014</xref>). Although many players in NSD have been identified and their functions defined, there remain critical gaps in our understanding.</p><p>In this manuscript, we focus on what must be the earliest events in NSD, the translation of poly(lysine) sequences by the ribosome. NSD is widely thought to be triggered by unfavorable electrostatic interactions that occur in the ribosomal exit tunnel when ribosomes translate the poly(lysine) sequences encoded by poly(A). Indeed, biochemical studies in rabbit reticulocyte lysate with proteins interrupted by iterated poly(lysine) and poly(arginine) sequences indicate that positively charged residues do slow translation and produce transiently arrested species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu and Deutsch, 2008</xref>). Other examples of peptide-mediated stalling have also been documented in bacterial and eukaryotic systems. In some cases, such as the <italic>tnaC</italic> gene, <italic>secM</italic>, or <italic>ermCL</italic> in bacteria, the peptide stalling motif is several amino acids in length and appears to specifically engage the contours of the exit tunnel to elicit stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gong and Yanofsky, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nakatogawa and Ito, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vazquez-Laslop et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seidelt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhushan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ito and Chiba, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arenz et al., 2014</xref>). Poly(proline) sequences have recently been shown to cause stalling during translation in bacteria and eukaryotes in the absence of specialized bypass factors, EFP and eIF5A, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doerfel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gutierrez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ude et al., 2013</xref>). In this case, proline is thought to adopt a conformation that interferes with the ribosome active site geometry.</p><p>Here we take a high-resolution biochemical look at the molecular events that occur when the ribosome translates poly(lysine) peptides. We find that insertion of consecutive AAA lysine codons into reporters has a stronger negative impact on protein expression than insertion of an equivalent number of AAG lysine codons in both eukaryotes and bacteria. Kinetic and toeprinting studies in an in vitro reconstituted <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> translation system reveal that differential protein output is the downstream consequence of ribosome pausing followed by an unanticipated ribosome movement on successive AAA codons that we refer to as ‘sliding’. When sliding occurs in the middle of genuine ORFs in a cell, frame is lost and ribosomes encounter out of frame stop codons that result in canonical (stop-codon mediated) termination. In eukaryotes, such premature termination events target the mRNA for non-sense mediated decay (NMD). The finding that the ribosome can robustly slide on poly(A) sequences explains bioinformatic analyses revealing that consecutive AAA codons are under-represented in ORFs in all genomes (unpublished data) and helps to rationalize the widespread usage of poly(A) sequence as a regulatory rather than a coding feature.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Protein production is differentially diminished by iterated lysine codons (AAA vs AAG)</title><p>To begin investigating the translation of poly(lysine)-encoding sequences, we created a series of mCherry- and luciferase-based reporter constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) containing no insert, glutamic acid (GAA) repeats, or consecutive lysine residues encoded by various combinations of AAA and AAG codons. These reporters were introduced into <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> cells and the protein products visualized by either luminescence or fluorescence, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The insertion of twelve consecutive negatively charged glutamic acid residues (GAA) had no negative impact on production of the reporter protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). By contrast, the addition of consecutive lysine residues generally resulted in overall less protein production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), consistent with previous studies of poly(lysine)-containing reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ito-Harashima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu and Deutsch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiabudini et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, we find that protein output from the poly(lysine)-containing reporters is codon dependent in both bacteria and yeast; reporters containing iterated AAG lysine codons generate more protein than those with an equivalent number of synonymous AAA codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The relative differences in expression of AAG- vs AAA-encoded poly(lysine)-containing reporters in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> are comparable (4 ± 0.3-fold more in <italic>E. coli</italic> and 3 ± 1-fold more in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> from reporters with AAG<sub>12</sub> vs AAA<sub>12</sub>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05534.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Protein production is differentially diminished by iterated lysine codons (AAA vs AAG) in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics of the mCherry (top) and luciferase (middle, and bottom) reporters used in this study.

In <italic>E. coli</italic> a single tRNA with a UUU anti-codon decodes both lysine codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan and Lowe, 2009</xref>), making <italic>E. coli</italic> an excellent system for studying differences in the production of poly(lysine) peptides. We measured the rate of lysine incorporation using a previously described reconstituted <italic>E. coli</italic> translation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Youngman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gromadski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zaher and Green, 2009</xref>) on a series of lysine-encoding simple mRNAs including: AUG-AAA-UUC-AAG-UAA (MKFK-Stop), AUG-UUC-AAA (MFK), AUG-(AAA or AAG)<sub>5</sub>-UAA (MK<sub>(A or G)5</sub>-Stop). Only Lys-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> was included during the translation of MKFK-Stop and MK<sub>5</sub>-Stop mRNAs while both Lys-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> and Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> were present when MFK was translated. Electrophoretic TLC (eTLC) readily resolved the reaction products allowing for analysis of intermediate and complete peptide products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The quantitated data were modeled in Mathematica using the kinetic scheme displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> (see ‘Material and methods’). These experiments reveal that addition of a single lysine in a heteropolymeric sequence is rapid and independent of whether lysine is the first or second amino acid incorporated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, rate constants for formation of MK and MFK peptides are 12 s<sup>−1</sup> and 7 s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively); these rates are similar to those typically measured for peptide bond formation in this in vitro system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gromadski et al., 2006</xref>). For messages containing iterated lysine codons, the rate constant for translating the first lysine codon is similarly fast (<italic>k</italic><sub>1,obs</sub> from 2–19 s<sup>−1</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) for AAA and AAG codons. However, subsequent lysines in an iterated sequence are added with considerably slower kinetics on both AAA (<italic>k</italic><sub>2,obs</sub> = 0.0005 and <italic>k</italic><sub>3,obs</sub> = 0.0003 s<sup>−1</sup>) and AAG codons (<italic>k</italic><sub>2,obs</sub> = 0.009 and <italic>k</italic><sub>3,obs</sub> = 0.015 s<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We note that the rate of second lysine addition during the translation of MK<sub>5</sub>-STOP messages are somewhat slower on AAA relative to AAG codons, potentially partially explaining the decreased overall protein output on these mRNAs. More importantly, however, these data show that the reactivity of the second Lys-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> on iterated lysine containing messages (such as MK<sub>5</sub>-Stop) is substantially reduced (at least 130-fold) on both lysine codon-containing mRNAs relative to normal elongation rates. Interestingly, the addition of a second lysine to messages with fewer sequential lysine codons (such as MK<sub>2</sub>F-STOP) does not exhibit such a striking kinetic defect (<italic>k</italic><sub>2,obs</sub> is not largely affected, data not shown). These data suggest that the identity of the message (i.e. a long poly(A) sequence) plays a critical role in the observed slowing of elongation. Toeprinting assays performed using the <italic>E. coli</italic> PURE cell-free translation system are consistent with these observations; <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosomes stall when the second lysine codon in iterated (AAA)- and (AAG)-codon containing sequences is positioned in the A site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, these results reveal that translating consecutive lysines in a poly(lysine) peptide sequence, either on iterated AAA or AAG codons, can lead to substantial kinetic delays in vitro.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05534.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Kinetic defect observed on addition of second and third lysine residues in iterated lysine stretch.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example eTLC displaying the <italic>E. coli</italic> translation products of a AUG-(AAA)<sub>5</sub>-UAA message.

(<bold>B</bold>) The top panel displays the differential equations used to solve for each rate constant. The bottom panels display the mathematical solutions for the differential equations. These solutions were used to perform modeling and fit the data. The fits were performed both iteratively (e.g., we solved for <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> by fitting the plots measuring the disappearance of M, then input that value into the equation describing the appearance of MK to solve for <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub>) and by letting all of the values float for each data set.

We speculate that these extended peptides result from the ribosome repeatedly moving backwards by at least three nucleotides to position an AAA Lys codon in the A site, and then subsequent standard peptide bond formation. Toeprinting assays performed on iterated AAA- and AAG-containing mRNAs provide further support for such irregular movement of ribosomes specifically on iterated AAA codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>); the toeprint on the iterated AAA sequence is diffuse relative to the discrete toeprint seen on iterated AAG sequence.

Unlike better studied −1 and +1 frameshifting events, these data suggest that ribosomes on iterated AAA sequences are making unexpected and large excursions from their initial frame; we refer to this process as ‘ribosome sliding’.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ribosome sliding is slow relative to the rate of normal elongation and termination reactions</title><p>The observation of ribosome sliding on iterated AAA codons is surprising given that the ribosome must somewhat regularly translate mRNA sequences in vivo that contain two consecutive AAA codons. While three or more AAA codons in a row are selected against in gene coding sequences, there are thousands of examples of two consecutive AAA codons in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> genes (see further details in bioinformatic analysis below, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In the experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, ribosome initiation complexes formed on the specified MK<sub>A2</sub>-Stop and MK<sub>A2</sub>F-Stop messages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) were only supplied with Lys-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> and essential elongation factors; the subsequent substrates normally present in vivo after the formation of MKK peptide were left out. To determine if ribosome sliding occurs in more typical circumstances, we performed elongation reactions on the same mRNAs, but where both Lys-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> and the relevant other downstream substrates (release factor 1 (RF1) or Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>) were added to the ribosome initiation complexes. The result is clear; in this latter case, the anticipated MKKF or MKK peptide products are predominantly generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data suggest that ribosome sliding on iterated AAA sequences occurs more slowly than the normal rate of peptidyl transfer with Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> or RF1-catalyzed peptide release, respectively. Moreover, these results readily explain how the ribosome can normally translate (at least two) sequential AAA codons in vivo without sliding. When there are more than two AAA codons in a row, each lysine after the first is added slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), raising the possibility that sliding may become

Indeed, a recent study with an (AAGAAGAAA)<sub>4</sub>-containing reporter argued that a truncated product generated by such a construct resulted from an unusual release factor-dependent termination event on a sense (lysine) codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiabudini et al., 2014</xref>). In an attempt to recapitulate these results, we directly looked for evidence of eRF1:eRF3-mediated termination activity on iterated lysine mRNAs in vitro using a yeast reconstituted translation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shoemaker et al., 2010</xref>); we see no evidence that such an event can occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We propose that an alternative explanation for the published data could be that the ribosome slides out of frame on the (AAGAAGAAA)<sub>4</sub> sequence, resulting in premature termination on a previously out-of-frame stop codon, akin to what we observe in the PURE <italic>E. coli</italic> cell-free translation system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This possibility seemed particularly likely given that we observed sliding activity on a AUG-AAA-AAG-UUC-STOP sequence in our in vitro reconstituted <italic>E. coli</italic> system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In wild type and <italic>upf1</italic>Δ cells, we find that the level of the (AAG)<sub>12</sub> containing reporter mRNA is unchanged relative to the mCherry reporter with no insert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, the levels of (AAGAAGAAA)<sub>4</sub> and (AAA)<sub>12</sub> reporter mRNAs are significantly reduced compared to the control (no insert) reporter (15-fold and 30-fold, respectively). These observations are consistent with the low levels of protein expressed in vivo from these reporters relative to sequences containing no insert or (AAG)<sub>12</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As with the luciferase reporters, the level of mCherry mRNA containing an (AAA)<sub>12</sub> insert is partially recovered by the deletion of <italic>UPF1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

In both organisms, AAA codons are found more commonly than AAG codons (62% AAA vs 38% AAG in yeast, and 72% AAA vs 28% AAG in bacteria); however, consecutive AAA codons are under-represented relative to their overall codon usage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Here, we provide mechanistic insight into what initially happens when the ribosome encounters poly(A) sequence. First, we find that the expression of proteins containing poly(lysine) stretches is codon-dependent in both bacteria and eukaryotes, with reporters containing iterated AAA codons consistently producing less protein than those with equivalent AAG codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig4">Figures 1, 4</xref>). This differential protein output is not the result of imprecise RNA polymerase action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) nor likely of disparities in the rate of adding lysine codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>); lysines are slowly incorporated on iterated AAA and AAG codons. Instead, the codon-dependent disparity primarily stems from an unusual sliding event that occurs when ribosomes encounter consecutive AAA codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3, 4</xref>). Our observation that ribosomes can slide in multiple frames on iterated AAA sequences provides a rationale for consecutive AAA codons being substantially under-represented in open reading frames in most genomes (see Bioinformatic discussion below, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and (unpublished data).</p><p>Our biochemical data in <italic>E. coli</italic> lead us to propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) for what happens to the ribosome during the translation of homopolymeric A sequences. On these messages, the first lysine is added quickly (<italic>k</italic><sub>1,obs</sub>) while subsequent lysines are added more slowly, causing the ribosome to pause. We note that the rate constants measured in the in vitro assay reflect all of the processes that can occur each time a new lysine moiety is added to the growing polypeptide chain (Lys-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> binding, peptidyl-transfer, translocation, peptidyl-tRNA drop-off, 70S complex instability, etc). We suspect it to be unlikely that ribosome pausing is caused solely by dramatically large defects in peptidyl-transfer, but instead may result from ribosomes that become effectively inactivated (e.g. as a result of complex instability on homopolymeric A messages, etc). Whatever the cause for an initial ribosome pausing event on iterated AAA sequences, the ribosome can either slide or perform another round of peptide bond formation. If the ribosome slides such that another AAA codon is positioned in the A site, the next step will also be slow, while if sliding somehow positions a non-lysine codon in the A site, recovery from slow elongation may occur. In our in vitro system translating di-lysine messages, we are able to observe sliding when consecutive AAA-codons are present because we force a strong pause after MKK formation by leaving out downstream factors required for translation to proceed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Our data suggest that ribosome sliding on iterated AAA sequences is the major difference between the translation of poly(AAA)- and poly(AAG)-containing messages that results in substantially different protein outputs. While each sequential addition of lysine in an iterated AAG sequence may be slow, the ribosome maintains frame and ultimately is able to produce full-length protein. By contrast, with repeated AAA sequences, the ribosome can eventually escape the homopolymeric A sequence through repeated sliding events, often emerging out-of-frame from the A stretch, and thus unable to produce full-length protein.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05534.020</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for events during ribosome sliding.</title><p>In this model translation is paused following the addition of the first lysine.

The secondary structure impairs the normal movement of the ribosome during translocation, and promotes the frame-shift event in an EF-G dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caliskan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). +1 PRFs signals are more diverse than −1 PRFs, but still generally depend on a slippery sequence and a downstream element (e.g., secondary structure or rare codon) that causes the ribosome to pause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dinman, 2012</xref>). Iterated A stretches are inherently slippery and contain a built-in translation pause (adding consecutive lysines is slow—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), however the poly(A) sequences that we have studied lack significant secondary structure downstream that might contribute to limiting unregulated ribosome sliding. As such, when ribosomes slide on iterated AAA codons, forward and backward movements may be permitted. The scale of the movements undergone during a ribosome sliding event may be more similar to those documented in translational bypassing on the gene product 60 of bacteriophage T4 which is synthesized from a discontinuous reading frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Samatova et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, however, in contrast to this specific concerted large-scale movement (50 nucleotides) which results in the production of a single peptide product, ribosome sliding is different in that no single outcome appears to be encoded by the event. The inability of the ribosome to translate a discrete product on homopolymeric A sequences likely explains the bioinformatic analyses demonstrating that poly(A) sequences are strongly selected against in coding sequences containing iterated lysines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Consistent with this idea, in <italic>E. coli</italic> we find that the minimum length (11) of a homopolymeric A sequence needed to trigger ribosome sliding in the PURE cell-free translation system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) correlates with the length of lysine stretch at which homopolymeric sequences are selected against in mRNA coding regions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>There are multiple reports in the literature indicating that frame-shifted ribosomes can trigger NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belew et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2014</xref>). We find that mRNA levels for reporters containing (AAA)<sub>12</sub> or (AAGAAGAAA)<sub>4</sub>, but not (AAG)<sub>12</sub> sequences, are reduced in a Upf1-dependent manner. These data are consistent with the idea that sliding on homopolymeric A stretches can eventually lead to ribosomes reaching out-of-frame premature termination codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). A recent report in the literature argued that translation of poly(lysine) stretches led to an unusual termination event on a sense codon (AAA or AAG) mediated by eRF3 (presumably in concert with its binding partner eRF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiabudini et al., 2014</xref>). These observations bring to mind premature termination events on sense codons documented in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zaher and Green, 2009</xref>); this quality control system was proposed to increase the fidelity of translation by minimizing frame-shifting and eliminating errors made during tRNA selection. We note that the premature termination event that we previously documented in <italic>E. coli</italic> was highly dependent on RF3, while the termination event documented in <italic>E. coli</italic> in this manuscript at homopolymeric A sequences is RF3-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given the clear evidence that we provide for ribosome sliding in the <italic>E. coli</italic> system and the inability to observe eRF1:eRF3-mediated peptide release on homopolymeric A programmed yeast ribosome complexes in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), we suggest that the most likely explanation for the eRF3-dependent truncated product generated in yeast cells on (AAGAAGAAA)<sub>4</sub>–encoding reporters in Chiabudini et al. is the result of ribosome sliding and canonical recognition of downstream premature stop codons. We note that there are multiple out-of-frame stop codons following the (AAGAAGAAA)<sub>4</sub>-repeat that could account for the observed products in Chiabudini et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiabudini et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We were intrigued by the observation that the (AAGAAGAAA)<sub>4</sub> reporter mRNA levels are more efficiently recovered than those of the (AAA)<sub>12</sub> reporter mRNA in a <italic>UPF1</italic>-deletion strain. We speculate that the more modest sliding within the (AAGAAGAAA)-repeats might be distinguished from the sliding on (AAA)-repeats in an important way. Sliding within homopolymeric AAA sequence most typically results in another nearby AAA codon being poised in the A site, and another inefficient elongation event with Lys-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>. Ribosomes that eventually exit the poly(A) sequence to reach heteropolymeric sequence and an out-of-frame downstream premature stop codon will trigger NMD; ribosomes that struggle to get past the very long stretch of iterated lysine codons will instead trigger NSD. As such, the mRNA levels for the (AAA)<sub>12</sub> reporter are partially recovered by a <italic>UPF1</italic> deletion and partially recovered by a <italic>DOM34</italic> deletion (data not shown). By contrast, on the (AAGAAGAAA)-repeat reporters, sliding has the potential to quickly place the ribosomes in a more productive frame for efficient elongation (one frame will result in Arg-Arg-Lys (RRK) repeats while the other frame will result in Glu-Glu-Lys (EEK) repeats). While we might predict that the poly(basic) RRKRRKRRKRR peptide will also be slowly translated, a ribosome that slides into the frame encoding the EEKEEKEEKEE peptide should be able to resume efficient elongation. As such, fewer ribosomes may trigger NSD and, instead, a majority of ribosomes will reach downstream premature stop codons that trigger NMD. These ideas can easily be understood in the context of the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> where differences in the elongation rates (e.g. slow for iterated lysine residues but fast for incorporation of other amino acids) will impact the relative contribution of ribosome sliding to overall outcome.</p><p>NSD was originally identified by following the degradation of transcripts lacking termination codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frischmeyer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van Hoof et al., 2002</xref>). These studies led to the idea that NSD is triggered when the ribosome stalls while translating a poly(basic) lysine sequence. NSD is commonly studied using reporters in yeast that contain poly(basic) inserts; common lysine and arginine inserts that have been investigated include (AAA)<sub>12</sub>, (AAG)<sub>12</sub>, (AAG-AAG-AAA)<sub>4</sub>, and (CGG-(CGA)<sub>2</sub>-CGG-(CGC)<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ito-Harashima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dimitrova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiabudini et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2014</xref>).

Despite these differences, because the mRNA and protein levels for all of these are broadly sensitive to known NSD factors (Ltn1, Dom34, Ski7), poly(basic) sequences have been treated equally. Our results demonstrating that ribosomes can slide on consecutive AAA codons suggest that there may be important distinctions to be made in considering these reporters and that there may be substantial mechanistic overlaps in these systems.</p><p>Even though cells rarely maintain homopolymeric A sequences in ORFs, there are some situations where the ribosome likely must deal with homopolymeric A stretches in both bacteria and eukaryotes. In bacteria, mRNAs are typically polyadenylated as part of the normal decay process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dreyfus and Régnier, 2002</xref>). For example, ribosome sliding might provide an escape for ribosomes already engaged on these mRNAs (a form of ribosome rescue). In eukaryotes, virtually all mRNAs in the cell are polyadenylated, but usually a stop codon is found at the end of the encoded ORF. However, there is abundant recent evidence indicating that a significant portion of yeast (14%) and human (9%) genes contain at least one alternative polyadenylation site within their coding sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ozsolak et al., 2010</xref>). It has even been suggested that premature polyadenylation may become up-regulated in cancerous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berg et al., 2012</xref>). In cases where premature polyadenylation takes place within the ORF, the ribosome will surely encounter a homopolymeric A sequence, likely triggering so called Non-Stop-Decay (NSD). In light of the results presented here, we would suggest that the triggering of NSD (and associated mRNA decay, proteolysis and ribosome recycling) occurs following the slow translation of iterated lysines and ribosome sliding events. The ubiquity of premature polyadenylation suggests that NSD broadly serves as an important pathway for regulating gene expression. The observation of synonymous AAG to AAA changes in iterated lysine stretches in genes upregulated in cancer provides support for the significance of this mechanism of gene regulation (unpublished data). The widespread use of polyadenylation for non-coding purposes in mRNA transcripts may find its origins in the inability of the decoding machine, the ribosome, to carefully control the behavior of these sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reporter creation</title><p>The Thrdx-HA-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) no insert reporter expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and the PURExpress cell-free translation system was created using Gateway cloning to include the 2HA-mCherry sequence in the pBAD-DEST49 vector.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>All the individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Nahum Sonenberg (Reviewing editor and peer reviewer), Daniel Wilson (peer reviewer), and Jonathan Dinman (peer reviewer).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The three reviewers concur that the manuscript presents convincing data for a novel mechanism of ribosome movement (sliding) on iterated AAA codons. The paper constitutes a strong combination of in vitro work using an <italic>E. coli</italic> system, coupled with the use of in vivo reporters both in <italic>E. coli</italic> and yeast. The experiments are well conducted and interpreted and support the conclusions. The kinetics analysis portion of this work is particularly notable.</p><p>There is only one major concern that was raised:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: typically, the conclusion that an mRNA is a substrate for NMD requires a transcriptional arrest time course experiment. Simply monitoring mRNA steady state abundance +/- Upf1 is not sufficient. This experiment would need to be performed.</p><p>Another point relates to the toe-print assay that is in the supplementary material. You demonstrated convincingly that consecutive AAA codons cause ribosome slippage using a number of different reporter systems in the main figures. However, they are all indirect. The only direct reporter that is employed by is the toe-print assay that is in the supplementary. This assay should be in the main text. It could be presented in a more appropriate manner showing the nucleotide sequence (together with the amino acid sequence) so that the reader can understand why the data supports ribosome slippage, and exactly which frame the ribosomes are in with the different constructs. You should perhaps indicate this using an accompanying schematic. You might also consider using an mRNA with a unique codon downstream of the polylysine sequence in different frames so that you can monitor read-through and change of frame by omitting the unique amino acid from the translation reaction to stall ribosomes on this codon if they make it through the polylysine stretch.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic></p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>): is the difference between the negative impact of AAA12 and AAG12 on luciferase output significant?

We believe that the toeprint data should remain as a supplement (Figure 1–figure supplement 1) to the main text because the toe-prints do not directly demonstrate sliding, and are intended to function simply in support of the data already in the main text. The addition of the toe-printing data would not add information beyond that already demonstrated. For example, the toe-prints indicate that ribosomes pause while adding sequential lysines, but our kinetic data more directly address this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, while the toe-prints suggest that the ribosomes get out of frame on poly(A) messages, our PURE reactions in the presence and absence of release factors demonstrate quite clearly that ribosomes can get out of frame on homopolymeric A messages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4C and 5</xref>).</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p><italic>1)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref> <italic>(</italic>S. cerevisiae<italic>): is the difference between the negative impact of AAA12 and AAG12 on luciferase output significant?
