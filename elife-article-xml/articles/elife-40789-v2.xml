Such variation may impact the evolvability of proteins, but the underlying molecular basis remains unclear. Here, we performed comparative directed evolution of four orthologous metallo-β-lactamases toward a new function and found that different starting genotypes evolved to distinct evolutionary outcomes. Despite a low initial fitness, one ortholog reached a significantly higher fitness plateau than its counterparts, via increasing catalytic activity. By contrast, the ortholog with the highest initial activity evolved to a less-optimal and phenotypically distinct outcome through changes in expression, oligomerization and activity. We show how cryptic molecular properties and conformational variation of active site residues in the initial genotypes cause epistasis, that could lead to distinct evolutionary outcomes. Our work highlights the importance of understanding the molecular details that connect genetic variation to protein function to improve the prediction of protein evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein evolution</kwd><kwd>evolvability</kwd><kwd>molecular mechanisms of evolution</kwd><kwd>enzyme</kwd><kwd>enzyme promiscuity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN 418262-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tokuriki</surname><given-names>Nobuhiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>353714</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tokuriki</surname><given-names>Nobuhiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN 2017-04909</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tokuriki</surname><given-names>Nobuhiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic change among enzyme orthologous with similar phenotypic properties can cause substantial differences in evolutionary response to a new enzyme function in terms of their molecular and fitness outcomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genetic diversity across orthologous proteins is thought to be predominantly neutral with respect to their native, physiological function, but can cause variation in other non-physiological phenotypic properties, a phenomenon known as ‘cryptic genetic variation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Le Rouzic and Carlborg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gibson and Dworkin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paaby and Rockman, 2014</xref>). Cryptic genetic variation has been shown to play an important role in evolution because genetically diverse populations are more likely to contain genotypes with a ‘pre-adapted’ phenotype, for example, a latent promiscuous function, that may confer an immediate selective advantage when the environment changes and a new selection pressure emerges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Queitsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Specchia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Visser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amitai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bloom et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rohner et al., 2013</xref>). Beyond that specific scenario, however, we have little understanding of how genetic variation affects the long-term adaptive evolutionary potential (or ‘evolvability’) of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wagner, 2008</xref>). Many biological traits, in particular promiscuous protein functions, evolve by accumulating multiple adaptive mutations before reaching a fitness plateau or peak. Thus, the degree to which a trait can improve and the level of fitness that it can reach ultimately determines the evolutionary potential and outcome of a given genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Romero and Arnold, 2009</xref>). Recent studies have shown that intramolecular epistasis is prevalent and that the phenotypic effect of the same mutation can be drastically altered when introduced into a genotype that differs by only a few other mutations, which may lead to different evolutionary outcomes depending on the starting genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Blount et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Visser and Krug, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Parera and Martinez, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Starr and Thornton, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miton and Tokuriki, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harms and Thornton, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Starr et al., 2017</xref>). It has also been shown that orthologous enzymes can exhibit a broad range of phenotypic responses to the same selection pressure to improve their promiscuous activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Khanal et al., 2015</xref>). These studies, however, have only focused on the effect of small mutational steps; the degree to which genetic starting points determines long-term evolutionary outcomes under identical selection remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">O'Loughlin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burch and Chao, 2000</xref>). More importantly, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the relationship between genetic variation and evolvability is highly limited. It has been suggested that protein fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tóth-Petróczy and Tawfik, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yip and Matsumura, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schulenburg et al., 2015</xref>) and protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weinreich and Chao, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bloom and Arnold, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009</xref>) can shape evolvability, but these alone cannot explain the prevalence of epistasis and the enormous variation we observe in the evolvability of different genotypes. An in-depth understanding of the molecular constraints exerted by cryptic genetic variation is crucial to further develop our ability to decipher, predict and design the evolution of proteins.</p><p>Metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) encompass a genetically diverse enzyme family that confer β-lactam antibiotic resistance to bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bebrone, 2007</xref>). Our previous work demonstrated that most MBLs exhibit phosphonate monoester hydrolase (PMH) activity (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>) in the range of 0.1 to 10 M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baier and Tokuriki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baier et al., 2015</xref>). β-lactam and phosphonate monoester hydrolyses differ in the cleaved bond (C-N <italic>vs</italic>. P-O) and the geometry of the transition state (tetrahedral <italic>vs</italic>. trigonal bipyramidal), making the PMH activity a catalytically distinct promiscuous activity for these enzymes. Thus, the evolution of MBLs toward PMH activity can be considered a model for neo-functionalization or the evolutionary emergence of a new enzyme function. Here, we carried out an empirical test of enzyme evolvability by performing directed evolution with four orthologous MBLs (NDM1, VIM2, VIM7, and EBL1) toward PMH activity. Employing diverse genetic, biochemical and biophysical analyses, we investigated the genetic and phenotypic response of MBLs to a new selection pressure during laboratory evolution. Consequently, we describe the molecular basis underlying these functional transitions: epistasis upon the fixation of a key initial adaptive mutation appears to differentiate the evolutionary trajectories. Last, we discuss the potential role of genetic variation in the evolution of new enzyme functions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40789.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparative directed evolution of metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Catalytic efficiencies (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>) of six metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) for β-lactamase and PMH activities.

VIM2 and NDM1 were chosen due to the availability of their biochemical and structural information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garcia-Saez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">King et al., 2012</xref>). VIM7 and EBL1 are close homologous enzymes to VIM2 (80% amino acid sequence identity) and NDM1 (55% amino acid sequence identity), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although the catalytic efficiencies for the native β-lactams hydrolysis are similar across these enzymes (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> only varies up to twofold across all six MBLS), their <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> for the promiscuous PMH activity varies by ~20 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). From these starting points, the same directed evolution scheme was applied to improve their ability to hydrolyze PMH in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Briefly, randomly mutagenized gene pools were transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic>, and purifying selection was used to enrich for functional variants while purging out non-functional variants by plating the libraries onto agar plates containing a low ampicillin concentration (4 μg/ml). Colonies were inoculated into liquid media (96-well plates, total of 396 variants per round), regrown, lysed and screened for PMH activity. The most improved variant(s) were isolated, sequenced and used as templates for the next round of evolution. Note that the ‘PMH fitness’ (i.e. the selection criteria) in our directed evolution scheme is defined as the level of PMH activity in <italic>E. coli</italic> cell lysate; as a result, PMH fitness is a function of catalytic activity and soluble expression levels in the cell. For example, the PMH fitness differences between NDM1 and VIM2 wild-type originate from their kinetic parameters, while their solubility is comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). By contrast, EBL1 and VIM2 wild-type have similar catalytic efficiencies but their PMH fitness differ by 35-fold due to large differences in protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Over the first two rounds of directed evolution (R2), we observed significant differences in the extent of fitness improvement among the four parallel trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, improvements in PMH fitness did not correlate with the initial fitness level. For example, although VIM2 is the variant with the highest initial activity, it only exhibited a 4-fold improvement in PMH fitness over the wild-type, and was surpassed by other, initially less fit variants such as NDM1 and EBL1, with a 210- and 310-fold improvement in PMH fitness, respectively. Overall, the close pairs of homologues EBL1/NDM1 and VIM2/VIM7, seem to follow similar trends in PMH fitness improvement. Consequently, we continued the directed evolution of VIM2 and NDM1 only, for eight additional rounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Overall, both trajectories exhibited diminishing returns in their evolution toward a new activity, that is each trajectory eventually reached a plateau where no substantial fitness increase was obtained in the last rounds of directed evolution. Note that in the last two rounds (R9 and R10), purifying selection was replaced by a pre-screening for increased PMH fitness (PMH activity level in the cell) on agar plates (&gt;5000 variants), yet no variant with increased PMH fitness was isolated, suggesting that fitness plateaued in both trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Besides the similar overall trend along the trajectories, there are substantial differences in their evolutionary outcomes: while NDM1-WT was initially ~4 fold less-fit than VIM2-WT in PMH fitness, NDM1 fitness became ~28 fold higher than that of VIM2 by the end of the evolutionary experiment (R10). Overall, the NDM1 trajectory displays a ~ 3600 fold increase in PMH fitness (between NDM1-R10 and NDM1-WT), whereas the VIM2 trajectory only exhibits a ~ 35 fold increase in PMH fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1G</xref>), resulting in over a 100-fold difference in PMH fitness improvement between the two trajectories. Given that the two wild-type enzymes were almost identical in terms of their physicochemical properties, protein solubility, stability and structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), the variation in evolutionary potential that separates these orthologous sequences is substantial.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Genotypic solutions vary across the evolutionary trajectories</title><p>Overall, NDM1 and VIM2 accumulated 13 and 15 mutations, respectively. Interestingly, the mutations that occurred along each trajectory were entirely distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1F</xref>). Only two mutations occurred at the same position (154 and 223), and these were mutated to different amino acids. For example, the mutations in the early rounds of evolution, which conferred the largest PMH fitness improvements, were W93G, N116T, and K211R in the NDM1 trajectory, and V72A, and F67L for VIM2. In NDM1, most mutations are scattered relatively evenly around the active site; only one mutation (W93G) is located below loop 3, and several are located in and around loop 10 and other parts of the active site. By contrast, in VIM2, six mutations are tightly clustered within or next to loop 3. These results demonstrate that, for these two enzymes, distinct fitness outcomes result from distinct mutational responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A limited accessibility of adaptive mutations from each starting point</title><p>An important question arising from the observation that NDM1 and VIM2 responded differently to the same selection pressure is whether their initial genotypes, and thus cryptic genetic variation, determined their evolutionary PMH fitness outcome.

However, performing such high-throughput characterizations is not feasible given our experimental evolution scheme.

Strikingly, most positive variants isolated in the additional screening possess mutations at the same positions as previously identified: Trp93 (in R1) and Met154 (R5) were isolated for NDM1. For VIM2, Val72 (R1), Phe67 (R2), Ser202 (R4), Thr263 (R5), and Val41 (R6) were isolated again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1H</xref>). These results suggest that only a handful of adaptive mutations, which are unique to each genotype, are available, at least from the wild-type sequence.</p><p>Next, we assessed the PMH fitness effects of the NDM1 and VIM2 mutations by introducing the mutations fixed during R2-R4 directly into their corresponding wild-type genetic background. In the VIM2 trajectory, we observed no differential fitness effect when later mutations are directly introduced on the wild-type background. This is consistent with the isolation of these later mutations during the additional R1 screening experiment, suggesting that a range of adaptive mutations is readily accessible from the starting enzyme. As a consequence, these mutations can collectively improve PMH fitness, regardless of their order of appearance and without significant epistatic constraint. On the contrary in NDM1, later mutations only confer a selective advantage if introduced after the initial fixation of R1 mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results explain why only few mutations, for example W93G, were identified in the additional screening from the starting enzyme. This also suggests that W93G plays a permissive role for later mutations, and thus that the order of appearance of mutations in the NDM1 trajectory is rather constrained.</p><p>Last, to examine why distinct mutations arise in the first round of the NDM1 and VIM2 trajectories, we examined the effect of the initial mutation from each trajectory (W93G in NDM1 and V72A in VIM2) in their counterpart enzyme. We found that each trajectory’s adaptive mutations are incompatible with one another. While W93G increases PMH fitness in cell lysate by ~25 fold in NDM1-WT (104-fold with purified NDM1), it causes a 3-fold decrease in PMH fitness when introduced into VIM2-WT (10-fold with purified VIM2), explaining why VIM2 never acquired this mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). W93G exhibits beneficial effects in MBL homologs other than VIM2 and VIM1, consistent with the observation that Trp93 was not only selected in the NDM1 trajectory, but also in two other evolutionary trajectories, EBL1 and VIM7’s (W93L in EBL1 and W93G in VIM7, respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1F</xref>). Moreover, introducing other hydrophobic residues (A, V, L and F) at position 93 in VIM2 had similar negative effects, indicating that mutating Trp93 is largely deleterious in VIM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Similarly, V72A, which improved the PMH fitness of VIM2 by ~2 fold (1.7-fold with purified enzyme), was largely neutral in NDM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Distinct molecular changes underlie the two evolutionary trajectories</title><p>The conventional paradigm of protein evolution is dominated by the idea that higher protein stability, or greater soluble and functional expression, promotes protein evolvability, by buffering the destabilizing effect of function-altering mutations and allowing a greater number of adaptive mutations to accumulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bloom and Arnold, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weinreich and Chao, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009</xref>). This model, however, fails to predict the difference in evolvability between NDM1 and VIM2, because their relative stability and soluble expression are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In order to elucidate the precise molecular changes that enabled evolutionary optimization in each trajectory, we measured a range of molecular properties, including catalytic efficiency (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>), the fraction of soluble protein expression, melting temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>), and oligomeric assembly, over the course of their evolution. The molecular changes that underlie their respective PMH fitness (PMH activity in cell lysate) improvements differed substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). By R10, the catalytic efficiency of NDM1 was improved by more than 18,000-fold compared to the wild-type (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> from 0.32 to 5900 M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2B</xref>). This significant improvement in catalytic efficiency, however, was offset by a loss of soluble expression at R1, where <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> increased by ~300 fold, while the solubility decreased from 43% to 25% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). The level of soluble expression never recovered, while <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> gradually increased until reaching the plateau observed in R7. By contrast, the catalytic efficiency of VIM2 stagnated at round 6, with only a ~ 25 fold increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> overall (VIM2-R10 compared to the wild-type). The subsequent PMH fitness improvements resulted from increasing soluble expression, from 40% to 70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Changes in solubility are only weakly correlated to changes in <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that other factors such as kinetic stability or protein folding affect the level of soluble protein expression more than thermostability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bershtein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wyganowski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pey et al., 2011</xref>).

NDM1 adapted exclusively by increasing catalytic efficiency while compromising its soluble expression while VIM2 evolved by increasing its expression, oligomerization and activity. Our observations also indicate that differences in protein stability or soluble expression in the initial genotypes cannot explain the differences in evolvability between the two enzymes. VIM2 variants consistently exhibit higher stability and solubility throughout the trajectory, yet the improvements in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> and PMH fitness are far lower than that of NDM1. Moreover, the distinct phenotypic solutions further highlight the qualitatively different evolutionary processes that led to distinct PMH fitness plateaus in each trajectory. Interestingly, the genetic differences in the evolutionary end points can create additional cryptic variation that becomes apparent when the environment is changed: when the enzymes are expressed at 37°C (rather that 30°C at which they evolved for higher PMH fitness) NDM1 variants are significantly less fit because of their lower soluble expression, whereas VIM2 variants maintain similar PMH fitness levels even at higher temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Distinct structural adaptation between the evolutionary trajectories</title><p>Having established that protein stability does not constrain the evolvability of the enzymes, we sought a molecular explanation by solving the crystal structures of the R10 variants of the NDM1 and VIM2 trajectories, allowing us to compare them with the previously published wild-type structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">King et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garcia-Saez et al., 2008</xref>). For NDM1-R10, we obtained crystal structures of the apo-enzyme and in complex with the phenylphosphonate product bound in the active site after <italic>in crystallo</italic> hydrolysis. Additionally, we conducted molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in complex with the PMH substrate (<italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonate, PPP). We identified three main structural adaptations from NDM1-WT that may underlie the ~18,000 fold improvement in catalytic efficiency for PMH activity. First, W93G removes steric hindrance between the side chain of Trp93 and the substrate, and generates a complementary pocket for the phenyl group below loop 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, there is an inward displacement of loop 3 (Trp93 is located near the base of this loop) by ~6 Å, which allows for improved π-π stacking interactions between Phe70 and the <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenol-leaving group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Third, loop 10 is repositioned via reorganization of the local hydrogen bonding network (largely by K211R and G222D), allowing it to interact with the leaving group of the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). For VIM2, we were only able to crystallize the dimeric fraction of VIM2-R10. This dimer reveals an unprecedented structural rearrangement: a full half of the structure exhibits a symmetrical domain-swapping between the two subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Besides domain swapping, the major structural rearrangement occurring between VIM2-WT and VIM2-R10 involves the reorganization of loop 3 resulting in its disorder in VIM2-R10, which is most likely caused by six mutations within and next to loop 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>). Four out of these six loop 3 mutations have accumulated by R5; thus, we speculate that these mutations and the loop rearrangement were the major cause of the ~25 fold increase in catalytic efficiency for PMH in VIM2-R10, compared to the wildtype. Taken together, the results further emphasize that the two starting enzymes responded to the same selection pressure by substantially different molecular solutions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40789.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The structural basis for improved PMH activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structural overlay of NDM1-WT (grey, PDB ID: 3SPU) and NDM1-R10 in the apo form (cyan, PDB ID: 5JQJ) and NDM1-R10 in complex with the PMH hydrolysis product, phenylphosphonate (PhPn, magenta sticks) (blue, PDB ID: 5K4M).

In NDM1, mutation W93G causes ~100 fold increase in PMH activity compared to the wild-type, but when introduced into VIM2, it reduces its PMH activity by 10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1I</xref>). We performed and compared MD simulations of NDM1-WT, VIM2-WT and models of NDM1-W93G, and VIM2-W93G in the presence of the PMH substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). NDM1-W93G showed similar structural adaptations to NDM1-R10 (described above); W93G eliminates the steric hindrance with the substrate, and allows loop 3 to shift inward to promote complementary interactions with the substrate, without the rearrangement of loop 10, which presumably occurs later in evolution. By contrast, in VIM2-WT, Trp93 adopts a different orientation to avoid steric hindrance, which instead promotes complementary interactions with the phenyl ring of the substrate. Consequently, W93G in VIM2 removes beneficial substrate-enzyme interactions, thus causing a deleterious effect on catalytic efficiency. Similarly, unlike in NDM1, loop 3 in VIM2-W93G does not form complementary interactions with the substrate, which is consistent with the observation that loop 3 is extensively mutated and reorganized by other mutations later in the VIM2 trajectory. By examining these crystal structures, we found that the ‘second-shell’ residues of Trp93 cause its indole side chain to adopt a different orientation. In NDM1, Leu65, Gln123 and Asp124 constrain Trp93 to point toward the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In VIM2, however, the second shell residues (Gln65, Asp123, and Asp124) differ, resulting in Trp93 being stabilized in an alternative conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

For example, in VIM7, which is 80% identical to VIM2, W93G caused a ~ 3 fold increase in PMH activity, despite the same mutation causing an antagonistic 10-fold decrease in PMH activity in VIM2. Taken together, cryptic and subtle differences in sequence and structure in both orthologs may influence the conformation of Trp93, a key active site residue, and cause the observed 1000-fold difference in the phenotypic effect of mutation W93G (100-fold increase in NDM1 <italic>vs.</italic> 10-fold decrease in VIM2). Thus, as previously discussed, the accessibility of adaptive mutations from each starting point, at least within one mutational step, seems to depend on the starting genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The existence of a great diversity of protein functions, together with many contemporary examples of proteins that have promptly adapted to changing environments, suggest a remarkable degree of evolvability for biological molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wagner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aharoni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baier et al., 2016</xref>). These successful examples of adaptation, however, may also obscure a wealth of cases where proteins have failed to adapt or were limited in their ability to evolve a new function. Our observations highlight that not all enzymes evolve to their fitness maximum, and that seemingly innocuous genetic variation may result in significant consequences for a protein’s ability to evolve a new function. Metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) confer β-lactam antibiotic resistance to bacteria by cleaving β-lactam rings (C-N bond). The PMH activity (breaking P-O bond) in MBLs is not likely to have ever been selected for; it can thus be considered as a truly non-physiological and serendipitous promiscuous function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Babtie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Copley, 2015</xref>). Thus, the promiscuous PMH activity of MBLs can be considered a cryptic and hidden ‘pre-adapted’ property. Genetic variation can alter the level of promiscuous activities in enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Visser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bloom et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amitai et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, in MBLs, the catalytic efficiencies for PMH hydrolysis differ by ~20 fold among orthologous enzymes, while the catalytic efficiencies for β-lactams hydrolysis only vary by twofold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Such phenotypic variation can cause differences in evolvability when an ‘immediate’ response to changing environments is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Visser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bloom et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amitai et al., 2007</xref>). Our work extends this view of the role of genetic diversity to encompass the evolutionary responses of individual genes to new selection pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Khanal et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, the initial fitness and/or the catalytic efficiencies of enzymes do not necessarily provide a good indicator of their evolutionary outcome, and thus of their evolvability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Khanal et al., 2015</xref>). Genetic variation can significantly alter the accessibility of adaptive mutations, and starting points with lower fitness may reach much higher evolutionary plateaus than starting points endowed with higher initial fitness. Thus, adaptive evolutionary potential can be truly ‘cryptic’ and only apparent after evolution happens, further complicating the prediction of the most successful initial genotypes.</p><p>Our observations, when combined with those of others, indicate that the evolvability of proteins is generally and profoundly rooted in the starting genetic variation that is available. On one hand, examples from nature and the laboratory have shown that independent evolutionary trials from a single genotype often follow very similar genetic and thus phenotypic trajectories; suggesting that only a limited amount of beneficial mutations is available from any single genotypic starting point, and in those cases evolution is largely deterministic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weinreich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Salverda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lobkovsky and Koonin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dickinson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Palmer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaltenbach et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, the prevalence of epistasis causes distinct effects when some adaptive mutation(s) are introduced on the genetic background of otherwise phenotypically similar orthologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Khanal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Parera and Martinez, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harms and Thornton, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Starr et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that genetic variation epistatically ‘restricts’ and/or ‘permits’ the accessibility of certain adaptive mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harms and Thornton, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kaltenbach and Tokuriki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Starr and Thornton, 2016</xref>). The successful evolution of new protein functions may therefore rely on genetic drift to explore the sequence space, thereby creating a diverse genotypic pool presenting multiple, differentially evolvable, genotypes from which an evolutionary trajectory may arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harms and Thornton, 2014</xref>). The genetic diversity that these neutral drifts generate thereby provides a foundation for the response of a population to new selection pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wagner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harms and Thornton, 2013</xref>). One complicating aspect of this model is the impact of temporal and spatial selection on the emergence of diverse genotypes. It is possible that this model explains a commonly observed phenomenon in bacterial adaptation, for example, drug-resistance and xenobiotic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Copley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Singh, 2009</xref>), in which typically only a small number of genotypes endowed with new functions will emerge within a larger population, after which these successfully adapted genes quickly disseminate to other bacteria via horizontal gene transfer.</p><p>Our observations shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic variation and evolution of new enzymatic function. The established and conventional paradigm of protein evolution suggests that protein stability, or soluble and functional expression of proteins, is the dominant factor in determining evolvability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bloom and Arnold, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weinreich and Chao, 2005</xref>). Other studies indicate that protein structural folds cause differences in evolvability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yip and Matsumura, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schulenburg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dellus-Gur et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tóth-Petróczy and Tawfik, 2014</xref>). However, in our study, neither protein stability nor protein fold can account for variation in evolutionary potential between the MBL enzymes toward PMH activity. Instead, we found that cryptic and subtle molecular differences seem to have a greater impact on granting the accessibility of key initial adaptive mutations (such as W93G): although VIM2 and NDM1 possess an almost identical overall structure, thermostability and soluble expression level, their evolution resulted in substantially different fitness outcomes and molecular solutions. Indeed, many examples demonstrated that strong epistasis in protein function can be caused by subtle conformational changes through the accumulation of mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tomatis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harms and Thornton, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dellus-Gur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Campbell et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, an in-depth understanding of the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms underlying the optimization of enzymatic functions, in particular of promiscuous activities, is essential to developing our ability to understand and predict the evolution of enzymes.</p><p>These results also have implications for protein engineering, laboratory evolution and protein design. Protein engineers often choose a single starting genotype based on the availability of biochemical and structural information (often orthologs with the highest initial activity). While much effort has been devoted to developing technologies for better library construction and high-throughput screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dalby, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Davids et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goldsmith et al., 2017</xref>), our observations suggest that it may also be effective to explore diverse initial genotypes and identify the most evolvable starting sequences to successfully obtain an optimized functional protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lapidoth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kiss et al., 2013</xref>). Yet, predicting the evolvability of proteins remains a challenge that will require more in-depth biochemical and biophysical characterizations in order to dissect the molecular mechanisms driving the evolution of protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clifton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kaltenbach et al., 2018</xref>).

All protein atoms and water molecules within 85% of the solvent sphere were allowed to move freely with no restraints, atoms in the last 15% of the sphere were subject to 10 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup> positional restraints, and all atoms outside this sphere were subjected to 200 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup> positional restraints to maintain them at their crystallographic positions. Protonation states of all ionisable residues within the inner 85% of the simulation sphere were assigned using PROPKA 3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Søndergaard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Olsson et al., 2011</xref>) and the protonation states of histidine side chains were determined by visual inspection of the surrounding hydrogen bonding pattern of each residue. The relevant protonation states and histidine protonation parameters are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4B</xref>. All ionizable residues outside of the 85% of the sphere were kept in their uncharged forms to avoid simulation artefacts caused by having charged residues in the excluded region of the simulations. All systems were initially equilibrated with 200 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup> positional restraints over the total timescale of 95 ps, during which the alternating heating, cooling and reheating was performed to release steric clashes and equilibrate the positions of the solvent molecules and hydrogen atoms, and to reach the target simulation temperature of 300K. The initial equilibration was completed by performing 10 ns of simulation at 300K, which was followed by 100 ns production simulation, the last 50 ns of which was subject to further analysis. This protocol was repeated five times generating five independent 100ns trajectories for each system. The root mean square deviations of all C-α atoms in our simulations is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, which demonstrates that all simulations have equilibrated during the 100 ns simulation time. During the final stage of the equilibration and production simulations weak 0.5 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup> restraints were applied on the PMH substrate in order to keep it within the simulation sphere, and 1.0 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup> restraints were applied on the metal ions, side chains of the metal ligands and the bridging hydroxide ion to assure proper coordination geometry of the metal centers. Apart from the very initial stages of the equilibration where a 0.01 and 0.1 fs time step was used, a 1 fs time step was used throughout the simulations. The results of the simulations were analyzed using: VMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Humphrey et al., 1996</xref>), and GROMACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>). The raw data of the MD simulations are available from the Dryad Digital Repository at doi:10.5061/dryad.qk653b3.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dan S Tawfik, Amir Aharoni, Joelle Pelletier and the members of the Tokuriki lab for comments on the manuscript.

Supported by an impressive array of data, the authors argue that cryptic properties of the evolutionary starting points of the different MBLs determine their evolvability. The main finding is that the initial promiscuous activities of the WT enzymes are not indicative of the final fitness peaks and that an orthologue with lower initial activity reached the highest fitness plateau in this experiment. The trajectories of two of the four orthologues are tracked in considerable detail and represent a comprehensive exploration of the molecular basis for the emergence of a new enzyme function from a low-level side activity.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A major question on which the approach hinges is the reproducibility of the trajectories, an issue addressed in the subsection “A limited accessibility to adaptive mutations from each starting point”. Given the stochastic nature of the starting library, would the evolutionary trajectory for a given protein be the same every time? Surprisingly, the article does not try to replicate the trajectories shown in Figure 1D, in order to show that these remain substantially the same, irrespective of the starting conditions. Instead, it presents additional samplings of starting libraries for two of the proteins (Figure 2A), data which appear to correspond to the R1 generation in Figure 1D. The extent to which these samplings substantiate the deterministic nature of the trajectories is not clear. The other arguments presented to this point seem equally indirect. If this issue cannot be resolved, the claims of determinism throughout the paper will have to be reduced substantially.</p><p>The article makes a number of sweeping claims, including that the results reported are essential to predicting the evolution of proteins and that they have profound implications for protein design. However, there is nothing in the paper to indicate that, on the basis of this study, the authors could predict the trajectory of a fifth MBL from its sequence. There are also no clear implications for protein design. The conclusion that multiple starting points are better than a single one refers only to directed evolution studies. In light of this, it is necessary to carefully edit the article in order to remove all claims not borne out by the data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40789.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A major question on which the approach hinges is the reproducibility of the trajectories, an issue addressed in the subsection “A limited accessibility to adaptive mutations from each starting point”.

We agree that the repeatability and deterministic nature of these four evolutionary trajectories are two aspects that are strongly associated with our overall claim. Studying these questions at the genetic level using our system, however, is beyond our experimental capacities. The main reason for not replicating the long-term trajectories of VIM2 and NDM1, with multiple parallel lineages, is the intensity of the experimental scheme required to perform directed evolution. Unlike other studies, which employ in vivo enzyme selection and organismal evolution, our directed evolution scheme (library creation, and cell lysate screenings) requires several weeks per round and per enzyme. Obtaining further mutational analyses, kinetics and structures can take many additional months. Thus, performing such analysis in multiple repeated lineages for multiple starting points is virtually unfeasible. Consequently, we conducted the most informative approach, within our reach, to perform a re-screening of three additional round 1 libraries for both NDM1 and VIM2 to probe the extent of determinism, at least at the initial round. The experiment showed striking repeatability and occurrence of key mutations that confer the largest increase of the evolutionary trajectories in the additional screenings (Figure 2). These results suggest that only a handful of adaptive mutations that are unique to each genotype, are accessible, at least from the wild-type sequence. However, we agree that this experiment does not prove the repeatability of the evolutionary outcomes, and other evidence and arguments that we presented in the manuscript are still indirect and circumstantial.</p><p>Therefore, in agreement with the reviewers, we have substantially reduced our claim of determinism throughout the manuscript; in particular, in the section “A limited accessibility of adaptive mutations from each starting point”, which has been extensively revised to comply with the reviewers’ comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The article makes a number of sweeping claims, including that the results reported are essential to predicting the evolution of proteins and that they have profound implications for protein design.

However, we would like to clarify that our intention was not to claim that this work will allow us to predict evolutionary outcomes starting from other MBL orthologues. On the contrary, we aim at emphasizing how difficult and complicated it is to predict evolutionary outcomes from a given starting point, partly due to the existence of cryptic genetic variation. We would like to discuss that only a very deep understanding of the molecular mechanisms at play during functional transitions will empower our ability to predict evolution. We also believe that these results are relevant, not only to the field of directed evolution and engineering, but also to protein design because most protein/enzyme designs still rely on a unique starting point, rather than exploring multiple ones. However, we acknowledge that there are researchers, in particular groups belonging to the Rosetta community, who capitalize on multiple starting points, which is why we now cite their work in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
