2015). Here we report that polyQ ATXN1 oligomers can propagate locally in vivo in mice predisposed to SCA1 following intracerebral oligomeric tissue inoculation. Our data also show that targeting these oligomers with passive immunotherapy leads to some improvement in motor coordination in SCA1 mice and to a modest increase in their life span. These findings provide evidence that oligomer propagation is regionally limited in SCA1 and that immunotherapy targeting extracellular oligomers can mildly modify disease phenotypes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10891.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10891.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>ataxin-1</kwd><kwd>propagation</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>oligomers</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Robert and Renee E Belfer Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lasagna-Reeves</surname><given-names>Cristian A</given-names></name><name><surname>Rousseaux</surname><given-names>Maxime WC</given-names></name><name><surname>Jafar-Nejad</surname><given-names>Paymaan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS027699-17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Jeehye</given-names></name><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2015) it is shown that polyglutamine ATXN1 oligomers propagate locally in SCA1 mice, and that passive immunotherapy targeting soluble oligomers can lead to an improvement in motor coordination and a modest increase in life span.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>We recently demonstrated that soluble oligomers play an important role in Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), a neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of a CAG repeat that encodes for glutamine (Q) in ataxin-1 (ATXN1)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2015</xref>). In the same study, we showed that ATXN1 oligomers are internalized into the cell and seed the formation of new ATXN1 oligomersÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2015</xref>). This 'seeding' concept has been explored in several other proteinopathies and is believed to be one of the drivers of neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Frost et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Munch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Holmes and Diamond, 2012</xref>). Whatâs more, evidence has mounted that soluble aggregates of amyloidogenic proteins including Tau, AÎ² and Î±âsynuclein, can propagate pathology from cell-to-cell in a prion-like fashion, thereby causing pathology progression from one brain region to theÂ another in a disease-specific pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hardy and Revesz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Holmes and Diamond, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Guo and Lee, 2014</xref>). Passive immunotherapy has been recently proposed as a feasible strategy to inhibit pathology propagation in mouse models for proteinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banks et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Masliah et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Yanamandra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Castillo-Carranza et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Games et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Tran et al., 2014</xref>). Despite these advances, it is not clear whether a mostly nuclear protein like ATXN1 will propagate from cell-to-cell in vivo and whether passive immunotherapy targeting oligomers will modify disease course.</p><p>In the present study, we report that polyQ ATXN1 oligomers act as a seed by inducing disease propagation to neighboring but not to distal cells and demonstrate that this cell-to-cell spread can be blocked using passive immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ATXN1 oligomers seed the formation of new endogenous ATXN1 oligomers in vivo</title><p>We recently demonstrated that in <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></italic>mice ATXN1 oligomers are restricted to focal sub-populations of Purkinje cells (PCs) and are not evenly present throughout the cerebellum. Notably, this focal distribution coincided with cellular toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2015</xref>). This observation, together with the finding that ATXN1 oligomers are able to penetrate cells in culture and seed the formation of new ATXN1 oligomers led us to hypothesize that if ATXN1 oligomers propagate in vivo, intracerebral injection of brain extract from a symptomatic SCA1 mouse into aÂ disease-free mouse would predispose the latter to develop neuropathology. To test this hypothesis, we injected cerebellar extract (10 Âµg, 2.5 Î¼L) either from <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></italic>or wild-type mice into the deep cerebellar nuclei of wild type, <italic>Atxn1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></italic>mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></italic>mice express one allele of murine Atxn1 with a 78Q expansion. These mice do not display behavioral abnormalities nor any neuropathology, including ATXN1 inclusions, indicating that a single copy of 78Q-Atxn1 is insufficient to generate disease within the short lifespan of a mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lorenzetti et al., 2000</xref>).

Nine different groups of mice (each constituting 8 animals) were injected at 3 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Three months after injection, ELISA revealed that cerebellar extracts from the SCA1 <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </italic>mice caused a two-to-three fold increase in oligomer formation in the cerebellum and brain stem of <italic>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></italic>mice compared to other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, left panels). Oligomer levels in the cortex, which were lower to begin with than in the cerebellum and brainstem, did not significantly change in any of the groups following injection of cerebellar lysate. Neuropathology confirmed that oligomers were located in cerebellum and brain stem, but not in cortex, hippocampus, striatum or olfactory bulb (data not shown). ATXN1 oligomers thus appear to propagate only to neighboring areas, and, at least under these conditions, trans-synaptic propagation was not detected. Nevertheless, we canât exclude the possibility that a higher concentration of inoculum and/or a longer incubation time might lead to oligomer propagation to farther areas. In all of the groups ofÂ mice tested, we observed similar amounts of total ATXN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right panels), which indicates that the increase of oligomers in the cerebellum and brain stem of <italic>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></italic>mice was produced by a seeding effect of ATXN1-154Q soluble oligomers rather than by inducing more expression of ATXN1-78Q. To evaluate whether or not pathology propagation was triggered by oligomers presented in the injected material from <italic>Atxn1</italic><sup>154Q/+,</sup>we performed a cell-based seeding assay using the injected materials as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, we added the injected material from <italic>Atxn1</italic><sup>154Q/+</sup> alone or pre-incubated with the anti-oligomer antibody F11G3 to cells that express ATXN1(82Q) fused to mRFP. After a 10 hr incubation, we then quantified the amount of oligomeric inclusions. In comparison with cells incubated with the injected material from wild type or non-treated group, the cells exposed only to the injected material from <italic>Atxn1</italic><sup>154Q/+</sup> developed the largest proportion of oligomeric inclusions (37.25%). Moreover, when cells were exposed to the injected material from <italic>Atxn1</italic><sup>154Q/+</sup> pre-incubated with F11G3, the proportion of oligomeric inclusions (15.25%) did not increase in comparison with the control groups thus suggesting that the active material in the injected lysate are the oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, this oligomeric pathology did not result from the surgical procedure itself: only PCs of <italic>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></italic>knockin mice injected with cerebellar extract from <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></italic> mice, not those injected with WT cerebellar extract, showed an increase in oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The observation that no oligomers were detected in PCs from either wild-type or <italic>Atxn1</italic> null mice injected with <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></italic> lysates suggests that host expression of polyQ-expanded ATXN1 is necessary for theÂ de novo formation of ATXN1 oligomers in PCs. Immunofluorescence confirmed that the oligomers detected in <italic>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></italic>PCs were indeed ATXN1 oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that the ATXN1 oligomers present in the injected material from <italic>Atxn1</italic><sup>154Q/+</sup> are responsible for inducing propagation of ATXN1 oligomers in <italic>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></italic>mice. Nevertheless, it is possible that other factors present in the inoculum play an important role in promoting propagation. Further, downstream exploration of the precise biochemical composition of these lysates will surely shed insight into this matter.</p><p>To determine if oligomer propagation was accompanied by motor deficit, we performed the rotarod assay in mice harboring brain lysate for 3 months. Even though the performance varied during training, there was no evidence of sustained deficit in the <italic>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></italic>knockin mice injected with cerebellar extract from <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Despite the fact that oligomers propagate through the cerebellum in <italic>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></italic>knockin mice, the newly formed 78Q ATXN1 oligomers appear insufficient to induce motor deficit or degeneration (data not shown). This lack of toxicity could be because in <italic>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></italic>knockin adult mice, the neurons are relatively healthy and thus can counteract the toxic effect of newly formed oligomers. In contrast, in <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></italic>mice, the neurons become dysfunctional by four weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2015</xref>) rendering them more susceptible to the toxicity of oligomers. Another possibility is that the newly formed 78Q ATXN1 oligomers adopt a different structure or conformation that is less toxic than the 154Q ATXN1 oligomers. Further studies will be necessary to determine if these newly formed ATXN1 oligomers are solely derived from 78Q ATXN1 molecules or whether they contain some persistent 154Q ATXN1 seeds.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Passive immunotherapy decreases ATXN1 oligomer pathology and improves motor coordination</title><p>Given the ability of the anti-oligomer antibody F11G3 to inhibit the internalization of ATXN1 oligomer complexes from <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </italic>cerebellum in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2015</xref>), we postulated that anti-oligomer (F11G3) immunotherapy could reduce the load of ATXN1 oligomers and mitigate the motor impairment observed in the <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </italic>model. Because <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </italic>mice develop motor incoordination as early as 5 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Watase et al., 2002</xref>), we began treatment at 4 weeks of age, where <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </italic>mice already have a modest accumulation of oligomers in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Wild-type and <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></italic> mice were injected intraperitoneally with F11G3 or control IgM antibodies (5 mg/Kg) once a week for 6 weeks. One week after the last injection, we performed the rotarod assay, sacrificed the mice and performed pathological and biochemical analyses. Injected mice were separated into two cohorts, one for biochemical and pathological analysis and one for behavioral and survival analysis. We focused our pathological examination on the cerebellum. Brain sections were immunostained with the anti-oligomer antibody, A-11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kayed et al., 2003</xref>), to ensure depletion of oligomers at the site of interest. <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </italic>mice treated with the anti-oligomer antibody showed fewer PCs with oligomers than the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). We further analyzed the cerebella by ELISA and noted a decrease in the amount of oligomers and ATXN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Notably, the immunotherapy did not affect the formation and total number of nuclear inclusions in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>): either these cortical inclusions are not preceded by oligomers or the antibody did not get internalized into these cells in vivo. Considering our previous study where we demonstrated that the anti-oligomer antibody blocks the seeding effect of ATXN1 oligomers in cell culture without getting internalized into the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2015</xref>), we suggest that the anti-oligomer antibody arrests the propagation of ATXN1 oligomer complexes to neighboring areas by targeting extracellular oligomeric entities rather than directly targeting intracellular oligomers. To confirm that the immunotherapy was indeed targeting ATXN1 oligomers, we analyzed the treated and control samples by western blot using F11G3 and anti-ATXN1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). The western blot analysis revealed a decrease in ATXN1 oligomers in the treated group, but no observable change at the level of monomeric ATXN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10891.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Anti-oligomer immunotherapy decreases pathology in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Histological staining of PCs (Calbindin, top panels) and Oligomers (A11, bottom panel) of control (IgM) and treated (F11G3) <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </italic>mice.

It is widely accepted that amyloid formation is characterized by such seeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Serio et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pedersen et al., 2004</xref>). This phenomenon has been explored in cell culture assays, several of which have demonstrated that extracellular aggregates that are internalized into the cell induce aggregation of intracellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Frost et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Munch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Holmes and Diamond, 2012</xref>). Moreover, the concept of cell-to-cell spread of many amyloidogenic proteins in vivo has been demonstrated by the progression of protein aggregate pathology from one brain region to another in a disease-specific pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hardy and Revesz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Holmes and Diamond, 2012</xref>). In our study, however, we found that injected oligomers induced formation of new ATXN1 oligomers only in areas proximal to the injection site. It thus seems unlikely that ATXN1 oligomers propagate transsynaptically in SCA1, as has been suggested with other neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Harris et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de Calignon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pecho-Vrieseling et al., 2014</xref>). Rather, we suggest ATXN1 propagates through a secretion and reuptake mechanism between neighboring cells as has been proposed for other proteinopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Guo and Lee, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, no obvious signs of degeneration or motor incoordination were observed in the injected mice. This suggests that the cell must continuously express the toxic entityÂ to trigger degeneration and behavioral deficits in mice. This notion is supported by the observation that immunotherapy targeting the ATXN1 oligomers slightly modified the phenotype in the <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </italic>mice: the antibody hindered the local propagation of ATXN1 oligomers. This treatment is not curative, however, because neurons expressing polyQ ATXN1 will still form their own toxic oligomeric entities, and some non-oligomeric forms of PolyQ ATXN1 might contribute to toxicity.</p><p>Passive immunotherapy has been proposed as a feasible strategy to inhibit pathogenesis in mouse models for AD and PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banks et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Masliah et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Yanamandra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Castillo-Carranza et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Games et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings suggest that such therapy might slightly impact disease progression by blocking the propagation of these oligomeric entities, but to halt or reverse symptoms it would likely be necessary to incorporate a joint therapy that targets the root cause of disease, the abnormal accumulation of polyQ ATXN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Park et al., 2013</xref>). Altogether, our findings revealed that ATXN1 oligomer propagation contributes to SCA1 pathogenesis, and that such propagation especially in the vicinity of affected cells, could be targeted through passive immunotherapy. That the benefit from such therapy was small highlights the need to develop therapies that target ATXN1, the protein driving the pathogenesis. The need for such combination therapy is likely to extend to other disease-driving proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Mouse models and preparation of brain extracts</title><p>All mouse procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee for Baylor College of Medicine and Affiliates. <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup>,Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Atxn1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lorenzetti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Watase et al., 2002</xref>) and were backcrossed to C57BL/6 for more than ten generations.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Ataxin-1 oligomers induce local spread of pathology and decreasing them by passive immunization slows SCA1 phenotypes&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a timely and intriguing follow up to the author's recent paper showing that oligomers are primary drivers of toxicity. Here the authors test whether injected oligomers can drive regional propagation of SCA1 pathology and whether passive immunotherapy can reverse disease phenotypes. The authors show data that oligomers can propagate within a localized region and that this propagation is limited only to neighboring areas. Immunotherapy results provide some indication that this approach could have limited efficacy. The major points are that for ataxin-1, propagation does not appear to be the major driver of toxicity, therefore immunotherapy against extracellular oligomers would require additional therapeutic strategies in combination. This is a very important point relating to treatment that passive immunotherapy may not be curative because neurons will form toxic oligomeric entities internally and that one would need to target abnormal accumulation of polyQ ATXN1.</p><p>Overall some type of more direct test of either the injected oligomers being the driver of seeding or whether immunotherapy impacts oligomers directly versus reducing mutant ATXN1 levels would have been helpful. We would welcome any additional experimental back up to address the major criticisms mentioned below but consider it crucial that the authors indicate very clearly the limitations of the work in their final manuscript by addressing in their revised text the questions raised in the essential revisions section.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Cerebellar extracts from control or Atxn1 154Q/+ mice were injected into Atxn1 78Q/+ or wild type mice and limited spreading to neighboring areas within the cerebellum and brain stem was detected. The authors state that the fact ATXN1 levels were the same indicates that oligomers were induced by the seeding effect of ATXN1-154Q soluble oligomers. It would have been helpful to use similar approaches as used in the initial published studies to deplete lysates of ataxin-1 (using oligomer antibody) to show that the effect was directly a consequence of oligomers, but minimally the previous study and discussion of this depletion experiment should be discussed. There are other factors that could provide this effect including inflammatory cytokines or other external (and limiting) factors. Further, it is not mentioned until the Discussion whether this localized spreading had an effect on behavior or neurodegeneration in the Atxn1 78Q/+ mice and should be discussed in the Results.</p><p>2) The authors perform passive immunotherapy with F11G3 using IP injection in 154Q/+ mice. Decreased oligomers and ATXN1 were observed in cerebella. What is status at 4 weeks when injected? The authors postulate that the antibody targets extracellular oligomeric entities. This experiment could also be done in the 78Q/+ mice using the conditions with injected lysates. This would provide a direct test of whether immunotherapy targeted the oligomers.</p><p>3) Could the phenotypic effect of the passive immunity experiment be due to the decrease of ATXN1 (panel 2D), not the oligomers since increasing the oligomers in the 78Q background does not result in a phenotype?</p><p>4) It is briefly mentioned that the increase in oligomers in the 78Q background post-injection is not associated with neurodegeneration or motor incoordination. The authors interpret this to mean that the &quot;toxic entity&quot; (presumably the 154Q) needs to be continuously expressed to observe a phenotype. As the 78Q expansion is abnormal yet insufficient to cause disease in the mouse, presumably due to their short lifespan (subsection âATXN1 oligomers seed the formation of new endogenous ATXN1 oligomers in vivoâ, first paragraph), seeding the formation of oligomers was insufficient to increase the pathogenicity of this abnormal repeat as hypothesized by the authors. This would call into question the true pathogenicity of the oligomers if their presence does not alter phenotype. Can the authors comment on whether pure 78Q oligomers are likely formed following seeding from the 154Q lysate or whether all the oligomers likely contain one or more 154Q molecules? If pure 78Q oligomers are formed post-seeding, then why is there no phenotype? If the 78Q is simply insufficient to cause disease, does injection of the oligomers back into 154Q itself worsen that phenotype?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10891.010</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Cerebellar extracts from control or Atxn1 154Q/+ mice were injected into Atxn1 78Q/+ or wild type mice and limited spreading to neighboring areas within the cerebellum and brain stem was detected.

Pre-incubating the <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </italic>brain homogenate with F11G3 completely abolished the seeding nature of the homogenate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>; subsection âATXN1 oligomers seed the formation of new endogenous ATXN1 oligomers in vivoâ, second paragraph). This suggests that the seeding/propagation observed in vivo is due to the oligomers present in the injected material. Nevertheless, in the manuscript we acknowledge that other factors in the injected material such as inflammatory responses could also play a role in propagation. We also discussed the necessity to perform future studies where lysate depleted of ATXN1 oligomers are injected in <italic>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup> </italic>mice.</p><p>With regards to whether the localized spreading had an effect on behavior in <italic>Atxn<sup>78Q/+</sup> </italic>mice, we performed Rotarod analysis to test for the presence of motor coordination defects in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We found that â consistent with our pathological findings â only mild and unsustained defects were observed in the <italic>Atxn<sup>78Q/+</sup></italic> mice injected with <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </italic>brain homogenate (in the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection).</p><p><italic>2) The authors perform passive immunotherapy with F11G3 using IP injection in 154Q/+ mice. Decreased oligomers and ATXN1 were observed in cerebella. What is status at 4 weeks when injected? The authors postulate that the antibody targets extracellular oligomeric entities. This experiment could also be done in the 78Q/+ mice using the conditions with injected lysates. This would provide a direct test of whether immunotherapy targeted the oligomers.</italic> </p><p>Our new data demonstrate that ATXN1 oligomers are already present in <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </italic>mice cerebellum at 4 weeks of age. Nevertheless the amount of oligomers at this age is modest in comparison with <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </italic>mice at 11 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>; subsection âPassive immunotherapy decreases ATXN1 oligomer pathology and improves motor coordinationâ, first paragraph).</p><p>We agree with the reviewersâ observation regarding the administration of F11G3 in <italic>Atxn<sup>78Q/+</sup> </italic>mice after lysate injection in order to provide direct test of whether immunotherapy targeted oligomers. However, this experiment would take several months as we would have to restart essentially all experiments (to have the proper littermate and age matched controls). Thus, to answer this question as a proxy, we showed that immunotherapy using F11G3 in <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </italic>mice specifically targets ATXN1 oligomers but not monomeric ATXN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>; in the aforementioned paragraph). These data lend further support that the effects observed throughout these experiments are from the immunotherapy specifically targeting ATXN1 oligomers.</p><p><italic>3) Could the phenotypic effect of the passive immunity experiment be due to the decrease of ATXN1 (panel 2D), not the oligomers since increasing the oligomers in the 78Q background does not result in a phenotype?</italic> </p><p>Our new data demonstrate how the immunotherapy in <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </italic>mice specifically targets ATXN1 oligomers but not monomeric ATXN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>; subsection âPassive immunotherapy decreases ATXN1 oligomer pathology and improves motor coordinationâ, first paragraph). Therefore, the decrease of total ATXN1 levels measured by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) is mainly due to a decrease in the levels of ATXN1 oligomers.</p><p>Regarding the fact that no phenotype is observed in the <italic>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup> </italic>mice injected with <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </italic>brain homogenate; we added new comments in the Results section (subsection âATXN1 oligomers seed the formation of new endogenous ATXN1 oligomers in vivoâ, last paragraph). Furthermore, we address this point in more detail in question 4.</p><p><italic>4) It is briefly mentioned that the increase in oligomers in the 78Q background post-injection is not associated with neurodegeneration or motor incoordination. The authors interpret this to mean that the &quot;toxic entity&quot; (presumably the 154Q) needs to be continuously expressed to observe a phenotype. As the 78Q expansion is abnormal yet insufficient to cause disease in the mouse, presumably due to their short lifespan (subsection âATXN1 oligomers seed the formation of new endogenous ATXN1 oligomers in vivoâ, first paragraph), seeding the formation of oligomers was insufficient to increase the pathogenicity of this abnormal repeat as hypothesized by the authors. This would call into question the true pathogenicity of the oligomers if their presence does not alter phenotype. Can the authors comment on whether pure 78Q oligomers are likely formed following seeding from the 154Q lysate or whether all the oligomers likely contain one or more 154Q molecules? If pure 78Q oligomers are formed post-seeding, then why is there no phenotype? If the 78Q is simply insufficient to cause disease, does injection of the oligomers back into 154Q itself worsen that phenotype?</italic> </p><p>At this time, we cannot ascertain the exact nature of the oligomeric entities in the brains of injected animals without proper genetic tools (such as having differentially tagged knockin mice for <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></italic> and probing for their respective tags biochemically). Nevertheless, we comment in the results section whether pure 78Q ATXN1 oligomers are likely formed following seeding from the <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </italic>brain lysate or whether all the oligomers likely contain one or more 154Q ATXN1 molecules (subsection âATXN1 oligomers seed the formation of new endogenous ATXN1 oligomers in vivoâ, last paragraph). In the same section, we also discussed that the newly formed oligomers are insufficient to cause disease, possibly either because the healthy neuronal environment in <italic>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></italic> mice can counteract the toxic effect of these oligomers or because they are structurally different from 154Q toxic oligomers.</p><p>We have not had to opportunity to inject oligomers into <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </italic>mice yet given their sensitivity to stereotaxic surgery. However, considering the abundance of published studies from several proteinopathies indicating that seeding inoculate into presymptomatic mice accelerates neurodegeneration (Guo and Lee, 2014), we believe that the injected material would accelerate and perhaps worsen phenotypes in <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </italic>mice.</p></body></sub-article></article>
