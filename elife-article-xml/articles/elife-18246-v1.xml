While remyelination promises to restore lost function, it remains unclear whether remyelination will prevent axonal loss. Inflammatory demyelination is accompanied by significant neuronal loss in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model and evidence for remyelination in this model is complicated by ongoing inflammation, degeneration and possible remyelination. Demonstrating the functional significance of remyelination necessitates selectively altering the timing of remyelination relative to inflammation and degeneration. We demonstrate accelerated remyelination after EAE induction by direct lineage analysis and hypothesize that newly formed myelin remains stable at the height of inflammation due in part to the absence of MOG expression in immature myelin. Oligodendroglial-specific genetic ablation of the M1 muscarinic receptor, a potent negative regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, results in accelerated remyelination, preventing axonal loss and improving functional recovery. Together our findings demonstrate that accelerated remyelination supports axonal integrity and neuronal function after inflammatory demyelination.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18246.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18246.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>demyelination</kwd><kwd>myelination</kwd><kwd>oligodendrocytes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007055</institution-id><institution>Third Military Medical University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Overseas Youth Program Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mei</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSCF31471043</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mei</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81270017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mei</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship grants (DFG;

Over the course of the disease, demyelinated axons undergo irreversible degeneration, which correlates with progression and results in permanent disability—events that are pathological hallmarks of progressive MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Trapp et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bitsch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjartmar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Franklin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuhlmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lovas et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tallantyre et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trapp and Stys, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Singh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sorbara et al., 2014</xref>). To date, there are no therapeutic interventions that directly prevent neuronal degeneration, especially as the precise mechanisms underlying degeneration remain undetermined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bjartmar and Trapp, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simons et al., 2014</xref>). As a crucial accessory to the functional nerve-fiber unit, the myelin sheath provides multiple-layers of concentric membrane, which act to maximize the speed and reduce the energy demands of action potentials. The importance of myelin in the developing CNS is further illustrated by recent findings demonstrating that oligodendrocytes provide critical metabolic support to neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fünfschilling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lappe-Siefke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). However, while it seems intuitive that remyelination plays a crucial role in preserving axonal integrity and restoring neuronal function in an inflammatory condition like MS, direct evidence is lacking. Remyelination is an inefficient process in MS, which is likely due to an inhibitory microenvironment that prevents oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) from terminally differentiating into myelinating oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang and Franklin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuhlmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wolswijk, 1998</xref>). Additionally, it is thought that the microenvironment may also modify the epigenetic regulation of OPCs to alter transcriptional programs necessary for differentiation during development and after demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moyon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huynh et al., 2014</xref>). In order to promote myelin repair in MS, recent high-throughput screening efforts have identified a number of myelin regenerative compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deshmukh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Najm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Samanta et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, some of these compounds promote precocious differentiation of oligodendrocytes and attenuate clinical symptoms in EAE, an inflammatory demyelinating animal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mei et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deshmukh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Najm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Samanta et al., 2015</xref>). The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear, as active inflammation dynamically results in coincident demyelination, axonal degeneration and remyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miller and Karpus, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nikić et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ransohoff, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stanley and Pender, 1991</xref>). Demonstrating the functional significance of remyelination necessitates uncoupling the immunological response and degenerative process from oligodendrocyte-mediated repair. Here, we uncouple remyelination from inflammation and degeneration by genetically targeting cell-specific deletion of the M1 muscarinic receptor (Chrm1) in OPCs to demonstrate that accelerated remyelination is sufficient to reduce the severity of EAE clinical scores, attributable in part to preserving axonal integrity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Demyelination, axonal loss and remyelination in EAE</title><p>To determine whether EAE is a model suitable for investigating remyelination and axonal protection, we set out to characterize the timing of demyelination, axonal loss and the possibility of remyelination throughout the course of EAE. We induced EAE using the MOG peptide (MOG<sub>35-55</sub>) with mice on the C57BL/6 genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mendel et al., 1995</xref>). The mice developed chronic paralysis and reached a peak clinical score approximately 14 days post immunization (PI), which was maintained until 30 days PI. To characterize demyelination of the spinal cords during EAE, we employed osmium tetroxide (OsO4; a lipophilic transition metal that efficiently stains myelin) to examine the integrity of the myelin along the white matter tracts of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>). Demyelinating lesions were detected in the white matter tracts of the lumbar spinal cord at the peak of EAE severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) followed by extensive and global demyelination at the late stage of EAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The widespread damage to myelin was also visible by immunostaining for MOG, a myelin-specific protein, on cross sections of spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–f</xref>). Notably, neurofilament (NF) staining displayed numerous demyelinated axons (MOG-negative areas) at the peak of clinical severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), and significant loss of axons by NF immunoreactivity at the late stage of EAE--indicating significant neuronal degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). By transmission electron microscopy (EM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g–i</xref>), remyelinated axons were sparsely identified as thinly myelinated axons in the late stage of EAE spinal cords, which were accompanied with a large number of demyelinated and possibly degenerating axons with diffuse cytoplasmic staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h,i</xref>). These results indicate that the EAE model is complicated by significant inflammation, demyelination, axonal degeneration and sparse remyelination. These findings suggest that standard EAE may not be an ideal model to investigate the possible relationship between remyelination and axonal integrity. However, as inflammatory demyelination is highly relevant to MS, we decided to pursue approaches that may uncouple the immunological response and degenerative processes from the reparative impact by oligodendrocytes.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18246.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Axonal degeneration and remyelination after inflammatory demyelination in EAE.</title><p>Representative spinal cord sections were stained for OsO4 (black) showing myelin in the naïve (<bold>a</bold>), and EAE mice at the peak (<bold>b</bold>) and late stages (<bold>c</bold>) of EAE.

Remyelination and axon loss were assessed by FluoroMyelin detection and immunostaining for NF in the lumbar spinal cords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>). Clemastine treatment significantly preserved myelin staining intensity and prevented axon loss as assessed by NF immunostaining in the white matter tracts at the late stage of EAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>). To examine the infiltration of T-cells, macrophages and the activation of microglia, we immunostained for CD3 (T-cells) and Iba1 (macrophages and microglia) and quantified the density of these cells in demyelinated lesions at the late stage of EAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). We did not find a statistical difference in the density of CD3 or Iba1 positive cells after treatment with clemastine, suggesting that the mechanism of action does not alter the inflammatory response at the level of cellular infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). However, as histology provides a static image of one time point, it is impossible to conclusively determine whether clemastine, or any other small molecule for that matter, contributes to the attenuation of the clinical score in EAE by solely accelerating remyelination. With that said, the possibility remains that clemastine could still modulate other aspects of inflammation, provide some sort of axonal support, or even stabilize the myelin sheath thereby preventing further damage. It is also important to note that all of these potential effects are not mutually exclusive and may each contribute to the attenuation of the clinical score.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18246.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Administration of clemastine attenuates EAE clinical scores and prevents axonal loss.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Daily treatment of clemastine (10 mg/kg, n = 25) from day 0 decreases the clinical severity in the MOG<sub>35-55</sub> induced EAE model.

In this line, recombination is induced by tamoxifen only in NG2 cells (OPCs) and newly formed myelin (remyelination) can be visualized by expression of the membrane-associated isoform of GFP (mGFP), as only mature oligodendrocytes express tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). We induced recombination with a single dose of tamoxifen two days prior to immunization and clemastine treatment. GFP-positive myelin was absent in the vehicle EAE mouse at the peak of disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>), while a number of GFP positive myelin sheaths were visualized as 'rings' surrounding demyelinated axons (NF+/MOG-) after clemastine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). These results directly indicate that newly formed myelin (remyelinated axons) can be initiated and identified as early as the peak of disease with myelin regenerative compounds. However, if remyelination is occurring at the height of inflammation, how is the new myelin stabilized in this highly toxic milieu? We hypothesize that as remyelination is accelerated in the MOG-induced EAE model, the new myelin does not yet express the MOG antigen and would be excluded from MOG-induced inflammatory demyelination. This is clearly evident upon the detection of a number of axons surrounded by thin GFP membranes that are still yet negative for MOG expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). We also examined the recombination efficiency of the NG2-CreErt; tau-mGFP mice, as we did not detect any GFPpositive myelin sheaths in the vehicle control mice. As newly formed oligodendrocytes are not generated in high frequency in adult mice, we examined 14-day old mice to determine recombination efficiency by administration of tamoxifen at postnatal day 8 and then examining recombination 6 days later. By examining cortical regions where myelination is sparse at postnatal day 14, we quantified the number of GFP positive, CC1 positive oligodendrocytes and calculated a recombination efficiency of approximately 30% of the total number of oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>). It is also important to note that we did not identify GFP positive cells in the cortex that were not CC1 positive, suggesting that GFP expression was specific to oligodendrocytes. Consequently, while we can employ this approach to identify newly generated oligodendrocytes and remyelination in EAE, it does not necessarily allow us to identify all remyelinated axons. Despite the coincidence of remyelination and attenuation of clinical scores upon remyelination, it remains unclear whether preservation of axonal integrity is solely due to remyelination, as none of the small molecules are cell-type specific, and off-target effects may contribute to the attenuation of clinical scores in EAE. Clemastine may modulate the immune system via antagonism of a number of receptors—including the histamine receptor 1 and the muscarinic receptors—expressed by immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jutel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johansen et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, uncoupling remyelination from effects on the immunological response and degenerative process requires cell-specific manipulation of OPCs without affecting other cell types. As clemastine is known to possess anti-muscarinic properties and was identified in a cluster of other anti-muscarinic compounds from a high-throughput screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mei et al., 2014</xref>); identification and knockout of the specific target receptor in OPCs could phenocopy the effects elicited by administration of clemastine and allow us to definitively demonstrate the neuroprotective role of remyelination in EAE.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18246.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Lineage-specific tracing of remyelination by newly-formed oligodendrocytes in EAE.</title><p>Lineage-specific tracing of remyelination by newly-formed oligodendrocytes was accomplished using the <italic>Cspg4</italic>-CreErt; <italic>Mapt</italic>-mGFP line.

Clemastine and benzatropine are two potent myelin regenerative compounds that act to antagonize six overlapping targets, including the five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes (<italic>Chrm1-Chrm5</italic>) and the histamine receptor 1 (<italic>Hrh1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen and Almazan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Angelis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kubo et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ragheb et al., 2001</xref>). The expression of these receptors on oligodendroglia was examined by analyzing mRNA and antibody staining. qRT-PCR and immunostaining detected <italic>Chrm1-Chrm5</italic> and <italic>Hrh1</italic> expression in OPCs at both mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>) and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c,d</xref>). As all the potential receptor targets were expressed by OPCs, albeit at varying levels, we hypothesized that the effects of muscarinic receptor (MR) antagonists on differentiation should be blocked upon loss-of-function. To investigate the potential target(s), OPCs were systematically purified from Chrm1-Chrm5 or Hrh1 knockout mice. After treatment with clemastine, benzatropine, or vehicle, the numbers of MBP-positive OLs and PDGFRα-positive OPCs were quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Treated groups were normalized to vehicle controls to reveal the effects of MR antagonists on oligodendroglial differentiation upon individual receptor deletion. As expected, clemastine or benzatropine induced an approximate five-fold increase in the number of OLs and a simultaneous decrease in the number of OPCs when examined in wildtype OPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Similar effects of MR antagonists were observed in the cultures from Chrm2-Chrm5 or Hrh1 knockout OPCs, suggesting that none of these individual receptors are essential for mediating the effects of the MR antagonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Interestingly, knockout of the Chrm1 completely abolished the effects of the anti-muscarinic compounds, resulting in similar numbers of OPCs and differentiated OLs as compared to vehicle-treated Chrm1KO cells, suggesting that the Chrm1 may be the sole mediator of the effects of the MR antagonists on oligodendroglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). To determine if Chrm1 is sufficient for mediating the effects of anti-muscarinic drugs, we examined whether Chrm1 deletion would phenocopy the enhancement of OPC differentiation and myelination by muscarinic antagonists. OPCs from the Chrm2- Chrm5 or Hrh1 knockout mice revealed similar levels of differentiation (MBP-positive) and proliferation (PDGFRα-positive) as compared to the wildtype OPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,c</xref>). However, the Chrm1 knockout cultures displayed a five-fold increase in MBP-positive OLs as well as a significant decrease in the number of OPCs when compared to wildtype cultures, consistent with the hypothesis that deletion of the Chrm1 is sufficient to enhance differentiation of OPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). To test whether OPCs from the Chrm1 knockout mice display precocious differentiation and myelination, we cocultured Chrm1 null OPCs with rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. We detected a significant increase in number of myelinating OLs as well as a concomitant decrease in OPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d,e</xref>).

Myelinated axon density in the ventral white matter was significantly higher in the Chrm1 cKO EAE spinal cords, as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Consistently, immunostaining for MOG and NF showed a significant increase in MOG immunoreactive areas and NF positive axons in the Chrm1 cKO EAE spinal cords, as compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d–h</xref>). To determine whether remyelination is neuroprotective and preserves axonal integrity in Chrm1 cKO mice, we examined the axons in the spinal cord ventral white matter with EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7i,j</xref>). Remyelinated axons in the EAE spinal cord were identified by thinner myelin sheaths, as compared to the pre-existing myelinated axons with thicker myelin sheaths in naïve mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7i</xref>). In the control EAE mice, demyelinated and degenerating axons were easily detected with a number of pre-existing myelinated axons and just a few remyelinated axons. In contrast, remyelinated axons were more consistently observed in the Chrm1 cKO EAE spinal cords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7j</xref>). We next quantified the <italic>g</italic>-ratio of the axons in the EAE spinal cords, focusing on the ventral white matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7k</xref>). The percentage of unmyelinated axons (<italic>g</italic>-ratio = 1) was decreased in the Chrm1 cKO EAE spinal cords, suggesting that remyelination is enhanced in the Chrm1 cKO EAE mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7k</xref>). The overall myelinated axon density (per mm<sup>2</sup>) was significantly decreased in the EAE control mice as compared to the Chrm1 cKO mice, suggesting that less axons undergo degeneration in Chrm1 cKO EAE mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7l</xref>). To determine whether remyelination is the direct cause of enhanced axonal survival, we sorted remyelinated axons from pre-existing myelinated axons by examining <italic>g</italic>-ratios. We reasoned that axons with a <italic>g</italic>-ratio greater than 0.8 were likely to be remyelinated axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7k</xref>), since most of the axons in the naïve spinal cord white matter exhibited <italic>g</italic>-ratios below 0.8 (pre-existing myelinated axons) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mei et al., 2014</xref>). The pre-existing myelinated axon density (<italic>g</italic>-ratio &lt; 0.8) significantly decreased in the EAE mice, without any significant difference between the Chrm1 cKO and control EAE mice, suggesting that Chrm1 deletion in OPCs does not affect the severity of demyelination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7m</xref>). Remyelinated axon density (<italic>g</italic>-ratio &gt;0.8) was detected in control EAE mice and was significantly increased as compared to naïve mice, suggesting that remyelination is an ongoing process even in the control EAE mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7n</xref>). Notably, a two-fold increase in the remyelinated axon density was detected in the Chrm1 cKO mice as compared to control EAE mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7n</xref>), demonstrating that remyelination is indeed neuroprotective from the neuroinflammatory environment in EAE. Additionally, we examined the infiltration of T-cells, macrophages and the activation of microglia by immunostaining for CD3 and Iba1 and quantified the number of these cells in demyelinated lesions of the Chrm1 cKOs and control littermates at the late stage of EAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We did not find a statistical difference in the number of CD3 or Iba1 positive cells in lesions from the Chrm1 cKOs and the control littermates, suggesting that the Chrm1 cKO does not overtly alter the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). While we cannot exclude the possibility that deletion of Chrm1 from OPCs may alter a yet unidentified inflammatory role by OPCs, taken together, our findings suggest that the most likely scenario is that remyelination is playing a causal role in preserving axon integrity after inflammatory demyelination.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Axonal degeneration underlies the chronic disability and progression in MS, and is currently untreatable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bitsch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjartmar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Franklin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuhlmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lovas et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tallantyre et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trapp and Stys, 2009</xref>). Immunomodulatory approaches are effective in decreasing the number of relapses and may impact the timing of progressive disability but fail to fully prevent progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carrithers, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rice, 2014</xref>). Currently, no intervention is available for neuroprotection, especially as the the mechanisms resulting in axonal degeneration are not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bjartmar and Trapp, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sherman and Brophy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). How then can we prevent axon degeneration after inflammatory demyelination? Emerging evidence indicates that the myelin sheath is important to ensure the survival of axons by providing physical and metabolic support in the developing CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirrlinger and Nave, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morrison et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saab et al., 2013</xref>). Since remyelination is an inefficient process in MS lesions, remyelinating therapies have been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach for MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franklin and Ffrench-Constant, 2008</xref>). In order to promote myelin repair, recent high-throughput screening efforts have yielded a number of myelin regenerative compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deshmukh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Najm et al., 2015</xref>), and interestingly some of these compounds are capable of attenuating the clinical severity of EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deshmukh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Najm et al., 2015</xref>). However, our limited understanding of the significance of remyelination dampens enthusiasm for myelin regenerative approaches to protect axons and prevent progression, as attenuation of EAE clinical symptoms may also be attributed to immunomodulatory effects from nonselective pharmacotherapeutic approaches. Here we utilize a genetic approach to enhance remyelination by manipulating oligodendroglia specifically without affecting other cell types, namely by the conditional deletion of Chrm1 in OPCs. For the first time, our findings uncouple remyelination from active inflammation and axonal degeneration in EAE and clearly demonstrate that remyelination is sufficient to preserve axonal integrity and neuronal function under an inflammatory demyelinating condition. It is notable that endogenous remyelination is nearly absent at the peak of EAE and is only sparsely observed at the later stages, suggesting cell autonomous remyelination is an inefficient process in the inflammatory setting. Strikingly, myelin regenerative approaches are able to initiate remyelination as early as the peak of EAE, as demonstrated by lineage tracing, and is sufficient to rescue axons from degeneration, possibly by reconstructing metabolic and/or physical support for demyelinated axons. Additionally, we hypothesize that remyelinated axons are excluded from the MOG-induced demyelination due in part to the absence of MOG expression in the immature newly formed myelin. This is clearly evident upon the detection of a number of axons surrounded by thin GFP membranes that are still yet negative for MOG expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Furthermore despite the thin myelin observed after remyelination, this process appears to be sufficient to preserve a large number of axons. This evidence suggests that early remyelination could be an effective intervention to preserve axonal integrity after inflammatory demyelination. Together, our findings provide novel insights into the functional role of remyelination as a means to preserve axonal integrity and neuronal function after inflammatory demyelination. Our findings clearly identify Chrm1 on OPCs as the target of anti-muscarinic treatment for remyelination – suggesting that remyelination therapy is a promising approach for restoring function and prolonging the quality of life for patients with MS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Transgenic mice</title><p>Chrm1, Chrm2, Chrm3, Chrm4, Chrm5, and Hrh1 knockout mice have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Noubade et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wess, 2004</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior editor) and four reviewers, one of whom, Klaus-Armin Nave (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Klaus-Armin Nave (Reviewer #1 and Reviewing Editor) and Patrizia Casaccia (Reviewer #2). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript addresses a very important and critical question in myelin biology: the mechanism of remyelination. The manuscript convincingly demonstrates that a very rapid remyelination of spinal cord lesions in EAE mice reduces the extent of neurodegeneration and clinical symptoms. At a general level, the data also suggest that axon loss in EAE is caused by targeted oligodendrocyte/myelin injury (subject to repair) and not by the mere recruitment and presence of highly activated immune cells (bystander effect). Specifically, the paper analyzes the effect of clemastine as a pharmacological inhibitor of muscarinic receptor M1R. The authors show that inhibition or loss of this receptor from oligodendrocyte lineage cells drives remyelination and ameliorates the EAE phenotype.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The text needs major revisions. The writing style does not match the elegance of the experimental results and it should be edited in its entirety. The use of imprecise terminology, grammatical errors and lack of flow in the overall description of the results negatively impacts reading of the manuscript. The text requires serious editing from Abstract to the end of the Results, as the scientific message is often lost due to difficulties in the flow.</p><p>2) The authors' major conclusion that remyelination supports axonal integrity and neuronal function is by itself not so surprising and should be rephrased in the Abstract. More remarkable is the unexpected early onset of remyelination that overlaps and interferes with the peak of EAE scores. As the authors point out, it demonstrates that myelin itself is axon protective in neuroinflammation. This could be made clearer in the Abstract.</p><p>3) Demonstrating that Clemastine does not interfere with immunization is critical and is so far done indirectly in conditional M1R mutants. Which immune cells express muscarinic receptors? Papers reporting immunosuppressive effects of this drug should be discussed (e.g. Jutel et al., Nature 2001, PMID: 11574888; Johansen et al. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2011 PMID: 21807405). However, the deletion of M1R in OPC may theoretically also influence the production of substances from OPC with the ability to modulate immune cell responses. Thus in some of their experiments the reduced axonal damage which is associated with remyelination and an improved clinical score may also be positively influenced by an altered inflammatory milieu. The authors should stain for activated microglia and demonstrate similar T cell counts and/or cytokine expression levels in MOG-EAE mice with and without Clemastine treatment. Also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, an important control is to show the level of immune infiltration in WT and M1RKO and compare it to the conditional M1RKO in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>. If some of that is beyond the scope, the authors must be more cautious in their interpretation and discussion of their results.</p><p>4) In the Abstract and elsewhere states the necessity of &quot;.. uncoupling the immunological response and degenerative processes from possible consequent and even coincident repair…&quot; – it is unclear that these processes have been &quot;uncoupled&quot;, even when using OPC-specific Cre mice. In fact, with the overlap in time between reduced EAE scores and remyelination all processes appear even more interrelated than if remyelination were following several days after EAE peak scores.</p><p>5) The quality of immunohistochemistry for NF and MOG in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-F</xref> is suboptimal and should be replaced or omitted. High resolution and quality images of longitudinal spinal cord section, stained for NF and MOG from clemastine treated mice should be included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The effect of clemastine treatment on overall infiltration of immune cells in the spinal cord could be presented in the same figure.</p><p>6) The authors may include the efficiency of recombination for the NG2-CreErt;Tau-mGFP line and explain why only &quot;mature&quot; oligodendrocyte express Tau (shouldn't also progenitor and pre-myelinating oligodendrocyte express it?). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> does not convey the most important message and it is best if combined with the data currently in supplemental. Quantification of the &quot;tau&quot; positive rings in untreated and clemastine treated mice would provide strong support to the remyelinating effect of the drug.</p><p>7) In the Introduction authors state: &quot;…the precise mechanisms underlying axonal degeneration remains unknown (Bjartmar and Trapp, 2003)&quot;.

Which immune cells express muscarinic receptors? Papers reporting immunosuppressive effects of this drug should be discussed (e.g. Jutel et al., Nature 2001, PMID: 11574888; Johansen et al.

If some of that is beyond the scope, the authors must be more cautious in their interpretation and discussion of their results.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that it is impossible to be completely confident that small molecule therapeutics for remyelination (such as clemastine) will not also affect many other processes. With that said, we have now extensively discussed and referenced this possibility, as well as the potential effects that OPCs may have on the immune response. Additionally, we have now examined T-cell and macrophage infiltration and microglial activation in EAE lesions after clemastine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>) and in the Chrm1 cKO mice (Figure 7—figure supplement 3). We do not find any differences in the number of CD3 or Iba1 positive cells within the lesions after clemastine treatment or in the Chrm1 cKO mice.</p><p>Additionally, to examine the possibility that Chrm1 deletion in cells other than oligodendroglia contributes to the prevention of axon loss, we assessed unmyelinated axons in the spinal cord, which were exposed to a similar inflammatory milieu as the myelinated axons. CGRP positive unmyelinated axons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord were similar in density between the naïve wildtype and Chrm1 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K, L</xref>). When subjected to EAE, the density of CGRP positive fibers was dramatically decreased in both Chrm1 null and wildtype mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K, L</xref>). It is noteworthy that the decrease in the CGRP positive fibers is similar between wildtype and Chrm1 knockout mice, indicating that Chrm1 deletion does not rescue unmyelinated axons from degeneration and is supportive of the possibility that accelerated remyelination protects axons from degeneration after EAE.</p><p><italic>4) In the Abstract and elsewhere states the necessity of &quot;.. uncoupling the immunological response and degenerative processes from possible consequent and even coincident repair…&quot; – it is unclear that these processes have been &quot;uncoupled&quot;, even when using OPC-specific Cre mice. In fact, with the overlap in time between reduced EAE scores and remyelination all processes appear even more interrelated than if remyelination were following several days after EAE peak scores.</italic> </p><p>We agree that all of these processes seem temporally and spatially interrelated—however, the goal of our study was to uncouple these processes mechanistically by taking a genetic approach to manipulate oligodendroglial function without altering inflammation or degeneration. We have now added the statement that remyelination is “coincident” with inflammation and the degenerative process in the abstract and throughout the manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) The quality of immunohistochemistry for NF and MOG in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-F</xref> is suboptimal and should be replaced or omitted. High resolution and quality images of longitudinal spinal cord section, stained for NF and MOG from clemastine treated mice should be included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The effect of clemastine treatment on overall infiltration of immune cells in the spinal cord could be presented in the same figure.</italic> </p><p>We have now replaced the longitudinal immunostaining of NF and MOG in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and replaced it with high-resolution spinal cord cross sections. Additionally, we have also added the quantification of the density of T-cell and macrophage infiltration and microglial activation in EAE lesions after clemastine treatment to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) The authors may include the efficiency of recombination for the NG2-CreErt;Tau-mGFP line and explain why only &quot;mature&quot; oligodendrocyte express Tau (shouldn't also progenitor and pre-myelinating oligodendrocyte express it?). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> does not convey the most important message and it is best if combined with the data currently in supplemental. Quantification of the &quot;tau&quot; positive rings in untreated and clemastine treated mice would provide strong support to the remyelinating effect of the drug.</italic> </p><p>We have now examined the recombination efficiency of the <italic>Cspg4</italic>-CreErt; <italic>Mapt</italic>-mGFP line. As newly formed oligodendrocytes are not generated in high frequency in adult mice, we examined 14-day old mice to determine recombination efficiency by administration of tamoxifen at postnatal day 8 and then examining recombination 6 days later. By examining cortical regions where myelination is sparse at postnatal day 14, we quantified the number of GFP positive, CC1 positive oligodendrocytes and calculated a recombination efficiency of approximately 30% of the total number of oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). It is also important to note that we did not identify GFP positive cells in the cortex that were not CC1 positive, suggesting that GFP expression was specific to oligodendrocytes. Taken together, while this approach will identify newly generated oligodendrocytes and remyelination in EAE, it does not necessarily allow us to identify all of the remyelinated axons. We have now discussed this in detail in the manuscript and added an additional reference for the mouse line that was used to identify newly differentiated oligodendrocytes during development (Etxeberria et al., 2016).</p><p>Quantification of GFP positive myelin was difficult to evaluate, as we did not detect any GFP positive myelin sheaths in the vehicle control group when compared to the clemastine treated mice. We have now discussed this in the last paragraph of the subsection “Small molecule approaches do not definitively demonstrate remyelination in EAE”. Our main point in using this mouse line was an attempt to identify “newly” formed remyelinated axons at the peak of EAE – which we were successful in demonstrating.</p><p><italic>7) In the Introduction authors state: &quot;…the precise mechanisms underlying axonal degeneration remains unknown (Bjartmar and Trapp, 2003)&quot;. This may still be broadly true but several ideas have accumulated over the past decade or so since the publication of this review. They should cite more recent literature on this topic.</italic> </p><p>We have now added additional references (Simons et al., 2014; Singh et al., 2013; Sorbara et al., 2014) in the Introduction concerning degeneration of axons in MS.</p></body></sub-article></article>
