Immune cells called macrophages—which are perhaps best known for their ability to engulf and digest microbes and cell debris—help to control inflammation. In mammals, different types of macrophage exist; the most functionally extreme of which are the M1 macrophages that stimulate inflammation and M2 macrophages that reduce the inflammatory response.</p><p>Macrophages acquire different abilities through a process called polarization, which is controlled by signals produced by a macrophage's environment. Polarization has been well investigated in human and mouse cells grown in the laboratory, but less is understood about how this process occurs in live animals.</p><p>Nguyen Chi, Laplace-Builhe et al. investigated whether zebrafish larvae (which are naturally transparent) could form an experimental model in which to investigate macrophage polarization in living animals. Zebrafish were first genetically engineered to produce two fluorescent proteins: one that marks macrophages and one that marks M1 macrophages. These fluorescent proteins allow the movement and polarization of macrophages to be tracked in real time in living larvae using a technique called confocal microscopy. Nguyen Chi, Laplace-Builhe et al. also isolated macrophage cells from these zebrafish at different times during the inflammatory process to identify which macrophage subtypes form and when.</p><p>The results show that unpolarized macrophages move to the sites of inflammation (caused by wounds or bacterial infection), where they become polarized into M1 cells. Over time, these M1 macrophages progressively convert into an M2-like macrophage subtype, presumably to help clear up the inflammation.</p><p>Furthermore, Nguyen Chi, Laplace-Builhe et al. show that the M1 and M2 macrophage subtypes in zebrafish are similar to those found in mammals. Therefore, genetically engineered zebrafish larvae are likely to prove useful for studying macrophage activity and polarization in living animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07288.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07288.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>live imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002887</institution-id><institution>Conseil Régional Languedoc-Roussillon</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>chercheur avenir 2012-Q-173</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Djouad</surname><given-names>Farida</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-MIDI-009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levraud</surname><given-names>Jean-Pierre</given-names></name><name><surname>Lutfalla</surname><given-names>Georges</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Conseil Régional Languedoc-Roussillon: supported Farida Djouad's work by covering the expenses for reagent, imaging and animal facilities as well as the salary for an engineer.

Currently, it is well established that macrophages are not just important immune effector cells but also cells with critical homeostatic roles, exerting a <italic>myriad</italic> of functions in development, homeostasis, and tissue repair and playing a pivotal role in disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wynn et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, there is a high interest in a better characterization of these cells to establish an early and accurate diagnosis. The wide variety of macrophage functions might be explained by the outstanding plasticity and versatility of macrophages that efficiently respond to environmental challenges and changes in tissue physiology by modifying their phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Mosser and Edwards, 2008</xref>). Although there is a consensus that macrophages are a diversified set of cells, macrophage subtypes are still poorly characterized. Indeed, although these cell populations have been extensively investigated in mouse and human, these studies were mostly performed in vitro using monocyte-derived macrophages induced under specific stimuli. A comprehensive characterization of macrophage subsets that takes into account their specific behaviour, phenotypic diversity, functions, and modulation shall rely on a real-time tracking in the whole organism in response to environmental challenges.</p><p>Mouse and human macrophages have been classified according to their polarization state. In this classification, M1 macrophages, also referred as classically activated macrophages, are pro-inflammatory cells associated with the first phases of inflammation, while M2 macrophages, also known as alternatively activated macrophages, are involved in the resolution of inflammation and tissue remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gordon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biswas and Mantovani, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sica and Mantovani, 2012</xref>). Differential cytokine and chemokine production and receptor expression define the polarization state of macrophages. However, it is worthwhile to note that such binary naming does not fully reflect the diversity of macrophage phenotypes in complex in vivo environments in which several cytokines and growth factors are released and adjust the final differentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chazaud, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Thomas and Mattila, 2014</xref>). Macrophages might adopt <italic>intermediate activation phenotypes</italic> classified by the relative levels of macrophage subset-specific markers. Therefore, macrophage plasticity results in a full spectrum of macrophage subsets with a myriad of functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Mosser and Edwards, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Xue et al., 2014</xref>). Although the possible phenotype conversion of macrophages from M1 to M2 has been suggested in in vitro studies, a recent study argues for the sequential homing of M1 and M2 macrophages to the site of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Stout et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sica and Mantovani, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Shechter et al., 2013</xref>). Such controversies highlight the lack of accurate real-time tracing of macrophage subtypes in vivo in the entire animal.</p><p>Inflammation is a model of choice to study the wide range of macrophage subsets involved from its initiation to its resolution. Therefore, in the present study, we propose to decipher in vivo in real time the kinetic of macrophage subset recruitment, their behaviour and their phenotypic plasticity at the molecular level during a multiple-step inflammatory process. We used the zebrafish larvae model for its easy genetic manipulation, transparency, and availability of fluorescent reporter lines to track macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ellett et al., 2011</xref>). While the existence of macrophage subtypes in zebrafish embryos has been suggested, they have not been fully characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Herbomel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ellett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cambier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Petrie et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we report a new reporter transgene for TNFa, a central inflammatory cytokine and well-established marker of M1 macrophages, instrumental to discriminate macrophage subsets during intravital imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In vivo visualization of macrophage activation and polarization</title><p>Fin wounding-induced inflammation and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> inoculation in zebrafish larvae of 3 dpf are two well-established models triggering macrophage recruitment. Using in situ hybridization, we observed that the expression of the <italic>tumour necrosis factor alpha</italic> (<italic>tnfa</italic>), a consensus marker of M1 macrophages, was induced in cells accumulated in the caudal fin and the muscle following amputation (n<sub>larvae</sub> = 29/33) and <italic>E. coli</italic> inoculation (n<sub>larvae</sub> = 12/12), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>). To study the cells that express the <italic>tnfa</italic> transcripts, we established the <italic>Tg(tnfa:eGFP-F)</italic> transgenic zebrafish line expressing a farnesylated (membrane-bound) eGFP (eGFP-F) under the control of the <italic>tnfa</italic> promoter. While eGFP-F was undetectable in intact fins of <italic>Tg(tnfa:eGFP-F)</italic> larvae (n<sub>larvae</sub> = 10/10), it was expressed in cells recruited to the wound at 6 hr post-amputation (hpA) (n<sub>larvae</sub> = 16/16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). Similarly, eGFP-F expression was upregulated in cells accumulated in the muscle of <italic>Tg(tnfa:eGFP-F)</italic> larvae at 16 hr post-inoculation (hpi) of DsRed-expressing <italic>E. coli</italic> (n<sub>larvae</sub> = 8/8), compared to Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injection (n<sub>larvae</sub> = 3/3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>). Confocal analysis confirmed the presence of a membrane-bound eGFP in cells displaying a typical myeloid morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). To demonstrate that the <italic>Tg(tnfa:eGFP-F)</italic> line recapitulates transcriptional activation of <italic>tnfa</italic>, we performed a simultaneous detection of <italic>tnfa</italic> mRNA by in situ hybridization and GFP-F protein by immunofluorescence in amputated larvae 6 hpA. We observed a consistent overlap between <italic>tnfa</italic> and GFP-F signal in the fin (n<sub>larvae</sub> = 11/11), showing the direct correlation of eGFP-F and <italic>tnfa</italic> transcriptional activation in the fin of the reporter line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). In addition, we FACS-sorted GFP<sup>+</sup> cells from wounded <italic>Tg(TNFa:eGFP-F)</italic> larvae 6 hpA and performed RT-qPCR to analyze <italic>tnfa</italic> expression. We observed a significant increase of <italic>tnfa</italic> mRNA level in eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells as compared to eGFP<sup>−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L,M</xref>). All together these results indicate that the <italic>Tg(TNFa:eGFP-F)</italic> reporter line recapitulates transcriptional activation of <italic>tnfa</italic>. Then, with the ability to specifically track <italic>tnfa</italic>-expressing cells, we used <italic>Tg(tnfa:eGFP-F)</italic> fish to study macrophage activation by mating them with <italic>Tg(mpeg1:mCherryF)</italic> fish in which macrophages express farnesylated mCherry (mCherryF) under the control of the macrophage-specific <italic>mpeg1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ellett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Nguyen-Chi et al., 2014</xref>). In intact <italic>Tg(tnfa:eGFP-F/mpeg1:mCherryF)</italic> larvae, no eGFP-F was observed in macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We imaged double transgenic larvae <italic>Tg(tnfa:eGFP-F/mpeg1:mCherryF)</italic> using 4D confocal microscopy from 45 min post-amputation and found that macrophages were recruited to the wound from 1 hpA, some starting to express eGFP from 3 hpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). From 5 hpA already activated macrophages, that is, expressing <italic>tnfa</italic> arrived at the wound (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Similarly, infection with a crimson-expressing <italic>E. coli</italic> in the muscle induced the expression of <italic>tnfa</italic> in phagocytes few hours following the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Imaging of the double transgenic larvae <italic>Tg(tnfa:eGFP-F/mpeg1:mCherryF)</italic> showed that <italic>tnfa</italic>-expressing phagocytes were mainly macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). These results show the dynamic macrophage activation in real-time in vivo including recruitment and rapid phenotypic change.

In mammals, M1 and M2 macrophages are reported to be involved, respectively, in the initial phase of inflammation and in the resolution phase. Cell sorting was thus performed at 6 hpA and 26 hpA following caudal fin amputation since the kinetic analysis of macrophage subset activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) suggested that these two time points correspond to initiation and resolution of inflammation, respectively. As expected, high levels of <italic>mpeg1</italic> expression was observed in the mCh<sup>+</sup> and dbl<sup>+</sup> sorted cells at 6 and 26 hpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and high levels of <italic>tnfa</italic> expression was detected in double-positive populations at 6 hpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Importantly, based on the stability of the eGFP in <italic>Tg(tnfa:eGFP-F/mpeg1:mCherryF)</italic> larvae allowing us to specifically track the behaviour and fate of pro-inflammatory macrophages, we found that the dbl<sup>+</sup> pro-inflammatory macrophages changed their phenotype at 26 hpA. Indeed, dbl<sup>+</sup> macrophages negative for M2 markers at 6 hpA, displayed at 26 hpA, in parallel to a significant decrease of <italic>tnfa, il1b</italic>, <italic>and il6</italic> expression level, a significant increased expression level of <italic>ccr2</italic> and <italic>cxcr4b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,H</xref>). Of note, a tendency toward differential expression level was observed for <italic>tnfb</italic> and <italic>tgfb1</italic> between 6 and 26 hpA. To go further and demonstrate that the same macrophages are present at the wound site during inflammation and its resolution, we generated the <italic>Tg(mpeg1:GAL4/UAS:Kaede)</italic> larvae to track macrophages exploiting the conversion of the native green fluorescence of Kaede into red fluorescence under UV light. Recruited macrophages were photoconverted 6 hpA and imaged at 26 hpA revealing that early recruited macrophages were still present at the wound area 20 hr later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Then, GFP<sup>+</sup> macrophages were specifically tracked using time-lapse imaging of wounded <italic>Tg(mpeg1:mCherryF/TNFa:GFP-F)</italic> fins from 6 to 26 hpA. We show that initially recruited eGFP<sup>+</sup> macrophages remain at the injury site and still express the GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>).

All together these data show that pro-inflammatory macrophages underwent a phenotypic conversion toward an intermediate phenotype in which both M1 and M2 markers are expressed. In addition, this molecular characterization of macrophages in zebrafish reveals the conservation of macrophage subtypes between zebrafish and human.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07288.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>M1-like macrophages convert their phenotype toward M2-like phenotype in the wounded fin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram showing the site where caudal fin was transected (dotted red line) in 3 dpf <italic>Tg(mpeg1:mCherryF/tnfa:eGFP-F)</italic> larvae.

Live imaging of transparent transgenic zebrafish larvae allowed the first real-time visualization of macrophage activation and polarization. In parallel, a molecular analysis of macrophage sub-populations highlights the evolutionary conservation of macrophages from fish to mammals. We propose that in response to wounding zebrafish, unpolarized macrophages are recruited to the inflammation site and adopt a M1-like phenotype. Subsequently, they progressively convert their functional phenotype from M1-like to M2-like in response to progressive inflammatory microenvironment changes within the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Live imaging of the new transgenic line we generated opens new avenues to study in real time in live vertebrates the full spectrum of macrophage activation, polarization, and functions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal experiments described in the present study were conducted at the University of Montpellier according to European Union guidelines for handling of laboratory animals (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/home_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/home_en.htm</ext-link>) and were approved by the Direction Sanitaire et Vétérinaire de l'Hérault and Comité d'Ethique pour l'Expérimentation Animale under reference CEEA-LR-13007.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Zebrafish line and maintenance</title><p>Fish and embryo maintenance, staging, and husbandry were as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Nguyen-Chi et al., 2014</xref>).

The resulting fragment was phosphorylated using T4PNK, digested by NotI and cloned in a farnesylated eGFP (eGFP-F) derivative of pBSKI2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Thermes et al., 2002</xref>). The resulting plasmid (pI2promTNFa:eGFP-F) harbours a 3.8-kb fragment of the zebrafish <italic>tnfa</italic> promoter, including part of the first coding exon. It uses the endogenous ATG codon of <italic>tnfa</italic> to drive the translation of eGFP-F. The expressed eGFP-F harbours the first 7 amino acids of zebrafish TNFa at its N-terminus (MKLESRA). The expression cassette is flanked by two I-SceI sites. pI2promTNFa:eGFP-F was co-injected in fertilized eggs with the enzyme I-SceI (New England Biolabs, France). Developing embryos were injected with non-pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> at 3 dpf (days post-fertilization), and those that developed a specific green fluorescence were raised as putative founders. The offspring of putative founders was tested the same way in order to establish the stable transgenic line.

As suggested by the reviewers, we generated the <italic>Tg(mpeg1:GAL4 /UAS:Kaede)</italic> larvae to track Kaede<sup>+</sup> macrophages from 6hpA to 26 hpA. Photoconversion of macrophages recruited at the wound 6hpA demonstrates that most of macrophages stays at the wounded fin 20 hours later. We show that the same macrophages are present at the wound site during inflammation and its resolution suggesting that the same cell might adopt different phenotypes and functions. This result is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>. To directly demonstrate that M1-like GFP<sup>+</sup> macrophages recruited at 6 hpA are still present in situ 26 hpA, we have carefully tracked them using time lapse imaging of wounded <italic>Tg(mpeg1:mCherryF /TNFa:GFP-F)</italic> fins from 6 to 26 hpA, as proposed by the reviewers. Our data demonstrate that initially recruited GFP<sup>+</sup> macrophages remain at the injury site and still express the GFP. Moreover, we carefully observed macrophage behavior over time post-amputation. Among GFP<sup>+</sup> macrophages displaying an amyboid phenotype at the wound site 6 hpA, 50% change toward a fibroblastic phenotype from 11 hpA when found at distance of the wound area. These data are described in the paragraph “Molecular signature of <italic>tnfa</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> and <italic>tnfa</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup> macrophage populations<italic>”</italic> and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-C</xref> and Movie 5. Also, note additional Methods. All together these results show that M1-like GFP<sup>+</sup> macrophages expressing high levels of <italic>tnfa</italic> first accumulate at the wound 6hpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and then convert toward a M2-like GFP<sup>+</sup> macrophage phenotype in situ 26hpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-H</xref>).</p><p><italic>2)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>does not conclusively demonstrate that the</italic> tnfa:eGFP-F <italic>line recapitulates transcriptional activation of</italic> tnfa<italic>, which is critical to interpret all following results using this line.

The related text is in the subsection “In vivo visualisation of macrophage activation and polarization”.

We therefore focused on GFP<sup>+</sup> cells without taking into account the mpeg1<sup>+</sup> cells since in agreement with the reviewers we believe that it makes more sense to include this data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. We FACS-sorted GFP<sup>+</sup> cells from wounded <italic>Tg(TNFa:eGFP-F)</italic> 6 hpA and performed qPCR analysis for <italic>tnfa</italic> expression, as recommended by the reviewers. We observed a significant increase (43 fold) of <italic>tnfa</italic> mRNA level in GFP<sup>+</sup> cells as compared to GFP<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L-M</xref>). Thanks to reviewer requests, we can claim that the <italic>Tg(TNFa:eGFP-F)</italic> reporter line recapitulates transcriptional activation of <italic>tnfa</italic>.

As mCherry-F and GFP-F are two different proteins, we are not expecting a complete overlapping of their fluorescence in the macrophage. Although they are both mainly targeted to the membrane, they only partially colocalise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1 A and B</xref>). Furthermore, we observed accumulation of mCherry-F in structures inside the macrophage while GFP-F does not. Several factors can explain these differences: 1/ they are not expressed at the same level and 2/ their trafficking toward the membrane may occur differently (mCherry-F may be trapped on its way to the membrane). Membrane targeted mCherry pattern is in sharp contrast with that of the NTR fused with an unmodified form of mCherry. When specifically expressed in macrophages NTR-mCherry is localised in the cytoplasm and is outlined by the GFP-F fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1 C and D</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07288.017</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>GFP-F is expressed in macrophages in <italic>Tg(tnfa:eGFP-F)</italic>.</title><p>(A) eGFP-F (Green) and mCherry-F (red) fluorescences were analyzed by confocal microscopy amputated <italic>Tg(mpeg1:mCherryF/tnfa:eGFP-F)</italic> fins at 18 hpA.
