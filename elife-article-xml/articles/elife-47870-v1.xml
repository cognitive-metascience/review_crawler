Nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been implicated in motivated behavior, but it remains unclear whether motivational drive is linked to discrete neurobiological mechanisms within the NAc. To examine this, we profiled cohorts of Sprague-Dawley rats in a test of motivation to consume sucrose. We found that substantial variability in willingness to exert effort for reward was not associated with operant responding under low-effort conditions or stress levels. Instead, effort-based motivation was mirrored by a divergent NAc shell transcriptome with differential regulation at potassium and dopamine signaling genes. Functionally, motivation was inversely related to excitability of NAc principal neurons. Furthermore, neuronal and behavioral outputs associated with low motivation were linked to faster inactivation of a voltage-gated potassium channel, K<sub>v</sub>1.4. These results raise the prospect of targeting K<sub>v</sub>1.4 gating in psychiatric conditions associated with motivational dysfunction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>motivation</kwd><kwd>nucleus accumbens</kwd><kwd>potassium</kwd><kwd>kv 1.4</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>patch-clamp</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA031747</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ortinski</surname><given-names>Pavel I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA041513</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ortinski</surname><given-names>Pavel I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA032681</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>Jill R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA044311</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>Jill R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA016176</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cole</surname><given-names>Robert D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Low effort-based motivation to pursue naturally rewarding stimuli can be increased pharmacologically, by targeting inactivation of a single voltage-gated potassium channel within the mesolimbic dopamine reward system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dysregulated motivation to pursue previously rewarding stimuli is a feature of multiple psychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, and withdrawal from substance use. Indeed, response to positive motivational situations has been proposed as one of only five behavioral dimensions that link the entire range of psychiatric diagnoses with underlying neurobiological mechanisms (RDoC framework; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuthbert, 2015</xref>). Daily fluctuations in motivation for reward is a regular and familiar feature of human experience. However, chronically and persistently low motivation is associated with vulnerability to mental illness, including substance use disordersÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carroll et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janowsky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Radke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brennan et al., 2001</xref>). Despite progress in understanding the neurobiology of reward over the last two decades, it remains unclear whether neuronal activity underlying persistent differences in motivation is functionally distinct from a broader spectrum of signaling events mediating reward processing.</p><p>The mesolimbic reward circuit is central to the processing of rewarding environmental stimuli. At the center of this circuit is the nucleus accumbens which integrates affective, spatial, and cognitive signals with approach to reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mogenson et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di Chiara, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Di Chiara et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wise, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saddoris et al., 2015</xref>). The principal cells of the nucleus accumbens, striatal projection neurons (SPNs), regulate their firing patterns in a manner that predicts locomotion toward rewards as well as reward omission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Peoples and West, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicola et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Roitman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wan and Peoples, 2006</xref>). Action potential output of SPNs is modulated by dopamine, a molecule consistently implicated in behavioral response to motivationally salient stimuli, including action-outcome associations as well as reward avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akaike et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nicola et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ji and Martin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ortinski et al., 2015</xref>). Dopamine modulates firing of SPNs in the nucleus accumbens via intracellular messengers coupled to the associated G-protein signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">ValdÃ©s-Baizabal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cantrell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schiffmann et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bender et al., 2010</xref>). Among the prominent dopamine targets are the voltage-gated potassium channels, canonical regulators of action potential output.</p><p>Voltage-gated potassium channels comprise the most diverse family of ion channels with over a hundred genes coding for potassium channel subunits in addition to multiple channel regulators. These channels are notably capable of suppressing, facilitating, and shaping action potentials and rhythmic activity throughout the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ji and Martin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jan and Jan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kimm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnston et al., 2010</xref>). For example, in principal neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, activation of K<sub>v</sub>1 channels increases firing threshold and inhibits firing, while activation of K<sub>v</sub>3 channels accelerates action potential repolarization and promotes high firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnston et al., 2010</xref>). In midbrain dopaminergic neurons, inhibition of K<sub>v</sub>2 channels increases action potential firing and decreases afterhyperpolarization (AHP), while activation of the large conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (BK) channel decreases AHP, but has no effect on action potential firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kimm et al., 2015</xref>). In the striatum, dopamine depletion increases SPN intrinsic excitability and decreases AHP by accelerating the inactivation of the A-type (I<sub>A</sub>) K<sup>+</sup> current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azdad et al., 2009</xref>). The kinetic properties of potassium channel gating have been a subject of intense interest over many decades as the timing of channel activation and inactivation affects potassium channel interactions with other ionic conductances to determine membrane excitability and action potential generation.</p><p>Recent evidence suggests a prominent role for K<sup>+</sup> channels in reward and motivated behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gelernter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cadet et al., 2017</xref>). For example, severalÂ studies indicate that G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK) channels regulate neuronal firing and behavioral response to addictive drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCall et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rifkin et al., 2017</xref>). In the NAc, where GIRK expression is very low or absent, chronic cocaine treatment has been shown to increase I<sub>A</sub> and BK channel currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hu et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, decreased activation of small-conductance calcium-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels in the NAc core has been reported to increase spike output and facilitate motivation to seek alcohol after abstinence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hopf et al., 2010</xref>), while microinjection of a K<sub>v</sub>7 agonist into the nucleus accumbens core has been found to reduce alcohol seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McGuier et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, a genome-wide analysis found rats that compulsively self-administer methamphetamine despite negative consequences (foot shocks) are segregated from non-compulsive methamphetamine takers by both differential RNA expression and DNA hydroxymethylation at a number of genes encoding voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cadet et al., 2017</xref>). Despite this substantial body of evidence that K<sub>v</sub> channels play a role in individual responding for drug reward, it remains unclear whether K<sub>v</sub>-regulation of neuronal excitability may account for variability in responding to naturally reinforcing stimuli.</p><p>In this study, we test the hypothesis that individual heterogeneity in effort-based motivation is linked to altered intrinsic excitability of nucleus accumbens shell SPNs. We find that the spectrum of behavioral performance on a classical test of effort-based motivation is mirrored by genome-wide transcriptional differences with a major contribution of voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels and dopamine related transcripts. Our electrophysiological analyses provide evidence for a specific voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel subtype, K<sub>v</sub>1.4, as a channel species with potential to specifically target the low motivation phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Individual differences in motivation for sucrose reward</title><p>We began by establishing a behavioral profile of motivation for sucrose reward using a PR schedule of reinforcement in seven cohorts totaling 111 rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). This revealed dramatic variability in PR breakpoints.

We then looked at currents mediated by the large-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated potassium (BK) channels since they have been shown to interact with I<sub>A</sub> to influence both afterhyperpolarization and neuronal firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kimm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Storm, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang and McBain, 1995</xref>).

Overall, our results suggest that a low motivation phenotype is linked to increased spiking of NAc principal neurons.

The reason for the latter finding is unclear, but it was strongly driven by a single rat robustly responding at baseline (15 inactive lever presses), but not after UK-78,282 treatment (one inactive lever press). Exclusion of this animal did not meaningfully affect highS breakpoint values, number of active lever presses, or pellets earned. Overall, these data show that an antagonist of K<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels elevates willingness to exert effort for reward selectively in rats displaying lower motivation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47870.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Selective effect of K<sub>v</sub>1.4 antagonism on PR performance in lowS animals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In lowS animals (NÂ =Â 6), microinjection of UK-78,282 into the NAc shell dose-dependently increased: i) breakpoints, ii) active lever presses and iii) pellets earned, but not iv) inactive lever presses.

Faster K<sub>v</sub>1.4 inactivation accelerates action potential output of NAc SPNs, despite an apparent lack of changes in the number of functional K<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels. Suppression of K<sub>v</sub>1.4 activity by UK-78,282 selectively decreases SPN spiking and facilitates motivated behavior in subjects with a lower baseline motivation for reward.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Selective effect of UK-78,282 on lowS K<sub>v</sub>1.4</title><p>The lowS, but not the highS, phenotype that we describe was sensitive to the microinfusion of 100 nM concentration of UK-78,282 into the NAc. At this concentration, UK-78,282 is expected to be highly specific for K<sub>v</sub>1.4. The target with the next nearest affinity, K<sub>v</sub>1.3 channel, is blocked by UK-78,282 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 280 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanson et al., 1999</xref>) and is not expressed in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kues and Wunder, 1992</xref>). We were initially puzzled by the discordant electrophysiological findings with UK-78,282. The compound selectively suppressed action potential firing in the lowS group, but was equally efficacious at blocking the peak of A-type currents in both lowS and highS animals. Our observation that faster inactivation of A-type currents is also uniquely sensitive to UK-78,282 in the lowS group provided clues as to the potential mechanisms involved. For example, inactivation of K<sub>v</sub>1.4 is regulated by phosphorylation via the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) that prolongs inactivation time course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roeper et al., 1997</xref>). We detected no significant differences in expression of any of the four major CaMKII isoform genes (<italic>Camk2a</italic>, <italic>Camk2b</italic>, <italic>Camk2d</italic>, and <italic>Camk2g</italic>) in the RNA sequencing data. However, a number of reports indicate that D2 dopamine receptors stimulate CaMKII activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Takeuchi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shioda and Fukunaga, 2017</xref>). If this mechanism were to be involved, then decreased D2 receptor stimulation would lead to decreased CaMKII activity and faster A-type current inactivation. Further, activity of CaMKII is sensitive to the inhibitor proteins encoded by the <italic>Camk2n1</italic> and <italic>Camk2n2</italic> genes. Increased expression of these genes in the lowS animals would promote faster inactivation. Consistent with this, our sequencing data show significant downregulation of Drd2 and upregulation of <italic>Camk2n2</italic> (but not <italic>Camk2n1</italic>), transcripts in the lowS, relative to the highS, NAc tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3âsource data 1</xref>).</p><p>Differential assembly of the K<sub>v</sub>1 channel tetramer may also play a role in regulating K<sub>V</sub>1.4 signaling. For example, hetero-tetrameric assembly of K<sub>v</sub>1.4 with the delayed rectifier subunits, K<sub>v</sub>1.1 or K<sub>v</sub>1.2, leads to slower inactivation relative to the K<sub>v</sub>1.4 homomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Po et al., 1993</xref>). K<sub>v</sub>1.1 and K<sub>v</sub>1.2, encoded by <italic>Kcna1</italic> and <italic>Kcna2</italic> genes, are both expressed in the rat striatum, albeit at lower levels than K<sub>v</sub>1.4 (<italic>62</italic>). Neither <italic>Kcna1</italic> nor <italic>Kcna2</italic> were differentially expressed in the lowS vs highS sequencing data. However, expression of the regulatory subunit K<sub>v</sub>Î²1 (<italic>Kcnab</italic>1 gene) that promotes cell surface expression of K<sub>v</sub>1.x heterotetrameric complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Manganas and Trimmer, 2000</xref>) was markedly lower in the NAc of lowS animals. Lower expression of K<sub>v</sub>Î²1 is expected to decrease availability of K<sub>v</sub>1.x hetero-tetramers and contribute to faster K<sub>v</sub>1.4 channel inactivation reported here.</p><p>Both behavioral and electrophysiological effects of UK-78,282 in midS animals were aligned closely with effects observed in the highS group. It is intriguing that with regard to possible regulators of K<sub>v</sub>1.4 function discussed above, RNA sequencing data from midS animals indicated significantly lower levels of <italic>Kcna1</italic> and <italic>Kcnab2</italic> transcripts expected to lead to faster inactivation, but decreased <italic>Camk2n1</italic> (no change in <italic>Camk2n2</italic>) levels expected to lead to slower inactivation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3âsource data 1</xref>). Electrophysiological data indicated that I<sub>A</sub> decay time in midS animals at baseline was intermediate to that of lowS and highS groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2C</xref>), however midS animals were insensitive to UK-78,282 at both the I<sub>A</sub> kinetics and behavioral levels. These findings highlight remarkable flexibility and multiple redundancies that can impact activity of a single channel with possible behavioral consequences. Other possibilities for regulation of K<sub>v</sub>1.4 inactivation include interactions with intracellular heme, intracellular pH, protein phosphatases, and membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roeper et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sahoo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Padanilam et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oliver et al., 2004</xref>). Direct examination of each of these mechanisms is outside the scope of this work. We can conclude, however, that unique sensitivity of lowS NAc neurons to UK-78,282 is likely conferred by differential interaction of K<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels with binding partners or phosphorylation mechanisms rather than functional availability of K<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels on the cell surface.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>K<sub>v</sub>1.4 regulation of neuron firing</title><p>Application of UK-78,282 suppressed peak I<sub>A</sub> amplitude in both lowS and highS animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). However, there was a difference in voltage-dependence of the enhancement. In the lowS animals, our results indicate equal availability of K<sub>v</sub>1.4 across potentials, including in the zone subthreshold to action potential firing. In the highS animals, K<sub>v</sub>1.4 availability is greater at suprathreshold potentials. It is not clear what contributes to this difference. The voltage-dependence of activation kinetics of K<sub>v</sub>1 family members has been shown to shift in the depolarizing direction by assembly with K<sub>v</sub>1.2 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baronas et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, K<sub>v</sub>1.2 has been shown to enhance activation of K<sub>v</sub>1.4/1.2 heterotetramers following depolarizing pre-pulses, a phenomenon termed use-dependent activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baronas et al., 2015</xref>). Such use-dependence may play a role in suppressing action potentials during spike trains and contribute to lower action potential spike frequency observed in highS animals. Slower inactivation of I<sub>A</sub> in highS animals, discussed above, will also tend to suppress action potential output.</p><p>The effect of constitutive K<sub>v</sub>1.4 deletion on action potentials has been examined in two previous studies. The first one of these found that cortical pyramidal neurons of K<sub>v</sub>1.4<sup>-/-</sup> mice have shorter action potential width, but similar resting membrane potential, input resistance and rheobase relative to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carrasquillo et al., 2012</xref>). Blockade of K<sub>v</sub>4 channels in this study, however, unmasked differences across a broader range of membrane properties, indicating involvement of K<sub>v</sub>4-mediated compensatory mechanisms. The second report, found increased firing of suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons using the same line of knock-out mice, but did not evaluate other measures of membrane excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Granados-Fuentes et al., 2012</xref>). In a study of NAc neurons, suppression of A-type currents by dopamine was also linked to increased firing, although contribution of K<sub>v</sub>1.4 to these currents was not specifically examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hopf et al., 2003</xref>). Increased action potential frequency in K<sub>v</sub>1.4<sup>-/-</sup> mice is consistent with our recordings from SPNs of the NAc in lowS animals, given the RNA sequencing data that indicates decreased levels of <italic>Kcna4</italic> transcript in this group. However, we find no differences in action potential width between lowS (1Â Â±Â 0.04 ms) and highS (0.99Â Â±Â 0.07 ms) groups. Indeed, we observe that lowS and highS groups are similar across a broad spectrum of action potential and intrinsic excitability measures both in the absence and in the presence of UK-78,282 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, these observations argue for brain-region specific impact of K<sub>v</sub>1.4 on neuronal output that is additionally guided by interactions with other channels or modulatory mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Spike frequency and motivation for reward</title><p>The relationship between NAc spiking and reward seeking has been a subject of intense interest for decades. There is general support from behavioral pharmacology studies that inhibition of NAc shell promotes seeking of natural reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basso and Kelley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reynolds and Berridge, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kelley and Swanson, 1997</xref>). There are also strong indications that NAc firing may be modulated by reward-associated cues. For example, reward consumption has been shown to inhibit firing of NAc shell neurons in vivo, but only in the presence of cues predicting reward, whereas sustained increase in NAc firing has been proposed to inhibit operant responding for natural reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicola et al., 2004a</xref>). Multiple other behavioral cues regulate NAc firing in vivo, including timing of reward delivery, magnitude of reward, and reward identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicola et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nicola et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Taha et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krause et al., 2010</xref>). Our data are unique in that we report SPNs from animals less motivated to pursue reward to be biased toward higher firing in the slice, in the absence of external behavioral cues.</p><p>An obvious suspect for differences in spike output in our lowS and highS datasets is relative abundance of D1-expresing and D2-expressing neurons. D1- and D2-expressing SPNs display distinct electrophysiological properties with D2 neurons showing greater excitability and lower threshold for action potential firing than D1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cepeda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gertler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ade et al., 2008</xref>). Meanwhile, behavioral data provides mixed clues with some evidence supporting D1 SPNs as mediators of positive aspects of reward, and D2 SPNs as mediators of behavioral aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kravitz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hikida et al., 2010</xref>), while others report that signaling at both D1 and D2 SPNs enhances motivation for natural rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Soares-Cunha et al., 2016</xref>). Relative contribution of D1- and D2- SPNs to our data is not known and we have not directly addressed this question. However, several considerations argue against biased sampling, including random selection of SPNs from the pool of visually identified neurons and similar input resistance and rheobase values, hallmarks of D1 or D2 identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gertler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Janssen et al., 2009</xref>), between groups. RNA sequencing results indicated reduced expression of both D1 dopamine receptor and D2 dopamine receptor encoding genes in lowS relative to highS animals, rather than a selective reduction of one receptor population. If maintained at the protein level, this reduction highlights additional possibilities for regulation of neuronal output as a function of effort-based motivation.</p><p>Effort-based motivation for natural reward is unlikely to depend on a uniformly sustained increase or decrease in firing across all NAc shell SPNs. During a progressive ratio task for a cocaine reinforcer, a transient increase in NAc firing in vivo has been proposed to serve as a behavioral breakpoint signal, potentially driven by cocaine-induced increases in dopamine levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nicola and Deadwyler, 2000</xref>). However, behavioral output during progressive ratio for cocaine involved some neurons that are excited and others that are inhibited throughout the different phases of a behavioral task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nicola and Deadwyler, 2000</xref>). Indeed, responses combining both excitation and inhibition have been observed in the NAc across many reward-seeking behaviors examined with in vivo electrophysiology. It is possible that such dynamic responses are guided by interactions with a distinct pattern of inputs to or outputs from the NAc and our experiments do not address this contingency. Our data do support the idea that any behavior encoded by NAc shell output will be biased by greater intrinsic likelihood of generating such output by SPNs in lowS, relative to highS, animals.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we describe a set of neuronal and genetic features associated with motivation to exert effort for natural reward. Lower motivation is linked to a divergent transcriptome profile, and increased SPN output in the NAc shell. Increased SPN output depends on faster inactivation kinetics of K<sub>v</sub>1.4 and blockade of K<sub>v</sub>1.4 activity selectively increases effort for natural reward in animals displaying low motivation. These results point to modulators of K<sub>v</sub>1.4 gating as potential targets in a broad spectrum of psychiatric disorders associated with deficits in motivation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus), weighing between 250â300 grams (Taconic Laboratories, Germantown, NY, USA) were individually housed in a colony room, rats were food restricted (20 g normal chow per day) with <italic>ad libitum</italic> water access and were maintained on a 12 hr/12 hr light/dark cycle, with lights on at 0700 hr.

During the first session, animals received a bilateral infusion of either UK-78,282 (1 nM) or UK-78,282 (100 nM) into the NAc shell through microinjectors extending 2 mm below tips of the guide cannulas. Microinfusions were at 0.5 Î¼l/side over 2 min plus one minute of passive diffusion away from cannula tips. The criterion performance on the PR schedule was then re-established over consecutive daily sessions. After that, the animals underwent a second test session during which they received microinjection of a different UK-78,282 concentration. Microinjections of the two UK-78,282 concentrations were counterbalanced between animals and no animal received more than two microinjections. Cannula placements were confirmed histologically by cresyl violet staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed with Excel 2016 (Microsoft) or GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad software). For behavioral and electrophysiological experiments, Students t-tests, one-way ANOVAs, or two-way repeated measures ANOVAs followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests were performed as indicated in the text. Sample sizes were determined using G power 3.1.9.4 (effect sizeÂ =Â 0.5, alphaÂ =Â 0.05, powerÂ =Â 0.8). Throughout the manuscript, cell numbers are designated ânâ, while animal numbers are designated âNâ. Data were reported as meanÂ Â±Â standard error of the mean and statistical significance thresholds were set at p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: âKauÃª Machado Costa (Reviewer #2); Alexxai Kravitz (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers found that the study used a strong, multifaceted approach to reveal genetic and physiological underpinnings of population variance in effort-based motivation. The main findings are:</p><p>1) There is substantial variability in effort-based motivation.</p><p>2) Those with high v. low effort-based motivation have a different transcriptional profile in the NAc shell, including differential expression of 4 genes related to dopamine signaling and 6 related to K<sup>+</sup> channels.</p><p>3) Those with low v. high effort-based motivation show lower electrically-evoked phasic dopamine release in the NAc shell.</p><p>4) NAc shell medium spiny neurons from low motivation rats were more excitable, with smaller AHPs and faster IA inactivation. This was linked to changes in K<sub>v</sub>1.4, a transcript downregulated in low motivation rats.</p><p>5) Inactivation of K<sub>v</sub>1.4 in the NAc shell increased motivation selectively in low motivation rats.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The sucrose preference test data are underpowered and, moreover, these data do not reflect the hedonic experience of the pellets earned during the progressive ratio task. For that reason, the reviewers suggested removing these data. All reviewers agreed that these data were not critical, and were even tangential to the main point of this study. If they are to be kept in, power should be added and their interpretation shifted to avoid the implication that these data speak to the hedonic experience of the reward in the PR task.</p><p>2) The experiments assessing the effects of UK-78,282 on IA inactivation (Figure 6E) are also underpowered. Because this is such a vital component of the study, the reviewers would like to see the N for both highS and lowS subjects increased.</p><p>3) Reviewers were also concerned with the power in the FSCV and FSCAV experiments. For the FSCAV data this was especially a problem with the marginal and thus unclear effect. They agreed that these experiments are also not critical to the conclusions drawn here and can be removed. If you choose to keep them in, power should be added so both the evoked FSCV and tonic FSCAV results are more convincing.</p><p>4) The reviewers agreed that is not possible to adequately differentiate D1 and D2 MSNs by electrophysiological criteria alone. Thus, the claims in the Discussion, which were not supported with data, of no correlation between putative D1 or D2 identity and electrophysiological responses should be removed and instead the Discussion should make clear to the reader that this remains an open question.</p><p>5) Because motivation in the PR task is interpreted as a stable trait-like feature, the reviewers agreed that it would be helpful provide data on the stability of PR performance across days.</p><p>6) Please clarify how lowS, midS, and highS groups were defined for individual experiments and report the behavioral data for each smaller cohort.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The data in this report demonstrate substantial variability in motivation to exert effort in a progressive ratio task for food reward. Taking the top and bottom quartile of the subjects, the authors found that those subjects with low PR performance showed a different NAc shell transcriptional profile than those with high performance, had lower phasic dopamine released evoked by electrical stimulation, and higher MSN excitability. The latter was linked to K<sub>v</sub>1.4 function and K<sub>v</sub>1.4 blockade was found to increase motivation in low PR subjects. The multifaceted approach here is a strength. There are a lot of data here that will be of interest to many researchers to follow up on. The findings are novel and exciting, demonstrating a new potential mechanism of effort-related motivation and therapeutic target. My concerns are noted below.</p><p>1) There is substantial variability in PR performance, leading to categorization of low, and high S groups for subsequent experiments, which seems reasonable. But it is not clear within these smaller cohorts used for the RNA-seq, FSCV, physiology, and infusion experiments how low, mid, and high were defined. Was this top and bottom 25% within each smaller cohort, or within the larger group? This should be made clear and the behavioral data for each smaller cohort should be shown, perhaps in a supplementary figure.</p><p>2) Because motivation in the PR task is interpreted as a stable trait-like feature, it would be helpful to show that it was consistent within subject across days.</p><p>3) To say that K<sub>v</sub>1.4 blockade 'rescues' a deficit in lowS animals is a bit of an overstatement, because even with the blockade breakpoint, presses, and earned pellets remain lower in the lowS than the midS group. To make this clear, the midS data should be included in the main Figure 7. Moreover, to make an interpretation that K<sub>v</sub>1.4 blockade had an effect in one group but not another, the data should be analyzed together in a 2 way ANOVA with variables group (low, mid, high S) and drug dose. A significant interaction would justify the individual group ANOVAs evaluating dose within each group.</p><p>4) The FSCV methods are not adequately described. The frequency of MFB electrical stimulation needs to be provided. There should be some description of how electrode placements were optimized. The FSCAV methods are not provided. Details on how the FSCV data were analyzed, including how the max was determined, how the half-life was calculated, and how transient events were defined and calculated, need to be provided.</p><p>5) The 'hedonic preference' findings lead to the, perhaps unintended, implication that PR performance and reward hedonic experience are not related. But sucrose preference in this two bottle test is not reflective of the hedonic preference of the pellets earned in the PR task and so this interpretation could be somewhat misleading. I suggest referring to this as sucrose preference, as is more common, and walking back conclusions that PR and hedonia were unrelated.</p><p>6) The N for the FSCV data are somewhat low in the lowS group (N=5), which becomes a problem for the marginal tonic DA effect. I'm concerned the data are not sufficiently powered to detect an effect. If these data are going to be shown, power should be added or a power analysis provided to indicate these experiments were sufficiently powered.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In their study, O'Donovan et al. set out to identify potential genetic and physiological underpinnings of population variance in effort-based motivation. They use PR breakpoints as an index for this behavioral variable in a naÃ¯ve cohort of Sprague-Dawley rats, focusing on differences between animals at the top (highS) and bottom (lowS) quartiles of the PR breakpoint distribution. First, they showed that these groups were similar in their FR responses, sucrose preference (but see comment below) and stress hormone levels. Authors performed a genome-wide RNA sequencing of tissue samples from the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of these groups as a broad-scope strategy for identifying differentially expressed transcripts. Out of the 164 identified genes differentially expressed in low- versus high-motivation rats, the authors found four genes related to dopamine signaling and six related to K<sup>+</sup> channels. Using in vivo FSCV, they show that lowS rats have lower evoked dopamine transients in the NAc shell. Furthermore, striatal projection neurons (SPNs) from lowS rats were more excitable, with smaller AHPs and faster IA inactivation. They pharmacologically demonstrate that this phenotype is linked to changes in K<sub>v</sub>1.4 (KCNA4), which was identified as a downregulated transcript in their RNA screening. The changes in K<sub>v</sub>1.4 currents seen in lowS versus highS animals were not simply related to current amplitude, as would perhaps have been expected based on the RNA screening alone, but involved a specific acceleration of IA inactivation that was selectively impacted by blockade with UK-78,282. The authors speculate on the potential mechanism underlying this finding but chose not to explore it within this study. Finally, they pharmacologically inactivate K<sub>v</sub>1.4 within the NAc shell in vivo, resulting in a dose-dependent increase in motivation selectively for the lowS rats, establishing a causal link between gene expression variability, K<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels, SPN excitability in the NAc shell and behavioral motivation.</p><p>Overall, the study is very interesting, well conducted and of high relevance. The approach used to isolate potential underpinnings for behavioral variability is at the forefront of the field. The core of the presented data is quite adequate, and the findings are truly exciting. However, a few key issues need to be addressed.</p><p>One major concern is that the sucrose preference test is woefully underpowered. It seems as if only 3 highS and 3 or 4 lowS rats were included in this test, and there is a clear trend towards the lowS animals having a higher sucrose preference. This is particularly important given the role of specific subregions of the NAc shell in mediating hedonic preference vs. incentive salience (as established in the work of Kent Berridge and others). The authors unfortunately would need to repeat this test, specifically with more highS and lowS rats, in order to have a conclusive result and rule out potential differences in sucrose preference.</p><p>The authors also claim to have clustered their recorded cells into putative D1- and D2-expressing SPNs based on their electrophysiological properties and saw no difference in &quot;electrophysiological responses at baseline, or following drug application&quot; between the groups, but this data is not shown. This analysis and its results must be disclosed, as well as the relative number of putative D1 and D2 cells in each experiment, wherever this is possible. Any differential effect between these two cells types, as well as potential sampling biases, could lead to major changes in the interpretation of the results. Results reported in Figure 6E are of particular concern, given that the selective effect of UK-78,282 on IA inactivation in the lowS group (a key finding of the study) is &quot;demonstrated&quot; with less than 6 cells in each group, which is already a relatively underpowered experiment without considering a potential asymmetry in the sampling of D1 vs. D2 subpopulations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by O'Donovan and colleagues addresses an important question of individual variability among rats on motivational tasks, specifically here in the progressive ratio task. Variance is often high on these tasks, and reasons for this inter-animal variance are not known. In an elegant set of studies, the authors link this variance to changes in the transcriptional landscape of the nucleus accumbens, and drill down further to link it to changes in potassium channel expression. They highlight one channel in particular, K<sub>v</sub>1.4, and perform extensive electrophysiology to show that it is differentially active in low vs. high motivated rats. This channel is expressed highly in both dorsal and ventral striatum, and the authors further demonstrate that pharmacological manipulations of its function can increase motivation in rats that are on the low end of PR responding. Overall, I found the study well designed and experimentally sound, and the discussion of the questions and implications were both interesting and appropriate. I have only suggestions for improvement.</p><p>1) In Figure 1, they show that the differences in PR were not observable in the preceding FR sessions. They argue this by looking at average FR responding in the same rats before they were trained on the PR. A more sensitive test of this question would be to look at a correlation between FR responding and PR responding in the same animals. I would encourage the authors to look into this.</p><p>2) The paper proposes to find a mechanism underlying variance in motivational drive on the PR task. As they note in their Introduction, motivation can fluctuate between days. The rats here were tested on PR until responding was stable, so the authors have data on whether these differences in PR responding were indeed stable within animals across days. They currently present PR data as the average of the last 3 days of PR training. Can they perform correlations among these days (i.e.: Days 1 vs. 2, 1 vs. 3, 2 vs. 3) to confirm that high responding on the PR task is a stable behavioral trait across days?</p><p>3) I was unclear how rats were parsed for RNA analysis, FSCV, and ephys experiments. Were these all from the original group in Figure 1A? Were these solely the lowS and highS animals identified in Figure 1A? Can the authors clarify how they divided these animals up and chose which individuals were used for each assay? A schematic of the overall experimental flowchart would be helpful for wrapping my head around it, as there were many rats that ended up in several different experiments.</p><p>4) For the ephys, can the authors clearly label how many cells from how many rats were recorded for each experiment?</p><p>5) The final section of the Results is titled, &quot;K<sub>v</sub>1.4 blockade rescues deficient PR performance in lowS animals&quot;. The word &quot;rescue&quot; also appears in their impact statement, but I think this word is too strong considering their highS rats have breakpoints of ~250, and their lowS rats have breakpoints of ~50 which were increased to ~80 with K<sub>v</sub>1.4 blockade. Even with K<sub>v</sub>1.4 blockade these rats would be in the &quot;lowS&quot; group based on the distribution in Figure 1A. The authors should be more nuanced in their description of the effect as a &quot;rescue&quot;.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Altered gating of K<sub>v</sub>1.4 in the nucleus accumbens suppresses motivation for reward&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

I have only one remaining issue which is that there are still a few instances where statistics need to be clarified. There are still instances where only a p value is shown without the full statistical reporting, e.g., in the second paragraph of the subsection âIndividual differences in motivation for sucrose rewardâ, all of the text for Figure 4âfigure supplement 1. The full statistic needs to be shown in all these cases. In many cases, e.g. in the subsection âLow motivation for sucrose is linked to increased NAc spike outputâ, a two -way ANOVA is used to analyze the data, but only one F statistic is reported, leaving it in some cases unclear whether this F statistic is one of the main effects or the interaction. In these cases, please include the full ANOVA results (both main effects and interaction), or otherwise clarify which part of the ANOVA is being reported. I would be preferable to report actual p values in all cases rather than p&lt;0.05 or p&lt;0.01.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have appropriately responded to all of my comments in their revised manuscript.

The frequency of MFB electrical stimulation needs to be provided. There should be some description of how electrode placements were optimized. The FSCAV methods are not provided. Details on how the FSCV data were analyzed, including how the max was determined, how the half-life was calculated, and how transient events were defined and calculated, need to be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>FSCV and FSCAV experiments have been removed from the manuscript.

But sucrose preference in this two bottle test is not reflective of the hedonic preference of the pellets earned in the PR task and so this interpretation could be somewhat misleading. I suggest referring to this as sucrose preference, as is more common, and walking back conclusions that PR and hedonia were unrelated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed results and interpretation of the sucrose preference experiments.

I'm concerned the data are not sufficiently powered to detect an effect. If these data are going to be shown, power should be added or a power analysis provided to indicate these experiments were sufficiently powered.</p></disp-quote><p>FSCV and FSCAV experiments have been removed from the manuscript.

The approach used to isolate potential underpinnings for behavioral variability is at the forefront of the field. The core of the presented data is quite adequate, and the findings are truly exciting. However, a few key issues need to be addressed.</p><p>One major concern is that the sucrose preference test is woefully underpowered. It seems as if only 3 highS and 3 or 4 lowS rats were included in this test, and there is a clear trend towards the lowS animals having a higher sucrose preference. This is particularly important given the role of specific subregions of the NAc shell in mediating hedonic preference vs. incentive salience (as established in the work of Kent Berridge and others). The authors unfortunately would need to repeat this test, specifically with more highS and lowS rats, in order to have a conclusive result and rule out potential differences in sucrose preference.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed results and interpretation of the sucrose preference experiments. Please see essential revision #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also claim to have clustered their recorded cells into putative D1- and D2-expressing SPNs based on their electrophysiological properties and saw no difference in &quot;electrophysiological responses at baseline, or following drug application&quot; between the groups, but this data is not shown. This analysis and its results must be disclosed, as well as the relative number of putative D1 and D2 cells in each experiment, wherever this is possible. Any differential effect between these two cells types, as well as potential sampling biases, could lead to major changes in the interpretation of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We excluded putative D1/D2 data clustering results from the revised Discussion, but indicate reasons why we consider sampling bias unlikely. Please see essential revision #4 and Discussion subsection âSpike frequency and motivation for rewardâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results reported in Figure 6E are of particular concern, given that the selective effect of UK-78,282 on IA inactivation in the lowS group (a key finding of the study) is &quot;demonstrated&quot; with less than 6 cells in each group, which is already a relatively underpowered experiment without considering a potential asymmetry in the sampling of D1 vs. D2 subpopulations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have increased the number of cells and animals in electrophysiological experiments with UK78,282 and included them in the revised Figure 5D-E. Please see essential revision #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[â¦] Overall, I found the study well designed and experimentally sound, and the discussion of the questions and implications were both interesting and appropriate. I have only suggestions for improvement.</p><p>1) In Figure 1, they show that the differences in PR were not observable in the preceding FR sessions. They argue this by looking at average FR responding in the same rats before they were trained on the PR. A more sensitive test of this question would be to look at a correlation between FR responding and PR responding in the same animals. I would encourage the authors to look into this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the idea. The revised manuscript includes correlation between FR and PR responding in individual animals in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B and Results subsection âIndividual differences in motivation for sucrose rewardâ, second paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The paper proposes to find a mechanism underlying variance in motivational drive on the PR task. As they note in their Introduction, motivation can fluctuate between days. The rats here were tested on PR until responding was stable, so the authors have data on whether these differences in PR responding were indeed stable within animals across days. They currently present PR data as the average of the last 3 days of PR training. Can they perform correlations among these days (i.e.: Days 1 vs. 2, 1 vs. 3, 2 vs. 3) to confirm that high responding on the PR task is a stable behavioral trait across days?</p></disp-quote><p>We now include data demonstrating behavioral stability of PR over the last three days of PR training for each lowS and highS animal in Figures 1D and E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I was unclear how rats were parsed for RNA analysis, FSCV, and ephys experiments. Were these all from the original group in Figure 1A? Were these solely the lowS and highS animals identified in Figure 1A? Can the authors clarify how they divided these animals up and chose which individuals were used for each assay? A schematic of the overall experimental flowchart would be helpful for wrapping my head around it, as there were many rats that ended up in several different experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see essential revision #6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For the ephys, can the authors clearly label how many cells from how many rats were recorded for each experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>Cell and animal number information has been added throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The final section of the Results is titled, &quot;K<sub>v</sub>1.4 blockade rescues deficient PR performance in lowS animals&quot;. The word &quot;rescue&quot; also appears in their impact statement, but I think this word is too strong considering their highS rats have breakpoints of ~250, and their lowS rats have breakpoints of ~50 which were increased to ~80 with K<sub>v</sub>1.4 blockade. Even with K<sub>v</sub>1.4 blockade these rats would be in the &quot;lowS&quot; group based on the distribution in Figure 1A. The authors should be more nuanced in their description of the effect as a &quot;rescue&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the title of the final section of the Results to âK<sub>v</sub>1.4 blockade improved PR performance in lowS animalsâ and refrain from unwarranted use of ârescueâ in the revised impact statement and throughout the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are two small remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>First, please address the concerns about statistical reporting noted by reviewer #1.</p><p>Second, given that there has been some author changes (Srimal Samaranayake and Parastoo Hashemi removed and Robert Cole added), please confirm in your cover letter that all authors, including those removed, are aware of and have approved of these changes.</p></disp-quote><p>In this revised version, we addressed the statistical reporting comments raised by reviewer #1.</p><p>We have also removed two authors: Srimal Samaranayake and Parastoo Hashemi.
