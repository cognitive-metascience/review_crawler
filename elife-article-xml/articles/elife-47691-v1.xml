In eukaryotes, chromosome structure is governed largely by histones, while in bacteria, organization is provided by the nucleoid-associated proteins. Collectively, these proteins function both in architectural capacities and in regulatory roles. Chromosome evolution in bacteria can be driven by mutation, genome rearrangement, and horizontal gene transfer, and work over the last decade has revealed that many bacteria have co-opted nucleoid-associated proteins to additionally serve as âgenome sentinelsâ, suppressing the inappropriate expression of newly acquired DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dorman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dorman, 2014</xref>). This is thought to maximize competitive fitness by repressing the expression of foreign DNA until it is either incorporated into the existing regulatory networks of the host, or decays to a point that it is lost from the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Navarre et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Different bacteria employ distinct nucleoid-associated proteins as xenogeneic silencers, including H-NS in the proteobacteria, MvaT/MvaU in the pseudomonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castang et al., 2008</xref>), Rok in <italic>Bacillus</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Smits and Grossman, 2010</xref>), and Lsr2 in the actinobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gordon et al., 2008</xref>). None of these proteins share sequence or structural homology, but all act by binding to AT-rich regions within the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Navarre et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gordon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Smits and Grossman, 2010</xref>). H-NS has been the best-studied of these proteins. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella,</italic> H-NS represses the expression of pathogenicity islands, endogenous phage genes, as well as other genes needed to respond to environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lucchini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Navarre et al., 2006</xref>). H-NS binds DNA as a dimer, and can either polymerize along the DNA to form a rigid filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), or bridge DNA to facilitate chromosome compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dame et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dame et al., 2006</xref>); both activities can limit the activity of RNA polymerase. Lsr2 is thought to function similarly to H-NS. To date, its study has been confined to the mycobacteria, where Lsr2 specifically binds and represses the expression of horizontally transferred genomic islands and AT-rich regions, including major virulence factor-encoding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gordon et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to many of the pathogens in which chromosome organization and genome silencing have been explored, the streptomycetes are largely benign, sporulating soil bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">FlÃ¤rdh and Buttner, 2009</xref>) that are instead renowned for their ability to produce a wide array of specialized metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hopwood, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barka et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, the metabolic output of this actinobacterial genus includes the majority of naturally-derived antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections. The streptomycetes encode two Lsr2 paralogs, unlike their mycobacterial relatives who possess a single <italic>lsr2</italic> gene. <italic>Streptomyces</italic> are additionally unusual in that they have linear chromosomes, where the majority of the genes required for viability are clustered in the chromosome core, and more species-specific and laterally-acquired genes are located in the flanking chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentley et al., 2002</xref>). It is within these arm regions that most of the specialized metabolic clusters are found. Recent work has revealed that specialized metabolic clusters are over-represented as horizontally-transferred elements in the streptomycetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McDonald and Currie, 2017</xref>), and that in the closely-related <italic>Salinospora</italic>, lateral gene transfer is a major driver of specialized metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ziemert et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Specialized metabolic gene clusters are subject to complex, hierarchical regulatory control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">van Wezel and McDowall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Most <italic>Streptomyces</italic> clusters contain dedicated pathway-specific regulators, which in turn are controlled by a suite of more globally-acting transcription factors. Interestingly, however, most clusters are poorly expressed under normal laboratory conditions, and in many cases their associated metabolites remain uncharacterized. This is also the case for the filamentous fungi, many of whom have a broad, untapped specialized metabolic repertoire, courtesy of transcriptional silencing by histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pfannenstiel and Keller, 2019</xref>). Significant efforts are being made to stimulate the production of these âcrypticâ metabolites in both bacteria and fungi, as they are widely regarded as productive sources of new natural products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Craney et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ochi and Hosaka, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Scharf and Brakhage, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yoon and Nodwell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Daniel-Ivad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Onaka, 2017</xref>).</p><p>We sought to investigate the role of the nucleoid-associated proteins Lsr2 and LsrL in gene regulation in <italic>Streptomyces</italic>. We found that deleting <italic>lsr2</italic> from the chromosome of <italic>Streptomyces venezuelae</italic> had minor effects on <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> growth and development and major effects on metabolism. In contrast, deleting <italic>lsrL</italic> had no detectable impact on development, and only a minor effect on metabolism. Focussing on Lsr2, we determined that it bound AT-rich regions, generally repressed the expression of prophage genes and other genes unique to <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> (presumably acquired by lateral gene transfer), and suppressed antisense gene expression. The most profound effect of <italic>lsr2</italic> deletion, however, was the large-scale activation of specialized metabolic cluster gene expression. Lsr2 directly repressed the transcription of many cryptic clusters in a way that is analogous to Lsr2- and H-NS-mediated repression of pathogenicity islands in other bacteria, and histone-mediated cluster silencing in fungi. Unexpectedly, Lsr2 also controlled the expression of well-characterized and highly-conserved clusters, suggesting that Lsr2 control has been broadly integrated into the regulatory cascades governing specialized metabolism. Our results suggest that Lsr2 functions as a metabolic gatekeeper in the streptomycetes, playing a critical role in the metabolic circuitry of these organisms, and that bacteria, like fungi, employ chromosome structuring elements to control specialized metabolism. Finally, we have manipulated Lsr2 activity using dominant negative variants, and successfully promoted the production of otherwise cryptic metabolites in a wide range of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lsr2 and Lsr2-like (LsrL) in <italic>Streptomyces venezuelae</italic></title><p>All <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species possess two <italic>lsr2</italic> homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chandra and Chater, 2014</xref>). We examined these gene products and found that within any given species, the homologs sharedÂ ~50% end-to-end amino acid identity and 60â65% sequence similarity. One homolog shared both genomic synteny and greater sequence similarity when compared with Lsr2 from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We termed this protein Lsr2 (SVEN_3225 in <italic>S. venezuelae</italic>), and its more divergent homolog LsrL, for Lsr2-like (SVEN_3832 in <italic>S. venezuelae</italic>).</p><p>To determine the biological role of these two genes and their products, we constructed single and double mutants in <italic>S. venezuelae</italic>.

results using reverse transcription-PCR, focussing on select genes from clusters specifying a range of predicted products (polyketides, thiopeptides, butyrolactones, and non-ribosomal peptides). In each case, transcripts were only reproducibly detected in the <italic>lsr2</italic> null mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This suggested that Lsr2 functions as a principal regulator for the majority of specialized metabolites in <italic>S. venezuelae</italic>, repressing the activity of these clusters under laboratory conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Lsr2 directly controls specialized metabolite cluster expression</title><p>To determine whether the effects observed in our transcription profiling experiments stemmed from direct or indirect control by Lsr2, we examined our RNA-seq data for significant changes in the expression of any known global antibiotic regulators. Unexpectedly, none were affected by the loss of Lsr2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), suggesting that Lsr2 may directly impact specialized metabolic cluster expression. We next conducted chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing experiments to identify Lsr2-associated DNA sequences using a functional Lsr2â3ÃÂ FLAG fusion-expressing strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We isolated immunoprecipitated DNA from FLAG-tagged and control (untagged Lsr2-expressing) strains late during liquid culture growth, at a developmental stage corresponding to the third time point in our transcriptional analyses. Using a stringent filter (<italic>q</italic> valueÂ &lt;Â 0.01), we identified 223 Lsr2 binding sites distributed throughout the chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). These included sites within 17 specialized metabolic clusters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), with 14 of these clusters showing altered transcriptional profiles in the <italic>lsr2</italic> mutant compared with the wild type strain (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The effect of Lsr2 on specialized metabolism, and the lack of association with other characterized global regulators, collectively suggested that Lsr2 activity may represent a new level in the regulatory cascades governing specialized metabolism. As most globally acting antibiotic regulators exert their effects by controlling the expression of pathway-specific regulators (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McKenzie and Nodwell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rigali et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), we tested whether this was also the case for Lsr2. For the 14 clusters that were bound directly by Lsr2 and had altered transcription profiles, we examined where Lsr2 bound, relative to any potential cluster-specific regulators. For approximately half (8 of 14), Lsr2 binding was associated with a regulatory gene (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). For the others, Lsr2 bound elsewhere in the cluster, suggesting an independent mechanism of regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Trends in Lsr2 binding and regulatory control</title><p>To better understand how Lsr2 exerted its repressive effects, we undertook a more comprehensive investigation into its binding and regulatory impacts. We first validated the specificity of Lsr2 binding using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). We tested five ChIP-associated sequences, and found that each of these effectively out-competed non-specific DNA probes for binding by Lsr2. This indicated that Lsr2 preferentially bound the DNA regions identified in our ChIP assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Our ChIP-seq results suggested that Lsr2 bound to 223 sites across the chromosome. Interestingly, these sites were not concentrated in the arm regions where more of the species-specific (and presumably laterally-acquired) sequences were located, but instead were enriched in the âcoreâ region of the chromosome (as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentley et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). When considering all Lsr2 binding sites,~25% of the associated genes (where Lsr2 bound immediately upstream and/or overlapping with their coding sequences) had altered transcriptional profiles, and of these, more than 30% were in specialized metabolic clusters (19 of 63) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>We assessed whether there was any correlation between binding site position and regulatory impact. We found that binding sites within the arm regions were more likely to have transcriptional ramifications compared with those in the core [35% (left arm), 40% (right arm), 25% (core)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Binding sites associated with transcriptional changes were also, on average, larger than those that had no direct effect on transcription, at least for the left and core regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), although there were a number of large sites within the core region that had no direct effect on transcription.</p><p>We next sought to understand whether there was any specificity to Lsr2 binding in the chromosome. We analyzed the in vitro-confirmed Lsr2 binding sites (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>) using the MEME server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>); however, no consensus motif could be identified. In examining the cluster-associated binding sites more broadly, we found these sequences had an average GC-content of 62.9%. When all Lsr2 binding sites were considered, an average GC-content of 65% was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), well below the chromosome average of 72.4%.</p><p>Previous in vitro analyses of binding preferences for Lsr2 from <italic>M. tuberculosis,</italic> had defined an eight nucleotide AT-rich sequence as being optimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gordon et al., 2011</xref>). We analyzed both the <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> genome, and our identified Lsr2 binding sites, for either AT-rich 20 nt segments (<underline>&gt;</underline>50% A/T), or AT-rich âcoreâ sequences (defined as 5 of 6 consecutive nucleotides being A/T). To first determine the relative AT density in the <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> chromosome, we assessed the number of 20 nt AT-rich stretches in 30 randomly selected sequences â 15 that were 500 bp and 15 that were 1000 bp in length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). We found that 7/15 of the shorter sequences lacked any AT-rich stretch (with the number of stretches ranging from 0 to 20, with an average of 5), compared with 2/15 of the longer sequences (with numbers ranging from 0 to 36, and an average of 10). In contrast, the vast majority (222/223) of Lsr2 target sequences possessed at least one AT-rich 20 nt stretch: shorter target sequences (<underline>&lt;</underline>500 bp) contained anywhere from 0 to 27 non-overlapping stretches (average of 7), while longer sequences (<underline>&gt;</underline>750 bp) contained between 8 and 291 (average of 64) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p><p>We next assessed the presence of AT-rich core sequences within both the random genome sequences, and the Lsr2-bound sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). For the random segments, 11/15 of the 500 bp sequences lacked an AT-rich core (with numbers ranging from 0 to 10, with an averageÂ &lt;1). This closely mirrored the absence of an AT-rich core in 10/15 of the 1000 bp sequences (range of 0â8, with an average of 1.5). This is in stark contrast to the Lsr2 target binding sequences: only 9 of 223 target sequences lacked an AT-rich core, with shorter sequences (<underline>&lt;</underline>500 bp) averaging three core sites (ranging from 0 to 11), and larger sequences (<underline>&gt;</underline>750 bp) averaging 25 (ranging from 1 to 124). This collectively suggested that while the presence of an AT-rich core sequence and multiple AT-rich segments may not be sufficient to promote Lsr2 binding, they appear to be near universal characteristics of Lsr2-bound sequences.</p><p>To experimentally assess the importance of these AT-rich sequences for Lsr2 binding, we focussed our attention on the Lsr2 binding site located in the intergenic region between the divergently expressed <italic>sven_5106</italic> and <italic>sven_5107</italic> genes within the predicted butyrolactone biosynthetic cluster (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Using EMSAs, we compared Lsr2 binding to the wild type sequence (58% GC), with binding to mutant sequences having increasing GC content (63%, 64% and 70%). Lsr2 bound the AT-rich sequences with much higher affinity than the more GC-rich sequences, with very little binding observed for the 70% GC-containing probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Notably, there was little difference in binding seen for sequences in which an AT-rich core was disrupted (64% GC), versus when the overall AT-content was changed (63% GC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>). To determine whether the Lsr2 preference for more AT-rich DNA was also observed in vivo, we introduced these altered sequences in place of the wild type, within a larger DNA fragment (spanning 9 kb and encompassing <italic>sven_5105â07</italic>) on an integrating plasmid vector, and introduced these variants into the Lsr2â3ÃÂ FLAG expressing strain. We conducted ChIP experiments for each strain, and quantified the amount of DNA specific for this region using quantitative PCR. We observed far higher levels of the wild type sequence compared with any of the mutant sequences (&gt;80% less), presumably reflecting greater Lsr2 affinity for the wild type, AT-rich sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>). We also assessed the expression of the flanking genes in each case, and observed little expression from the wild type sequence, while increased expression was associated with the mutant sequences. This indicated that decreased binding by Lsr2 led to increased transcription of the flanking genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Lsr2 activity is not specific for newly acquired biosynthetic clusters</title><p>Given that Lsr2 is predicted to be functionally equivalent to H-NS in <italic>E. coli</italic>, where H-NS inhibits the expression of laterally-acquired DNA sequences, we wanted to determine whether Lsr2 preferentially bound and repressed the expression of recently acquired (poorly conserved) biosynthetic clusters in <italic>S. venezuelae</italic>. To investigate cluster conservation, we subjected the sequence of each of the 30 <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> specialized metabolic clusters to BLAST searches. We focussed our attention on eight phylogenetically divergent <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species, alongside three strains of <italic>S. venezuelae</italic>, and assessed the conservation of each cluster within these streptomycetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). As expected, we found that Lsr2 bound and repressed the expression of genes in many poorly conserved/recently acquired clusters. However, not all <italic>S. venezuelae</italic>-specific clusters were controlled by Lsr2, and several of the best conserved clusters (<italic>e.g.</italic> siderophore/desferrioxamine-encoding biosynthetic cluster and bacteriocin-encoding clusters) were under direct Lsr2 control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This suggested that Lsr2 may function both as a silencer of newly acquired clusters, and as a central regulator within the hierarchy governing specialized metabolic cluster expression.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47691.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Conservation of specialized metabolic clusters in diverse streptomycetes.</title><p>Phylogenetic tree of diverse <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species, with the relative conservation of each specialized metabolic cluster from <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> shown in the right.

We mutated <italic>sven_6229</italic>, and found the <italic>m/z</italic> 281 peak disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). A close homolog of SVEN_6229, PrnA, catalyzes the conversion of L-tryptophan to 7-chloro-L-tryptophan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2005</xref>), and mutant PrnA variants can yield 5-chloro-L-tryptophan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lang et al., 2011</xref>).

Uniquely in <italic>Streptomyces,</italic> however, it appears that Lsr2 function has been co-opted for the control of specialized metabolism, and that the cryptic/silent nature of many of these metabolic clusters is due to direct Lsr2 repression.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mechanism of Lsr2-mediated repression</title><p>Previous work on Lsr2 from the mycobacteria has shown Lsr2 preferentially binds AT-rich DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gordon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gordon et al., 2011</xref>), and our findings suggest that this is also the case in the streptomycetes. Unlike more conventional transcription factors, we found that Lsr2 binding sites in <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> tended to be quite broad, centring on AT-rich sequences, extending hundreds (or thousands) of base-pairs, and frequently encompassing promoter regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). In the proteobacteria, H-NS can polymerize along the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Will et al., 2018</xref>), repressing transcription by shielding the DNA from binding by transcription factors or RNA polymerase. It can also bridge disparate DNA segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van der Valk et al., 2017</xref>), repressing gene expression by trapping RNA polymerase, and/or changing the local DNA architecture. Lsr2 repression in <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> is consistent with both polymerization and bridging mechanisms. The larger binding sites, often associated with transcriptional changes, could be the result of Lsr2 filamentation along the chromosome in those regions. We also identified multiple specialized metabolic clusters having more than one Lsr2 binding site (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This was particularly notable within the right arm of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These sites were often smaller (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), and it is possible that gene repression is achieved through bridging between these sites.</p><p>Many of the Lsr2 binding sites identified here, however, were not associated with altered transcription of their flanking genes. It is conceivable that these sites serve more of an architectural role, with Lsr2 binding promoting chromosome organization and compaction. Binding at these sites may also exert indirect effects on transcription, as a result of altered DNA structure and accessibility.</p><p>In this study, we focussed our attention on the DNA-binding activity of Lsr2, but it is worth noting that post-transcriptional regulatory roles have been identified for related proteins. In particular, H-NS can also bind RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Park et al., 2010</xref>), where it stabilizes target transcripts and promotes their translation. Notably, within the differentially expressed genes identified here, Lsr2 enhanced the expression of 10% of these genes. Their activation by Lsr2 (whether it be by binding their transcripts, or some other means) makes them interesting candidates for future investigations aimed at understanding alternative regulatory roles for Lsr2.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Role for Lsr2 repression</title><p>Our results suggest that Lsr2 functions both as a âgenome sentinelâ, and as a central governor of specialized metabolism. It represses the expression of many genes that seem to have been recently acquired based on conservation analysis. However, it also controls the expression of many well-conserved clusters in <italic>S. venezuelae</italic>. It is not clear how <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species acquire their specialized metabolic clusters. The clustered nature of specialized metabolic genes makes them amenable to transfer between species through conjugation or transduction (<italic>Streptomyces</italic> are not naturally competent for DNA transformation), although genomic studies have suggested that the transfer and maintenance of entire clusters is relatively uncommon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McDonald and Currie, 2017</xref>). In many clusters, the pathway-specific regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Williamson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">FernÃ¡ndez-MartÃ­nez et al., 2014</xref>) and/or resistance determinants (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flatt and Mahmud, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thaker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mak et al., 2014</xref>) are encoded near the ends of the cluster. Loss of either of these genetic elements during cluster transfer to a recipient could lead to inappropriate cluster expression in the absence of a fail-safe mechanism provided by proteins like Lsr2.</p><p>Within <italic>S. venezuelae,</italic> seven clusters lack an obvious pathway-specific regulator, and of these, five are under Lsr2 control. Similarly, six of nine clusters lacking an associated transporter are affected by Lsr2 (although resistance can be conferred by means other than transport, and not all specialized metabolites function extracellularly). In the streptomycetes, Lsr2 may therefore act to protect the cell from the toxic products of newly acquired clusters, until they are either integrated into existing regulatory networks or are lost from the cell. Widely conserved clusters controlled by Lsr2 (<italic>e.g.</italic> siderophore/desferrioxamine and bacteriocin) likely represent instances of successful integration, where Lsr2 control has evolved such that its repression can be alleviated under appropriate conditions. However, not all specialized metabolic clusters are under Lsr2 control. The products of Lsr2-independent clusters may be important for growth under laboratory conditions (and thus any Lsr2-mediated repression may have been alleviated under our experimental conditions), or they may be largely benign and/or have a low fitness cost associated with their production. On the other end of the spectrum are the volatile compounds, many of which required Lsr2 for their production. It appears that the synthesis of these molecules may be subject to different regulatory constraints than those of the specialized metabolites.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Control of Lsr2 expression and activity</title><p>As Lsr2 governs the expression of the majority of specialized metabolic clusters in <italic>S. venezuelae,</italic> it is critical to understand how its expression and activity are controlled.

How <italic>lsr2</italic> expression is activated, and whether it is also subject to post-transcriptional regulation remains to be seen.</p><p>At a protein level, H-NS activity can be modulated by interaction with a multitude of proteins, including association with paralogous proteins like StpA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">MÃ¼ller et al., 2010</xref>). Intriguingly, all streptomycetes encode a paralogous Lsr2-like protein, termed LsrL. Our data suggest that there exists regulatory interplay between these proteins, with Lsr2 repressing <italic>lsrL</italic> expression. It will be interesting to see whether LsrL associates with Lsr2 to form hetero-oligomers, and whether such an association alters Lsr2 activity. Deleting <italic>lsrL</italic> did not have profound phenotypic consequences, at least under the conditions we tested, so understanding its biological role in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> will require additional investigation. Unlike the streptomycetes, the mycobacteria do not encode additional Lsr2-like proteins. However, recent work in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> has suggested that Lsr2 can associate with the unrelated nucleoid-associated protein HU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Datta et al., 2019</xref>); whether an equivalent interaction occurs in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> has yet to be determined. Lsr2 also appears to be subject to post-translational modification, having been identified in several phospho-proteome screens conducted in <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Manteca et al., 2011</xref>), although how phosphorylation affects Lsr2 activity is currently unclear.</p><p>H-NS-mediated repression can be alleviated through competition for binding to similar sequences by other transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Will et al., 2015</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers were all enthusiastic about the general topic and the identification of Lsr2 as a potential regulator of many, normally silent gene clusters that are responsible for producing a variety of specialized metabolites in <italic>Streptomyces</italic>. The identification of a dominant negative variant of Lsr2 that could potentially be used throughout this genus to induce the production of useful small molecules was also met with excitement. However, the reviewers also had concerns about the novelty of finding a NAP that globally controls such gene clusters given prior work on HU and BldM. There were also significant concerns raised about the depth of the study in terms of elucidating the mechanism(s) by which Lsr2 regulates various gene clusters and even whether it functions directly or indirectly at the loci of interest. In discussion, the reviewers agreed that the paper was not suitable for <italic>eLife</italic> as it stands now, but potentially could be, with significant revision and addition of mechanistic depth (as detailed in the individual reviews below). That said, the reviewers also recognized that such work is quite involved and could take a considerable amount of time, in which case it may be best to pursue publication elsewhere; the reviewers felt that with more modest revision, e.g. improvement of the statistical treatment of the global data-sets, the paper could be ready for publication in another journal in short order. In that vein, you may want to consider the peer review transfer process noted below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript seeks to characterize the role of a nucleoid-associated protein, Lsr2 from <italic>Streptomyces venezuelae</italic>, as a regulator of xenogenic DNA and specialized metabolic gene clusters. The authors use RNA-seq to determine how a deletion in Lsr2 in <italic>Streptomyces venezuelae</italic> impacts gene expression genome-wide, and they try to correlate this to DNA-binding sites of Lsr2 identified using ChIP-seq. Deletion of Lsr2 leads to widespread differential gene expression (primarily upregulation) of many specialized metabolic cluster genes, with some possibly directly regulated. Using a dominant negative form of Lsr2, the authors demonstrate that disruption of native Lsr2 in various isolates of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> potentially leads to production of previously-silenced specialized metabolites. The authors propose that this may be a new method for producing novel metabolites not normally made in laboratory conditions. Although generally clear and easy to follow, the genome-wide studies presented needed better quantification and analysis to substantiate some of the claims made. I was also somewhat disappointed by the lack of mechanistic insight into how Lsr2 associates with certain regions of DNA and how it regulates gene expression. The primary advance seems to be the demonstration that deleting Lsr2 leads to expression of specialized metabolic gene clusters and their consequent production. It wasn't clear to me whether this was a major conceptual advance for the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> field.</p><p>1) Subsection âLsr2 represses the expression of horizontally acquired and specialized metabolic genes in <italic>S. venezuelae</italic>â, second paragraph: The authors argue that specialized metabolism genes are disproportionately affected in the <italic>lsr2</italic> mutant. Are there data for another NAP to compare against to support this claim? Maybe all NAPs yield such changes? Also, proper statistical testing is needed to assess whether specialized metabolic gene clusters are really disproportionately affected.</p><p>2) Nearly 75% of the sites Lsr2 is associated with by ChIP-seq don't show changes in expression â why not?</p><p>3) The authors state that there is a &quot;good correlation&quot; between Lsr2 binding and AT-content, but this conclusion wasn't substantiated rigorously or backed up with a quantitative analysis of the correlation. And the overall GC content of Lsr2 bound sites was only slightly less than that of the genome as a whole. So although the framework being applied here is H-NS, it seems like Lsr2 might not behave as &quot;cleanly&quot; with respect to binding AT-rich DNA. In the same vein, could AT-content be more systematically tested by EMSA?</p><p>4) The mechanism(s) by which Lsr2 regulates specialized metabolism gene cluster expression is not well characterized. It is suggested that for some it might bind and repress a regulatory gene, but this hypothesis is not tested, e.g. if the presumed Lsr2 binding site near a regulatory gene is mutated, does the corresponding metabolic gene cluster get upregulated?</p><p>5) Lsr2 binds near 14 specialized metabolism gene clusters. But 21 had expression changes. What explains the others? And is it true that the 14 are a subset of the 21?</p><p>6) Does Lsr2 bind to more recently acquired gene clusters? Phylogenetic studies could have substantially elevated the impact of the paper by directly addressing the hypothesis that Lsr2 binds and regulates foreign DNA. On a related note: is the idea that something of benefit over time loses Lsr2 regulation to become expressed and useful to the host? If so, is there any evidence that this is happening?</p><p>7) Is there a condition in which Lsr2 mutants show a disadvantage relative to the wild-type because they express &quot;foreign&quot; DNA and perhaps some of the gene clusters of interest here?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Gehrke et al., 2018 discovered the nucleoid-associated protein Lsr2 in <italic>Streptomyces venezuelae</italic> and proposed that Lsr2 directly represses the expression of genes in the majority of specialized metabolic clusters in this antibiotic-producing organism. The authors exploited these knowledge to manipulate the Lsr2 activity in the model <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species as well as uncharacterized isolates to improve the production of new secondary metabolites. The work was done rigorously and most of the claims were experimentally validated, however the novelty of this work might be limited. Lsr2 was first discovered and characterized in Mycobacterium, and was shown to be a transcriptional repressor. Gehrke et al., 2018 has not gone further in understanding the molecular mechanism of this repressor than in the previous works in Mycobacterium. Furthermore, deletions of global transcription factors/nucleoid-associated proteins in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spp. very often affects the expression of biosynthetic clusters. Some of the examples are: Salerno et al., 2009: a deletion of an HU-encoding gene affected <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spore pigmentation, Som et al., 2017: a global transcription regulator MtrA controls the expression of the actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin biosynthetic clusters in <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, or Thanapipatsiri et al., 2016: BldM, a transcriptional regulator of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> development, controls the expression of the venemycin biosynthetic cluster.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The paper by Gehrke and colleagues describes the effects of loss of Lsr2 activity on secondary metabolite production in <italic>Streptomyces venezuelae</italic>, the organism that produces chloramphenicol. The loss of Lsr2 not only results in dysregulation of known metabolites but also the production of novel ones. The paper also maps the binding sites of Lsr2 in the genome and reports the membership of its transcriptome. The findings are novel and will be of interest in both the basic science and the biotechnology spheres. However, there is scope to improve the scholarship in the article and to address anomalies around some of the data and to improve the presentation of some of the data.</p><p><italic>Streptomyces venezuelae</italic> expresses both Lsr2 and LsrL. Although the authors study mutants deficient in LsrL expression, this protein is absent from the Introduction and is not mentioned in the Abstract (it first appears in the Results subsection âLsr2 and Lsr2-like (LsrL) in <italic>Streptomyces venezuelae</italic>â). After Figure 1 (and Figure 1âfigure supplement 1) it disappears from the paper, not even appearing in the Discussion. Do the authors consider LsrL to be the counterpart of StpA, a paralogue of H-NS that is expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and related Gram-negative bacteria? Given that they have invested effort in investigating LsrL, it would be useful to give some thought to its physiological role. Like the LsrL-deficient mutant in this study, stpA knockout mutants of Gram-negative bacteria have few phenotypes, but they do have some: see PMID: 11029695 and PMID: 19843227. This point seems to deserve some consideration, otherwise why include the LsrL data?</p><p>When considering the impact of Lsr2 on gene expression in <italic>S. venezuelae</italic>, do the authors consider it as acting exclusively at the level of transcription silencing? H-NS and its paralogues have excellent RNA binding activity and well-characterised effects on translation. This point also has relevance for the LsrL/StpA issue that was raised above. What is known about Lsr2 and posttranscriptional control in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> (and in Mycobacteria)? Some commentary on this possibility would deepen the scholarly aspect of the study.</p><p>The distribution of Lsr2 binding sites along the linear chromosome shown in Figure 2 seems to be non-random. There is dense clustering of the sites in the mid-section with noticeable thinning at the left and right portions.

The DNA binding assay shown in Figure 6âfigure supplement 1 is not wholly convincing because the free probe is only barely restored at the highest concentration of Lsr2* used and the shifted complex is still obvious at that Lsr2* concentration (representing a 4:1 ratio of Lsr2* to Lsr2).

Furthermore, we show that Lsr2 controls the expression of these clusters independently of any characterized global regulators. This means that Lsr2 represents an important new level in the regulatory hierarchy governing specialized metabolism in the streptomycetes.</p><p>We have modified our manuscript throughout, to ensure that the importance of this study is clear to readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Subsection âLsr2 represses the expression of horizontally acquired and specialized metabolic genes in S. venezuelaeâ, second paragraph: The authors argue that specialized metabolism genes are disproportionately affected in the lsr2 mutant. Are there data for another NAP to compare against to support this claim? Maybe all NAPs yield such changes? Also, proper statistical testing is needed to assess whether specialized metabolic gene clusters are really disproportionately affected.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that many NAPs may indeed impact specialized metabolism. However, there is little in the way of published data that either support or refute this possibility, as few equivalent genome-wide analyses are available for other NAPs in the streptomycetes. Gene deletion experiments have been performed for sIHF (the functional equivalent of the <italic>E. coli</italic> IHF protein) and for HU in <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic>. However, no ChIP or transcriptional analyses (RNA-seq or microarray assays) have been published for either of these proteins, and consequently their binding sites remain elusive, as do their genome-wide effects on transcription. Phenotypic investigations into the effects of their gene deletions focussed more heavily on the developmental consequences stemming from deletion, where sporulation was profoundly affected in each case; this has not been observed for Lsr2.</p><p>Recent work published by Bush et al., 2019, has also suggested that BldC functions as a nucleoid associated protein. Notably, this protein preferentially impacted the expression of developmental genes, not specialized metabolic genes.</p><p>Collectively, this would suggest that not all nucleoid-associated proteins have the same effect as Lsr2.</p><p>Regarding the disproportionate impact of <italic>lsr2</italic> deletion on specialized metabolic clusters, we have now included the proportion of specialized metabolic cluster genes that are impacted, relative to all other genes. The difference is striking: ~15% (155/1031) of genes in specialized metabolic clusters show significantly altered transcription profiles, compared with 4.9% of non-specialized metabolic cluster genes (329/6680). This information can be found in the second paragraph of the subsection âLsr2 represses the expression of horizontally acquired and specialized metabolic genes in <italic>S. venezuelae</italic>â.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Nearly 75% of the sites Lsr2 is associated with by ChIP-seq don't show changes in expression â why not?</p></disp-quote><p>There are many possible reasons to explain this observation. A likely explanation, given the chromosome architectural role ascribed to Lsr2-related proteins, is that these Lsr2 binding sites may have architectural functions as opposed to regulatory ones (although at a gross chromosomal level, we did not detect any significant changes in chromosome compaction in the <italic>lsr2</italic> mutant, relative to the wild type strain). We have now added this possibility into our Discussion in the second paragraph of the subsection âMechanism of Lsr2-mediated repressionâ. We have also compared the characteristics of those sites associated with expression changes, with those that have no effect, and have identified a number of features that are more commonly associated with transcriptional changes (larger binding sites; greater AT-content). This information can be found in the second and third paragraphs of the subsection âTrends in Lsr2 binding and regulatory controlâ and in new Figure 2B and 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors state that there is a &quot;good correlation&quot; between Lsr2 binding and AT-content, but this conclusion wasn't substantiated rigorously or backed up with a quantitative analysis of the correlation. And the overall GC content of Lsr2 bound sites was only slightly less than that of the genome as a whole. So although the framework being applied here is H-NS, it seems like Lsr2 might not behave as &quot;cleanly&quot; with respect to binding AT-rich DNA. In the same vein, could AT-content be more systematically tested by EMSA?</p></disp-quote><p>We have undertaken a more comprehensive analysis of Lsr2 binding site composition, relative to that of the general chromosome, with respect to AT-rich âcoreâ binding sites (5 out of 6 AT residues), and AT-rich stretches of 20 bp (<underline>&gt;</underline>50% AT), and have shown that while not all sequences with these features are Lsr2 targets, the vast majority of Lsr2 targets possess these sequences.</p><p>We have also systematically tested Lsr2 binding to a sequence modified to have a range of GC contents (58%-70%), both in vitroand in vivo. We found that Lsr2 binding is enhanced with increasing ATcontent, with little binding observed when the probe was 70% GC (new Figure 3âfigure supplements 3 and 4). in vivo, we altered the AT-content of previously defined binding sites (the same sequences tested in the in vitroEMSA experiments described above), and observed greater Lsr2 binding to the AT-rich sequences than the GC-rich ones (new Figure 3âfigure supplement 3). We also observed an inverse correlation between flanking gene expression and Lsr2 binding: as less Lsr2 bound, more transcription was observed, confirming that Lsr2 binding to AT-rich sequences served to repress gene expression.</p><p>These experiments are all detailed in a new Results section (subsection âTrends in Lsr2 binding and regulatory controlâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The mechanism(s) by which Lsr2 regulates specialized metabolism gene cluster expression is not well characterized. It is suggested that for some it might bind and repress a regulatory gene, but this hypothesis is not tested, e.g. if the presumed Lsr2 binding site near a regulatory gene is mutated, does the corresponding metabolic gene cluster get upregulated?</p></disp-quote><p>Many of the Lsr2 binding sites associated with regulatory genes overlap or are within the coding sequences of their associated regulatory genes, making it challenging to mutate these sites without changing the coding sequence of the associated gene, or significantly altering the codon usage of these genes. However, we identified one candidate binding site that was ideally positioned for testing this hypothesis, in that it was both upstream of a regulatory gene (<italic>sven_5106</italic>), and the expression of this regulatory gene was altered in an <italic>lsr2</italic> mutant background.</p><p>We introduced this region into a plasmid vector, and compared the expression of genes flanking the Lsr2 binding site bearing either the native (AT-rich) sequence, or more GC-rich variants, where the ChIP-identified AT-rich binding core sequence had been altered (taking care not to mutate either promoter sequence within this region). These altered sequences (and the corresponding wild type) were the ones described in point 3, and were tested in vitroand in vivofor Lsr2 binding (binding was strongest to the wild type, or most AT-rich, and was weakest to the sequence with the highest GCcontent).</p><p>We found that increasing GC-content (and decreasing Lsr2-binding) led to increased expression of the flanking genes, as determined using RT-qPCR. These data are presented in Figure 3âfigure supplements 3 and 4, and are described in the last paragraph of the subsection âTrends in Lsr2 binding and regulatory controlâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Lsr2 binds near 14 specialized metabolism gene clusters. But 21 had expression changes. What explains the others? And is it true that the 14 are a subset of the 21?</p></disp-quote><p>Lsr2 binds within 17 specialized metabolic gene clusters, and there are expression changes associated with genes in 14 of these clusters. These 14 are indeed a subset of the 21 clusters having changed expression patterns â please see Table 1 for a complete summary of this information. For the 7 clusters that had transcriptional changes but no direct Lsr2 binding, we predict that these transcriptional effects are indirect. These may be mediated by other transcription factors under the control of Lsr2, or by alterations in the local DNA architecture stemming from the loss of Lsr2 binding. We have now elaborated upon these possibilities in our Discussion (subsection âMechanism of Lsr2-mediated repressionâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Does Lsr2 bind to more recently acquired gene clusters? Phylogenetic studies could have substantially elevated the impact of the paper by directly addressing the hypothesis that Lsr2 binds and regulates foreign DNA. On a related note: is the idea that something of benefit over time loses Lsr2 regulation to become expressed and useful to the host? If so, is there any evidence that this is happening?</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted phylogenetic analyses of each cluster, to determine whether Lsr2 preferentially associated with newly acquired (not conserved/unique to <italic>S. venezuelae</italic>) clusters, and to our surprise, found that while Lsr2 often bound to poorly conserved clusters, it also associated with (and affected the expression of) several of the most conserved clusters (see new Figure 4). This suggested that Lsr2âs function in controlling specialized metabolism extends beyond simply repressing the expression of foreign/newly acquired genes, and indicates that it also represents an important level in the regulatory cascades governing specialized metabolism in general. We have added in a new section addressing this point within our Results (subsection âLsr2 activity is not specific for newly acquired biosynthetic clustersâ, first paragraph), and have expanded upon it in our Discussion (subsection &quot; Role for Lsr2 repressionâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Is there a condition in which Lsr2 mutants show a disadvantage relative to the wild-type because they express &quot;foreign&quot; DNA and perhaps some of the gene clusters of interest here?</p></disp-quote><p>While we have not conducted a comprehensive survey of growth conditions, we have yet to determine conditions in which loss of Lsr2 is deleterious to the growth of <italic>S. venezuelae</italic>, apart from the delay in reproductive growth observed on and in MYM medium.
