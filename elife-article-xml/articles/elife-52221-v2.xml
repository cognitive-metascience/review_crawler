(β<sub>3</sub>-ARs) coupled to soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC)-dependent production of the second messenger 3’,5’-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) have been shown to protect from heart failure. However, the exact localization of these receptors to fine membrane structures and subcellular compartmentation of β<sub>3</sub>-AR/cGMP signals underpinning this protection in health and disease remain elusive. Here, we used a Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based cGMP biosensor combined with scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) to show that functional β<sub>3</sub>-ARs are mostly confined to the T-tubules of healthy rat cardiomyocytes. Heart failure, induced via myocardial infarction, causes a decrease of the cGMP levels generated by these receptors and a change of subcellular cGMP compartmentation. Furthermore, attenuated cGMP signals led to impaired phosphodiesterase two dependent negative cGMP-to-cAMP cross-talk. In conclusion, topographic and functional reorganization of the β<sub>3</sub>-AR/cGMP signalosome happens in heart failure and should be considered when designing new therapies acting via this receptor.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cardiomyocytes</kwd><kwd>heart</kwd><kwd>signalling</kwd><kwd>cGMP</kwd><kwd>second messenger</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12/18/30088</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gorelik</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT090594</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gorelik</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fr 1725/3-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friebe</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name><name><surname>Nikolaev</surname><given-names>Viacheslav O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ROI-HL grant 126802</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gorelik</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NI 1301/3-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friebe</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name><name><surname>Nikolaev</surname><given-names>Viacheslav O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>β<sub>3</sub>-AR signalling via cGMP in cardiomyocytes is regulated via phosphodiesterase 2 and 5 degradation, it is potentially cardioprotective, but dysregulated in heart failure through signal redistribution and higher phosphodiesterase activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the last two decades, functional β<sub>3</sub>-adrenergic receptors (β<sub>3</sub>-ARs) have been found and studied in cardiomyocytes isolated from various species including humans and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gauthier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mongillo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hammond and Balligand, 2012</xref>). Depending on the cell type (cardiomyocytes <italic>vs</italic> adipocytes or atrial <italic>vs</italic> ventricular myocytes), β<sub>3</sub>-ARs have been reported to couple to both stimulatory (G<sub>s</sub>) and inhibitory (G<sub>i</sub>) proteins and to regulate cardiac contractility. In human and rodent ventricular myocardium, catecholamine binding to β<sub>3</sub>-ARs elicits negative inotropic and positive lusitropic effects by signalling via G<sub>i</sub> and the second messenger 3’,5’-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gauthier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mongillo et al., 2006</xref>). Unlike β<sub>1</sub>- and β<sub>2</sub>-AR, the β<sub>3</sub>-AR is resistant to agonist-induced desensitization, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liggett et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nantel et al., 1993</xref>) and its expression is increased in heart failure as well as in sepsis and diabetic cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amour et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moniotte et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moniotte et al., 2001</xref>). It was hypothesised that β<sub>3</sub>-AR/cGMP pools can attenuate excessive cardiotoxic β<sub>1</sub>-AR/cAMP signalling, as well as pathological cardiac hypertrophy and remodelling which takes place in cardiomyocytes during the progression towards heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mongillo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hammond and Balligand, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Takimoto et al., 2005</xref>). Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), has been detected in close proximity to β<sub>3</sub>-ARs in cardiomyocyte caveolae structures. The caveolae are believed to provide discrete signalling domains, necessary for the autonomic regulation of the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feron et al., 1998</xref>). It has been shown indirectly that β<sub>3</sub>-AR/cGMP is most likely degraded by the phosphodiesterases 2 and 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mongillo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Takimoto et al., 2005</xref>). Recently, overexpression of β<sub>3</sub>-AR in transgenic mice has been shown to protect the heart from catecholamine-induced hypertrophy and remodelling via an eNOS/soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC)/cGMP-dependent signalling pathway. The same study showed localization of β<sub>3</sub>-ARs together with eNOS in caveolae-enriched membrane fractions, which had been separated via ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belge et al., 2014</xref>). Another mouse study identified the sGC subunit α1 as the facilitator of the NO dependent but Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent effects of β<sub>3</sub>-AR using sGC α1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cawley et al., 2011</xref>). Despite its name the ‘soluble’ sGC has been shown to act in close association with β<sub>3</sub>-ARs and membrane located signalosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mongillo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feron et al., 1998</xref>). However, the exact localization of functional β<sub>3</sub>-ARs in adult cardiomyocytes and the spatio-temporal regulation of their cGMP signals as well as their potential interaction with cAMP signalling pathways have not been studied before.</p><p>In this study, we employ a highly sensitive Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based biosensor, red cGES-DE5, in combination with scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM). We demonstrate that in healthy rat cardiomyocytes, functional β<sub>3</sub>-ARs are localized exclusively within the transverse (T)-tubules and stimulate a cGMP pool which is predominantly regulated by phosphodiesterases (PDEs) 2 and 5. Furthermore, by using the cAMP specific FRET-based biosensor Epac1-camps we show that β<sub>3</sub>-AR stimulation can decrease overall adenylate cyclase dependent cAMP levels in healthy cardiomyocytes by a PDE2-mediated cGMP-to-cAMP cross-talk. This cross-talk appears to be disrupted in heart failure, where β<sub>3</sub>-AR stimulation no longer has a significant effect on overall cAMP levels. In failing cells, β<sub>3</sub>-AR/cGMP signals decrease in the T-tubules. Heart failure leads to altered co-localization of sGC and caveolin-3, as shown via immunocytochemical staining. Together, these alterations result in the impairment of the β<sub>3</sub>-AR-dependent cGMP signalling pathway and of a PDE2-mediated β<sub>3</sub>-AR induced decrease of local cAMP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Echocardiography and biometric data show heart failure phenotype</title><p>To study β<sub>3</sub>-AR-dependent cGMP dynamics, we used ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated from healthy and failing rat hearts transduced with an adenovirus to express a highly sensitive cytosolic FRET biosensor red cGES-DE5.

Previous studies have suggested that the β<sub>3</sub>-AR are localized in caveolae, in close proximity to its signalling partners eNOS and sGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mongillo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belge et al., 2014</xref>). However, the exact sub-membrane localization of β<sub>3</sub>-AR and the compartmentation of its signalling to cGMP were not well understood. Alterations in β<sub>3</sub>-AR signalling in disease states have been difficult to study due to the lack of appropriate imaging techniques and specific antibodies which work in situations of relatively low endogenous expression. In this work, we studied the exact submembrane localization of β<sub>3</sub>-AR and alterations to β<sub>3</sub>-AR/cGMP signalling in failing cells using new cutting-edge biophysical approaches such as SICM and FRET. We were able to directly visualize compartmentalized β<sub>3</sub>-AR/cGMP production in the cellular context of adult rat cardiomyocytes and its disruption in heart failure. Using FRET imaging in the presence of either β<sub>3</sub>-AR agonists or antagonists, we show that these cells can produce cGMP following direct agonist stimulation of β<sub>3</sub>-ARs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In some, but not all cells, residual cGMP production was still detectable despite β<sub>3</sub>-AR and NOS inhibition. This is an observation which has previouslybeen reported in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mongillo et al., 2006</xref>). β<sub>3</sub>-AR dependent cGMP pools are mainly formed in the T-tubules (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) due to the localization of β<sub>3</sub>-ARs in close proximity to the caveolar signalosome, which among other molecules is comprised of eNOS and sGC. To further substantiate the association of functional β<sub>3</sub>-AR to caveolae, we dissociated the signalosome of these lipid structures in healthy cardiomyocytes using a previously published peptide, which targets the caveolin-3 scaffolding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Macdougall et al., 2012</xref>). As a result, β<sub>3</sub>-AR-cGMP pools were induced outside of T-tubular domains (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) which corroborates the importance of caveolar signalosomes for proper β<sub>3</sub>-AR regulation.</p><p>Using various family selective PDE inhibitors, we uncovered that β<sub>3</sub>-AR/cGMP signals are predominantly regulated by local pools of PDE2 and PDE5 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D and E</xref>). These findings are similar to what has been described for atrial natriuretic peptide-stimulated pools of submembrane cGMP in rat cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Castro et al., 2006</xref>) and eNOS/sGC-dependent pools of cGMP in mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Takimoto et al., 2005</xref>). Further regulation via the cGMP specific and IBMX insensitive PDE9 cannot be completely excluded, although a recent study in mice suggests that PDE9 degrades cGMP pools generated downstream of natriuretic peptide receptors acting independently of NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the overall β<sub>3</sub>-AR/cGMP response was significantly reduced in failing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,F</xref>) despite increased β<sub>3</sub>-AR expression reported in cardiac disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hammond and Balligand, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moniotte et al., 2001</xref>). This reduction in the signal could be in part be due to higher PDE activity on cGMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,E</xref>) and an altered subcellular arrangement of sGC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). sGC was found to redistribute away from caveolin-3 in heart failure, as demonstrated in this work by immunocytochemical double staining. We have observed a trend to an increased overlap between our sGCα and α-actinin staining in our confocal imaging, which could potentially represent an increased redistribution of sGCα to the areas of the Z-disc not directly associated with the T-tubules or caveolar signalosomes. Though the immunocytochemical method is limited in its spatial resolution and can therefore not resolve the caveolae structures themselves, it allows us to detect an alteration in sGC localization in heart failure, which could potentially be indicative of dysregulated caveolar signalosomes as reported previously in a pressure overload induced heart failure model using mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>). Decreased expression of eNOS in the caveolae, alongside increased expression of neuronal NOS (nNOS) at the sarcoplasmic reticulum has been reported in studies of tissue from humans with heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Damy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Drexler et al., 1998</xref>). As eNOS function in cardiomyocytes has been shown to attenuate beta-adrenergic contractile responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Farah et al., 2018</xref>), potential changes in local NOS activities for example due to decreased eNOS-caveolin-3 association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feron et al., 1998</xref>) could further contribute to altered β<sub>3</sub>-AR/cGMP signal disruption. The slightly increased contributions of PDE2,3 and 5 to cGMP regulation which we observed in heart failure, are probably responsible for the overall reduction in cGMP levels, as can be seen when comparing total ISO plus IBMX responses in control and failing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E</xref>). Increased expression and activity of the dual-specificity PDE2 has been shown in human heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mehel et al., 2013</xref>), as well as in a rodent model of aortic banding, where an increase in both cGMP and cAMP hydrolysis took place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yanaka et al., 2003</xref>). At the same time as being degraded by PDE2, cGMP can also increase the effect of PDE2 on cAMP by binding to the PDE’s GAF-B domain and leading to a conformational change, thereby triggering the so-called cGMP-to-cAMP crosstalk. This crosstalk between the second messengers of which one (cAMP) has increasingly been associated with detrimental signalling pathways in the context of heart failure, which the other (cGMP) could potentially attenuate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mongillo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moniotte et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yanaka et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, we have also detected a decreased β<sub>3</sub>-AR induced attenuation of the forskolin induced cAMP response, due to PDE2 activity, which it was possible to abolished by blocking the PDE2 using a specific inhibitor (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). This observed impairment of the cGMP/cAMP crosstalk further supports the hypothesis of dramatic spatial rearrangements in the β<sub>3</sub>-AR/sGC/PDE2 signalosome which impair cGMP dynamics and could potentially lead to depressed β<sub>3</sub>-AR effects on cardiac contractility demonstrated in similar animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mongillo et al., 2006</xref>) and in human heart tissue samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moniotte et al., 2001</xref>). The observed response of β<sub>3</sub>-AR stimulation of about 10 percent on overall cAMP levels, as measured via the cytosolic FRET sensor Epac1-camps, could be of physiological relevance when brought into the context of lowering pathological cAMP signalling levels on a whole or in confined signalling compartments. We believe that altered compartmentation of subcellular cGMP may play a role in disease-associated changes in β-AR signalling. However, heart failure does not completely ablate β<sub>3</sub>-AR/cGMP responses, leaving room for a residual cardioprotective action of β<sub>3</sub>-ARs in the failing heart. This therapeutic potential is currently being addressed pharmacologically using the β<sub>3</sub>-AR agonist mirabegron in clinical studies to treat heart failure with preserved and reduced ejection fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pouleur et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic of β<sub>3</sub>-AR/cGMP signalling in healthy (left side) and failing (right side) cardiomyocytes.</title><p>In healthy cardiomyocytes, functional β<sub>3</sub>-ARs are associated with caveolar signalosomes and localized mostly in T-tubules.

Next, they were blocked with PBS based buffer containing 0.3% Triton X-100% and 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were then double stained overnight, at 4°C with primary antibodies, diluted in PBS containing 0.3% Triton and 1% BSA, for example against sGCα1 together with α-actinin or Caveolin-3. Cells were then washed three times for 5 min with PBS before they were exposed to secondary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.3% Triton and 1% BSA for 1 hr. Finally, cells were washed again in PBS three times for 5 min before being mounted onto cover slides with mounting medium. Imaging was performed using an inverted Zeiss LSM-800 laser scanning microscope equipped with a 40x oil immersion objective and controlled by ZEN imaging software which was used for the colocalization analysis and detection of the respective Pearson’s correlation coefficients.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical differences were analysed using OriginPro 8.6 and GraphPad Prism 7 software. Normal data distribution was determined by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For the comparison of two independent groups with skewed distribution Mann-Whitney U test was used. For the comparison of normally distributed data, a two-tailed T-test (for comparing morphometric and echocardiographic data from independent animals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) or a mixed ANOVA followed by χ2-test (when data from several cells from multiple individual animals were compared) were applied. Differences were considered significant at p-values below 0.05. All data are presented as means ± s.e.m.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Peter O’Gara for cardiomyocyte isolation.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Marc Freichel (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Schobesberger et al. analyze the localization of β<sub>3</sub>-adrenergic receptor and associated signaling molecules in signaling domains of adult rat cardiomyocytes and its redistribution in a model of myocardial ischemia. They use FRET-based cGMP and cAMP sensors and scanning ion conductance (SICM) and confocal microscopy. The authors show Isoproterenol-evoked cGMP generation in control cardiomyocytes, its contribution by β<sub>3</sub>-adrenoceptors using β<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>2</sub> antagonists and its dependence on NO generation. The authors can demonstrate that ISO-evoked GMP production is reduced in failing cardiomyocytes. Using a large set of phosphodiesterase inhibitors, they elaborate the contribution of PDE2 and PDE5 isoforms for ISO-evoked cGMP generation. Combined FRET and SICM surface imaging reveals that β<sub>3</sub>-adrenoceptor-mediated cGMP generation occurs predominantly in the T tubular cleft in healthy myocytes, and that in failing myocytes the cGMP response is similar in T tubules and at the crest. Modulation of caveolin binding similarly equalizes T-tubule and crest signalling in healthy myocytes. Using confocal microscopy, the authors then show data suggesting that the β<sub>3</sub>-adrenergic receptor-associated signaling molecules sGCα1 and sGβ1 dissociate from caveolin 3-containing domains in failing cardiomyocytes. In a final set of experiments the authors demonstrate that β<sub>3</sub>-adrenoceptor activation attenuates cAMP generation (also measured by a FRET biosensor) in myocytes from healthy animals but that this control is lost in failing cells.</p><p>Opinion:</p><p>The study provides some interesting new data and is relevant because unlike the β<sub>1</sub>- and β<sub>2</sub>-ARs, β<sub>3</sub>-ARs are not desensitized in HF, and their activator is currently undergoing a Phase IIb clinical trial for treating heart failure. The combined SICM and FRET methods are unique to this investigative group and are valuable for the question at hand. There are a number of intriguing results presented, and the presentation is generally quite clear. However, the conclusions of the study are somewhat overstated, based on the data presented (and the way these data are analysed). This must be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) First and foremost, recent work of PC Simpson showed clearly that β<sub>3</sub>-AR does not exist in murine cardiac myocytes. The authors should examine their data in view of these observations or argue against.</p><p>2) Evidence that the myocytes are from a state of heart failure should be included in the Results (echo data).</p><p>3) The choice of drug concentrations (β<sub>1</sub>-AR, β<sub>2</sub>-AR antagonists, PDE inhibitors) must be justified – selectivity of drugs for the targets is key to the interpretation of most data in this manuscript.</p><p>4) There are issues with use of statistical tests. MW or t-tests are used to compare multiple groups (Figure 1, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 5). This should be re-done with ANOVA or non-parametric equivalent. Please notice also other comments about statistical analysis of the data.</p><p>5) Interpretation of t-tubule/crest responses (Figure 3 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1) does not appear justified by the data. In Figure 3, comparison of E and J suggest that T-tubule responses are lost but not that they are redistributed to other areas of the sarcolemma. By contrast, comparison of the impact of the C3SD peptide and its scrambled control in healthy cells suggests a gain of crest signalling, rather than a loss of t-tubular signals.</p><p>6) Care must be taken with interpretation of work using the C3SD peptide. The sequence replicates the so-called caveolin scaffolding domain (CSD) which for many years was considered to mediate the regulatory role of caveolins through interaction with a complementary caveolin binding motif (CBM) in target proteins. This central tenet has been questioned within the last decade by work from the Parton and Dart laboratories which show that most CBM in caveolin's 'binding partners' are inaccessible for interaction with the CSD. This does not necessarily weaken the evidence for a role for CSD, which may exert effects via alternative mechanisms. However, we are not aware of any evidence that the C3SD peptide leads to 'deletion of intact caveolae'. The cartoons (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, D) imply that Cav3 (presumably the red line, although not defined in legend) is a caveolar neck protein, which is not accurate. Furthermore, these cartoons suggest that with the C3SD peptide, the t-tubular cGMP signal is reduced which is not borne out by the data in part A of this figure. The legend states 'in cardiomyocytes treated with..C3SD..the cGMP signal in…crest areas is even stronger than when stimulated in t-tubules' but the comparison between these 2 datasets is not made (also see 3 above).</p><p>7) It is important to acknowledge the limitation of confocal imaging to provide robust support for the location of proteins in caveolae (lateral resolution ≈200 nm, caveolae 50-100 nm). Could more meaningful information be gained from confocal images (Figure 4) by a separation of interior (t-tubular) and surface (crest) staining?</p><p>8) The increased co-localisation of sGC and α-actinin is not explained (Figure 4F) – this seems to suggest increased sCG at z discs, i.e., t-tubules in failing cells which is not consistent with the overall interpretation of data.</p><p>9) Figure 5 – the magnitude of the impact of β<sub>3</sub>-AR stimulation on cAMP production (indexed with the Epac-based sensor) is small even in control cells. If this significant difference is retained when the data are analysed using ANOVA, the authors should comment on the relevance of such a small change. Perhaps measurement of cAMP signals in different subcellular compartments might reveal profound differences.</p><p>10) No direct evidence is presented here that β<sub>3</sub>-AR are caveolae-based (presumably because of lack of an appropriate antibody) yet some unsubstantiated statements are made e.g. 'β<sub>3</sub> -AR dependent cAMP pools are formed in caveolae'. Some evidence (referenced in the manuscript) supports the location of some sGC subunits in buoyant caveolae-containing fractions, and the evidence for caveolar location of eNOS is robust. However, comprehensive evidence to support statements regarding the location of the β<sub>3</sub> signalosome in caveolae is lacking.</p><p>11) Figure 6. There seems to be some lack of accuracy in depicting current (and past) data from this group. Why are β1-AR only in crest in healthy myocytes (vs. Nikolaev et al. 2010 Science). Are the PDE2/5 symbols misplaced at the bottom of panel A (surely these degrade cGMP in control cells as shown in Figure 2). The data in Figure 5C suggest that the normal β<sub>3</sub>-AR dependent reduction in cAMP seen in control cells is absent in failing cells (i.e. cAMP lower in control cells in the presence of β<sub>3</sub>-AR stimulation). Yet comparison of panel A and B in Figure 6 suggests that cAMP is lower in failing cells in the presence of β<sub>3</sub>-stimulation. Even given an increase in PDE2 expression/activity in failing cells (not shown explicitly) which could increase degradation of cAMP, how can the data in Figure 5 be reconciled with the cartoons in Figure 6?</p><p>12) It appears that the differently targeted β<sub>3</sub>-AR stimuli applied to T-tubules vs. Crest membrane regions were performed in different cells, with comparisons between them analyzed with non-paired statistics. This is not explicitly stated but is apparent by the statistical test used (Mann Whitney U). This seems problematic given that the level of FRET response varies from cell to cell, and even accepting IBMX-based normalization between cells, the statistical power to identify quantitative changes would be challenging. If getting both stimuli in the same cell is impossible and unpaired analysis is required, then the ability to properly normalize between cells is critical. The concern with it is raise by the key data shown in Figure 3. While the extent to which β<sub>3</sub>-AR-mediates cGMP at the Crest appears similar between healthy and failing cardiomyocytes, the FRET response at T-tubule declines in the latter group. If this was due to a redistribution of β<sub>3</sub>-AR to the Crest region, would you not expect a rise in the% FRET response there? Is it possible the results can be explained by a decline in β<sub>3</sub>-R levels or signal-coupling in the T-tubules after MI? Data in Figure 3E and 3J should be combined into a 2WANOVA, and a statistical test made for the interaction between heart failure (or not) and location where the agonist was applied.</p><p>13) This study is not the first to examine β<sub>3</sub> signaling in plasma membrane compartments or its modulation by heart failure (see Trappanese et al., Basic Res Cardiol, 2015), however there are differences in their findings to the current ones that deserve comment. They too found β<sub>3</sub>R expressed in both caveolin enriched and heavy (non-lipid raft) regions shown by direct Western Blot. Their results differ however, in that the distribution in each region did not appear to change in the canine HF model (mitral regurgitation), and signaling seemed only observed if the β<sub>3</sub>R was stimulated in the non-lipid raft compartment. The methods were clearly different, but results should be discussed, particularly in light of Comment 12. Ideally, using a membrane fraction, then Cav3 pull down, and β<sub>3</sub>-AR protein analysis would help confirm if there is indeed a redistribution in this model that was not observed in the canine model reported previously. If there is a real difference, the question then becomes what goes on in human – is it more like rat or dog?</p><p>14) There are a number of figures shown where the FRET tracings themselves do not appear to represent the summary data. Examples are in Figure 2 and 5. There are also concerns that for some analysis, very few animals were used, (e.g. Figure 1F, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B, Figure 5—figure supplement 1, Figure 5C), and this raises concerns about reproducibility.</p><p>15) Figure 5 is another key figure in the study, looking at potential crosstalk between β<sub>3</sub>-AR-stimulated cGMP and cAMP via PDE2 regulation. The modest decline from β<sub>3</sub>-AR agonist in controls seems to be reproduced in the post MI cells too, though the statistical variance is slightly different so one is borderline significant and the other not. The proper test would be a 2WANOVA, where the impact of heart condition is one variable, and the β<sub>3</sub>-AR application the other. This could be done for the β<sub>3</sub>-AR response, and then for +/- PDE2-I response where β<sub>3</sub>-AR stimulation is present. To support the authors' conclusions, there would need to be a significant interaction.</p><p>The authors choose forskolin to stimulate cAMP and PDE2-dependent hydrolysis, but this should be contrasted to a β-AR agonist to better support their conclusion (e.g. as depicted in Figure 6).</p><p>16) The novelty of the immunofluorescent microscopy data is questioned by prior reports showing similar co-distribution of sGC and Caveolin 3 in normal and failing hearts (e.g. Tsai et al., 2012). There is also a concern that the microscopy is based on freshly isolated cells, whereas the functional data were obtained 48 hours post isolation (time needed to introduce the FRET probes). What is the immunohistology distribution after this 48 hours? Myocytes are known to change the localization of ion channels and various GPCRs during this time period.</p><p>17) The MI model is not described, so it is difficult to know the severity of dysfunction generated. Equally important, the location in the heart from which myocytes cells were isolated post MI – is not noted. This is important; e.g. was this peri-infarct, or from the remote territory? How was that determined? How reduced was the EF generated and what other evidence was there supporting this as heart failure – e.g. elevated filling pressures, pulmonary edema, etc.. What was the sex of the animals?</p><p>18) The scheme shown in Figure 6 is interesting but not really confirmed by the data shown and so remains speculative. This is because Figure 5 does not test the relative signaling involved in the two different compartments (TT vs. Crest), and with cAMP being stimulated coupled to a Cav3/localizing β-AR, versus not.</p><p>19) In Figure 1B and f the authors show a reduced cGMP generation after Isoproterenol stimulation. However, it is not clear whether this is entirely mediated via β<sub>3</sub> receptors. The authors should do the similar experiments in the presence of CGP plus ICI (β<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor blockers).</p><p>20) In Figure 2E it is not entirely clear whether the FRET response by IBMX (about 4%) represents the cGMP generation on top of Isoproterenol evoked cGMP generation. If not the IBMX effect together with Isoproterenol is not larger than with ISO alone (Figure 1F). This should be clarified.</p><p>21) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Functional β<sub>3</sub>-ARs are localized in the T-tubules of healthy cells and redistribute to the non166 tubular sarcolemma in heart failure”, the authors state that in failing hearts cGMP generation can be detected across the sarcolemma. The authors should more specifically state that in healthy cardiomyocytes there is no crest response which becomes now obvious in failing hearts. At least this is demonstrated in Figure 3D and I.</p><p>22) The immunostainings shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 entirely depend on the specificity of the antibodies directed against sGCα1, caveolin3 and sGCβ1. The authors should comment in the manuscript about what is known about the specificity of these antibodies. Have they been used previously in knockout control cells or what other efforts have been made to demonstrate their specificity?</p><p>23) Figure 4—figure supplement 1: In the model in figure B and C, it is suggested that cGMP formation is reduced in the T tubules after induction of heart failure. However, if there is no statistical significance Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B between the first bar (T tubule scramble) and the third bar (T tubular C3SD). Thus, this model is not supported entirely by the data.</p><p>24) In Figure 5 the authors should somehow indicate more clearly at which time points the changes in cAMP generation are quantified in C. Is this at the time point just before IBMX application? The authors should clearly state in the manuscript the percentage of inhibition in cAMP generation by the β<sub>3</sub>-agonists. It seems to be in the range of 10-15%?</p><p>25) The model in Figure 6 in healthy cardiomyocytes indicates that cGMP act on PDE2 to limit cAMP generation. The authors should elaborate in a little bit more detail how this is achieved for readers not entirely familiar with the previous literature.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52221.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) First and foremost, recent work of PC Simpson showed clearly that β<sub>3</sub>-AR does not exist in murine cardiac myocytes.

In Figure 3, comparison of E and J suggest that T-tubule responses are lost but not that they are redistributed to other areas of the sarcolemma. By contrast, comparison of the impact of the C3SD peptide and its scrambled control in healthy cells suggests a gain of crest signalling, rather than a loss of t-tubular signals.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and have reworded the text accordingly as follows:</p><p>“The increased activity of β<sub>3</sub>-ARs in non-tubulated surface areas in failing cells might be linked to a disrupted association of β<sub>3</sub>-AR with caveolar signalosomes.

The sequence replicates the so-called caveolin scaffolding domain (CSD) which for many years was considered to mediate the regulatory role of caveolins through interaction with a complementary caveolin binding motif (CBM) in target proteins. This central tenet has been questioned within the last decade by work from the Parton and Dart laboratories which show that most CBM in caveolin's 'binding partners' are inaccessible for interaction with the CSD. This does not necessarily weaken the evidence for a role for CSD, which may exert effects via alternative mechanisms. However, we are not aware of any evidence that the C3SD peptide leads to 'deletion of intact caveolae'.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this correction and have reworded this part in the manuscript to “We investigated this hypothesis by using the cell-permeable peptide disruptor of caveolar signalling TAT-C3SD. The addition of this peptide leads to the dissociation of caveolar signalosomes by inhibiting signalling which is dependent upon the binding to the caveolin-3 specific scaffolding domain (C3SD)(MacDougall et al., 2012)”, while citing the MacDougall et al., 2012 publication from the Calaghan S. group.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The cartoons (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, D) imply that Cav3 (presumably the red line, although not defined in legend) is a caveolar neck protein, which is not accurate. Furthermore, these cartoons suggest that with the C3SD peptide, the t-tubular cGMP signal is reduced which is not borne out by the data in part A of this figure. The legend states 'in cardiomyocytes treated with..C3SD..the cGMP signal in…crest areas is even stronger than when stimulated in t-tubules' but the comparison between these 2 datasets is not made (also see 3 above).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this observation and have changed the cartoon to portray Cav 3 more accurately. We also performed additional C3SD peptide measurements for the Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It is important to acknowledge the limitation of confocal imaging to provide robust support for the location of proteins in caveolae (lateral resolution ≈200 nm, caveolae 50-100 nm). Could more meaningful information be gained from confocal images (Figure 4) by a separation of interior (t-tubular) and surface (crest) staining?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this observation and the suggestion to look at different cell areas in our confocal images. We have performed further Pearson Correlation Coefficient measurements by drawing the regions of interest so they either measured the membranes or the cell interior. We could however detect no significant differences in the cell areas. We added a remark about the limitation of confocal microscopy to detect structures underneath the diffraction limit in the Discussion, as follows: “Though the immunocytochemical method is limited in its spatial resolution and can therefore not resolve the caveolae structures themselves, it allows us to detect an alteration in sGC localisation in heart failure and, which could potentially be indicative of dysregulated caveolar signalosomes as reported previously in a pressure overload induced heart failure model using mice (Tsai et al., 2012)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The increased co-localisation of sGC and α-actinin is not explained (Figure 4F) – this seems to suggest increased sCG at z discs, i.e., t-tubules in failing cells which is not consistent with the overall interpretation of data.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the point the reviewer is making, however after more stringent statistical testing Figure 5F has lost its significance. Nonetheless, we opted to leave the images and graph in the manuscript as it might give a potential trend of where the sGCα subunit might be relocating to in heart failure we and have added the following sentence in the Discussion section: “We have observed a trend to an increased overlap between our sGCα and α-actinin staining in our confocal imaging, which could potentially represent an increased redistribution of sGCα to the areas of the Z-disc not directly associated with the T-tubules or caveolar signalosomes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 5 – the magnitude of the impact of β<sub>3</sub>-AR stimulation on cAMP production (indexed with the Epac-based sensor) is small even in control cells. If this significant difference is retained when the data are analysed using ANOVA, the authors should comment on the relevance of such a small change. Perhaps measurement of cAMP signals in different subcellular compartments might reveal profound differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We have acquired new data that and added to the figure, this effect is statistically significant (see Figure 6).</p><p>However, we appreciate the reviewer’s comment and have added the following paragraph into the Discussion:</p><p>“The observed response of β<sub>3</sub>-AR stimulation of about 10 percent on overall cAMP levels, as measured via the cytosolic FRET sensor Epac1-camps, could be of physiological relevance when brought into the context of lowering pathological cAMP signalling levels on a whole or in confined signalling compartments.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) No direct evidence is presented here that β<sub>3</sub>-AR are caveolae-based (presumably because of lack of an appropriate antibody) yet some unsubstantiated statements are made e.g. 'β<sub>3</sub> -AR dependent cAMP pools are formed in caveolae'. Some evidence (referenced in the manuscript) supports the location of some sGC subunits in buoyant caveolae-containing fractions, and the evidence for caveolar location of eNOS is robust. However, comprehensive evidence to support statements regarding the location of the β<sub>3</sub> signalosome in caveolae is lacking.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. In the past we have shown β<sub>3</sub>-AR association with caveolae in myocytes transgenically expressing the human β<sub>3</sub>-AR, which allowed us to perform membrane fractionation protein assays as well as a proximity ligation assay using a human specific β<sub>3</sub>-AR and Caveolin 3 antibody. We also currently have a paper in press (Dubois-Deruy E ESCHF 2020, in press) containing further evidence of this association via a PLA colocalization signal between the endogenous rat β<sub>3</sub>-AR and AMPK (itself in caveolae) from rat neonatal cardiac myocytes. In any case we added a remark in the Introduction to mention our previous work on the caveolae and β<sub>3</sub>-AR association: “Recently, overexpression of β<sub>3</sub>-AR in transgenic mice has been shown to protect the heart from catecholamine-induced hypertrophy and remodelling via an eNOS)/soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC)/cGMP-dependent signalling pathway. The same study showed localization of β<sub>3</sub>-ARs together with eNOS in caveolae-enriched membrane fractions, which had been separated via ultracentrifugation (Belge et al., 2014)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 6. There seems to be some lack of accuracy in depicting current (and past) data from this group. Why are β1-AR only in crest in healthy myocytes (vs. Nikolaev et al. 2010 Science). Are the PDE2/5 symbols misplaced at the bottom of panel A (surely these degrade cGMP in control cells as shown in Figure 2). The data in Figure 5C suggest that the normal β<sub>3</sub>-AR dependent reduction in cAMP seen in control cells is absent in failing cells (i.e. cAMP lower in control cells in the presence of β<sub>3</sub>-AR stimulation).

However, due to the relatively low expression of β<sub>3</sub>-ARs and the current lack of a suitable antibody, which could detect rat β<sub>3</sub>-ARs with appropriate specificity, we have refrained from performing this experiment. We agree that the data from Trappanese et al., 2015, does not match our data exactly, however we assume that this can at least in part be explained by the different pathophysiological courses of heart failure in the two different models. We have shown in the past, that in human a residual cGMP increase was detectable after β<sub>3</sub>-AR agonist application on biopsies from patients with different types of heart disease.

Cardiovascular Research, 2006) and others (Pavlovic et al. Exp Physiol, 2010) have demonstrated that factors such as the organization of the surface of the cardiomyocytes (z-groove ratio) and t-tubule density (rat cells lose only 25% of their t-tubule area over the first 48 hrs). Functional factors are not markedly altered, neither is the capacitance of the membrane or the staining of tubular structures after 48 hours despite the cells looking morphologically quite different due to the rounding of the myocytes ends. Rat cells compare favourably with those isolated from mouse which completely lose their form and function over 48 hrs (Pavlovic et al.

The authors should do the similar experiments in the presence of CGP plus ICI (β<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor blockers).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would benefit our work if we could show the β<sub>3</sub>-AR response only in the MI cells (with inhibiting β<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>2</sub> receptors); however, we were unable to perform the suggested experiment as we did not have any more MI cells (in the 2 months of time that we were given for the revision).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) In Figure 2E it is not entirely clear whether the FRET response by IBMX (about 4%) represents the cGMP generation on top of Isoproterenol evoked cGMP generation. If not the IBMX effect together with Isoproterenol is not larger than with ISO alone (Figure 1F). This should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point and have tried to make the data description clearer by adding the following passage into the figure legend: “The scatter plot/histograms present the average whole cell cGMP-FRET responses evoked by PDE inhibition further to the isoproterenol responses in% from (A-D) (E).”, that means i.e. if the ratio after ISO application was at 0.98 and the following ratio after single PDE inhibition was at 0.97 and the ratio after IBMX application at 0.96, then the values would be 1 for the single PDE and 2 for the total PDE inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Functional β<sub>3</sub>-ARs are localized in the T-tubules of healthy cells and redistribute to the non166 tubular sarcolemma in heart failure”, the authors state that in failing hearts cGMP generation can be detected across the sarcolemma. The authors should more specifically state that in healthy cardiomyocytes there is no crest response which becomes now obvious in failing hearts. At least this is demonstrated in Figure 3D and I.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and have changed the manuscript text accordingly to “In healthy cardiomyocytes, we observed that functional β<sub>3</sub>-ARs reside mainly in the T-tubules with very few responses being detectable outside of T-tubules (Figure 4A-E), whereas in failing cells, they β<sub>3</sub>-ARs responses after localised stimulation can be detected in both tubulated and non-tubulated areas across the sarcolemma (Figure 4F-J).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22) The immunostainings shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 entirely depend on the specificity of the antibodies directed against sGCα1, caveolin3 and sGCβ1. The authors should comment in the manuscript about what is known about the specificity of these antibodies. Have they been used previously in knockout control cells or what other efforts have been made to demonstrate their specificity?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the specificity of antibodies is essential for the experiments shown in our manuscript. Therefore, we used the best available antibodies and added the specificity info into the text. We have commented on the specificity of the antibodies we employed in our manuscript in the Materials and methods section as follows: “rabbit sGCα and β subunit antibodies (Prof. Andreas Friebe from Würzburg, Germany, specificity tested in KO animals Friebe, Voußen and Greoneberg, 2018), mouse α-actinin (Σ Aldrich, A7732), mouse Caveolin 3 (BD Transduction Laboratories, 610421, specificity tested in KO animals (Woodman et al., 2002)”.</p><p>Additionally, we tested the specificity of sGCα. Freshly isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes (either from wild type of from global sGC knockout mice) were fixed with ice-cold methanol and co-stained with sGCb1 and Cav3 antibodies as described in the Materials and methods and Figure 5—figure supplement 1) Confocal images were using the small laser intensities in all conditions similar to those used in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>23) Figure 4—figure supplement 1: In the model in figure B and C, it is suggested that cGMP formation is reduced in the T tubules after induction of heart failure. However, if there is no statistical significance in Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B between the first bar (T tubule scramble) and the third bar (T tubular C3SD). Thus, this model is not supported entirely by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the observation and have altered the cartoon accordingly, so that the cGMP formation in HF tubules does not appear smaller. See figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>24) In Figure 5 the authors should somehow indicate more clearly at which time points the changes in cAMP generation are quantified in C. Is this at the time point just before IBMX application? The authors should clearly state in the manuscript the percentage of inhibition in cAMP generation by the β<sub>3</sub>-agonists. It seems to be in the range of 10-15%?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and have attempted to clarify the measurement steps in the manuscript with the following explanation in the Figure 5 figure legend: “Scatter plot/histogram presenting whole cell cAMP-FRET responses depicted as the percentage of the maximal possible cAMP FRET response (= Forskolin followed by IBMX). The measured Forskolin or IBMX responses were the respective maximal responses, equalling the lowest FRET ratio value, achieved after each stimulus.” Additionally, we added the average response rate of 10.3% into the manuscript text as follows: “In healthy cells, stimulation of β<sub>3</sub>-AR led to a significant reduction of approximately 10.3% of the forskolin stimulated cAMP production (Figure 5C)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>25) The model in Figure 6 in healthy cardiomyocytes indicates that cGMP act on PDE2 to limit cAMP generation. The authors should elaborate in a little bit more detail how this is achieved for readers not entirely familiar with the previous literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and have elaborated more on this point in the Discussion section as follows: “At the same time as being degraded by PDE2, cGMP can also increase PDE2 activity on cAMP more strongly by binding to it, thereby triggering the so-called cGMP-to-cAMP crosstalk.This crosstalk between the second messengers of which one (cAMP) has increasingly been associated with detrimental signalling pathways in the context of heart failure, which the other (cGMP) could potentially attenuate (Mongillo et al., 2006; Moniotte et al., 2001; Yanaka et al., 2003)”, as well as in the figure legend (see Figure 7).</p></body></sub-article></article>
