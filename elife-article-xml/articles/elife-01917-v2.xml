Substrate addition to yeast expressing transporter fusions with yellow fluorescent protein and mCerulean triggered substrate-dependent donor quenching or resonance energy transfer. Fluorescence changes were nitrate/peptide-specific, respectively. Like CHL1, NiTrac1 had biphasic kinetics. Mutation of T101A eliminated high-affinity transport and blocked the fluorescence response to low nitrate. NiTrac was used for characterizing side chains considered important for substrate interaction, proton coupling, and regulation. We observed a striking correlation between transport activity and sensor output. Coexpression of NiTrac with known calcineurin-like proteins (CBL1, 9; CIPK23) and candidates identified in an interactome screen (CBL1, KT2, WNKinase 8) blocked NiTrac1 responses, demonstrating the suitability for in vivo analysis of activity and regulation. The new technology is applicable in plant and medical research.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold><ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01917.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01917.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01917.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>About 1% of global energy output is used to produce nitrogen-enriched fertiliser to improve crop yields, but much of this energy is wasted because plants absorb only a fraction of the nitrogen that is applied as fertiliser. Even worse, the excess nitrogen leaches into water sources, poisoning the environment and causing health problems. However, to date, most efforts to increase the efficiency of nitrogen uptake in plants have been unsuccessful.</p><p>The key to improving the uptake efficiency of a nutrient is to identify obstacles in its journey from the soil to cells inside the plant. The first obstacle that nitrate ions encounter is the membrane of the cells on the surface of the roots of the plant. Many researchers believe that it would be possible to increase the amount of nitrogen absorbed by the plant if more was known about the ways that plants control how nitrate ions and other chemicals enter cells.</p><p>The cell membrane contains gated pores called transporters that allow particular molecules to pass through it. Although the transporters responsible for the uptake of nitrate ions, peptides, and ammonium ions (the main nitrogen compounds that plants acquire) have been identified, current experimental techniques cannot determine when and where a specific transporter is active within a living plant. This makes it difficult to know where to target modifications and to determine how effective they have been at each step. The nitrate transporter also acts as an antenna that measures nitrate concentration to ensure it is used optimally in the plant, but current techniques cannot show how this actually works.</p><p>Now, Ho and Frommer have exploited the fact that a transporter changes shape as it does its job to create sensors that can track the movement of nitrate and peptides through the cell membrane. By using fluorescent proteins to monitor how the shape of the transporter changes, Ho and Frommer were able to measure how structural mutations and regulatory proteins influenced the movement of nitrate and peptides through the membrane.</p><p>For efficiency, all of this work was performed in yeast cells. The next goal is to use the technique in plants to uncover how they adjust to changes in nutrient levels in the soil.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold><ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01917.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01917.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>biosensor</kwd><kwd>FRET</kwd><kwd>fluorescence</kwd><kwd>transport</kwd><kwd>nitrate</kwd><kwd>oligopeptide</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1021677</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frommer</surname><given-names>Wolf B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1052348</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frommer</surname><given-names>Wolf B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Peptide and nitrate transporters have been converted into fluorescent reporters of transport activity and have been used to measure various transport properties including the dual affinity of the nitrate transceptor</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Quantitatively, nitrogen is the single most limiting nutrient for plants. Thus, not surprisingly, maximal crop yield depends critically on nitrogen fertilizer inputs. Current practices require production of ∼1.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> tons of N-fertilizer per annum, consuming ∼1% of the world’s annual energy production. Plants absorb only a fraction of the fertilizer applied to the field, leading to leaching into groundwater, polluting the environment, and damaging human health. Improvements in nitrogen use efficiency of crops are urgently required; although potential targets including uptake transporters and metabolic enzymes have been identified, successful improvements in N-efficiency are rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McAllister et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jiang, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schroeder et al., 2013</xref>). Overexpression of an alanine amino transferase or the transporter <italic>OsPTR9</italic> are two of the few examples of improved nitrogen use efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shrawat et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fang et al., 2013</xref>). Ammonium, nitrate, amino acids, and di- and tripeptides serve as the major forms of inorganic and organic nitrogen for plants. Uptake occurs predominantly from the soil/rhizosphere into roots, although aerial parts of the plant are also capable of absorbing nitrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McAllister et al., 2012</xref>). Nitrogen availability and distribution in soil vary both spatially and temporally. Inorganic nitrogen uptake is complex and involves multiple ammonium and nitrate uptake systems, typically grouped into low-affinity/high-capacity and high-affinity/low-capacity systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Siddiqi et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">von Wirén et al., 1997</xref>). Their relative activity is influenced by both exogenous and endogenous factors. The exact sites of uptake of the various forms of nitrogen along the length of the root, the cells that are directly involved, and in vivo regulation are not well understood. Also, the exact intercellular path towards the stele is not experimentally proven. The reasons for this lack of knowledge lie in the fact that nitrogen transport is difficult to measure. Some studies rely on the analysis of the depletion of the medium, others use stable isotopes, or the <sup>13</sup>N-isotope, which has a short half-life time of ∼10 min and requires access to a suitable supply source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clarkson et al., 1996</xref>). Most of these techniques lack spatial resolution, that is information on which cell layers and which root zones absorb the nutrient. Electrophysiological assays can provide spatial information; however, they are mostly used at accessible surfaces. Spatial information has been provided in a few studies by methods such as vibrating electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henriksen et al., 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">1992</xref>), positron-emitting tracer imaging systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Matsunami et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kiyomiya et al., 2001</xref>), or secondary ion mass spectrometers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clode et al., 2009</xref>). We also know little about differences in the distribution of the nitrogen forms in different root cell types or zones and with respect to cellular compartmentation. Classical approaches average total ion/metabolite levels over all cells in the sample, for example, in whole roots. Nitrate levels differ dramatically between root cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhen et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karley et al., 2000</xref>). Recently, a GFP-labeled protoplast-sorting platform was used to compare metabolomes of individual cell types in roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moussaieff et al., 2013</xref>). This study found that the levels of small oligopeptides were comparatively higher in the epidermis and endodermis compared to other root cell types. Compartmental analyses indicated that the nitrate concentration of root vacuoles is ∼10-fold higher compared to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhen et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>Transporters are placed in strategic positions to control which and how much of a specific nitrogen form can enter a given cell at a given point of time. The progress in identifying transporter genes provided a new handle for addressing the mechanisms and the spatial and temporal regulation of nitrogen acquisition from a new level of detail. Three major families of transporters for inorganic nitrogen uptake (and distribution) have been identified: the NPF/POT nitrate transporter family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Leran et al., 2013</xref>), NRT2 nitrate transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kotur et al., 2012</xref>), and the ammonium transporters of the AMT/MEP/Rh family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">von Wirén et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrade and Einsle, 2007</xref>). In addition to their role in nitrate uptake, members of the NPF/POT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Leran et al., 2013</xref>) family play important roles also in the transport of histidine, dicarboxylates, oligopeptides, and glucosinolates, and surprisingly at least three major plant hormones: auxin, ABA, and gibberellin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Krouk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kanno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boursiac et al., 2013</xref>). Genes are valuable tools for exploring physiological functions. Analysis of RNA levels allows us to study gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gazzarrini et al., 1999</xref>), for example, transcriptional GUS-fusions for determining organ and cell type specific expression and translational GFP-fusions for subcellular localization. Both classical and novel methods, including cell-specific transcriptional profiles and ‘translatomes’ provide us with new insights into differences in the expression of transporters in roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brady et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mustroph et al., 2009</xref>). Analysis of cell type-specific expression profiles showed that the majority of changes in nitrate-induced gene expression are cell-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gifford et al., 2008</xref>). Expression and purification of the proteins followed by reconstitution in vesicles or expression in heterologous systems to interrogate biochemical properties include K<sub>m</sub> and transport mechanisms. The genes can be used as a basis for structure function studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Loqué et al., 2007</xref>) and to obtain crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrade et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doki et al., 2013</xref>). We can use the genes to identify interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lalonde et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, the availability of genes enables us to generate specific mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yuan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2009</xref>) that provide insights into their physiological roles. However, even with this massive amount of detailed data, the key information is missing, namely the information on the activity state of a given protein in vivo. In vivo activity depends mainly on two additional parameters beyond protein abundance at a given membrane: the local concentration of the substrate/s, the status of the cell (e.g., the membrane potential and local pH as key determinants for ion transporter activity), and the status of cellular regulatory networks required for the activity of the protein in question. Again, genes can help us to find regulators and study the effect of mutations on nitrogen acquisition, but ultimately we need to be able to quantify the activity of the transporters in individual cells in vivo.</p><p>Nitrogen uptake is controlled by many factors, such as nitrogen level, energy status of the plant, assimilation status of imported nitrogen, N-demand, and involved mobile signals between shoots and roots as well as between different parts of the root system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">von Wirén et al., 1997</xref>). Nitrate transporters are regulated through phosphorylation, mediated by calcium-dependent calcineurin-like kinases (Calcineurin B-like, CBL and CBL-interacting protein kinase, CIPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Major breakthroughs were findings that indicate both the members of the AMT and NPF/POT family function as transporters and receptors (transceptors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lima et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rubio-Texeira et al., 2010</xref>). However, despite broad progress, at present, we have only a limited understanding of signaling pathways that control nitrogen acquisition.</p><p>It is important to develop tools for monitoring the activity of individual transporters in specific locations in individual cells of plant roots in a minimally invasive manner. A minimally invasive tool that has proven valuable for monitoring ions and metabolite levels with high spatial and temporal resolution is genetically encoded fluorescent nanosensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Okumoto, 2012</xref>). These sensors rely on substrate binding–dependent conformational rearrangements in a sensory domain. The rearrangements are reported by changes in Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) efficiency between two fluorescent proteins, which act as FRET donor and acceptor due to spectral overlap. Sensors for glucose, sucrose, and zinc have successfully been used in Arabidopsis to monitor steady state levels as well as accumulation and elimination under both static and dynamic conditions where roots were exposed to pulses of the respective analytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deuschle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaudhuri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Okumoto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaudhuri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lanquar et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The recent progress in obtaining crystal structures for transporters, and more importantly the availability of transporter structures in multiple configurations, has provided insights into the conformational rearrangements occurring during the transport cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guettou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henderson and Baldwin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Madej et al., 2013</xref>). Biochemical and structural analyses have shown that many transporters undergo conformational changes during the transport cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shimamura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jiang, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012</xref>). Important in this context is that such rearrangements have been observed for many members of the MFS superfamily, including members of the NPF/POT family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doki et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that it should be possible to ‘record’ the conformational rearrangements that occur during the transport cycle in a similar manner as used for the engineering of the FRET sensors. The first prototype for transport activity sensors, named AmTrac, uses ammonium transporters as sensory domains for engineering transport activity sensors by inserting a circularly permutated EGFP (cpEGFP) into a conformation-sensitive position of an ammonium transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Michele et al., 2013</xref>). Addition of ammonium to yeast cells expressing the AmTrac sensor triggers concentration-dependent and reversible changes in fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Michele et al., 2013</xref>). Whether this approach is transferable to other family proteins in different species remained to be shown. To create nitrate and peptide transport activity sensors, we fused CHL1 and four PTRs to fluorescent protein pairs, expressed the fusions in yeast, and tested their response to substrate addition (named NiTrac for nitrate transport activity and PepTrac for peptide transport activity). The five sensors responded to the addition of nitrate or peptides, respectively. The kinetics of the NiTrac1 sensor response was strikingly similar to the transport kinetics of the native CHL1; the response was specific and reversible. The new sensors were used to study structure/function relationships, to correlate effects of mutations in CHL1 and NiTrac1 on activity and sensor responses, and to observe the effect of potential regulators on the conformation of the transporter. The successful use of the sensors in yeast indicates that these new tools can be used for <italic>in planta</italic> analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Engineering of a nitrate transport activity sensor</title><p>It is likely that the nitrate transceptor CHL1 undergoes conformational rearrangements during its transport cycle. To measure substrate-dependent conformational rearrangements, CHL1 was sandwiched between a yellow acceptor (Aphrodite) and cyan donor fluorophore (mCerulean) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rizzo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This chimera, named NiTrac1, was expressed in yeast, followed by spectral analysis of yeast cultures in a spectrofluorimeter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The fluorophores were in Förster distance, as evidenced by significant resonance energy transfer. If conformational rearrangements were induced by substrate addition, one might expect a change in the energy transfer rate. To our surprise, and in contrast to typical FRET sensors (e.g., glucose or glutamate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fehr et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Okumoto et al., 2005</xref>]), we observed an overall reduction in the emission intensities of both donor and acceptor, but no obvious change in FRET efficiency. Cyan FPs are typically robust compare to the yellow variants; specifically, they are less sensitive to pH changes or other ions compared to yellow variants (here Venus encoded by codon-modified Aphrodite gene sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deuschle et al., 2006</xref>]). However, Aphrodite emission was unaffected by nitrate when excited directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, inset), indicating that the external nitrate triggers donor quenching in the cytosol. The sensor response can be expressed as a ratio change between the emission intensity of the sensor at CFP excitation relative to YFP emission obtained from acceptor excitation. As one may have expected, the nitrate analog chlorate that lead to the naming of CHL1 (chlorate resistance of the <italic>chl1</italic> mutant) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tsay, 1993</xref>) also triggered NiTrac quenching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The response of NiTrac1 is nitrate- and chlorate-specific; other compounds such as chloride, ammonium, divalent cations, and dipeptide had no significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). When mCerulean was replaced by the corral-derived cyan fluorescent protein mTFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ai et al., 2008</xref>), we observed FRET, but nitrate addition had no effect on the emission of this variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The mTFP variant, named NiTrac1c (control), therefore can serve as a control sensor for in vivo measurements. Replacement of mCerulean with eCFP, another jellyfish variant, retained the donor-quenching response to nitrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Although we do not understand the mechanism by which nitrate triggers donor quenching, the effect is likely related to a specific property common to mCerulean and eCFP and lacking in mTFP.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01917.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design and development of NiTrac sensors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the NiTrac1 sensor construct.

However, addition of nitrate to yeast cells expressing CHL1 alone had no effect on the fluorescence of a cytosolically expressed mCerulean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). One could argue that quenching occurs locally at the exit pore of the transporter directly at the plasma membrane and thus requires tethering of mCerulean to the transporter. To test whether quenching is specifically caused by nitrate, we created similar constructs for the oligopeptide transporters PTR1, 2, 4, and 5 from Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Komarova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsay et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Leran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Because binding and transport typically have different kinetic constants, we analyzed the response kinetics of NiTrac1. CHL1 is unusual in that it shows biphasic nitrate uptake kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu and Tsay, 2003</xref>). The observed dual-affinity in oocytes had been attributed to phosphorylation of T101 by endogenous kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu and Tsay, 2003</xref>). The phosphorylation hypothesis would suggest that about half of the transporter molecules are phosphorylated. Interestingly, we observed that the kinetics of the fluorescence response of NiTrac1 in yeast were also biphasic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Since it is unlikely that yeast also partially phosphorylates the transporter, the biphasic kinetics are more likely an intrinsic property of the protein. Mutation of T101 to alanine had been shown to eliminate the high-affinity component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu and Tsay, 2003</xref>). Introduction of T101A into NiTrac1 also eliminated the high-affinity component, intimating that NiTrac1 is a transport activity sensor, and that conformational rearrangements during the transport cycle affect mCerulean emission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly, the transport K<sub>m</sub>s of both high- and low-affinity phases matched the values obtained for the fluorescence response, supporting the hypothesis that NiTrac measures the transport activity.

We specifically targeted residues that might be important for substrate specificity, residues involved in proton cotransport, and salt bridges possibly involved in dynamic movements during the transport cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As one may have expected, different mutants showed different energy transfer ratios, consistent with conformational differences (altered distance and/or orientation of the fluorophores in the absence of substrate; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, we not only observed cases in which donor quenching was lost, but also changes that are consistent with changes in FRET efficiency in response to ligand addition, as well as mixtures of donor quenching and change in the FRET efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, without knowledge of the effect of the mutations on transport activity, the data are difficult to interpret. Therefore, we introduced the corresponding mutations into CHL1, expressed the mutants in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and used two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and <sup>15</sup>N-uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) to measure the transport activity. In response to nitrate addition, CHL1 expressing oocytes showed an inward current, consistent with the proposed 2H<sup>+</sup>/NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> cotransport mechanism. CHL1 contains a highly conserved motif E41-E44-R45 in TM1 predicted to play a role in proton coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Newstead, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Newstead et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Solcan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doki et al., 2013</xref>).

We therefore tested the role of residues in this motif using NiTrac expressed in yeast and CHL1 expressed on oocytes. Mutation in any of the three residues (E41A, E44A, and R45A, TM1) led to a loss of nitrate-induced currents and <sup>15</sup>N-uptake in both the high- and low-affinity range (0.5/0.25 and 10 mM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5, 6</xref>). The corresponding mutant of NiTrac1 also lost the sensor response to nitrate addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig7">Figures 4B, 7</xref>), indicating that the conserved motif is also used for proton cotransport of nitrate. Interestingly, the mutant was characterized by higher FRET compared to wild-type CHL1, indicating that the mutation leads to a conformational change in the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Structural and functional analyses of the bacterial peptide transporter PepT<sub>St</sub> had implicated a salt bridge between a conserved K126 in TM4 and E400 in TM10 in peptide recognition and/or structural movements during the transport cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Solcan et al., 2012</xref>). This lysine is conserved throughout the POT family (K164 of CHL1, TM4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Newstead, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Newstead et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Solcan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doki et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with results from the bacterial PepT<sub>St</sub> and GkPOT, mutation of K164 to alanine or aspartate in CHL1 completely abolished nitrate uptake in both the high- and low-affinity range (0.25 and 10 mM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>); however, the nitrate-dependent inward currents were retained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Mutation K136A in GkPOT and K126A in PepT<sub>St</sub> both abolished completely proton-driven uptake but still had counterflow activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Solcan et al., 2012</xref>). Both CHL1-K164 mutants either function as nitrate-dependent proton channels or have lost selectivity, and consistent with the shift of the reversal potential to more negative values transport other anions such as chloride. NiTrac1-K164A surprisingly showed a different response mode, that is upon addition of nitrate the mutant not only showed donor quenching but apparently also a change in FRET efficiency, underlining the exceptional sensitivity of NiTrac1 to effects of mutations on conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Mutation of the salt bridge acceptor E476A in TM10 of CHL1 led to loss of both the nitrate-induced inward current and <sup>15</sup>N-uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5, 6</xref>) and NiTrac lost the sensor response to addition of nitrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>); by contrast, and as one might expect, the conservative mutation E476D had no significant effect on transport properties and sensor response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5 fig6">Figures 4B, 5, and 6</xref>). Alanine substitutions were introduced into corresponding sites predicted to be in the vicinity of the substrate-binding pocket (L49, Q358, and Y388 in TM1, TM7, and TM8, respectively). Consistent with the results obtained for the corresponding residue (N342 in TM8) in GKPOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doki et al., 2013</xref>), Y388A had no detectable effect on the nitrate-induced inward currents, <sup>15</sup>N-uptake, and sensor response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5 fig6">Figures 4B, 5, and 6</xref>), indicating the residue Y388 may not be involved in nitrate binding or transport cycle of CHL1. Mutation of L49 in TM1 and Q358 in TM7 of CHL1 to alanine had no significant effect on nitrate-induced inward currents and <sup>15</sup>N-uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5, 6</xref>), but NiTrac responses were characterized by a mixture of donor quenching and FRET change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Based on the protein sequence alignments, CHL1 carries an extended cytoplasmic loop connecting the N- and C-terminal six helical bundles. To test the role of this loop, a triple mutant E264A-E266A-K267A was analyzed. The triple mutant lost specifically the low-affinity component nitrate-induced inward current and <sup>15</sup>N uptake but retained the high-affinity component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5, 6</xref>), implicating the charged residues in the extended loop in the regulation of nitrate uptake affinity. Similarly, the corresponding NiTrac1 mutant also lost the sensor response to high nitrate concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Together, these data show that NiTrac1 is a sensitive tool for reporting conformational changes in mutants and further support the hypothesis that NiTrac1 reports activity states of the transporter.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01917.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Response of NiTrac1 mutants to nitrate addition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Three-dimensional model of CHL1 protein based on the crystal structures of bacteria (‘Materials and methods’).

We hypothesized that binding of regulatory proteins or signaling proteins might affect the fluorescence properties of NiTrac1. Therefore, we tested whether coexpression of the known interactor CIPK23, which can phosphorylate CHL1 at T101 in in vitro assays, would affect the properties of NiTrac1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). CIPK23 did not change the energy transfer between the fluorophores in the absence of nitrate, but blocked the fluorescence response of NiTrac1 to nitrate addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), either by stoichiometric binding or by phosphorylation of T101. The coactivator CBL9, which did not affect CHL1 transport activity on its own but enhanced the CIPK23-mediated phosphorylation of CHL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ho et al., 2009</xref>), had no detectable effect on the fluorescence response of NiTrac1 by itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).

The five proteins were fused with yellow and cyan versions of GFP at their N- and C-termini, respectively. When expressed in yeast, the sensors respond to substrate addition either by donor quenching or by a FRET change. The most striking feature of NiTrac is the biphasic response kinetic that matches the dual-affinity transport properties of the protein strikingly well. Based on a predicted structural model and sequence alignments, we mutated select amino acids. Analysis of the fluorescence response of these mutants and comparison with transport assays provides us with insights into the structure-function relationship of the CHL1 nitrate transceptor. The sensor is also used for probing structural rearrangements that occur when NiTrac is coexpressed with putative regulators and interactors, and we discovered new candidate regulatory proteins. The engineering of a suite of nitrate and peptide transport activity sensors complements our recent work in which we developed the prototype for fluorescence-based activity sensors AmTrac and MepTrac by inserting circularly permutated EGFP into conformation-sensitive positions of ammonium transporters. Addition of ammonium to yeast cells expressing the AmTrac/MepTrac sensors triggered concentration-dependent and reversible changes in fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Michele et al., 2013</xref>). Together, the engineering of activity sensors through two different approaches: insertion of a fluorophore into a conformationally sensitive site in AMT/MEPs and terminal fusions of a fluorophore pair to the NPF/POT family proteins indicate the potential to transfer the concept to other transporters, receptors, and enzymes. This suite of genetically encoded sensors provides a unique set of tools for observing the activity of individual transporter family members in intact tissue layers of intact plants.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Sensor output from NiTrac1 and PepTracs</title><p>The activity sensors can provide three types of reports: (i) the basic ratio provides information on structure, specifically conformation of the population of sensors that can be compared between, for example, mutants or in response to coexpression of a regulator; (ii) the intensity of donor or acceptor can be subject to substrate-induced changes that lead to quenching as seen in NiTrac and PepTrac. At present, we do not understand the molecular basis of nitrate-induced donor quenching, which appears to affect mCerulean and CFP, but not mTFP. The fact that three PepTracs show a similar quenching effect when dipeptides are added may indicate that the quenching is caused by a conformational rearrangement in the transporter. A more detailed biophysical characterization may shed light on this unexpected behavior of the sensors. (iii) The change in the emission ratio of the two fluorophores upon substrate addition in PepTrac4 is likely caused by a change in the resonance energy transfer as had been observed for small molecule sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Okumoto, 2012</xref>). In certain cases, that is, NiTrac1 mutants L49A and Q358A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), we observed a mixture of donor quenching and FRET changes. We thus hypothesize that both NiTracs and all four PepTracs have the potential to report in two different modes, that is, donor quenching, a FRET change or a combination thereof.</p><p>Structural rearrangements triggered by mutations, by binding of a regulator or by mutations apparently lead to a variety of changes in the fluorescence output. One of the most striking features of NiTrac1 is that it reflects the biphasic kinetics of CHL1 and that even the transport and fluorescence response constants are highly similar. Mutagenesis of T101 to alanine, which had been shown to specifically affect the high-affinity component of nitrate uptake, also specifically eliminated the high-affinity response in NiTrac1. These findings strongly supported the notion that NiTrac reports the processes that occur in the transceptor, when it binds and/or transports nitrate. The observations also intimate that the dual-affinity is not caused by partial phosphorylation of CHL1 when expressed in oocytes, as suggested by Tsay’s group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu and Tsay, 2003</xref>), but more likely represent an intrinsic property of CHL1 since they also occur when NiTrac1 is expressed in yeast. CHL1 also functions as nitrate sensor to regulate transcription of a variety of genes including that of the high-affinity nitrate transporter NRT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ho et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, the transport and signaling activities of CHL1 can be decoupled by Pro492L in the loop connecting TM10 and 11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ho et al., 2009</xref>).

We observed three main types of response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>): (i) loss of both nitrate uptake activity and loss of the sensor response in E41A, E44A, R45A, and E476A; (ii) loss of either high- or low-affinity uptake activity and correlated loss of the respective sensor response in T101A and R264A/R266A/K267A; and (iii) maintenance of the nitrate uptake activity and sensor response in L49A, Y388A, Q358A, and E476D. Relative to NiTrac1, more than half of the mutants show a change in FRET between the two fluorophores in the absence of substrate addition. Consistent with the role of E41 and E44 in proton coupling for bacterial peptide transporters, the fluorescence response of E41A, E44A, and R45A NiTrac1 variants support a similar role in the nitrate transporter CHL1. Interestingly, L49A, which did not show detectable differences in transport activity, showed a mixture of donor quenching and FRET change in response to nitrate addition, demonstrating that NiTrac1 is exquisitely sensitive for detecting changes in the overall protein conformation. R45A lost transport activity but retained a FRET change response after the addition of substrate rather than showing a quenching response, indicating an overall conformational change due to binding of nitrate in the absence of a functional transport cycle. Interestingly, mutation of charged residues in the extended cytoplasmic loop of CHL1 (R264A/R266A/K267A) specifically affected the low-affinity component in sensor and uptake response, implicating the loop, potentially through interacting proteins that can tune activity. How T101 phosphorylation, which affects the behavior of CHL1/NiTrac1 at low nitrate levels cooperates with the cytosolic loop, which appears to specifically affect the behavior in high nitrate conditions will be interesting to address in future experiments. Based on our studies, we presume that K164, Q358, and E476 may participate in nitrate binding. Consistent with data from bacterial peptide transporters, E476A lost both sensor response and uptake activity. This conserved residue aspartate likely plays a role in the binding pocket and/or salt bridge formation that is important for the substrate transport cycle. Mutants carrying K164A/D and Q385A mutations were both characterized by significantly increased nitrate-dependent inward currents. It will be interesting to further explore the cause for the increased conductivity with respect to transported ion species. Although the data from the limited number of mutants do not allow us to draw conclusions on the exact molecular nature of the conformational changes, we nevertheless provide the first evidence that activity sensors are highly sensitive and simple tools for probing structure-function relationships in heterologous and homologous systems without the necessity to purify the transporters.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Effect of CIPK and CBL proteins on the NiTrac1 sensors</title><p>The interaction of proteins likely affects the conformation of both partners, either directly or as a consequence of modifications such as phosphorylation. Here we show that activity sensors can be used to probe such interactions with exquisite sensitivity. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that coexpression of the calcium-dependent kinase CIPK23, which is phosphorylating T101 of CHL1 and thereby inhibiting the low-affinity component of CHL1, can block the fluorescence response when coexpressed with NiTrac1. Although typically CIPKs are thought to require a CBL for substrate recognition and derepression of the autoinhibition, CIPK23 had been shown to be able to interact with CHL1 on its own and trigger at least partial phosphorylation of T101 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ho et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, although CBL9 had been shown to enhance the CIPK-mediated phosphorylation of T101, we did not observe an effect of coexpression of CBL on NiTrac1. Surprisingly, and despite the high sequence identity between AtCBL9 and AtCBL1 (∼89% identity), CBL1 but not CBL9 inhibited the nitrate response of NiTrac1. AtCBL1 and 9 have been shown to regulate a variety of processes including potassium uptake, pollen germination, as well as sugar-, hormone- and ROS-signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sagi and Fluhr, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hashimoto and Kudla, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drerup et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kimura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li, 2013a</xref>). Even though CBL1 and 9 have apparent overlapping functions, they can have specific effects, for example, the AtCBL1-AtCIPK1 complex is involved in ABA-dependent stress responses, whereas the AtCBL9-AtCIPK1 complex plays roles in ABA-independent stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drerup et al., 2013</xref>). In general, CIPKs depend on their coactivator-CBLs to activate CIPK kinase activity. However, recent studies showed that full-length CIPK23, CIPK16, or CIPK6 alone can activate the AKT1 potassium channel system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujii et al., 2009</xref>). Also, AtCBL10 interacts with AKT1 to regulate potassium homeostasis without binding to any AtCIPKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ren et al., 2013</xref>). The assays deployed here use strong promoters and high copy number plasmids. It will therefore be important to test whether low levels of the kinase are sufficient for inhibiting NiTrac1. It will also be interesting to compare the responses of NiTrac1 when expressed in mutant plants lacking components of the CBL-CIPK machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>WNK kinase and potassium transporter interactions</title><p>In addition, we tested whether NiTrac1 can be used to monitor conformational rearrangements caused by interacting proteins, specifically we tested interactors detected in a large-scale membrane protein/signaling protein interaction screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lalonde et al., 2010</xref>). Surprisingly, we found an interaction of CHL1 with the potassium transporter AtKT2/KUP2/SHY3, which plays a role in potassium uptake. Coexpression of KT2 with NiTrac1 led to a block of the nitrate response. Whether this interaction plays a role in crosstalk between nitrogen and potassium uptake remains to be shown. In addition, we had found an interaction with the ‘<italic>no lysine (K) kinase 8</italic>’ WNK8. Also, WNK8 blocked the nitrate-induced fluorescence response of NiTrac1. WNK8 had been shown to interact specifically with and phosphorylate subunit C of the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase AtVHA-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong-Hermesdorf et al., 2006</xref>), as well as with the calcineurin B-like 1 calcium sensor AtCBL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li, 2013b</xref>). It will be interesting to further explore the network between CBL1, WNK8, and CHL1.</p><p>Obviously, NiTrac1 is highly sensitive to conformational changes that occur during the transport cycle, effects of mutations, and to changes caused by interaction with other proteins. Thus, analyses performed with these sensors in plants will have to differentiate between responses caused by substrate and regulatory interactions. The use of controls, for example, the mTFP sensor and elimination of FRET by exchanging the acceptor with a non-fretting fluorophore, as well as the use of mutant sensors may be a way to dissect the relative contribution of substrate and protein interactions. These new tools are complementary to the classical tools set including electrophysiology and tracer studies but have the clear advantage of allowing measurements deep inside plant or animal tissues and organs, domains largely inaccessible to other technologies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Outlook</title><p>In summary, we developed a set of five sensors that can report the activity of nitrate and peptide transporters in vivo. At the same time, such activity sensors prove to be sensitive tools for studying the effect of mutations on the conformation of the transporter or to detect the regulatory interactions with other proteins. The next step will be to deploy NiTrac1 and its mutants as well as the PepTracs in Arabidopsis plants to characterize the activity of the transporters and their regulation in vivo. The plant peptide transporters are close homologs of the human SLC15 peptide transporters. The SLC15 transporter PepT1 has pathophysiological relevance in processes like intestinal inflammation and inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ingersoll et al., 2012</xref>), and it serves as a key transport mechanism for uptake of drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agu et al., 2011</xref>). Given the success in engineering five members of the plant transporter family, we envisage that the approach can be implemented also for measuring the activity of the human transporters in situ and to use such sensors, for example, for drug screens.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA constructs</title><p>All transporter and sensor constructs were inserted by Gateway LR reactions, into the yeast expression vectors pDRFlip30, 34, and 39. pDRFlip30 is a vector that sandwiches the insert between an N-terminal Aphrodite t9 (AFPt9) variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deuschle et al., 2006</xref>), with nine amino acids truncated of C-terminus and a C-terminal monomeric Cerulean (mCer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rizzo et al., 2006</xref>). pDRFlip39 sandwiches the inserted polypeptide between an N-terminal enhanced dimer Aphrodite t9 (edAFPt9) and C-terminal fluorescent protein enhanced dimer, seven amino acids and nine amino acids truncated of N-terminus and C-terminus of eCyan (t7.ed.eCFPt9), respectively. pDRFlip34 carries an N-terminal AFPt9 and a C-terminal t7.TFP.t9 (t7.TFP.t9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rizzo et al., 2006</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor (Detlef Weigel), a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers, one of whom, Oliver Einsle, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study, the authors constructed the FRET-based nitrate sensor NiTrac1 by sandwiching CHL1 in between of two fluorescent proteins. NiTrac1 showed quenching of fluorescence in dependence of nitrate addition, and the quenching response showed biphasic kinetics like CHL1. The quenching was affected specifically by nitrate, by amino acid substitutions of CHL1 and interacting factors of CHL1. To control for a general quenching effect of nitrate on this type of reporter, the authors also constructed PepTracs, FRET-based peptide sensors constructed on the basis of PTR-type oligopeptide transporters. From the analysis of fluorophore-dependent emissions, the expression of cytosolic fluorophores and cyan fluorophore variants, the authors concluded that NiTrac1 and most PepTracs do not allow FRET-dependent but fluorophore-dependent substrate interaction to record in vivo activities of these membrane transporters.</p><p>A homology model based on a peptide transporter structure was used to design point-specific mutants. This part of the study is very well carried out and yields interesting results, to the point that the authors postulate the involvement of certain residues – K134, Q358 and E476 – in nitrate transport of NiTrac. This is a very nice result, as it implicated that the fusion approach can be used for functional studies of transport mechanism, but throughout the work the authors do not refer to two recent structures of bacterial nitrate transporters of the MFS family, NarK and NarU, that may be of high relevance here. While the reviewers were not aware of the degree of homology between these and CHL1, it might add substantially to the quality of the discussion to consider this new structural data within the present work (Yan et al. (2013) CellRep 3:716, and Zheng et al. (2013) Nature 481:469).</p><p>The experiments in this study appear to have been conducted with great care and the conclusions are consistent with the results. This study thus is complementary to a recent report from the same group, in which a permutated GFP was introduced into the cytosolic loop of ammonium transporters to record substrate-dependent conformational changes of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Michele et al. 2013</xref>). Even though the authors are not yet able to explain the molecular mechanism underlying substrate-dependent fluorescence quenching, this study opens up a new avenue to monitor in vivo activities of transporters and thus promises to be highly influential to this field.</p><p>The following points should be addressed in a revised version of the manuscript:</p><p>1) One major concern that may require additional experimentation is the lack of a data set that shows time-dependent activation and reversibility of substrate-dependent fluorescence quenching. Such a data set is required not only to proof that activity and not activation is monitored by this molecular reporter but also to support its suitability to report in-planta changes of nitrate transport activities, i.e. when nitrate reduction depletes cytosolic nitrate pools. Such basic data are important as long as we don't know exactly what the quenching means. If these experiments cannot be done, the reasons for omitting them should be stated in the Discussion.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>: It would be highly useful to see changes in emission ratio after addition of potassium chlorate (not just chloride) since chlorate is a proven substrate analog for CHL1.</p><p>The reason to try chlorate is to obtain additional information on the responsiveness of the transporter-fluorophore complex to a substrate analog. If chlorate yields a similar response as nitrate while the other substrates did not, then I would consider this as an additional argument for a substrate-transporter interaction being responsible for the fluorescence quenching. (The reason to propose trying out chlorate is to obtain additional information on the responsiveness of the transporter-fluorophore complex to a substrate analog. If chlorate yields a similar response as nitrate while the other substrates did not, then one would consider this as an additional argument for a substrate-transporter interaction being responsible for the fluorescence quenching. Since one expects this to be a short-time response, there are no concerns about the toxicity of chlorate.)</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01917.012</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>In this study, the authors constructed the FRET-based nitrate sensor NiTrac1 by sandwiching CHL1 in between of two fluorescent proteins.

The bacterial NARs, for which structures have been generated seem to be more closely related to the second class of plant nitrate transporters, called NRT2. The Yan et al. (2013) structure paper on NarU states that it is related to the NRT2 family. The homology between NarU and NRT2s is extremely low: 14%–18%. We did a forced ‘alignment’ of CHL1 with NarU and NARK and find identities of 11 and 13%, which would appear random. Therefore, we did not see a good way to address this comment.</p><p><italic>The following points should be addressed in a revised version of the manuscript</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) One major concern that may require additional experimentation is the lack of a data set that shows time-dependent activation and reversibility of substrate-dependent fluorescence quenching.

We trapped yeast cells in a microfluidic device and monitored time-dependent changes. These data are now shown as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. As you can see, we observed coincident and rapid mCerulean quenching upon addition of nitrate (Aphrodite, when excited directly is unaffected like in the fluorimeter assays). The response is concentration-dependent. Importantly, the response is reversible, again coincident with removal and rapid. The experiment has been performed three times independently with comparable results. These data now strongly support that the sensors will likely work well when implemented in plants. We agree that this is a significant improvement.</p><p><italic>2)</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref><italic>: It would be highly useful to see changes in emission ratio after addition of potassium chlorate (not just chloride) since chlorate is a proven substrate analog for CHL1</italic>.</p><p><italic>The reason to try chlorate is to obtain additional information on the responsiveness of the transporter-fluorophore complex to a substrate analog.

We would however like to note that we have not been able to find a single manuscript that has tested the effect of chlorate on CHL1, nor its paralogs in plants nor orthologs from other plant species. That is indeed odd, given that CHL stands for chlorate resistance. It is noteworthy that Arnold Bloom (Kosola and Bloom, 1996), one of the prominent physiologists in this field, and others have reported that inhibition of nitrate uptake by nitrate was not competitive, therefore questioning the mechanism of chlorate transport. These experiments were performed in planta, where the situation is likely complex. Bloom concluded that chlorate is not a good analog for tracer studies in planta. Nevertheless, we tested the effect of chlorate on NiTrac1 and observe a similar quenching response, even quantitatively, for chlorate as observed for nitrate. These data are now shown in the new panel as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> (subsequent figure sections are the same, just renumbered). Thus the new data address the point raised by the reviewers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
