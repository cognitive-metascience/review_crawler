Although previous studies sought to explain CTCF multivalency based on sequence composition of binding sites, few examined how CTCF post-translational modification (PTM) could contribute to function. Here, we performed CTCF mass spectrometry, identified a novel phosphorylation site at Serine 224 (Ser<sup>224</sup>-P), and demonstrate that phosphorylation is carried out by Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P is chromatin-associated, mapping to at least a subset of known CTCF sites. CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P accumulates during the G2/M transition of the cell cycle and is enriched at pericentric regions. The phospho-obviation mutant, S224A, appeared normal. However, the phospho-mimic mutant, S224E, is detrimental to mouse embryonic stem cell colonies. While ploidy and chromatin architecture appear unaffected, S224E mutants differentially express hundreds of genes, including p53 and p21. We have thus identified a new CTCF PTM and provided evidence of biological function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CTCF</kwd><kwd>post-translational modification</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>chromosome architecture</kwd><kwd>PLK1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF GRFP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kriz</surname><given-names>Andrea J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Herchel Smith Endowment fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Herchel Smith Graduate Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kriz</surname><given-names>Andrea J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Jeannie T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37-GM58839</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Jeannie T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The chromosome architectural protein, CTCF, is phosphorylated at Ser<sup>224</sup> in a cell-cycle-dependent manner and abrogation of phosphorylation leads to a cell growth defect.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CCCTC-binding protein (CTCF) has been studied in many capacities since its discovery over twenty years ago. Originally identified as a candidate transcription regulator of <italic>c-myc</italic>, this multi zinc finger protein is highly conserved amongst Nephrozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lobanenkov et al., 1990</xref>). Subsequent studies further revealed that CTCF has insulatory activity, specifically in blocking enhancer-promoter interactions, and in separating transcriptionally active genomic regions from heterochromatic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Merkenschlager and Odom, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ong and Corces, 2014</xref>). Later genomic studies revealed tens of thousands of CTCF binding sites in mammalian genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rhee and Pugh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakahashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xie et al., 2007</xref>), with &gt;5000 of these being conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to CTCF’s role in blocking enhancer-promoter loops, recent chromatin conformation capture (3C) based assays revealed that CTCF paradoxically also plays an architectural role in shaping the genome as well, helping to mediate three-dimensional chromatin loops in some cases. In addition, 3C-based assays also revealed that CTCF binds to the borders of many Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), megabase-sized regions which function to insulate chromatin interactions such as promoter-enhancer loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ong and Corces, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nora et al., 2012</xref>). Disruption of TADs, for example through deletion of CTCF sites, can lead to genetic disease through ectopic enhancer-mediated upregulation of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lupiáñez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nora et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>How can a single protein carry out so many different functions in the cell? In addition, how does the cell specify which function CTCF carries out at a given binding site, especially when some of these functions, for example mediating versus blocking chromatin loops, directly contradict each other? Numerous studies have attempted to explain the multivalency of CTCF on the basis of factors such as motif composition of binding site, chromatin state, DNA methylation, and CTCF’s role in mediating three-dimensional chromatin interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). For example, it has been proposed that CTCF’s insulatory activity can be explained in context of its mediation of three-dimensional chromatin loops.</p><p>In addition to these models, which predict the function of CTCF based on the chromatin state around a given binding site, other studies have sought to define CTCF function based on post-translation modifications (PTMs) of the protein itself. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of CTCF has been found to play roles in imprinting and nucleolar transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Torrano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yu et al., 2004</xref>) while SUMOylation of CTCF appears to enhance its repressive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">MacPherson et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, phosphorylation of CTCF has been proposed to turn CTCF into a transcription activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">El-Kady and Klenova, 2005</xref>) or reduce its DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sekiya et al., 2017</xref>), depending on site. These prior studies demonstrate that CTCF PTMs, possibly in combination, could influence the myriad of CTCF functions. The extent to which CTCF is post-translationally modified is currently no known. Many prior PTMs were identified indirectly by candidate-based approaches. Several proteomic screens have been carried out using mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rigbolt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kettenbach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dephoure et al., 2008</xref>), though phosphorylation sites were called by confidence scores made by probabilistic scoring algorithms without further validation or characterization. Here, we endeavored to screen for new CTCF PTMs by taking an unbiased approach. We identify a novel phosphorylation site at Serine 224 (Ser<sup>224</sup>-P), perform an extensive characterization of its cellular functions, and uncover an effect on growth of embryonic stem cell colonies and gene regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Murine CTCF is phosphorylated at a highly conserved position, Ser<sup>224</sup></title><p>To explore the possibility that PTMs regulate CTCF, we took an unbiased approach to both confirm known and identify novel PTMs, specifically S/T/Y phosphorylation using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sekiya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rigbolt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kettenbach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dephoure et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klenova et al., 2001</xref>). We utilized a doxycycline-inducible system to express murine CTCF-3xFLAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). This allowed us to purify CTCF from cells using a FLAG epitope rather than a CTCF antibody, as the latter could select against PTMs present within the antigenic sequence. The CTCF-3xFLAG transgene was stably introduced into female immortalized rtTA MEFs and doxycycline induction was verified by GFP microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jeon and Lee, 2011</xref>). Anti-FLAG immunofluorescence confirmed that CTCF-3xFLAG co-stained the nucleus in the same pattern as total CTCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Exogenous expression of CTCF-3xFLAG in this system only occurs at a modest level, which we confirmed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). Previously, we also found that even slight perturbation of CTCF levels affects differentiation of female ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). However, induction of the transgene was well-tolerated in SV40T immortalized MEFs as they were viable and stably expressing CTCF-3xFLAG even after 9 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We thus concluded that exogenously expressed CTCF-3xFLAG in immortalized MEFs could be a tractable system for analyzing CTCF PTMs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42341.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Murine CTCF is phosphorylated at Ser<sup>224</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GFP microscopy of co-inducible CTCF-3xFLAG, EGFP MEFs ± 1 μg/mL doxycycline for 48 hr.

CTCF is tightly associated with chromatin through the central zinc fingers binding its core DNA motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakahashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yusufzai and Felsenfeld, 2004</xref>). However, homogenizing nuclei under mild conditions with nucleases was not preferable as endogenous phosphatase activity would have been present. Thus we generated nuclear extracts under stringent conditions. Following dialysis of the nuclear extracts, anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation was performed and eluted material was resolved by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue stained. A band corresponding to CTCF-3xFLAG was excised for mass spectrometry analysis (arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Following trypsin digestion and extraction, phosphorylated peptides were enriched using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) with Fe-NTA resin prior to LC MS/MS. A unique murine site of serine phosphorylation was identified at Ser<sup>224</sup>, which is ~50 aa N-terminal of the CTCF zinc finger domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Notably, in a phosphoproteome screen of HeLa cells, a single peptide containing human CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kettenbach et al., 2011</xref>). However, the significance of this PTM in human cells was neither validated nor explored. While it is also reported that CTCF is phosphorylated at Ser<sup>604</sup>, Ser<sup>609</sup>, Ser<sup>610</sup> and Ser<sup>612</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">El-Kady and Klenova, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rigbolt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dephoure et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klenova et al., 2001</xref>); we were unable to identify peptides containing these residues. As these phospho-sites lie in close proximity in a region of CTCF poorly cut by trypsin and chymotrypsin, it is possible that resolution of these phospho-sites was infeasible with our approach. Previous mass spectrometry studies which identified these residues were also global studies that did not provide spectra or additional validation of sites, making direct comparison with our study difficult. Likewise, we were also unable to confirm if the linker sequences between the zinc fingers were phosphorylated as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sekiya et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, CTCF orthologs have only been found in Nephrozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heger et al., 2012</xref>). To explore the potential evolutionary significance of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P, we compared CTCF amino acid sequences from several Nephrozoa species with Clustal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The CTCF amino acid sequences from mouse, rat, human, chimpanzee, opossum, chicken, frog, zebrafish, sea urchin, fruit fly, and water flea were aligned. A 25 amino acid window centered on mouse Ser<sup>224</sup> remarkably revealed striking conservation proximal to this position amongst vertebrata, but not echinodermata or arthropoda (arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This conservation suggests that Ser<sup>224</sup> phosphorylation is potentially catalyzed by a conserved vertebrate kinase. Ergo, this PTM may contribute distinctly to the regulatory complexity of vertebrate genomes relative to other deuterostomes or protostomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup> can be phosphorylated by CK2</title><p>Discovery of a novel phosphorylation site at Ser<sup>224</sup> raised the question as to which kinase could modify this position. It was previously reported that casein kinase 2 (CK2) could phosphorylate CTCF in vitro at Ser<sup>604</sup>, Ser<sup>609</sup>, Ser<sup>610</sup> and Ser<sup>612</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klenova et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, the highly conserved amino acid sequence surrounding Ser<sup>224</sup> fits the known CK2 recognition site (S-x-x-D/E) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meggio and Pinna, 2003</xref>). Thus, we decided to test if CK2 also modifies Ser<sup>224</sup>. To do this, we first generated recombinant CTCF and in vitro phosphorylated it with CK2 and [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). Following SDS-PAGE, autoradiography revealed that recombinant CTCF can be phosphorylated by CK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To determine if Ser<sup>224</sup> specifically is phosphorylated by CK2, we performed that assay with non-radioactive ATP and excised a Coomassie stained band corresponding to full length CTCF (red box, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Mass spectrometry analysis of the band, revealed that CKII phosphorylated CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As with our analysis of immunoprecipitated CTCF from MEFs, we did not observe phosphorylation at Ser<sup>604</sup>, Ser<sup>609</sup>, Ser<sup>610</sup> or Ser<sup>612</sup>. However, again, technical hurdles (i.e., the close proximity of these sites in a region poorly cut by trypsin and chymotrypsin) may preclude their identification by mass spectrometry. Furthermore, while we discovered that CK2 could phosphorylate Ser<sup>224 </sup>in vitro, it remained to be seen if this occurs in vivo. Finally, it is also a distinct possibility that CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup> could be recognized by additional kinases pertinent to specific functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Generation of a CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P antibody</title><p>To explore the significance of this PTM in cells, we generated an antibody to CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P in collaboration with Cell Signaling Technology. Following screening of prospective affinity purified antibodies, we further tested if the candidate CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P antibody recognized a phosphorylated protein by western blot. We generated cell extract from immortalized rtTA MEFs and treated the extract with Lambda Protein Phosphatase. western blot revealed that the CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P antibody had reduced affinity for the phosphatase treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P antibody also recognizes a smaller (~125 kDa) band that is not detected by a CTCF monoclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Notably CTCF migrates at a higher molecular weight (150 kDa) than predicted (84 kDa) in SDS-PAGE gels.

Using immortalized tetraploid female MEFs, we found that the CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P antibody labeled a nuclear antigen in a pattern reminiscent of CTCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, CTCF was visually excluded during interphase from nucleoli and constitutive heterochromatic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burke et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore we also scrutinized CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P relative to the nucleolus, constitutive heterochromatin, and facultative heterochromatin using antibodies against B23, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Spector et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bannister and Kouzarides, 2011</xref>). In wildtype female cells, H3K27me3 is known to be prominently enriched on the inactive X chromosome (Xi). In tetraploid MEFs, it usually appears as two nuclear bodies. CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P was not enriched on the Xi, and we found no evident visual distinction between CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P and total CTCF nuclear distribution regardless of co-staining nucleoli and heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Thus, at a cytological level, CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P appears to distribute similarly as total CTCF in the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P accumulates during the G2/M transition of the cell cycle</title><p>However, a remarkable observation from our immunofluorescence assays was that CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P labeling was not homogeneous in an asynchronous population of MEFs. Some of the nuclei were more intensely labeled by the CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P antibody whereas nuclei stained with total CTCF antibody were uniformly labeled (arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). While it also appears that there were less intensely CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P stained nuclei that were observable particularly when compared to normal IgG staining, this may be attributable to antibody cross reactivity to unmodified CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Since CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P potentially occurs in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kettenbach et al., 2011</xref>) and vertebrates share a high degree of sequence identity surrounding Ser<sup>224</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), we next asked if the mottled CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P pattern is discernable in asynchronous human cells. As predicted, CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P labeling of asynchronous HEK293 revealed that a subset of cells was intensely labeled by the antibody (arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This intimates that this PTM may be associated with a vertebrate-conserved CTCF regulatory mechanism.</p><p>Given the irregular CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P staining of asynchronous cells, we posited that perhaps this PTM is regulated by the cell cycle. To explore this possibility, we performed CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P immunofluorescence on asynchronous MEFs with additional antibodies to cell cycle markers. To identify cells in S phase and G2/M, we labeled cells with antibodies against PCNA and phosphorylated histone H3 Ser<sup>10</sup> (H3S10ph) respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bravo and Macdonald-Bravo, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hendzel et al., 1997</xref>). While a total CTCF antibody labeled 100% of the cells (n = 104), again only a fraction of the cells (23.4%, n = 248) were CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Comparing this fraction to the cell cycle markers revealed that a striking majority (94.8%) of the CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P positive cells were co-labeled with H3S10ph antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P labeling was most prominent in cells in both early G2 and late G2/prophase, as evidenced from the H3S10ph staining pattern (white arrows, early G2; yellow arrows, late G2/prophase. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). There were also CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P positive cells co-stained with PCNA antibody (27.6%) (Orange and magenta arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). However, the majority of these CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P-PCNA double positive cells (81.3%) were also faintly positive for H3S10ph (magenta arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that phosphorylation of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup> likely initiates at the end of S phase and peaks at G2/M. To further evaluate if CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P is enriched at G2/M, we arrested TST-1 mESCs 20 hours with the CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vassilev et al., 2006</xref>). RO-3306 treatment resulted in an accumulation of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P positive cells blocked at G2/M as evident from the concomitant increase in H3S10ph co-staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These data pointed to an association of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P with the G2/M transition of the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>PLK1 phosphorylates CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup></title><p>To explore how CTCF is specifically phosphorylated at the G2/M transition, we first sought to identify which kinase(s) could be phosphorylating CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup> at the end of S and in G2/M. Naturally, our first search criterion was that a prospective kinase also had to be expressed at these stages of the cell cycle. We also presumed that the kinase has a bona fide role limited to G2/M. Using these guidelines, Polo-like kinase I (PLK1) was the most attractive candidate. PLK1 is a regulator of the G2/M transition and phosphorylates mitosis-associated substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barr et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly, PLK1 expression increases from S phase and peaks during G2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Golsteyn et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lake and Jelinek, 1993</xref>). Comparing the consensus PLK1 substrate site to the amino acid sequence flanking CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup> revealed that Ser<sup>224</sup> is a potential target of PLK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nakajima et al., 2003</xref>). Of note, CTCF was not identified as a PLK1 target in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kettenbach et al., 2011</xref>). However, the designation of PLK1 targets in that study was not resultant from direct assay. Similarly, we did not find PLK1 in our CTCF-3xFLAG IP-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) likely due to stringent nuclear extraction conditions used to extract CTCF from the chromatin fraction that disrupted native protein-protein interactions (see Materials and methods). We also examined PLK1 conservation across Nephrozoa by clustering the amino acid sequence identity of orthologs using Clustal. For reference, orthologs of the kinases ATM and GSK3B were also compared. We found that PLK1 conservation mirrors that of its potential CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup> substrate, where the kinase is most conserved amongst vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>).

We performed CTCF and CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P immunofluorescence after 12 hr of treatment with 100 nM or 1000 nM BI 6727 (EC<sub>50</sub> ~10–150 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rudolph et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rudolph et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gorlick et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with inhibition of PLK1, we observed a likely G2/M defect evident in a higher percent of H3S10ph positive cells in BI 6727 treated cells than control (DMSO, 5.6%; 100 nM BI 6727, 11.4%; 1000 nM BI 6727, 29.2%; t = 12 hr; n &gt; 100 cells). While 30.8% (n = 214) of untreated cells were CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P positive, only 18.3% (n = 175) were positive following treatment with 100 nM BI 6727 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The range of EC<sub>50</sub> values for BI 6727 (10–150 nM) suggests that remaining CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P was likely due to incomplete inhibition of PLK1 at this concentration. Supporting this, 1000 nM BI 6727 completely ablated CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P phosphorylation (n = 101) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Total CTCF expression was not affected by 12 hr treatment with BI 6726 at either concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). While this indicates that PLK1 is essential for CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P, treatment with BI 6727 does not exclude the possibility that our observations were an indirect outcome. Therefore, we also performed an in vitro kinase assay with purified recombinant CTCF and PLK1, using both Casein and PLK1 autophosphorylation as positive controls (*** and ** respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Golsteyn et al., 1995</xref>). In support of our hypothesis, we found that PLK1 directly phosphorylated CTCF (*, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, this result did not indicate if CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P had occurred. To test this, we performed the PLK1 in vitro kinase assay without radioactive isotope and we excised the band corresponding to full-length CTCF from the Coomassie stained gel (red box, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Analysis by mass spectrometry revealed phosphorylation at Ser<sup>224</sup>, arguing that indeed PLK1 is the kinase for CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). However, as we did not capture in vivo interactions of CTCF with PLK1 (or CK2), we could not confirm either as the CTCF kinase for certain. Therefore, both PLK and CK2 remain potential CTCF kinases.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P localizes to pericentric regions during mitosis</title><p>We posited that this modification could be observed on condensed chromatids during metaphase. It was previously reported that CTCF remains bound to mitotic chromosomes – both along the dyad arms and at centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rubio et al., 2008</xref>). However it was also reported that CTCF is phosphorylated in its zinc finger domain during mitosis which results in its dissociation from chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sekiya et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, the latter study did not directly identify phosphorylation sites or visualize the mitotic chromatids. Accordingly, to resolve this discord and test our hypothesis, we performed immunofluorescence on mESC metaphase spreads alongside antibody to the facultative heterochromatin mark H3K27me3 that is found on chromatid arms but is excluded from the centromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Terrenoire et al., 2010</xref>). Much like CTCF, CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P could be observed on chromatid arms, albeit not uniformly like CTCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Remarkably, CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P appeared distinctly enriched in between the centromeres of the murine acrocentric chromosomes and the H3K27me3 positive dyad arms. We therefore concluded that the metaphase localization of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P is pericentric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).

Accordingly, we examined the correlation between CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P and CTCF binding as detected by our ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). While there was a detectable linear relationship between CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P and CTCF binding signal, this was only sufficient to explain about half of all CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P binding (R<sup>2</sup>, fraction of variation in CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P binding explained by CTCF binding, for all peaks = 0.48, R<sup>2</sup> for shared peaks = 0.54). Therefore, at least a subset of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP-seq peaks likely represented real binding sites outside of pericentric regions. In addition, as our ChIP-seq was performed in unsynchronized ES cells, which are mostly in interphase (S phase), this suggests that CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P is bound at these regions outside of G2/M as well.</p><p>We next sought to examine features which differentiated regions bound by CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P from regions bound by unmodified CTCF. Shared CTCF and CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP peaks (representing 95.9% of all CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P peaks) had significantly more CTCF binding signal than CTCF peaks in general (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, p&lt;2.2e-16, Wilcoxon rank sum test). While CTCF motifs found in CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P peaks did not tend to be more conserved than motifs found in CTCF ChIP peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>, p=0.1623, Wilcoxon rank sum test), CTCFSer<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP peaks did tend to contain more motifs than CTCF ChIP peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, p&lt;2.2e-16, Wilcoxon rank sum test). In other words, CTCFSer<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP peaks tend to be found at higher affinity sites with greater numbers of CTCF binding sites than CTCF ChIP peaks in general. We also found that shared CTCF and CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP peaks tended to be larger than CTCF peaks in general (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>, p&lt;2.2e-16, Wilcoxon rank sum test), which may in part explain these trends.</p><p>Finally, we compared our CTCF and CTCFSer<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP-seq with a previously published cohesin ChIP-seq done in mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kagey et al., 2010</xref>). While 22.8% and 33.3% of our CTCF ChIP-seq peaks overlapped with SMC1 and SMC3 peaks, respectively, 51.6% and 85.1% of our CTCFSer<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP peaks overlapped with SMC1 and SMC3 peaks, respectively.

We generated doxycycline-inducible S224A- and S224E-3xFLAG mESCs and overexpressed wild type CTCF, S224A or S224E over six days of growth. Ectopic expression of S224E but not wild type or S224A affected growth of mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

We initially posited that CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P may be critical to regulating some chromatin function of CTCF. As CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P was observable in the nucleus in only a fraction of asynchronous cells, it was a remote possibility that Ser<sup>224</sup> is also critical for CTCF nuclear import. Thus, we examined localization of inducible wild type CTCF, S224A, and S224E in MEFs by immunofluorescence.

As we observed CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P bound to only a fraction of CTCF sites genome-wide, it was also a possibility that this amino acid position is critical for DNA binding.

While FLAG binding was enriched at positive control region Cirbp over IgG, the –dox sample and a negative control region Oct4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), the level of binding was much lower than that of CTCF. Similarly, FLAG binding was modestly enriched over IgG, the –dox sample, and Oct4 at at least the two CTCF sites bordering the Mecp2 TAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, Irak1, Ikbkg), as well as at the site bound by phospho-CTCF in the Mecp2 TAD in one replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, Flna), although to an extent much less than that of CTCF. This modest binding of S224E CTCF to the Mecp2 TAD, likely due to endogenous wild-type CTCF remaining in the system, may possibly explain why we were unable to detect changes in chromatin architecture in this region.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Overexpression of CTCF S224E upregulates the p53 signaling pathway and globally plasma membrane proteins at the RNA level</title><p>As we could not attribute the mESC growth phenotype to changes in cell cycle progression, CTCF binding or TAD structure, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify genes that were differentially expressed (DE) when CTCF S224E was induced in mESC’s. We found 375 genes that were DE between two replicates (adjusted p-value&lt;0.01), with 118 (31%) being upregulated and 257 (69%) being downregulated upon overexpression of CTCF S224E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Surprisingly, CTCF was not a DE gene. To confirm that CTCF S224E was expressed, we examined RNA-seq reads overlapping CTCF codon 224 and found that 12–16% of reads had the glutamate codon at position 224 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). This indicates that while CTCF S224E was present, it was not grossly overexpressed at the RNA level; therefore, our observations from modest exogenous expression may reflect the importance of this site. We next looked at coverage of CTCF and CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP-seq over DE genes in an attempt to determine whether DE genes were directly regulated by CTCF. On average, CTCF binding was enriched along both downregulated and upregulated DE genes, albeit at different locations. In particular, downregulated genes were more enriched in CTCF binding upstream of the transcription start site, while upregulated genes were more enriched in CTCF binding along the gene body. CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P enrichment followed a similar pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Next, in order to determine if specific pathways were enriched among our DE genes, we performed functional annotation analysis of upregulated and downregulated DE genes using the PANTHER Overrepresentation Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nikolsky and Bryant, 2009</xref>), with the list of all expressed genes as the background. Among upregulated genes, the only significantly overrepresented PANTHER pathway was the p53 pathway (FDR = 0.0495), most notably including <italic>Trp53</italic> (upregulated 1.3-fold, adjusted p-value&lt;0.00075) and <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> (upregulated 1.3-fold, adjusted p-value&lt;0.00043), genes which were also bound by CTCF and CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Meanwhile, among downregulated genes, the most significant overrepresented cellular component categories were ‘cell periphery’ (FDR = 2.28×10<sup>−6</sup>) and ‘plasma membrane’ (FDR = 3.45×10<sup>−6</sup>), although, many downregulated genes did not fall into these categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). These results suggest that modest CTCF S224E overexpression could lead to the slight activation of p53 signaling, and also global downregulation of proteins on the plasma membrane. The effect may be direct, as CTCF binding was found to be enriched at DE genes or indirect, as RNA-seq was assayed on cells after six days of S224E overexpression in mESCs, when a colony grown phenotype was already apparent. We conclude that the serine 224 of CTCF plays a critical role in regulating gene expression and suggest that the effect on the p53 signaling pathway may partly explain the growth phenotype in mESCs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the quarter century since its discovery, CTCF has been ascribed a multitude of chromatin functions. While DNA sequence composition and CpG methylation are determinants of CTCF binding, a regulatory system independent of DNA binding has remained elusive. Here we discovered and confirmed a CTCF PTM conserved among vertebrates. We observe for the first time that CTCF is differentially regulated during the cell cycle, with CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P being enriched at G2/M and specifically on pericentric regions during metaphase. Notably, CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup> phosphorylation is regulated by the kinase PLK1 whose expression profile also peaks in G2/M. As exogenously expressing S224E leads to colony formation defects and gene expression changes, our data hint at the importance of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P for proper cell function. We were further able exclude several potential functions of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P. First, Ser<sup>224</sup> does not directly affect CTCF binding to DNA. However, while CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P occupies a subset of all CTCF sites genome wide, how this PTM is limited to a fraction of sites on the chromatids and pericentric satellites is still unclear. Second, while overexpression of a S224E leads to colony formation defects, we did not observe any changes in a TAD’s structure, suggesting that CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P may not impact the architectural role of CTCF, at least around the gene-rich <italic>Mecp2</italic> TAD. Third, cell cycle progression and ploidy of cells overexpressing the phospho-mimic were not obviously affected. We conclude that regulation of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P is needed to prevent dysregulation of hundreds of genes, directly or indirectly through mechanisms that likely do not involve CTCF interphase binding, architectural function, cell cycle progression or ploidy. However, an intriguing possibility which we did not investigate is that the negative charge introduced by phosphorylation at Ser224 could alter the conformation of the CTCF protein, altering the manner in which CTCF regulates genes or interacts with other proteins. We hope these observations will provide starting points for further elucidating the natural functions of this CTCF PTM and valuable resources for future study.</p><p>With our observation of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P enrichment proximal to the centromere, several avenues of investigation become conspicuous. First, what could be the pericentric function of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P? For example, CTCF interacts with cohesins and the latter remain at the centromere to facilitate cohesion during metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rubio et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stedman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morales and Losada, 2018</xref>). CTCF has also been found to impede ‘loop extrusion’ activity of the cohesin complex during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vian et al., 2018</xref>). Could a similar capacity be expected for pericentric CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P and the cohesin complex? Likewise, the presence of pericentric CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P may demarcate a topological boundary between the chromatid arms and satellite DNA. Notably, PLK1 also phosphorylates cohesins, promoting their prophase dissociation from the chromatid arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Losada et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hauf et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giménez-Abián et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sumara et al., 2002</xref>). PLK1 phosphorylation of CTCF may also be linked to cohesin dissociation from the chromatids. Another prospective undertaking would be to determine if CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P is present at all pericentromeres. Are all pericentromeres identical? Thus, the identification of this PTM and development of a specific antibody may prove to be an invaluable resource to the cell cycle and mitosis communities.</p><p>PLK1 mediated phosphorylation of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup> may also not be a finite event. Coordinated signaling could occur. The Polo Box Domain (PBD) of PLK1 targets the kinase activity by tethering PLK1 to a phosphopeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lowery et al., 2004</xref>). While CTCF appears to lack an ideal PBD binding site, perhaps PLK1 is recruited to CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup> by a proximal phosphoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elia et al., 2003</xref>). Conversely, what triggers dephosphorylation of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P? Thus exploring the vicinal events surrounding Ser<sup>224</sup> phosphorylation could elucidate the G2/M function of this PTM. Furthermore, as CTCF contains 100 S/T/Y amino acids, there exists the possibility that other bona fide phosphorylation events exist. Similarly, with 65 lysines, CTCF acetylation and/or methylation may also occur and orchestrate a much more complex symphony of insulator regulation. Hence by confirming Ser<sup>224</sup> phosphorylation, we are likely only previewing what could be an expansive CTCF signaling network. While our assays did not elucidate a conspicuous mechanism or functional consequence of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P, nonetheless its identification and generation of a specific antibody to it can be a useful resource. From a disease perspective, this PTM may also serve as a useful biomarker of dividing cells or prove to be a therapeutic target for competitive or allosteric inhibition, if targeting PLK1 directly proves adverse. Lastly, at least 5000 CTCF binding locations are conserved amongst mammalian genomes and these are often associated with syntenic chromatin domain boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vietri Rudan et al., 2015</xref>). As CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P also appears conserved amongst vertebrates, it is an attractive possibility that Ser<sup>224</sup> phosphorylation along with yet confirmed CTCF PTMs may constitute a conserved code that underlies chromatin organization and gene regulation akin to the histone code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenuwein and Allis, 2001</xref>). Elucidation of such a CTCF code may also reveal insights into how interphase contacts are remembered and restored before and after mitosis. This prospective code may also be bifurcated species-specifically by the degree of conservation of particular CTCF PTMs, potentially exposing mechanisms of speciation. Thus, further unmasking CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P and thoroughly validating the entirety of CTCF PTMs would be invaluable to understanding how the ubiquitous insulator’s functions are specified.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and cells</title><p>The <italic>Ctcf<sup>S224A</sup></italic> and <italic>Ctcf<sup>S224E</sup></italic> mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis with Phusion polymerase (NEB) on pcDNA3-CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chao et al., 2002</xref>).

TAD scores were then calculated from the insulation scores using the ‘insulation2tads.pl’ cworld script with default parameters and the Mecp2 TAD boundaries manually defined as the bins chrX: 71,225,000–71,250,000 and chrX: 71,675,000–71,700,000, based on these bins containing CTCF peaks with convergent motifs that aligned visually with the ‘box’ of the TAD region.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>RNA-seq</title><p>RNA from F1-2.1 mESCs carrying a dox-inducible CTCF S224E transgene (clone A2) grown for six days with or without 1 μg/mL doxycycline for 6 days was purified by TRIzol (Thermo Fisher) extraction via manufacturer’s instructions. Polyadenylated mRNA was the selected from total cell RNA using oligo(dT) beads (New England BioLabs). Libraries were constructed using the NEBNext Ultra Direction RNA Second Strand Synthesis Module and the NEBNext ChIP-Seq Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina (New England BioLabs) and sequenced on a HiSeq 2000, resulting in 50–60 million 50-nt paired end reads per sample. Two biological replicates were performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>RNA-seq analysis</title><p>RNA-seq reads were trimmed using cutadapt with the options -e 0.2 -q 20 -a AGATCGGAAGAGC -m 20 --overlap 12. Trimmed reads were aligned to the mm9 reference genome using TopHat2 as previously described. PCR duplicates were removed and HOMER used to tabulate unique reads mapping to exons of each gene. DESeq2 was then used to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes. DE genes were counted as those with adjusted p-value&lt;0.01. Only genes with at least one count in one of the four samples were included in the analysis. MA plot was generated using the plotMA() function of DESeq with LFC estimates generated with the lfcShrink() function of DESeq2 with default parameters.</p><p>For visualizing RNA-seq reads overlapping codon 224 of CTCF, RNA-seq reads were aligned to the CTCF S224E transgene sequence using the same parameters as above and an index of the CTCF S224E transgene sequence generated using bowtie2 with the default parameters. The resulting bam file of aligned reads was then visualized on IGV.</p><p>Overrepresentation analysis of upregulated and downregulated DE genes was done using the PANTHER Classification System (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pantherdb.org">http://www.pantherdb.org</ext-link>). Gene symbols for downregulated or upregulated DE genes used as input lists and the gene symbols of all expressed genes (i.e., all genes used in DESeq2 analysis) were used as the reference list.</p><p>Metagene plots of ChIP-seq over DE upregulated, downregulated and all genes were generated via CEAS using bigwig files of reads from CTCF or CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP-seq (see above).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Clustal alignment</title><p>UniProt indexed CTCF, PLK1, ATM and GSK3B amino acid sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) from mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), rat (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>), human (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>), chimpanzee (<italic>Pan troglodytes</italic>), opossum (<italic>Monodelphis domestica</italic>), chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>), frog (<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>), zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>), sea urchin (<italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic>), fruit fly (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>), and water flea (<italic>Daphnia pulex</italic>) were aligned using Clustal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clustal.org/clustal2/">http://www.clustal.org/clustal2/</ext-link>). The multiple alignments were iterated at each step using the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix with gap opening, extension, and distance penalties set to 10, 0.2, and four respectively.

In particular, the authors have performed CTCF mass spectrometry and identified a novel phosphorylation site at Serine 224. A new antibody is generated to recognize CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P. This phosphorylation is shown to be regulated by PLK1 and enriched during G2/M stages of the cell cycle. Using immunofluorescence, the authors identify that CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P is accumulated at certain pericentric regions of the mitotic chromosomes. With CTCF mutants that either obviate serine phosphorylation (S224A) or mimic constitutive phosphorylation (S224E), the authors characterize the functional significance of Ser<sup>224</sup>-P and find that S224A leads to no defect but S224E causes smaller colonies in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). To explore the function of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P and interpret the observed cell growth defect, the authors find that S224E does not affect CTCF-DNA binding, chromatin architecture, or ploidy, but this mimic of constitutive phosphorylation leads to differential expression of p53 pathway genes in mESCs.</p><p>Overall, this paper contains a large amount of work, which is resourceful for studying PTMs and for understanding the multivalent functions of CTCF. The new CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P antibody, its validation and characterization presented in the paper, are valuable resources.</p><p>Major comments are:</p><p>1) The functional significance of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P is not clear. It is intriguing that the phospho-obviation mutant (S224A) is normal and the phosphor-mimic mutant (S224E) causes defects in mESC colonies. The data presented here suggest that Ser<sup>224</sup> phosphorylation seems dispensable for cell survival, but constitutive phosphorylation at Ser<sup>224</sup> is deleterious to mES cell growth. Since CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P is enriched only at the G2/M transition of the cell cycle and is limited to pericentric regions, the function of Ser<sup>224</sup>-P may be part of the chromatin regulation for mitosis that is multi-layered. However, phosphorylation at Ser<sup>224</sup> may induce a negative charge and alter the domain conformation, which may change CTCF-mediated gene regulation across the cell cycle. Is it possible that CTCF-protein interactions dependent on this domain surrounding Ser<sup>224</sup>, which appears evolutionarily conserved (Figure 1F), and constitutive phosphorylation at Ser<sup>224</sup> may stabilize/weaken the protein-protein interactions? The authors should clarify these possibilities.</p><p>2) The approach and CTCF mass spectrometry taken in this work fail to detect the previously reported CTCF phosphorylations – Ser<sup>604</sup>, Ser<sup>609</sup>, Ser<sup>610</sup>, Ser<sup>612</sup> – in CTCF-3xFLAG induced MEFs or through in vitro CK2 phosphorylation of recombinant CTCF. The authors should add details explaining the &quot;technical hurdles&quot; that preclude the identification/validation of the known phosphorylation sites, or address differences in experimental settings that may explain why the earlier studies did not include Ser<sup>224</sup>-P.</p><p>3) The phospho-CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup> antibody shows a low level of cross-reactivity to the unmodified CTCF (Figure 2A and B). Would this contribute to the ChIP-seq profiles showing CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P DNA-binding within a subset of CTCF binding sites, especially during interphase while CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P is not enriched yet? It would be helpful to clarify the chromatin-association feature of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P, i.e. whether Ser<sup>224</sup>-P is present during interphase and is CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P DNA-bound at defined chromosomal regions beyond the G2/M transition phase.</p><p>4) The authors show that both CK2 and PLK1 can phosphorylate CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup> with in vitro kinase assay combined with mass spectrometry. Given that PLK1 is associated with G2/M transition and is most conserved among vertebrates, PLK1 is proposed as the specific kinase for CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P. However, as the authors indicated, a direct CTCF-PLK1 interaction was not found in either HeLa cells or in CTCF-2xFLAG MEFs, and that the loss of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P observed with PLK1 inhibition in MEFs may be an indirect effect.

One viable idea is that CTCF post-translational modifications contributes to this richness of function, although specific evidence supporting this idea is either sparse or somewhat contradictory. In this manuscript Del Rosario and colleagues identify a novel phosphorylation site at Serine 224 in CTCF. They show that the site is phosphorylated by PLK1. They then attempt to identify the function of this form of CTCF. By generating a specific antibody as well as other reagents, they show this modified form accumulates at the G2/M transition of the cell cycle and is enriched at pericentric heterochromatin. They also performed ChIP-seq on this modified form of CTCF and show that it binds to a subset of CTCF binding sites in the genome. Overexpression of a transgene with a phospho-mimic mutation adversely affected ES cell growth but a series of experiments designed to examine the nature of this phenotype did not reveal anything striking that could account for such a phenotype. In conclusion, the authors demonstrate a new modified form of CTCF but much remains to determine whether this modification contributes to a specific function in the cell.</p><p>Figure 3: Treatment with the PLK1 inhibitor, BI 6727.

It is intriguing that the phospho-obviation mutant (S224A) is normal and the phosphor-mimic mutant (S224E) causes defects in mESC colonies. The data presented here suggest that Ser<sup>224</sup> phosphorylation seems dispensable for cell survival, but constitutive phosphorylation at Ser<sup>224</sup> is deleterious to mES cell growth. Since CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P is enriched only at the G2/M transition of the cell cycle and is limited to pericentric regions, the function of Ser<sup>224</sup>-P may be part of the chromatin regulation for mitosis that is multi-layered. However, phosphorylation at Ser<sup>224</sup> may induce a negative charge and alter the domain conformation, which may change CTCF-mediated gene regulation across the cell cycle. Is it possible that CTCF-protein interactions dependent on this domain surrounding Ser<sup>224</sup>, which appears evolutionarily conserved (Figure 1F), and constitutive phosphorylation at Ser<sup>224</sup> may stabilize/weaken the protein-protein interactions? The authors should clarify these possibilities.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we do believe there is a possibility that PTMs may influence the way in which CTCF regulates genes as well as interactions between CTCF and other proteins. We hope that the resources we provide to the community will encourage exploration of these possibilities. We have modified the Discussion to include several of the scenarios that the reviewer suggests as we also believe they are exceptional starting points for further research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The approach and CTCF mass spectrometry taken in this work fail to detect the previously reported CTCF phosphorylations – Ser<sup>604</sup>, Ser<sup>609</sup>, Ser<sup>610</sup>, Ser<sup>612</sup> – in CTCF-3xFLAG induced MEFs or through in vitro CK2 phosphorylation of recombinant CTCF. The authors should add details explaining the &quot;technical hurdles&quot; that preclude the identification/validation of the known phosphorylation sites, or address differences in experimental settings that may explain why the earlier studies did not include Ser<sup>224</sup>-P.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the subsection “Murine CTCF is phosphorylated at a highly conserved position, Ser<sup>224</sup>”, to more thoroughly explain the technical details preventing detection of CTCF phosphorylation at previously reported sites Ser<sup>604</sup>, Ser<sup>609</sup>, Ser<sup>610</sup>, Ser<sup>612</sup>. Namely, these sites reside in a region of CTCF poorly cut by trypsin and chymotrypsin. Therefore, mass spectrometry could not determine which of these sites is phosphorylated. We would also like to note that the previous studies (1-5) did not directly determine, for example through phosphorylation experiments with recombinant proteins, if CK2 was phosphorylating Ser<sup>604</sup>, Ser<sup>609</sup>, Ser<sup>610</sup>, Ser<sup>612</sup>. In addition, the previous mass spectrometry studies which identified these phospho-sites were global studies which did not provide spectra or other further validation of these individual sites, making direct comparison with our study difficult (3-5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The phosphor-CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup> antibody shows a low level of cross-reactivity to the unmodified CTCF (Figure 2A and B). Would this contribute to the ChIP-seq profiles showing CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P DNA-binding within a subset of CTCF binding sites, especially during interphase while CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P is not enriched yet? It would be helpful to clarify the chromatin-association feature of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P, i.e. whether Ser<sup>224</sup>-P is present during interphase and is CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P DNA-bound at defined chromosomal regions beyond the G2/M transition phase.</p></disp-quote><p>While the cross-reactivity of the CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P antibody with unmodified CTCF could potentially contribute to the ChIP-seq profiles, we do not believe the CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP-seq is purely a result of this cross-reactivity. If this were the case, we would expect the CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP-seq to display a low level of binding at all CTCF ChIP peaks, with CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P binding directly correlating to that of CTCF. To test this possibility, we plotted of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P versus CTCF ChIP-seq coverage at all CTCF peaks (Figure 4D, black dots) and at shared CTCF and CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP-seq peaks (Figure 4D, red dots). While there was a detectable linear relationship between CTCF and CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P binding signal for both sets of peaks, this was only sufficient to explain half of all CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P binding (R<sup>2</sup>, fraction of variation in CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P binding explained by CTCF binding, for all peaks = 0.48, R<sup>2</sup> for shared peaks = 0.54). Therefore, we believe at least a subset of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP-seq peaks likely represent real binding sites outside of pericentric regions. In addition, as the ChIP-seq was performed in a population of unsynchronized ES cells, which are mostly in interphase (S phase), this would suggest that CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P is present outside of the G2/M phase of the cell cycle as well. We have clarified these possibilities in the second paragraph of the subsection “CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P binds to a subset of CTCF binding sites during interphase”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors show that both CK2 and PLK1 can phosphorylate CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup> with in vitro kinase assay combined with mass spectrometry. Given that PLK1 is associated with G2/M transition and is most conserved among vertebrates, PLK1 is proposed as the specific kinase for CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P. However, as the authors indicated, a direct CTCF-PLK1 interaction was not found in either HeLa cells or in CTCF-2xFLAG MEFs, and that the loss of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P observed with PLK1 inhibition in MEFs may be an indirect effect. Therefore, possible direct evidence supporting Figure 3 &quot;CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup> is phosyphorylated by PLK1 and prominently labels pericentric chromatin&quot; should include immunofluorescence for PLK1 in combination with CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P on metaphase chromosomes. In addition, is CK2 also involved in regulating CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P phosphorylation? The authors should clarify the data with CK2, with respect to PLK1, as possible kinase for CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments. Although the reviewer is correct that we did not observe direct CTCF-PLK1 interactions in the co-IP experiments, we believe that this negative result does not preclude PLK1 (or any other kinase) from phosphorylating CTCF. Kinase-substrate interactions are highly transient, making their co-IP exceptionally challenging. The Kd’s are probably well above the nM range. Additionally, in order to IP CTCF from the chromatin fraction, CTCF was extracted in 2M salt, anionic detergent, and reducing agent. This combination likely prevents capture of native protein-protein interactions. In general, because of the harsh conditions they are often done in, we believe IP assays are not necessarily demonstrative of bona fide direct protein-protein interactions in the way that in vitro binding or kinase assays are. We have edited the text to clarify this point. Similarly, the metaphase spread immunofluorescence experiments were not intended to directly address whether PLK1 is directly interacting with CTCF because immunofluorescence does not provide the needed resolution to truly determine if two proteins are interacting as enzyme and substrate. As many previous studies have already shown PLK1 to be chromatin associated during mitosis, we expect that the CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P and PLK1 co-IF would show wide overlap, but that PLK1 would also be found widely on chromatin arms outside of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P bound regions as well; therefore we do not think that this experiment would lend support to PLK1 being the specific kinase of CTCF. We provide direct evidence for PLK1 being the CTCF kinase in mass spectrometry experiments performed with recombinant CTCF and PLK1 (Figure 3F); however similar experiments were also positive for CTCF and CK2 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). While we still believe that PLK1 is more likely to be the CTCF kinase than CK2 due to both the expression pattern of PLK1 and the appearance of CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P peaking in G2/M, we agree with the reviewer that our experiments did not capture an in vivointeraction with PLK1 or CK2 and have amended the text to more clearly present both as potential CTCF kinases (subsection “PLK1 phosphorylates CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] Figure 3: Treatment with the PLK1 inhibitor, BI 6727.

As shown, percentage of H3S10ph positive cells concomitantly increases with increasing concentration of BI 6727. This indicates that PLK1 inhibition by BI 6727 induces a G2/M block. The increase in G2/M blockage between 100nM and 1000nM BI 6727 may indicate that PLK1 inhibition is not complete at the lower concentration, possibly explaining why there is remaining CTCF Ser224-P in this condition. Agreeing with this, the EC<sub>50</sub> for BI 6727 in different cell lines ranges from 10-150nM (6-8). We have clarified this point in the text. Unfortunately, we were not able to provide immunofluorescence for a control protein phosphorylated by PLK1, as we were unable to find high-quality antibodies for both such a substrate and its specific phosphorylated form.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: ChIP-seq.

Shared CTCF and CTCFSer<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP peaks (representing the vast majority, 95.9% of all CTCFSer<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP peaks) had significantly more CTCF binding signal than CTCF peaks in general (p &lt; 2.2e-16, Wilcoxon test). This suggests that the CTCFSer<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP peaks are indeed found at higher affinity CTCF sites than CTCF ChIP peaks in general.</p><p>We then analyzed the nature of CTCF motifs found in CTCF and CTCFSer<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP peaks. While CTCF motifs found in CTCFSer<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP peaks did not tend to be more conserved than motifs found in CTCF ChIP peaks (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E, p = 0.1623, Wilcoxon test), CTCFSer<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP peaks did tend to contain more motifs than CTCF ChIP peaks (Figure 4F, p &lt; 2.2e-16, Wilcoxon test). In other words, while CTCFSer224-P binding sites do not appear to be more conserved than CTCF binding sites in general, they do tend to be found at locations with greater numbers of CTCF binding sites. We also found that shared CTCF and CTCFSer<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP peaks tended to be larger than CTCF ChIP peaks in general (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F), which may in part explain some of these trends.</p><p>Finally, we compared our CTCF and CTCFSer<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP-seq peaks with a previously published cohesin ChIP done in mouse embryonic stem cells (9). While 22.8% and 33.3% of our CTCF ChIP-seq peaks overlapped with SMC1 and SMC3 peaks, respectively, 51.6% and 85.1% of our CTCFSer<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP-seq peaks overlapped with SMC1 and SMC3 peaks, respectively. This suggests that CTCFSer<sup>224</sup>-P ChIP-seq peaks also tend to be more found at sites where cohesin co-binds.</p><p>We have edited the text to include this further characterization of our CTCFSer<sup>224</sup>-P peak (subsection “CTCF Ser<sup>224</sup>-P binds to a subset of CTCF binding sites during interphase”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 8: In the Hi-C experiment using overexpressed CTCF wild-type and mutant transgenes, were the mutant CTCF proteins found at the sub-TAD domain? RNA seq suggests that S224E is only modestly expressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments. To check to what extent the mutant S224E CTCF is bound to the sub-TAD region, we did FLAG ChIP-qPCR in doxycycline inducible S224E-3xFLAG mESCs after 48h of dox induction, the same conditions under which the Hi-C<sup>2</sup> experiment was performed (Figure 8C). While FLAG binding was detected to be enriched at one of the positive control regions over IgG and the –dox sample or a negative control region (Figure 8C, Cirbp versus Oct4), the level of binding was much lower than that of CTCF. This is consistent with low expression of CTCF S224E versus the endogenous WT CTCF, as suggested by the RNA-seq. We next examined the Mecp2 TAD for CTCF peaks most likely to have the potential to affect chromatin architecture, selecting the CTCF peaks at the TAD borders (Figure 8A, Irak1 and Ikbkg) and well as the peak at the sub-TAD border which is bound by CTCF Ser224-P (Figure 8A, Flna). FLAG binding was modestly enriched over IgG, the -dox sample and a negative control region at the two CTCF binding sites bordering the TAD(Figure 8C, Irak1, Ikbkg versus Oct4), as well as Flna in one replicate, although again the level of binding was much lower than that of CTCF. This suggests that CTCF S224E binding at the Mecp2 TAD is indeed much lower than binding of the endogenous WT CTCF, possibly explaining why we were unable to detect changes in chromatin architecture in the region upon S224E overexpression. We have modified the text to explain this accordingly.</p><p>Note that we have also slightly adjusted the TAD borders for the TAD score calculation in 8B to align with the CTCF peaks tested by FLAG-ChIP (Figure 8A, C, Irak1 and Ikbkg).</p><p>References:</p><p>1) E.
