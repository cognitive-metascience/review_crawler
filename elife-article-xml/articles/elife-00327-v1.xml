gene transcripts. The HIV-1 Tat protein selectively recruits P-TEFb as part of a super elongation complex (SEC) organized on a flexible AFF1 or AFF4 scaffold. To understand this specificity and determine if scaffold binding alters P-TEFb conformation, we determined the structure of a tripartite complex containing the recognition regions of P-TEFb and AFF4. AFF4 meanders over the surface of the P-TEFb cyclin T1 (CycT1) subunit but makes no stable contacts with the CDK9 kinase subunit. Interface mutations reduced CycT1 binding and AFF4-dependent transcription. AFF4 is positioned to make unexpected direct contacts with HIV Tat, and Tat enhances P-TEFb affinity for AFF4. These studies define the mechanism of scaffold recognition by P-TEFb and reveal an unanticipated intersubunit pocket on the AFF4 SEC that potentially represents a target for therapeutic intervention against HIV/AIDS.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00327.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00327.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00327.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The rates at which many genes are expressed as proteins are limited by the efficiency of a process called transcriptional elongation. This process takes place as the stretch of DNA that defines the gene is transcribed into an RNA molecule and it is catalyzed by an enzyme called RNA polymerase II. However, this enzyme can become trapped, and another enzyme called P-TEFb (positive transcription elongation factor b) is needed to release it. P-TEFb and other elongation factors therefore have an important role in gene expression.</p><p>The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that hijacks the gene expression processes in human immune cells to replicate the RNA genome of the virus. To do this, the virus produces a protein called Tat that recruits P-TEFb as part of a multi-protein machine called the super elongation complex. This ensures that the process of transcriptional elongation, and hence the overall replication process, is highly efficient. There are gaps, however, in our knowledge of the architecture of the super elongation complex, which is known to be organized on a flexible scaffold. In turn, the molecular basis for the interaction between HIV-1 Tat and P-TEFb within the super elongation complex is not well understood.</p><p>Now Schulze-Gahmen et al. show that only one of the two subunits in P-TEFb—a cyclin known as CycT1—binds to the AFF4 scaffold protein in the super elongation complex. In addition to assisting with the expression of hundreds of human genes, super elongation complexes containing P-TEFb-AFF4 are hijacked in various forms of cancer and viral infections, including HIV/AIDS. Schulze-Gahmen et al. show that AFF4 can directly contact HIV-1 Tat, which binds to the P-TEFb-AFF4 complex much more strongly than it binds to P-TEFb alone. This suggests that HIV-1 Tat evolved to work within the super elongation complex. Moreover, Schulze-Gahmen et al. reveal that HIV-1 Tat binds to a cleft between the P-TEFb enzyme and the AFF4 protein, which raises the possibility that this cleft could be used as a target for anti-HIV/AIDS drugs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00327.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00327.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>transcription elongation</kwd><kwd>super elongation complex</kwd><kwd>SEC</kwd><kwd>intrinsically disordered protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI41757-11, R01AI095057</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Qiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>California HIV/AIDS Research Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ID09-B-026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alber</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50GM82250</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alber</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name><name><surname>Krogan</surname><given-names>Nevan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structure-function analysis of the super elongation complex formed when HIV replicates inside cells reveals that the HIV-1 Tat protein binds to a cleft between P-TEFb, an enzyme that is involved in normal transcription, and AFF4, a protein that is used to build the super elongation complex</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>At many genes in humans—including the integrated HIV genome as well as loci that regulate development and mediate responses to stress—RNA polymerase II initiates transcription but forms a stable paused complex after the synthesis of 30–50 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Levine, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Luo et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). These paused polymerases are poised for rapid, synchronous efficient transcription. For these genes, escape of the paused polymerase from the promoter-proximal region and elongation of the mRNA are rate-limiting regulated processes. Promoter escape requires positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), a heterodimeric protein kinase composed of CDK9 and cyclin T1 (CycT1) subunits. P-TEFb triggers promoter escape by directly or indirectly stimulating phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain and the associated factors, NELF (negative elongation factor) and DSIF (DRB sensitivity inducing factor). Consequently, recruitment of active P-TEFb to the paused polymerase complex serves as an important checkpoint for gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Levine, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Luo et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>P-TEFb cycles between inactive and active complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhou and Yik, 2006</xref>). Recent studies of gene fusions in myeloid leukemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Yokoyama et al., 2010</xref>), as well as complexes recruited to the HIV promoter by the HIV Tat protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">He et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sobhian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jager et al., 2012</xref>), uncovered a family of Super Elongation Complexes (SECs) that bring together active P-TEFb and other transcription elongation factors. The SECs act at many normal human genes to stimulate mRNA elongation not only by triggering promoter escape but also by limiting proteolytic degradation of transcription elongation factors and increasing the processivity of RNAP II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">He et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biswas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). The SECs also couple to the PAF complex, which stimulates efficient transcript elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">He et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to P-TEFb, the SECs contain subunits in the AF4, ELL, and ENL/AF9 protein families. Despite the major roles of SECs in metazoan gene expression and human disease, little is known about the architecture of these complexes.</p><p>To define the interactions that mediate SEC assembly and to understand how HIV Tat recruits P-TEFb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wei et al., 1998</xref>) in the context of these large protein complexes, we mapped contacts among SEC subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chou et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we report the structural and functional analysis of P-TEFb in complex with the cognate binding site on the SEC scaffold protein, AFF4. These studies reveal that AFF4 recognizes P-TEFb by binding the CycT1 subunit on the side opposite from CDK9. AFF4 is positioned to make direct contacts with HIV-1 Tat. Tat increases the affinity of P-TEFb for AFF4 by over an order of magnitude in vitro and rescues P-TEFb binding of AFF4 interface mutants in vivo. These results suggest that the SEC scaffold is an unanticipated direct partner of HIV-1 Tat, and an intersubunit Tat-binding pocket in the AFF4-P-TEFb complex may afford an unexpected site to target with selective inhibitors of HIV transcription.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00327.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>AFF4 binds CycT1 distal to CDK9.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic model of the SEC.

Superposition of the CycT1 subunits of the structures of Tat-P-TEFb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tahirov et al., 2010</xref>) and AFF4-P-TEFb shows that Tat is positioned to pack against helix 2 of AFF4.

Direct measurements of Tat affinity are problematic, however, because Tat is unstable in vitro in the absence of partners and difficult to maintain in an active form. To overcome this problem, we took advantage of a thermodynamic cycle that illustrates that AFF4 and Tat mutually influence the P-TEFb affinity of each other by the same amount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In quantitative in vitro assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), the purified AFF4<sub>2–73</sub> peptide bound Tat-P-TEFb (K<sub>d</sub> = 0.85 ± 0.15 nM) ∼11 times more tightly than P-TEFb (K<sub>d</sub> = 10 ± 1 nM). The AFF4<sub>2–363</sub> segment also bound Tat-P-TEFb (K<sub>d</sub> = 0.6 ± 0.1 nM) ∼11 times more tightly than P-TEFb (K<sub>d</sub> = 7 ± 1 nM). These results support the model of direct Tat interactions with AFF4 and suggest that the AFF4<sub>2–73</sub> peptide includes the principal residues that contact Tat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To test the importance of the AFF4 interactions for P-TEFb and Tat recognition in vivo, we measured the effects of mutations in AFF4 on the binding of SEC subunits and Tat in HeLa cells. Cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant AFF4 containing a C-terminal 3× FLAG tag, and immunoprecipitations using an anti-FLAG antibody were probed for the presence of associated factors. Alanine substitutions in P-TEFb contacts such as AFF4 Phe35, Tyr59/Asp60, and Lys63/Asp64 reduced binding of P-TEFb but not the ELL2, AF9, or ENL subunits of the SEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These defects were rescued by overexpressing a stably integrated gene for Tat, which strengthened the AFF4-P-TEFb association. In contrast, tandem alanine substitutions for AFF4 Glu61/Met62, which are more exposed in the P-TEFb interface and predicted to contact Tat, caused a small reduction (∼30%) in the binding of P-TEFb that was not rescued by overexpressing Tat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The specificity of these mutational effects supports the model that Tat interacts directly with AFF4.</p><p>In keeping with the tenuous contacts of the AFF4<sub>3–21</sub> helix with CDK9, AFF4<sub>2–73</sub> (K<sub>d</sub> = 10 ± 1 nM) binds only 3.6 times more tightly than AFF4 <sub>32–67</sub> (K<sub>d</sub> = 36 ± 4 nM) to P-TEFb (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). In addition, the CDK9 kinase subunit structure is little changed upon AFF4 binding to P-TEFb (CDK9<sub>15–360</sub> RMSD = 0.54 Å vs 1BLQ). In vivo, the Glu13Ala/Arg14Ala AFF4 mutant in the heart of the CDK9 interface in the crystals is associated with a &lt;25% decrease in transcription stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and little change in P-TEFb binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

By comparison, Tat stimulated P-TEFb by sevenfold, and addition of AFF<sub>2-73</sub> did not further stimulate the kinase activity of the Tat-P-TEFb complex.

These contacts are largely conserved in AF4 family members and can be perturbed physically and functionally by mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with these results, tandem alanine substitutions of Pro33/Leu34, Val41/Thr42, Arg51/Ile52, and Met55/Leu56 in the CycT1 binding site (but not Arg3/Glu4 or Glu25/Asp26 in the preceding segment) also reduce P-TEFb binding in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chou et al., 2012</xref>). The impacts of alanine substitutions on transcriptional stimulation by AFF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) show that residues in the P-TEFb interface, as well as helix stabilizing residues, play crucial roles. The additional sensitivity of transcriptional stimulation to alanine substitutions of disordered residues flanking the CycT1 binding site suggests that the flexibility and potential interactions with other ligands are important for function.</p><p>HIV-1 Tat binds adjacent to AFF4, increases the affinity of AFF4 for P-TEFb by over an order of magnitude, and rescues P-TEFb binding to AFF4 interface mutants in vivo. The AFF4 Glu61/Met62 double alanine substitution in the proposed Tat interface blocks this rescue. These results suggest that direct contacts between Tat and the AFF4 scaffold in complex with P-TEFb mediate the selective recruitment of the SEC to the HIV promoter. The functional AFF4-Tat interface, including the acetylated Lys28 in Tat as a potential regulator of affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kiernan et al., 1999</xref>), supports the idea that Tat evolved to function within the SEC. In the crystal structure of the (low-affinity) Tat-P-TEFb subcomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tahirov et al., 2010</xref>), Tat binds to a relatively open groove. In the context of the AFF4-P-TEFb structure, however, AFF4 creates an unanticipated pocket for Tat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Each baculovirus was amplified (2×), plaque purified, and amplified (3×) to obtain a stock with 10<sup>8</sup> plaque forming units (PFU)/ml. Test infections were screened for expression levels of the target proteins by Western blot analysis, and the highest expressing virus stock was used.</p><p>For large-scale production of P-TEFb, 4 l of High5 cells at 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in ESF921 medium (Expression Systems, Reno, NV) were infected with 20 ml of virus stock per liter of culture. The flasks were incubated for 52 hr at 27°C on a rotary shaker. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 30 min at 350x<italic>g</italic> in a Beckmann JLA-8.1 rotor, washed quickly in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and centrifuged at 350×<italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen. For large-scale production of P-TEFb-Tat, insect cells were coinfected with 20 ml each of CDK9, CycT1, and Tat virus stocks. The remaining steps were the same as for production of P-TEFb.</p><p>AFF4<sub>2–73</sub> was cloned into a modified pET28 plasmid. The recombinant protein includes a N-terminal TEV-protease-cleavable His-tag. The plasmid was transformed into Rosetta(DE3)pLysS. 3 l of transformed <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> were grown at 37°C to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.6, and expression was induced with 0.3 mM IPTG at 18°C for 16 hr. Cells were harvested, and pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Purification of the AFF4-P-TEFb complex</title><p>Pellets from 4 l infected High5 cells were resuspended in 75 ml lysis buffer (20 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) with 1 × Roche Complete Protease Inhibitor and 0.5 mM AEBSF. Cells were lysed with a Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was brought up to 0.2 M NaCl by adding 3.0 ml 5 M NaCl, incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 5800x<italic>g</italic> in a SS34 rotor. The supernatant was saved, and the pellet extracted again with 30 ml lysis buffer in the homogenizer. The supernatants of the two centrifugations were combined, cleared by centrifugation at 210,000×<italic>g</italic> in an ultracentrifuge, and filtered through a 0.8-μm syringe filter. The cleared lysate was loaded onto a 5 ml His-Trap HP column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated in buffer A (20 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 0.3 M NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 20 mM imidazole). After washing for 10 column volumes with buffer A + 1 M NaCl, followed by 10 column volumes of buffer A, P-TEFb was eluted with a gradient from 0% A to 100% B (20 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 0.3 M NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 M imidazole, 1 mM DTT). The eluted P-TEFb was dialyzed for 3 hr against 2 L buffer A. TEV-protease was added to the protein at a 1:25 (wt/wt) ratio, and the digest was incubated for 1 hr at room temperature and 4°C overnight. The digest was loaded on a His-Trap HP column, and P-TEFb lacking the His tag eluted in the flow-through of the column, while undigested protein and TEV-protease eluted later in the imidazole gradient. The yield was ∼0.8 mg P-TEFb/L High5 cell culture.</p><p>The Tat-P-TEFb complex was purified in a similar way. The cell lysate was purified over a 5 ml His-Trap HP column, dialyzed, and digested with TEV protease as described above. The digested complex was diluted with 1.1 volumes of 20 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.3, 1 mM DTT, 1% β-octyl-glucoside to a final concentration of 0.14 M NaCl, and 0.5% β-octyl-glucoside and applied to a Source S anion exchange column equilibrated in 20 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.3, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT. The column was developed with a linear gradient to 20 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.3, 0.75 M NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT. P-TEFb-Tat eluted as single peak at about 0.25 M NaCl.</p><p>To purify AFF4<sub>2–73</sub>, 30 g of <italic>E. coli</italic> cell pellet was resuspended in 125 ml lysis buffer (25 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 0.2 M NaCl, and 1 mM DTT). Lysozyme was added to 0.1 mg/ml final concentration and incubated for 30 min. After adding Roche Complete Protease Inhibitor without EDTA, 0.5 mM AEBSF, and DNaseI (5 units/ml), the cells were lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged for 1 hr at 17,000 rpm in a SS34 rotor. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.8-μm syringe filter and applied to a 5 ml His-Trap column. The protein was purified as described for P-TEFb.</p><p>The separately purified P-TEFb and AFF4<sub>2–73</sub> were combined at a 1:1.4 (mol/mol) ratio, concentrated to 0.6 ml, and injected onto an analytical Superdex S200 gel exclusion column equilibrated with 25 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 0.2 M NaCl, and 1 mM DTT. The center fractions of the eluted three-protein peak were used for crystallization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Crystallization and structure determination</title><p>The purified AFF4-P-TEFb complex was concentrated to 10 mg/ml using Millipore Ultrafree centrifugal devices. Crystals were grown from 1.0 µl protein combined with 0.5 µl silver bullet condition 30 (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA; 0.33% wt/vol Gly-Phe, 0.33% wt/vol Gly-Tyr, and 0.33% wt/vol Leu-Gly-Gly in 20 mM Na-HEPES pH 6.8) and 0.5 µl reservoir solution equilibrated against 16–18% PEG 3350, 0.1 M Na-HEPES pH 7.0. After equilibrating for 24 hr, diluted microseeds from previous crystallization experiments were added with a hair. Seeding produced large single crystals (0.3 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm) with and without 1 mM AMPPNP, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The presence of all three proteins in the crystals was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry of dissolved crystals.</p><p>Crystals were soaked in cryoprotectant (25% PEG 3350, 0.1 M Na-HEPES pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 1:4 silver bullet 30) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data were collected at Beamline 8.3.1 at the Advanced Light Source at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">MacDowell et al., 2004</xref>). The best data were collected from a crystal that was grown in the presence of 1 mM AMPPNP and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.

The asymmetric unit contains three complexes. Initial refinement using PHENIX was performed with model restraints, as well as noncrystallographic symmetry restraints. Model restraints were removed in later stages of refinement. AFF4 was built manually and the model was adjusted using Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>). The model was refined using gradient minimization with weight optimization and maximum-likelihood targets, TLS refinement, and individual atomic B-factor refinement. The model was checked against composite omit maps. Density was missing for residues 1–7 and 88–95 in CDK9 mol1 and mol3, and residues 1–7 and 89–97 in CDK9 mol2. Density also was absent for residues 1–7 and 253–264 in CycT1 mol1, residues 1–7 and 257–264 in CycT1 mol2 and mol3, and residues 2–33 and 67–73 in AFF4, mol1 and mol3. For AFF4 in molecule 2 residues 2, 22–33, and 67–73 are missing.</p><p>The register of the AFF4 sequence in the electron density was confirmed by locating the Se atoms in crystals grown with SeMet-labeled AFF4. AFF4<sub>2−73</sub> was labeled with SeMet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Van Duyne et al., 1993</xref>) and purified as described above.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission want to reveal their identity: Wes Sundquist, Reviewing editor. The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports.</p><p>The authors describe the structure and associated biochemistry of the complex between P-TEFb and the relevant binding region of the SEC scaffold, AFF4. Overall, this work is of high technical quality and represents an important advance.</p><p>The crystal structure reveals that an otherwise unstructured epitope within aff4 (residues 34–66) binds P-TEFb, and meanders across an exposed surface of the Cyclin T1 subunit. The structure is at relatively low resolution (2.9 Å), but the crystallography appears technically strong and the overall similarity of the three complexes in the asymmetric unit also lends confidence. The structure reveals how P-TEFb binds the aff4 scaffold, and the observed Cyclin T1-AFF4 interactions are strongly supported by extensive binding studies using mutant Cyclin T1 proteins and transcription activation data using mutant aff4 proteins. A very interesting point is that the bound aff4 peptide approaches the Tat binding site, suggesting that aff4 may contact Tat directly. This hypothesis is nicely supported by the demonstration that aff4 binds 11-fold more tightly to the P-TEFb:Tat complex than to P-TEFb alone. Supporting IP data also show that Tat expression can “rescue” the effects of aff4 mutations that would otherwise inhibit Cyclin T1 binding, although these studies do not unambiguously identify aff4 residues that contact Tat (Glu61/Met62 are presented as attractive candidates, but the binding/rescue effects are small). The discovery that Tat probably contacts aff4 directly is significant, and adds aff4 as an important component to the previously characterized pTEFb/Tat/TAR complex.</p><p>The authors should provide:</p><p>1) Additional evidence for the modeled Tat-AFF4 interaction. This could be done by testing the effects of mutations at aff4 positions 61-63 on Tat enhancement of aff4 binding to P-TEFb in the in vitro binding assay. This would provide a clear quantitative assessment of the modeled binding pocket.</p><p>2) Additional analysis of the (putative) AFF4-CDK9 interaction. This contact is only seen in one of the complexes in the asymmetric unit, but multiple binding experiments suggest that interactions the N-terminal region of aff4 and the CDK9 subunit probably increase the affinity of the AFF4:P-TEFb complex by about four-fold (e.g., the data in Table 2), and mutations in this region of aff4 can have significant (albeit not overwhelming) effects on transcriptional activation (Figure 3B). Testing one or two structure-based aff4 point mutants would address whether or not this (admittedly weak) contact actually occurs in solution. Both types of requested aff4 mutants could be analyzed in the FP competition experiments (as reported for other aff4 constructs in Table 2).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00327.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We would like to explore with you the necessity of providing additional data to assess 1) the Tat interaction with aff4 and 2) the aff4 interaction with CDK9. In general, we are concerned that the suggested experiments would not be definitive and that they would delay dissemination of the discovery of the intersubunit pocket for Tat.</p><p>As appreciated in the review, we provided significant evidence for a direct Tat interaction with AFF4. In addition to the proximity of aff4 and Tat in the respective cocrystal structures, we showed that Tat enhances aff4 binding 11-fold in vitro, that Tat rescues P-TEFb binding to aff4 interface mutants in vivo, and that the aff4 61/62 double alanine substitution in the proposed Tat interface blocks this rescue. Moreover, K28 of Tat, which is engaged in the aff4 interaction in our model but exposed to solvent in the Tat-P-TEFb complex, is acetylated in vivo and this modification regulates Tat functions.</p><p>While each of these experiments is not by itself definitive, together they make the case for a direct Tat-AFF4 interaction. Indeed, the suggestion that we assay quadruple aff4 mutants including the 61/62 di-alanine substitution is predicated partly on our result that this double mutation blocks Tat rescue of the interaction of P-TEFb with the mutant AFF4. There is no doubt that the requested experiments could provide additional examples of the concepts we demonstrated, but they would not add new lines of proof.</p><p>Similarly, analysis of additional mutants in the N-terminal helix stabilized by intermolecular interactions in the crystals would not provide definitive evidence about the partner of this sequence. If we had proposed that this segment of aff4 functions to bind CDK9, we suspect the reviewers would have noted our naïveté about an interaction of a 20-residue helix between molecules in one of 3 crystal complexes that makes a non-complementary interface and contributes less than one kcal per mole to the affinity. Moreover, they would have pointed out that the 13/14 di-alanine mutant in the heart of the interface is associated with a &lt;25% decrease in transcription stimulation (Figure 3B) and little change in P-TEFb binding (Figure 4C) in vivo.</p><p>Rather than making and assaying a handful of additional mutants, we edited the manuscript to clarify the conclusions and tie them back to the data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
