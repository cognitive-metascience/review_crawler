potential to interrogate the host-pathogen interaction (Tezera et al., 2017a). Here, we use the model to investigate mechanisms whereby immune checkpoint therapy for cancer paradoxically activates TB infection. In patients, PD-1 is expressed in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb)-infected lung tissue but is absent in areas of immunopathology. In the microsphere model, PD-1 ligands are up-regulated by infection, and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is further induced by hypoxia. Inhibition of PD-1 signalling increases Mtb growth, and augments cytokine secretion. TNF-Î± is responsible for accelerated Mtb growth, and TNF-Î± neutralisation reverses augmented Mtb growth caused by anti-PD-1 treatment. In human TB, pulmonary TNF-Î± immunoreactivity is increased and circulating PD-1 expression negatively correlates with sputum TNF-Î± concentrations. Together, our findings demonstrate that PD-1 regulates the immune response in TB, and inhibition of PD-1 accelerates Mtb growth via excessive TNF-Î± secretion.</p></abstract><kwd-group

pandemic, killing more people than any other infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wallis et al., 2016</xref>). TB involves a complex host-pathogen interaction, with humans and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) having undergone prolonged co-evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Menardo et al., 2019</xref>). TB has often been thought to primarily result from loss of immune control, because approximately 90% individuals infected with TB never progress to active disease, and this progression is increased in the context of immune deficiency; such as in cases of HIV infection, in infants, people with genetic deficiency of the IL-12/IFN-Î³ signalling pathway or after anti-TNF-Î± antibody treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Garra et al., 2013</xref>). However, an emerging concept is that an excessive immune response to Mtb may be equally harmful. Standard disease paradigms predict that immune activation resulting from the administration of checkpoint inhibitors should lead to better control of Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zumla et al., 2016</xref>). However, counter-intuitively these agents seem to be activating TB, as evidenced by recent reports of TB developing in patients treated for malignancy with immune checkpoint inhibition, often rapidly after commencing therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujita et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Picchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jensen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elkington et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takata et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barber et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Eeden et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with this emerging clinical phenomenon, programmed death (PD-1) deficient mice are highly susceptible to TB, dying more rapidly than T-cell deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">LÃ¡zÃ¡r-MolnÃ¡r et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barber et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 are expressed in human granulomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elkington et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting a regulatory role at the site of disease. TB granulomas are hypoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belton et al., 2016</xref>), and PD-L1 is up-regulated by hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Noman et al., 2014</xref>), further suggesting a mechanistic link between hypoxia and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis within TB lesions. In this study, we investigate the expression patterns of PD-1 and PDL-1 within TB infected human lung tissue and the relationship between PD-1 and anti-TB immunity. Next, using a human 3D cell culture model of TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tezera et al., 2017a</xref>), we show that hypoxia increases expression of PD-1 and its ligands, that PD-1 inhibition increases Mtb growth. Surprisingly, TNF-Î± is primarily responsible for this effect, and TNF-Î± neutralisation reverses the anti-PD-1 induced phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PD-1 is expressed in human TB granulomas but not in areas of immunopathology</title><p>First, we investigated the presence and localisation of PD-1-expressing T cells in human pulmonary TB. We hypothesised that PD-1 would be expressed by T cells in the lung of patients with TB, and at a higher frequency than in the blood. In thirty-five patients undergoing medically indicated lung resection to treat TB or TB sequalae, PD-1 expression was measured on T cells isolated from the lung and matched blood samples, available for 23 patients, by flow cytometry. Overall, PD-1 expression in homogenized lung tissue was highly variable, with a trend towards increased PD-1 in both CD4 and CD8 T-cells from the lung compared to matched blood, which reached statistical significance for CD8 T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Lung tissue from healthy individuals was not available for study, however, the median frequency of 11% and 14% of PD-1+ CD4 and CD8 T-cells observed are generally lower than recently reported for healthy human lung tissue from organ donors of approximately 50% for both cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Snyder et al., 2019</xref>).

PD-1 expression on lung CD4 cells was predominantly restricted CD69+ T-cells, with a smaller proportion also expressing CD103 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, overall frequencies <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), consistent with a tissue resident phenotype and in contrast to PD-1 expressing cells in blood, which are largely CD69 negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Lung CD8 T-cells were also found to predominantly express CD69 in addition to CD103, again in contrast to CD8 T-cells in circulation. Therefore, these data are consistent with expression of PD-1 on lung tissue resident T-cells in patients with active or previous pulmonary TB infection. However, TB immunopathology is highly heterogenous within the lung and these analyses do not provide information as to the localization of PD-1 expression within TB lesions.</p><p>To address this question, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of human lung biopsies of patients with active TB. Within stable granulomas with an intact cellular structure, PD-1 expression was present around the central macrophage core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Câi</xref>). Both CD4 and CD8 T cells were present in the granuloma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Câii</xref> and -iii), and co-localisation analysis demonstrated that a proportion of both T cell subtypes expressed PD-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>-iv), consistent with the flow cytometry data. In contrast, in caseating granulomas with evident immunopathology, PD-1 expression was totally absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Dâi</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The lack of immunoreactivity was not due to lack of viable cells, as CD4 and CD8 expressing T cells were present within the same area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Dâii</xref> and -iii). Therefore, in human granulomas, PD-1 is expressed in areas where the host-pathogen interaction appears stable but is absent in regions of immunopathology.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The PD-1/PD-L1 axis is up-regulated in the 3D microsphere model</title><p>Taken together, these data from Mtb infected patients demonstrate that PD-1 is expressed by lung resident T-cells and may be required to prevent destructive lung disease.

Furthermore, a hypoxic environment (1% oxygen) further increased PD-L2 expression. PD-1 gene expression was not increased at 72 hr by Mtb infection under normoxic conditions, but was up-regulated when infected cells were incubated in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The change in expression required both infection and hypoxia, as hypoxia did not increase PD-1 or PD-L1/2 expression alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We then studied PD-1/PD-L1 cellular surface expression in microspheres by flow cytometry after one week of infection.

Consistent with our initial observation, anti-TNF-Î± neutralising antibodies suppressed the TNF-mediated increased Mtb growth, with a partial reduction at each concentration studied of two different neutralising antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Exogenous TNF-Î± modulated macrophage polarisation within microspheres, reducing CD80 expression at day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, we next investigated whether anti-PD-1-induced Mtb growth could be reversed by blocking TNF-Î± activity. Anti-PD-1 antibody treatment of infected cells again augmented Mtb growth, and this increased growth could be reversed by the incorporation of anti-TNF-Î± antibodies into the microspheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This confirms that an excess of TNF-Î± is the primary driver of increased Mtb growth caused by PD-1 inhibition in the 3D model.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>TNF-Î± is highly expressed in TB granulomas and sputum TNF-Î± negatively correlates with circulating PD-1 expression</title><p>Finally, to establish the in vivo relevance of our cell culture model findings, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of biopsies from patients with standard TB and anti-PD-1 associated TB.

Although this involved comparing PD-1 expression by circulating T cells, remote from the site of disease, with total TNF-Î± concentration in the sputum, we hypothesised that a reverse association would support the conclusion that PD-1 limits TNF-Î± secretion in patients. Consistent with this, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell PD-1 expression negatively correlated with sputum TNF-Î±, with a significant negative association despite the relatively low sample numbers, which would be expected to obscure an effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although Mtb kills more people than any other infection worldwide, an enduring enigma is that 90% of those exposed exert lifelong control of the pathogen. In seminal post-mortem studies when TB was highly prevalent in the United States, Opie showed that 30% of humans who died from other causes had viable Mtb present in the lung apices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Opie and Aronson, 1927</xref>). Therefore, in the majority of exposed individuals, a stable relationship forms between host immune cells and Mtb without disease developing. Disseminated TB disease often develops in immunocompromised individuals, such as advanced HIV infection, newborn infants or following anti-TNF-Î± therapy, and this observation informs the view that TB can arise as a disease of a deficient immune response to the pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Garra et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>However, the commonest form of human TB, and the one that leads to transmission, is apical pulmonary disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elkington et al., 2011</xref>). This occurs most frequently in young adults between the ages of 20â25 with the strongest recall response to Mtb antigens, as measured by the Mantoux test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Comstock et al., 1974</xref>). Therefore, these clinical observations demonstrate that infection results in a stable symbiosis between host and pathogen in the majority of individuals, and a pronounced immune response associates with the subsequent development of infectious pulmonary disease. The recently emerging clinical phenomenon of TB rapidly developing after initiating anti-PD-1 immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujita et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Picchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jensen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elkington et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takata et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barber et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Eeden et al., 2019</xref>) further reinforces that an excessive immune response in TB can be harmful.</p><p>PD-1 is expressed on T cells at the site of TB disease and PD-1 expression on circulating CD4+ T cells associates with bacterial load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Day et al., 1995</xref>). PD-1 expression is elevated in circulating CD4 T cells in TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shen et al., 2016</xref>) and has been proposed to limit an effective host immune response. Consequently PD-1 inhibition has been advanced as a therapeutic target to accelerate clearance of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zumla et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jurado et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Singh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Suarez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). However, from an evolutionary perspective, PD-1 is proposed to limit immunopathology in the face of chronic antigenic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sharpe and Pauken, 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is equally plausible, and indeed perhaps more logical, that PD-1/PD-L1 pathway up-regulation in TB is a physiologically appropriate response to the persistent pathogen. We found that hypoxia further up-regulated the PD-1/PD-L1/2 axis, consistent with hypoxia increasing expression in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Noman et al., 2014</xref>), and TB lesions are hypoxic both in model animals and human lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Via et al., 2008</xref>). Analysis of the effect of hypoxia is complicated that both host and pathogen physiology are altered, with hypoxia causing reduced Mtb growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Devasundaram et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ortega et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eoh and Rhee, 2013</xref>) but also causing diverse host physiological changes. PD-1 may be particularly important in limiting excessive inflammation and pathology in conditions of low oxygen tension. TB reactivation following immune checkpoint blockade, and the extreme susceptibility of PD-1 deficient mice to Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">LÃ¡zÃ¡r-MolnÃ¡r et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barber et al., 2011</xref>), would support such a regulatory role, even though it runs counter to widely advanced disease paradigms.</p><p>Our work further highlights the double-edged sword of the host immune response in TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ehlers, 1999</xref>). TNF-Î± is clearly essential to an effective host immune response to TB, as disease frequently develops after treatment with anti-TNF-Î± antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Keane et al., 2001</xref>), and TNF-Î± inhibits Mtb growth in zebrafish macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clay et al., 2008</xref>) and human alveolar macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirsch et al., 1994</xref>). However, excessive TNF-Î± is also associated with poor outcomes in TB. In human cells, an excess of TNF-Î± can increase Mtb growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byrd, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Engele et al., 2002</xref>), consistent with our observations. In patients with active TB, TNF-Î± expression by Mtb-specific T cells is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harari et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tebruegge et al., 2015</xref>) and TNF-Î± associates with more severe radiological findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casarini et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tsao et al., 2000</xref>). In diverse model systems, excessive TNF-Î± has been shown to cause harmful inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bekker et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taylor et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tsenova et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roca and Ramakrishnan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tzelepis et al., 2018</xref>), consistent with TNF-Î± exerting a bell-shaped effect on host immunity, with either deficit or excess detrimental. Similarly, we report a deleterious effect of additional GM-CSF, in contrast to GM-CSF improving control of Mtb growth in murine macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rothchild et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that cytokine responses are highly dose and context dependent, potentially with each demonstrating non-linear responses leading to a complex matrix of what may denote the optimal cytokine profile for Mtb control. Consistent with our findings, in the one patient that developed TB on anti-PD-1 treatment where longitudinal samples are available, there was a spike in PPD-specific TNF-Î± expressing cells prior to with the development of active TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barber et al., 2019</xref>), consistent with PD-1 acting as a regulator of TNF-Î± expression in TB. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a harmful effect of excessive TNF-Î± in TB.</p><p>We found that multiple cytokines and chemokines were increased after PD-1 inhibition, and therefore events in humans are likely to be more complex than TNF-Î± excess alone. The augmented inflammation may have multiple harmful effects, such as recruitment of excessive inflammatory cells and destruction of the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cambier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al Shammari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mishra et al., 2017</xref>), which favour Mtb growth. In the mouse model of TB, one key role of PD-1 is to limit IFN-Î³ production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sakai et al., 2016</xref>), and we have shown that excess IFN-Î³ also accelerates Mtb growth in microspheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tezera et al., 2017a</xref>). We did not show an effect of TNF-Î± on cell survival, although TNF-Î± has been reported to increase macrophage necrosis in the zebrafish model, via a mitochondrial-lysosomal-endoplasmic reticulum circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roca and Ramakrishnan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roca et al., 2019</xref>). The effect of PD-1 inhibition on macrophage polarisation and survival warrants further investigation, as this is likely to be one determinant of outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lerner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cronan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>As in all in vitro systems, the bioelectrospray model has limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elkington et al., 2019</xref>). For example, it does not permit the ingress of new inflammatory cells, and therefore can only be used to investigate the early events resulting from anti-PD-1 treatment, and not the recruitment of inflammatory cells by increased chemokine secretion. In addition, although it permits longer analysis of the host-pathogen interaction than other human primary cell culture systems, the 3 week standard experiment remains shorter than human infection, and so it models early events. We have not yet characterised which cells produce TNF-Î±, nor the wider phenotypic changes that result from inhibition of the PD-1 axis. The optimal approach would be to integrate single cell RNAseq to the analysis pipeline, so the phenotype of different cells can be comprehensively analysed. As microspheres can be readily dissolved by incubation in EDTA to release the cells, the system is suited for this technical development.</p><p>The common side effects of anti-PD-1 treatment in patients are termed immune related Adverse Events (irAEs), which are autoimmune in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Postow et al., 2018</xref>). We have proposed that an autoimmune process may exacerbate pathology in TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elkington et al., 2016</xref>), and others have suggested that a loss of tolerance underlies progression to active TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Divangahi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Olive and Sassetti, 2018</xref>). The common theme is that an excessive response to antigens, whether host or pathogen-derived, can drive disease in TB and our findings further support this conclusion. PD-1 may act to fine tune the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses necessary to control infection without causing pathology. Notably, immune related adverse events to immune checkpoint inhibitors may be treated with anti-TNF-Î± antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Postow et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting TNF-Î± may be the primary driver of both autoimmunity and TB pathology after PD-1 treatment.</p><p>Our model provides the mechanistic insights into a clinical phenomenon with significant implications for future TB treatment and vaccine approaches. Simply driving a stronger immune response to Mtb seems unlikely to be beneficial, as clinical and epidemiological data suggest it may be harmful. For example, host-directed therapies may be designed to accelerate bacterial clearance whilst concurrently reducing immunopathological effects by appropriate skewing of macrophage phenotype. A more nuanced view considering the different immunological phases of TB is essential, differentiating events at the point of initial exposure from the late events at the apex of the lung, where excessive inflammation leads to immunopathology and transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elkington and Friedland, 2015</xref>). Defining the distinction between a protective and pathological immune response in human TB remains a key unanswered question, essential to inform new interventions to control the TB pandemic.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>)</td><td valign="top">H37Rv</td><td valign="top">(From Ref: 20)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Used at multiple of infection of 0.1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>)</td><td valign="top">H37Rv pMV306hsp+LuxAB+G13+CDE</td><td valign="top">(From Ref: 20)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Used at multiple of infection of 0.1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>)</td><td valign="top">H37Rv pMV306hsp encoding the wild-type FFluc</td><td valign="top">(From Ref: 20)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Used at multiple of infection of 0.1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (Antibodies)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">âAntibody</td><td valign="top">anti-CD45-V500 Horizon (Clone no.

The cell-alginate suspension was injected into the bead generator where microspheres were formed in an ionotropic gelling bath of 100 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> in HBSS. After washing twice with HBSS with Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>, microspheres were transferred in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% human AB serum and incubated at 37Â°C. Microspheres were either dispensed into eppendorfs, which were then randomly allocated to different environmental conditions, or plated into a 96-well plate with conditions in triplicate according to a pre-determined template. For experiments in hypoxia, microspheres were incubated in 1% oxygen in Galaxy 48 R CO<sub>2</sub> incubator (Eppendorf, UK) until analysis. Supernatants were collected at defined time points. Time points described are days post infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Live cell imaging</title><p>Uninfected or UV killed Mtb infected cells suspended in alginate-collagen matrix were plated in an eight well Î¼-Slide (ibidi GmbH, Germany).

Samples were imaged using an Olympus IX81 time-lapse microscope with temperature of 37Â°C and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 5%. Z-stacks 200 Âµm in height were captured at one position in each sample every 30 min for 48 hr.

Inhibitor one was prepared in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich,UK) at a concentration of 6.3 mM and dissolved to a concentration of 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM and 1 Î¼M in complete media and added to media around microspheres on the day after encapsulation. Luminescence was monitored on specific days. For the microspheres incubated in hypoxic conditions, measurement of luminescence was repeated for every 30 min after the addition of luciferin until the reading plateaued, which was usually 2 hr.</p><p>In antibody inhibitory experiments, spartalizumab (Selleckchem, Germany), a humanised IgG4 anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody, was used to inhibit of PD-1/PD-L1 signalling in microspheres. Briefly, cells were infected with Mtb overnight, pelleted and then a suspension of anti-PD1 antibodies (20 and 200 Î¼g/ml) were added and pre-incubated for 1 hr. Cells were then encapsulated within microspheres and kept for 14 days in either normoxia or 1% oxygen at 37Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Mtb growth was measured using luminescence and supernatants were taken for either cytokine or LDH measurement. An IgG4 human antibody was used at the same concentration as a control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cell toxicity assays</title><p>Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in the supernatants collected at different time points was analysed by a colorimetric activity assay as per manufacturerâs instructions (Roche, Burgess Hill, United Kingdom). As a second assay, CytoTox-Glo Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega) was used, which measures dead-cell protease activity released from cells without membrane integrity using a luminogenic peptide substrate, the AAF-Glo Substrate. Luminescence from 96-well plates was analysed by GloMax Discover (Promega). The LDH assay was suited for later time points, as this could be performed on microspheres in eppendorfs, while the CytoTox glow required analysis in 96 well plates and so was best suited to analysis in the first week.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Gene expression analysis</title><p>All the reagents were sourced from ThermoFisher Scientific (Paisley, UK).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alissa Rothchild (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Tezera et al. extend previous findings using a 3D biospray cell culture model to dissect host-pathogen interactions during human Mtb infection by investigating the impact of PD-1 blockade on infection. The authors demonstrate that PD-1 is expressed on lung resident T cells from TB patients and that PD-1 and PD-L1 expression increases following infection of PBMCs in the 3D model. They show that inhibition of PD-1 is detrimental to host control of Mtb due to excessive TNF production. This is an interesting paper, but as the authors themselves point out, it is already known that PD-1 blockade leads to an increase in cytokine production and loss of Mtb control. The dogma thus far, is that excessive Th1 responses are the mechanism of TB susceptibility in PD-1 blockers cases. This paper fights this dogma; and says that the pro-inflammatory cytokines drive Mtb replication, and this excessive cytokine response is what is at the root of TB susceptibility from PD1 blockers. The authors have designed a number of experiments with their innovative three-dimensional model, called the microsphere.</p><p>The reviewers were enthusiastic about the novel application of microsphere to this contemporary issue, but given that other studies have demonstrated a clear roles for TNF during Mtb infection, they raised concerns about lack of mechanistic detail as to how PD-1 inhibition increases TNF production in this 3D model and what impact excessive TNF is having on immune cell interactions in the microsphere system. In addition, some results (see below) need further data and statistics to support the conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1: PD-1 is expressed in granulomas but not in areas of immunopathology. This is an important point being made, with human samples, but the first statistical testing is PD1 levels in tissue cells versus blood cells. Perhaps a) cells become PD1 positive in tissue, b) PD1 cells hone to the tissue, c) other? Though p-values are reported, it wasn't clear what the hypothesis was. It was much clearer in the tissue sections when the authors set out to determine whether the PD1+ were and were not, in the tissue. Maybe the statistical testing should be reserved for the data that directly address the experimental hypotheses? In Figure 1A, there are ~ 35 dots in the lung plot with a median frequency of PD1+ cells of about 15%. Does this mean that the authors studied 35 independent samples from 35 patients? Please describe the N for the pathology samples in the Results (perhaps this was in a supplementary file?). It seems that the biologic difference between blood and lung is very thin and the statistical difference is driven by the large number of dots. It would be important to clarify the number of independent lung samples studied for this figure. Finally, in the text, the authors conclude by saying: &quot;PD-1 is expressed by lung resident T-cells and may be required to prevent destructive lung disease.&quot; I believe this is based on an inverse correlation. It might be preferable to conclude the section with what is observed, then introduce the hypothesis in the next section. There are other critical questions that must be addressed in Figure 1. How does the frequency of PD-1 expressing T cells in TB patients compare to healthy controls? It would be helpful in Figure 1A to compare the frequencies (at least in the blood) to those in healthy controls to understand whether the increase in PD-1 is lung specific or systemic during Mtb infection. Second, in Figure 1B, PD-1 expression appears to be highest on the CD103+ CD69+ population for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, but CD103 does not seem to mark the CD4<sup>+</sup> T population with the highest PD-1 expression. Is CD103 known to mark tissue residency for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells like it does for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells? If not, it might be better to leave this marker out of the analysis in Figure 1B-I for clarity. It would also be useful to include the overall frequencies of each of the four CD103/CD69 populations for both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from lung parenchyma to better understand which of the four populations are common or rare in the human lung.</p><p>2) The effect of different cytokines and chemokines on Mtb growth within the microspheres in Figure 5A-C and Figure 5âfigure supplement 1 and their description in the text is confusing. Can the authors clarify what &quot;Chemokines (RANTES, MIP-1a and MIP-1b) and growth factors (G-CSF and GM-CSF) had a small growth-promoting effect&quot; means given that only GM-CSF led to significant increases in Mtb growth in Figure 5B? Additionally, some of the supplementary data in Figure 5âfigure supplement 1 does not match up with the results shown in Figure 5. For example, Figure 5B shows no difference in Mtb growth with the addition of IL-1RA, but there is a significant increase in Mtb growth following IL-1RA treatment shown in Figure 5âfigure supplement 1. Close reading of the figure legends shows that the concentration of cytokines/chemokines added in Figure 5âfigure supplement 1 was 5 times higher, but there is no mention of this in the text or explanation of why. Please clarify why these two different experiments were performed and provide an interpretation of the differing results. Microsphere have disparate cells which are constituents of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This might include T cells, myeloid cells, and matrix. Please discuss how these data compare to previous experiments performed on isolated Mtb infected cells. Specifically, other groups Hirsch et al., 1994 showed that TNF in Mtb infected macrophages interfered with Mtb replication. Other have shown how early macrophage events are interfered with my TBF blockers, that would allow Mtb replication. These data will be compared with Figure 5A. Why is the data so different? Sam Behar's lab has demonstrated that T-cell derived GMCSF diminishes Mtb replication (MBio 2017 Oct). This will be contrasted with data, Figure 5B. Please discuss the discrepancy.</p><p>3) The authors very nicely demonstrate that the increase in Mtb growth is dependent on TNF production and cite several papers that link TNF to Mtb growth by different mechanisms including &quot;recruitment of excessive inflammatory cells and destruction of the extracellular matrix&quot; and &quot;cell survival.&quot; Is it possible to identify which mechanism is responsible for the Mtb growth phenotype in this 3D culture model or at least rule out any of these possibilities? For example, following PD-1 blockade with or without anti-TNF antibodies is there a change in the viability of myeloid cells or a difference in the proportions of cell populations within the microspheres? How do the authors envision the mechanism in this system might be similar or different from other PD-1 inhibition studies? For instance, there is obviously no inflammatory cell recruitment occurring within the microspheres but perhaps TNF production leads to changes in population frequencies that impact bacterial control. The study would be strengthened by an analysis to determine which cell type or mechanism is responsible for the excess TNF production following PD-1 blockade (CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, or an innate cell type). At minimum, the authors should include a nuanced which of the mechanisms would be relevant to their model and why.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52668.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1: PD-1 is expressed in granulomas but not in areas of immunopathology. This is an important point being made, with human samples, but the first statistical testing is PD1 levels in tissue cells versus blood cells. Perhaps a) cells become PD1 positive in tissue, b) PD1 cells hone to the tissue, c) other? Though p-values are reported, it wasn't clear what the hypothesis was. It was much clearer in the tissue sections when the authors set out to determine whether the PD1+ were and were not, in the tissue. Maybe the statistical testing should be reserved for the data that directly address the experimental hypotheses?</p></disp-quote><p>We accept this comment. The point that we were trying to make was that PD-1 is expressed by T cells within the lung of patients with TB, and so we first show that PD-1 expressed in the lung, and this is at a higher level than in the blood.

For the lung, the reviewer raises an important question. Unfortunately, out studies use lung tissue removed by surgical resection of patients with complications of TB, such as massive haemoptysis, and thus healthy control material is not easily obtainable to make these comparisons. Recently published work looking at healthy lungs from organ donors does report high PD-1 expression. This is now referenced and discussed in the first paragraph of the subsection âPD-1 is expressed in human TB granulomas but not in areas of immunopathologyâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, in Figure 1B, PD-1 expression appears to be highest on the CD103+ CD69+ population for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, but CD103 does not seem to mark the CD4<sup>+</sup> T population with the highest PD-1 expression.

The experiments were performed twice, with two concentrations of cytokines on each occasion. One concentration was that measured in the cell culture supernatants (Figure 4), and the second was 5x this, to allow for potential concentration gradients from the exterior to the centre of the microspheres. The 1x concentration (âlowâ) experiments are presented in the main manuscript, whilst the 5x concentration (âhighâ) experiments are in the supplementary material. The direction of effect of each cytokine was the same for low and high concentrations, though with a greater effect size for the 5x. We have provided clarification in âthe first paragraph of the subsection âExogenous TNF-Î± increases Mtb growth in microspheresâ and Figure 5 and Figure 5âfigure supplement 1 legend to avoid the confusion.

We propose that for several cytokines there is a bell-shaped response curve, with an optimal concentration for mycobacterial control, and either very low or high concentrations being deleterious, as is emerging for TNF-Î±, from both our work and other groups. We accept that these concepts were not sufficiently commented on in the original submission, and have extended the Discussion (fourth paragraph), putting our results in the context of the previous work cited above, and we have expanded on the balance between protective and harmful concentrations of cytokines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors very nicely demonstrate that the increase in Mtb growth is dependent on TNF production and cite several papers that link TNF to Mtb growth by different mechanisms including &quot;recruitment of excessive inflammatory cells and destruction of the extracellular matrix&quot; and &quot;cell survival.&quot; Is it possible to identify which mechanism is responsible for the Mtb growth phenotype in this 3D culture model or at least rule out any of these possibilities?

High TNF concentrations lead to a reduction in CD80 expression, which associate with macrophages more permissive to Mtb growth. We now discuss this in the last paragraph of the subsection âExogenous TNF-Î± increases Mtb growth in microspheresâ. Further mechanistic dissection of the phenomenon will be possible within the model, which we propose to do by single cell sequencing of cells released from microspheres as discussed in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion.

We can then determine phenotypic changes with PD-1 inhibition and how excess TNF leads to increased cell growth. However, this is an extensive programme of work, involving technical challenges of setting up single cell RNAseq in the containment level 3 laboratory, and cannot be performed within the time frame available. Therefore, to address the point, we have edited the manuscript as suggested to give a more nuanced discussion of the potential mechanism, and how they might be investigated, âin the sixth paragraph of the Discussion, as requested by the reviewers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
