BHK fibroblasts by nonclassical mechanisms. We present evidence that MEND depends on mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) openings, followed by coenzyme A (CoA) release, acyl CoA synthesis, and membrane protein palmitoylation. MEND is blocked by inhibiting mitochondrial Ca uptake or PTP openings, depleting fatty acids, blocking acyl CoA synthesis, metabolizing CoA, or inhibiting palmitoylation. It is triggered by depolarizing mitochondria or promoting PTP openings. After mitochondrial MEND blockade, MEND is restored by cytoplasmic acyl CoA or CoA. MEND is blocked by siRNA knockdown of the plasmalemmal acyl transferase, DHHC5. When acyl CoA is abundant, transient H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> oxidative stress or PKC activation initiates MEND, but the immediate presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> prevents MEND. The PTP inhibitor, NIM811, significantly increases plasmalemma in normally growing cells. Thus, the MEND pathway may contribute to constitutive as well as pathological plasmalemma turnover in dependence on mitochondrial stress signaling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01293.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01293.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01293.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells use a process called endocytosis to absorb proteins and other molecules. There are many forms of endocytosis, but they usually involve the molecule of interest becoming tucked into a bud that forms in the cell membrane. This bud is then pinched off to leave the molecule inside a vesicle that is inside the cell. In general endocytosis is triggered by ‘caging’ proteins such as clathrin, but other forms are also possible. These “non-classical” forms of endocytosis are involved in processes as diverse as the internalization of pathogens and the response of cells to wounding, and sometimes they involve large fractions of the cell membrane being pinched off. Several different forms of “massive endocytosis” have been observed, but they have remained enigmatic in comparison to the classical forms of endocytosis.</p><p>Now Hilgemann et al. report a new pathway for massive endocytosis that is triggered by a sudden influx of calcium ions into Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) fibroblasts. Up to 70% of the cell membrane can be pinched off during this process, especially areas of the membrane in which lipids and proteins are arranged in a more ordered pattern than in the average cell membrane. After massive endocytosis, it takes BHK cells about 30 minutes to replace the regions that were lost during the endocytosis.</p><p>Hilgemann et al. find that calcium ions exert their influence via mitochondria, which are the primary source of energy for most cells. In contrast to all other cell organelles, the mitochondria are surrounded by two concentric membranes. The influx of calcium ions causes pores in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, called permeability transition pores, to open so that coenzyme A, a small molecule that is required for fatty acid metabolism, is released into the cytoplasm of the cell. This is followed by the condensation of coenzyme A with a fatty acid and the attachment of fatty acids to the surface membrane proteins. The attachment of these fatty acids (a process known as palmitoylation) evidently promotes ordered regions of the cell surface to coalesce and be pinched off into the cytoplasm as membrane vesicles. A key unanswered question is whether the release of coenzyme A by mitochondria regulates biochemical processes in addition to endocytosis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01293.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01293.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>palmitoylation</kwd><kwd>patch clamp</kwd><kwd>permeability transition pore</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL513223</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hilgemann</surname><given-names>Donald W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL067942</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hilgemann</surname><given-names>Donald W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM51466</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jennings</surname><given-names>Benjamin C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mitochondria can trigger massive endocytosis by releasing coenzyme A into the cytoplasm and thereby promoting the addition of fatty acids to surface membrane proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endocytic processes that do not use classical endocytic proteins remain poorly understood because they are mechanistically inhomogeneous and difficult to study in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mayor and Pagano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doherty and McMahon, 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, they are involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howes et al., 2010</xref>), cell wounding responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tam et al., 2010</xref>), and pathogen internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vidricaire and Tremblay, 2007</xref>), as well as membrane recycling in some neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gong et al., 2008</xref>) and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jiang and Chen, 2009</xref>). Massive endocytic (MEND) responses described by us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fine et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hilgemann and Fine, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lariccia et al., 2011</xref>) are the largest endocytic responses ever characterized. Large fractions of the plasmalemma that are internalized bind many amphipathic molecules less well than membrane remaining at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hilgemann and Fine, 2011</xref>). Thus, MEND internalizes preferentially the more ‘ordered’ portions of the surface membrane. Different forms of MEND can be distinguished on the basis of ATP-, polyamine-, and Ca-dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lariccia et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, MEND can be initiated by rapidly cleaving sphingomyelin in the outer plasmalemma monolayer with bacterial sphingomyelinase C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lariccia et al., 2011</xref>). It has been suggested that this form of MEND becomes activated during cell wound responses when native sphingomyelinases are translocated to the cell surface via exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corrotte et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We describe here experiments that suggest an entirely different pathway by which MEND occurs in BHK fibroblasts subsequent to large Ca transients. These ATP-dependent endocytic responses are functionally similar to ‘excessive’ endocytosis that occurs after large Ca transients in secretory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith and Neher, 1997</xref>). Up to 70% of the cell surface of fibroblasts can be internalized, followed by replenishment of the plasmalemma from internal membrane pools over 20 to 40 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lariccia et al., 2011</xref>). To elucidate the cellular pathway by which MEND occurs, we attempted first to resolve how Ca promotes MEND, and second, to understand why more ordered membrane domains would be selectively internalized. As described here, our data support the hypothesis that Ca transients act initially to prime mitochondria to open PTPs (permeability transition pore) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giorgio et al., 2013</xref>), releasing metabolites to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzolin et al., 2010</xref>). At the distal end of the pathway, our data suggest that palmitoylation of surface membrane proteins promotes the coalescence of ordered membrane domains by promoting protein clustering, as described biochemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levental et al., 2010</xref>) and as occurs in anoxia-related metabolic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frank et al., 1980</xref>).</p><p>That mitochondria might regulate surface membrane palmitoylation and thereby endocytosis is a novel hypothesis. Nevertheless, studies that suggest how this might occur have been available for decades. First, it is known that coenzyme A (CoA), which is synthesized on the outer mitochondrial surface, is accumulated into the matrix space by voltage-sensitive transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tahiliani, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leonardi et al., 2005</xref>), generating CoA gradients to the cytoplasm of at least 50:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tahiliani and Neely, 1987</xref>). Therefore, transient openings of nonselective mitochondrial pores, PTPs, can potentially release CoA and generate cytoplasmic CoA transients in the range of tens of micromolar without serious consequences for other mitochondrial metabolites. Second, the low micromolar concentration of free CoA in the cytoplasm has long been suggested to limit cytoplasmic acyl CoA synthetase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Idell-Wenger et al., 1978</xref>), whereas free CoA is less likely to limit pyruvate dehydrogenases that have higher CoA affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bremer, 1969</xref>). Third, it is known that surface membrane proteins, visualized as membrane particles in freeze fracture studies, can cluster and decrease in number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frank et al., 1980</xref>) in a cellular circumstance known to cause PTP openings, namely during anoxia and reoxygenation of cardiac tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brenner and Moulin, 2012</xref>). Therewith, a working hypothesis is suggested that mitochondria might control palmitoylation of membrane proteins in response to metabolic stress by releasing CoA to the cytoplasm. In principle, this release may occur not only via PTP openings, but by reverse CoA transport during mitochondrial depolarization caused by partial PTP openings, and via membrane defects that might occur during mitochondrial fission and fusion events in metabolic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Knott et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frank et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>It is now well established that transient PTP openings occur physiologically, causing transient mitochondrial depolarizations accompanied by superoxide flashes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hausenloy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Saotome et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). One widely-held view is that low conductance PTP openings cause mitochondrial depolarization without loss of metabolites, and thereby release excess mitochondrial Ca to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huser and Blatter, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Korge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhou and O’Rourke, 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, it appears possible for mitochondria to release metabolites by transient PTP openings without loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity or even global mitochondrial depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dumas et al., 2009</xref>). Knockout of cyclophilin D, a major PTP regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basso et al., 2005</xref>), gives rise to intriguing phenotypes: hearts are mildly protected from ischemia/reperfusion damage, but animals are markedly less tolerant of physical exertion (swimming) and shift their energy metabolism from fatty acids to glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elrod et al., 2010</xref>). From the prevailing interpretation of PTP function, these phenotypes will be the result of mitochondria Ca accumulation, driven by the failure of PTPs to open and release Ca when it accumulates in the matrix space. Our working hypothesis predicts that loss of mitochondrial depolarizations will also favor CoA accumulation by mitochondria and cause a decrease of cytoplasmic free CoA. Consequences of a lower cytoplasmic free CoA concentration might include the shift from fatty acid to glucose metabolism, owing to the different CoA affinities of acyl CoA synthetases and pyruvate dehydrogenases noted above.</p><p>With this background, we describe here multiple lines of evidence that mitochondrial responses to large Ca transients trigger MEND in BHK cells, that CoA and acyl CoAs are intermediates in the pathway, that membrane protein acylation is required, specifically via the acyl transferase, DHHC5, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2010</xref>), that PKCs and oxidative stress promote acyl CoA-dependent endocytosis without PTP openings, and finally that the MEND pathway may contribute significantly to constitutive surface membrane turnover in BHK cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Evidence that MEND is initiated by mitochondria</title><p>Using BHK fibroblasts, data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref> lends initial support to the hypothesis that palmitoylation can be initiated by release of CoA from mitochondria where it is accumulated by membrane potential-driven transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tahiliani, 1991</xref>).

Patch clamp is established in a Ca-free extracellular solution using a cytoplasmic solution that contains a high concentration of Na (40 mM), ATP (8 mM) and GTP (0.2 mM). Then, cells are moved into one of multiple parallel flowing solution streams at 37°C, and Ca influx is activated by switching extracellular Ca from 0 to 2 mM Ca for 12 s. Membrane current (upper trace), which reflects 3Na/1Ca exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yaradanakul et al., 2008</xref>), allows calculation of the absolute quantity of Ca entering cells. Since BHK cells are round after removal from dishes, we can also calculate cell volume from cell diameter (25–35 μm) and determine the absolute change of Ca occurring in cells. In the experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the total cellular Ca concentration increases by 2.1 mM, and free Ca typically exceeds 50 μM in these experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lariccia et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>During Ca influx, membrane area (i.e., C<sub>m</sub>, lower trace) increases by 35% as a result of the fusion of subplasmalemmal membrane vesicles to the plasmalemma (exocytosis). Then, after a delay of 30–120 s, membrane area begins to decline as a result of endocytosis until more than 50% of the plasmalemma is removed into vesicles just beneath the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lariccia et al., 2011</xref>). As indicated below the experimental traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, we quantified membrane area in relation to initial area at three points; just before Ca influx (1), after exocytosis (2), and after the MEND response (3). These values are subsequently presented as sets of three bar graphs. MEND responses, defined as the fractional decrease of membrane area between points 2 and 3, were compared only if Na/Ca exchange currents were not statistically different and exocytic responses in different groups were also similar.</p><p>The first set of bar graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> quantifies the Standard MEND response (Control, CTR; black and white). The second bar set (purple) shows that removal of inorganic phosphate (Pi, 1 mM) from the standard cytoplasmic solution reduces MEND responses to less than 30% of peak membrane area, as expected from the activating effect of Pi on PTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Massari, 1996</xref>). The third data set (blue) shows that the mitochondrial Ca uniporter inhibitor, RU323 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ying et al., 1991</xref>) (15 μM), strongly blocks MEND. Subsequently, it is shown that the nonspecific PTP inhibitor, cyclosporine A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crompton et al., 1988</xref>) (CsA, 5 μM in cytoplasmic and extracellular solutions; green) and the PTP/cyclophilin D-specific cyclosporine, NIM811 (N-methyl-4-isoleucine cyclosporine) (2 μM; orange) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Waldmeier et al., 2002</xref>), also strongly inhibit MEND. Importantly, the calcineurin inhibitor, FK506, had no effect on MEND, even at a high concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lariccia et al., 2011</xref>). Activation of protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε) is reported to protect cells from oxidative damage by inhibiting PTP openings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baines et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Budas and Mochly-Rosen, 2007</xref>). Therefore, we incubated cells with a PKC activator, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG, 15 μM), for 20 min before experiments, and Standard MEND was effectively blocked (yellow). Next, we performed experiments to induce rapid mitochondrial depolarization, which may be expected ‘initially’ to promote PTP openings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scorrano et al., 1997</xref>), as well as to cause both reverse Ca transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Montero et al., 2001</xref>) and reverse CoA transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tahiliani, 1991</xref>) from mitochondria. To do so, we included the mitochondrial uncoupler, CCCP (20 μM), and the ATP synthetase inhibitor, oligomycin (OM, 5 μM), in the pipette and opened cells only after placing them in a flowing solution at 37°C. As indicated by the solid red bar graph for data point ‘1’ (before the Ca transient), cells underwent 30% MEND responses within 1 min after rupturing the membrane in the patch pipette (i.e., ‘opening’ the cell to the patch pipette). Thereafter, Ca influx initiated supernormal exocytic responses, from point ‘1’ (before) to ‘2’ (peak), but MEND was fully suppressed. Thus, while rapid mitochondrial depolarization with these agents can activate single MEND responses with very little delay, cells subsequently are refractory to MEND for the duration of patch clamp experiments (∼30 min). We report lastly in this connection an experiment set in which we tested for inhibition of MEND by an antioxidant that becomes targeted to mitochondria, Mito-Tempo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>). When included in the pipette solution at 10 μM, average MEND responses were reduced from 42 ± 7% (n = 10) to 27 ± 6% (n = 8), but the difference was not significant.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> describes the initiation of MEND by perfusing the cytoplasm of cells rapidly with metabolic substrates that optimally open PTPs in isolated mitochondria at submicromolar free Ca (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Massari, 1996</xref>). To do so, we place the end of a micro-capillary tube within 50 μm of the orifice of the patch pipette opening. Using positive pressure to generate rapid solution flow, diffusible molecules are exchanged between the cytoplasm and the pipette tip within 2–5 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hilgemann and Lu, 1998</xref>).

After a delay of several seconds, MEND responses occurred over a time course of somewhat less that 1 min and amounted to 34 ± 6% of initial cell area at 37°C.

Thus, KSP solution, like mitochondrial depolarization, induces a MEND-refractory state within at most 1 min, even when no MEND occurs at 22°C. Given that cytoplasmic solutes exchange with pipette solutions within a few seconds, this result suggests that metabolites required for MEND might be released and lost into the patch pipette during cytoplasmic application of KSP solution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MEND requires acyl CoA synthesis and palmitoylation</title><p>Initial evidence that MEND requires generation of acyl CoAs and palmitoylation is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.

However, one possibility raised by the literature is that phosphorylation of some DHHC protein substrates by PKCs can be permissive for their subsequent palmitoylation. This is the case for the dually palmitoylated, Na/K pump regulatory protein, phospholemman (PLM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tulloch et al., 2011</xref>), which is expressed preferentially in muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geering, 2006</xref>).

The overexpression of PLM caused a three-fold increase in the rate of PKC/mCoA-dependent MEND. This result clearly supports the idea that MEND can be promoted by the presence of proteins that can be palmitoylated and therefore is a ‘cargo-dependent’ form of endocytosis. At this time, we can only speculate that long-term protein modifications caused by transient oxidative stress also promote the availability of membrane protein palmitoylation sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The MEND pathway may be constitutively active</title><p>Given that MEND can be activated without large Ca transients, the question is raised whether the MEND pathway may be constitutively active at the cytoplasmic acyl CoA concentrations occurring normally in cells.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, BHK cells are essentially round after removal from dishes. From micrographs, we measured the diameter of each cell in both the ‘X’ and ‘Y’ directions, calculated the spherical area of each cell, and determined the C<sub>m</sub> of each cell after opening it via patch clamp. In the first group of experiments, BHK cells were removed from dishes and were incubated for 1 or 3 hr, either with or without NIM811 at 37°C. Results for control cells were pooled, giving three groups of measurements. The average diameters of cells employed (28.2 ± 0.9, 27.8 ± 1.0 μm, and 29.9 ± 1.4 μm) were very similar. Assuming a specific membrane capacitance of 1 pF per 100 μm<sup>2</sup>, we calculated for each cell the ratio of surface membrane area to the area of a sphere with the cell diameter. For control cells, a ratio of 2.2 ± 0.1 was obtained, indicating that surface membrane undulations account for one-half of the cell surface. After 1 hr of NIM811 treatment this ratio was not changed, but the ratio increased significantly to 2.6 ± 0.1 after 3 hr of incubation.

In summary, treatment of BHK cells with NIM811 causes a significant increase of membrane area after a delay of 1 hr, reaching a plateau within about 3 hr, indicating ‘either’ that membrane insertion at the cell surface is increased ‘or’ that membrane removal from the cell surface is decreased, as expected for partial inhibition of endocytosis.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01293.009</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>NIM811 increases surface area of cultured BHK cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Micrograph of BHK cell during patch clamp. 25× LWD lens.

(3) MEND is blocked by two cyclosporines, one considered a specific cyclophilin D/PTP inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Waldmeier et al., 2002</xref>). Although cyclosporine A also inhibits calcineurin, we determined previously that calcineurin inhibition by FK506 does not inhibit MEND (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lariccia et al., 2011</xref>). (4) MEND can be blocked by prior PKC activation, consistent with suggestions that PKCs protect cells from reperfusion injury by inhibiting PTP openings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ytrehus et al., 1994</xref>). (5) MEND occurs when cells are internally perfused with mitochondrial substrates that support PTP openings, namely succinate with Pi in potassium-rich cytoplasmic solution at an optimal free Ca concentration (0.2 μM, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Massari, 1996</xref>]). These responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) occur without an initial exocytic phase, indicating that Ca release from mitochondria, if it occurs, does not cause large Ca transients in these experiments. (6) Finally, we bring to bear original descriptions of PTP openings, monitored via mitochondrial light scattering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haworth and Hunter, 1979</xref>). Under the conditions of those experiments, the rate at which PTPs open increases over the Ca concentration range of 10–500 μM, but maximal responses are still obtained with 30 μM free Ca in less than 10 s. Free cytoplasmic Ca concentrations in our experiments definitively exceed 50 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lariccia et al., 2011</xref>), and we activate Ca influx for 10 to 14 s in the Standard MEND protocol. Therefore, it is very likely that full PTP pore openings occur during these experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Must PTPs open fully or does mitochondrial depolarization suffice to initiate MEND?</title><p>Rapid cytoplasmic application of KSP solution or CCCP with oligomycin in BHK cells induces a MEND-refractory state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which we interpret to be the consequence of CoA release via PTP openings with subsequent loss of CoA into the pipette. We admit in this regard that CCCP and oligomycin have not previously been shown to cause transient PTP openings when rapidly introduced into cells. However, depolarization definitively promotes PTP openings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scorrano et al., 1997</xref>). In fact, more specific explanations may emerge because recent work indicates that PTPS are formed by dimers of the target of oligomycin, the ATP synthetase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giorgio et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Related to these experiments, it is an important question whether mitochondrial depolarization per se causes substantial CoA release via reverse CoA transport. Studies of cardiac mitochondria indicate that reverse CoA transport can decrease matrix CoA with a half-life on the order of 15 min when mitochondria are depolarized with valinomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tahiliani, 1991</xref>). Accordingly, reverse transport of CoA by depolarized mitochondria would release only about 10% of the mitochondrial CoA content within the delay of 1–2 min that precedes the onset of MEND after a Ca transient. This may well be significant in intact cells. However, the fact that KSP solution effectively causes a MEND-refractory state within 1 min at room temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) is much more consistent with rapid CoA loss via diffusion through a pore than via the reverse transport process.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Is MEND preceded by a burst of acyl CoA synthesis and membrane protein palmitoylation?</title><p>That the pathway to Ca-activated MEND in BHK cells requires generation of acyl CoAs and palmitoylation of proteins at the cell surface is supported by the following evidence: (1) fatty acid depletion of cells for 1 hr, a specific inhibitor of acyl CoA synthetase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Omura et al., 1986</xref>), and a nonspecific inhibitor of palmitoylation, bromopalmitate, all reduce MEND, and triascin C with bromopalmitate causes complete MEND block. (2) An acetyl CoA synthetase, when perfused into cells together with acetate to deplete CoA, also fully blocks Ca-activated MEND. (3) A high concentration of CoA, which fully blocks acylation activity of a DHHC acyl transferase, fully blocks Ca-activated MEND. (4) When MEND is blocked by four different interventions that probably act through mitochondria, introduction of acyl CoA into the cytoplasm fully restores MEND. (5) Low concentrations of CoA are equally effective as acyl CoA in promoting MEND in these protocols. (6) High CoA concentrations are demonstrated to block DHHC acyl transferase activity and to strongly block MEND, and this block is rapidly reversed by perfusion CoA out of the cytoplasm. (7) Ca-activated MEND, MEND induced by acyl CoA in cyclosporine A-blocked cells, and MEND induced by PTP-promoting substrates (KSP solution) are all selectively inhibited by knockdown of the DHHC5 acyl transferase, which is known to be active at the surface membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2011</xref>). As with evidence for mitochondrial involvement, multiple explanations are possible for individual outcomes. However, the results together provide clear evidence that Ca-activated MEND requires acyl CoA synthesis and acyl transferase activity, that is protein palmitoylations, within the time frame in which MEND occurs. While palmitoylation within the secretory pathway clearly can target proteins to the plasmalemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Greaves et al., 2009</xref>), the present data sets clearly suggest that progressively greater palmitoylation of surface membrane proteins can promote removal of proteins from the cell surface by endocytosis. Whether or not MEND requires palmitoylation of specific proteins is not addressed by the present data sets. However, we have demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> that the presence of a membrane protein that can be dually palmitoylated in a PKC-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tulloch et al., 2011</xref>) facilitates the occurrence of MEND. This clearly suggests that MEND is a ‘cargo-dependent’ endocytic process.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Do sphingomyelinases play a role in Ca-activated MEND?</title><p>It seems likely that Ca-activated MEND in BHK cells is mechanistically related to endocytosis that occurs during cell wounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tam et al., 2010</xref>). As noted in the Introduction, it is proposed that exocytosis during cell wounding translocates sphingomyelinases to the cell surface, where they subsequently generate ceramide and promote endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tam et al., 2010</xref>). Further, it is proposed that caveolae are internalized in a specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corrotte et al., 2013</xref>). From our perspective, it is certain that several different mechanisms can cause MEND (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lariccia et al., 2011</xref>), and extracellular application of sphingomyelinase C does so very effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lariccia et al., 2011</xref>) when about 50% of cellular sphingomyelin is cleaved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Van Tiel et al., 2000</xref>). Our tests for involvement of native sphingomyelinases in BHK MEND responses were entirely negative, and we were able to dissociate exocytosis from MEND (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lariccia et al., 2011</xref>). While caveolae might well become involved in MEND, the loss of 70% of the cell surface during large MEND is inconsistent with the much smaller membrane area represented by caveolae in almost all cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bretscher and Whytock, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Parton and del Pozo, 2013</xref>). In our view, therefore, MEND involves the internalization of ordered membrane domains that can form via phase separation from bulk membrane as the result of multiple synergistic cellular processes, one of them being progressively more extensive palmitoylation of membrane proteins that appears to occur in Ca-activated MEND in BHK cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Is the MEND pathway constitutively active?</title><p>Constitutive endocytosis in BHK cells has been analyzed rather extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marsh and Helenius, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Griffiths et al., 1989</xref>). Between one and two percent of the surface membrane is internalized per min, mostly via well-defined coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marsh and Helenius, 1980</xref>). Nevertheless, the precise quantitation of different endocytic forms does not seem secure. Certainly, endocytic mechanisms that internalize ‘lipid raft’ proteins, in particular GPI-anchored proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lakhan et al., 2009</xref>), are also well characterized in BHK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fivaz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Refaei et al., 2011</xref>). It therefore cannot be discounted that the mechanisms underlying MEND are constitutively active, possibly in dependence on spontaneous mitochondrial depolarizations and superoxide flashes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elrod et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) and consistent with the increase of sarcolemma area caused by NIM811 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). MEND can internalize surface membrane at a rate of 50% per min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), at least 25-times greater than constitutive membrane turnover. Therefore, a constitutive activity of the MEND pathway equal to even one percent of its maximal activity would be a substantial endocytic flux in BHK cells.</p><p>Independent of mitochondrial involvement, our experiments raise a question whether the distal part of the MEND pathway, that is acyl CoA/palmitoylation-dependent endocytosis, might be a form of ‘lipid raft’-dependent endocytosis that is physiologically activated by PKCs and/or oxidative stress. Clearly, DHHC5 is constitutively functional in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>), and both PKC activation and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> promote acyl CoA-dependent endocytosis without the activation of Ca transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Endocytosis following PKC activation might in principle reflect the endocyotic process that normally inactivates PKCs by removing PKCs from the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carmena and Sardini, 2007</xref>). Although generally ascribed to conventional, ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis, a ‘caveolar’ or ‘lipid raft’ pathway that is blocked by nystatin has also been shown to participate in PKC inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leontieva and Black, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Our work suggests that the dually palmitoylated membrane protein, PLM, can be used as a simple model to study PKC-dependent endocytosis in future work, independent of mitochondrial involvement. PLM appears to be palmitoylated in dependence on its phosphorylation by PKCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tulloch et al., 2011</xref>), and expression of PLM promotes acyl CoA/PKC-dependent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Therefore, mutations of PLM to modulate selectively its palmitoylation and phosphorylation status should allow insightful experiments. It appears more challenging to elucidate how transient H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> oxidative stress activates endocytosis, although an obvious starting point will be to determine how the palmitoylation status of membrane proteins is changed by transient oxidative stress.</p><p>In summary, our work lends support to a working hypothesis that mitochondrial signaling impacts the plasmalemma by controlling and/or modulating surface membrane protein palmitoylation and subsequently palmitoylation-dependent endocytosis. One trigger appears to be release of CoA from mitochondria during mitochondrial depolarizations that involve transient PTP openings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huser and Blatter, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Korge et al., 2011</xref>). Activation of PKCs prior to a Ca transient blocks MEND, while both PKCs and transient generation of ROS support MEND progression at the cell surface. Accordingly, a wave of PKC activation during MEND will tend to restabilize mitochondria but promote ongoing endocytic events. How MEND is related to different categories of ‘lipid raft’-dependent endocytosis delineated to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lajoie and Nabi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mayor and Pagano, 2007</xref>) remains to be established. It will be of great interest to establish how and if the MEND pathway is related to Ca-activated excessive endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith and Neher, 1997</xref>) and bulk endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cousin, 2009</xref>) in secretory cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Electrical methods, cell cultures, and myocytes</title><p>Patch clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yaradanakul et al., 2008</xref>) and cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Linck et al., 1998</xref>) were as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lariccia et al., 2011</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Richard Aldrich (Reviewing editor) and Bertil Hille (peer reviewer).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this refreshingly original study, Hilgemann and colleagues attempt to understand the mechanism for massive endocytosis (MEND) – uptake of about half the plasma membrane – after a large increase in cytoplasmic calcium. The phenomenon has a corollary in ‘excessive endocytosis’ reported in chromaffin cells by Smith and Neher. The conclusion is that mitochondrial stress induces depolarization or permeability transition pore (PTP) leak of CoA that in turn promote acetyltransferase DHHC5 activity and membrane palmitoylation.</p><p>The work brings an innovative mix of biophysical and biochemical techniques and makes excellent use of two techniques unique to this laboratory: perfused whole-cell pipettes and cytoplasmic calcium loading by reversal of the Na/Ca exchanger.</p><p>This laboratory discovered MEND and now is making excellent progress towards explaining the signals underlying it, revealing a really new chain of events. The reviewers find the work to be difficult but imaginative, and congratulate the authors on significant discoveries.</p><p>Overall the work uses a novel and compelling method of accurate membrane surface area measurement, and intracellular control of metabolites and enzymes, to present a reasonable hypothesis to explain an unusual form of endocytosis. Although the authors tip their hat to the possibility that this pathway is constitutive, the hypothesis mainly rests on dire cellular Ca leak conditions, such as those that occur with membrane damage. This does not make it less important or interesting, and may lead to investigation of new membrane uptake pathways.</p><p>While we have high enthusiasm for the paper, the following issues must be resolved before the paper can be accepted.</p><p>1) The major problem is that all of the reviewers found the manuscript to be quite difficult to read and to understand. The work is of considerable importance and should be interesting and accessible to a wide range of researchers. We feel that the writing and presentation can be considerably improved so that it will be understandable to all interested readers. We encourage the authors to thoroughly rewrite the paper (and the companion paper) for clarity.</p><p>2) The following questions should be addressed, at least by comments in the text. Do PTP channels actually open before MEND occurs? Is MEND actually preceded by a burst of CoA release into the cytosol, and does such release occur through PTP channels? Is MEND preceded by a burst of acyl-CoA synthesis? Does MEND actually require the palmitoylation of a protein, and which? How directly is that protein involved in MEND? Further, how are the findings here related to the requirements for/effects of PIP2, cholesterol, alkylating phosphatases, and sphingomyelinases? In its present form, this paper seems less than definitive.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01293.012</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The major problem is that all of the reviewers found the manuscript to be quite difficult to read and to understand.
