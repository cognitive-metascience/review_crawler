subregions has not been addressed. We have found that optogenetic activation of dStr dopamine neuron terminals in mouse brain slices pauses the firing of cholinergic interneurons in both the medial and lateral subregions, while in the lateral subregion the pause is shorter due to a subsequent excitation. This excitation is mediated mainly by metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) and partially by dopamine D1-like receptors coupled to transient receptor potential channel 3 and 7. DA neurons do not signal to spiny projection neurons in the medial dStr, while they elicit ionotropic glutamate responses in the lateral dStr. The DA neurons mediating these excitatory signals are in the substantia nigra (SN). Thus, SN dopamine neurons engage different receptors in different postsynaptic neurons in different dStr subregions to convey strikingly different signals.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

To evaluate the projections of DA neurons to the mdStr or ldStr, we injected the retrograde axonal tracer cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) into the ldStr, and for comparison into the mdStr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, top panels). In the ventral midbrain, double immunostaining for CTB (green) and the DA neuron marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; magenta) revealed DA neurons projecting to the injection sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, middle). CTB is transported anterogradely as well, and so revealed the terminals of Str projection neurons in the SN pars reticulata (SNr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, middle, asterisks). The restricted distribution of anterogradely labeled terminals confirmed that the CTB injections were limited to the mdStr or ldStr, and indicated that the wider CTB staining in the Str was not due to the wider spread of the injected CTB, but rather reflected retrograde and anterograde labeling of locally connected Str neurons.

However, the subregional difference in TrpC3 expression between mdStr and ldStr was significantly smaller than the difference in the size of the slow EPSC (viz. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), so differential TrpC3 expression was not the determinant of the prominence of the slow EPSC in the ldStr.

They inhibit mdStr ChIs, while they inhibit and excite ldStr ChIs. The inhibition is D2 mediated, and shorter in ldStr ChIs due to an ensuing slow EPSC. The slow EPSC is mediated monosynaptically by glutamate cotransmission activating mGluR1 receptors, coupled to activation of TrpC3/7, along with DA activation of D1-like (D1/5) receptors. mGluR1 responses are observed only in ChIs in the ldStr, while SPNs show iGluR responses. Topographic projections of SN DA neurons to the ldStr mediate the glutamate responses in ChIs. Slow DA neuron driven EPSCs are seen discreetly in ldStr ChIs, due presynaptically to SN DA neuron glutamate cotransmission and postsynaptically to enriched expression of TrpC3, that together determine the unique responses of ldStr ChIs to DA neuron activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39786.023</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Summary of DA neuron excitatory synaptic responses in the dStr.</title><p>Transmitter release sites are shown for one presynaptic terminal per postsynaptic Str cell type.

Pharmacological isolation of the slow EPSC together with use of selective and more potent antagonists of group I mGluRs revealed mGluR1 and D1 as mediators of the slow EPSC. We used the highly potent and selective mGluR1 antagonist JNJ, at the maximum mGluR-selective concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukunaga et al., 2007</xref>). Less specific mGluR antagonists require higher concentrations that may mask mGluR1 effects through opposing actions at other mGluRs. While the JNJ and MTEP cocktail showed significant mGluR1 effects after 10 min, the D1 antagonist SCH23390 required 20 min to show significant action. SCH loses D1 selectivity at higher concentrations due to Ca2<sup>+</sup> channel blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guenther et al., 1994</xref>), so longer application times are required.</p><p>The slow EPSC was not completely blocked by mGluR1 and D1 antagonists; the small residual EPSC could be due to incomplete antagonist action, or could be a minor still unspecified response mediated by a G-protein and TrpC3/7, as it was blocked by GDPÎ²S or FFA. FFA has multiple actions besides TrpC3/7 antagonism; it is also a TrpC6 agonist and affects other ion channels. The lack of significant effects on fast glutamate EPSCs excluded effects on transmitter release through other ion channels, and complete blockade of slow EPSCs excluded a TrpC6 contribution to the slow EPSCs.</p><p>Optogenetic activation of DA neurons projecting to olfactory tubercle (OT) evokes a delayed D1-mediated excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wieland et al., 2014</xref>). While the delayed excitation in the OT is solely D1 mediated, D1-like receptors mediate only part of the response in dStr ChIs. Since DA neuron glutamatergic projections to the mdStr are sparse, the small slow EPSCs seen in some mdStr ChIs are likely D1R mediated, pointing to slow D1-mediated excitation of ChIs across the Str. Both D1 and D5 receptors are expressed in ChIs, but DA application produces the same depolarization in wild type and D1R KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Centonze et al., 2003</xref>), arguing that the D1 component of slow EPSCs is mainly D5R mediated. Although our observation of enriched D5R expression and reduced D1R expression in ChIs agree with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yan et al., 1997</xref>), we found a higher absolute D1R expression in ChIs than previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yan et al., 1997</xref>); this could be due to methodological differences, species (rat vs. mouse) or animal age. Immunostaining would not necessarily reveal D1Rs in ChIs given the high D1R expression in dSPNs, which greatly outnumber ChIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergson et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>The slow EPSC in dStr ChIs is mainly mGluR1 mediated. Slow mGluR1 EPSCs were originally described in cerebellar Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batchelor and Garthwaite, 1997</xref>) and ventral midbrain DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fiorillo and Williams, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shen and Johnson, 1997</xref>); however, these slow EPSCs are seen only with spike trains, suggesting that they are mediated by glutamate spillover acting at extrasynaptic receptors. In contrast, slow EPSCs in ldStr ChIs are reliably evoked with single spikes, at low frequency, suggesting that mGluR1 receptors are closer to synaptic release sites in ChIs than in Purkinje cells or DA neurons. ChIs, as well as SPNs, express both mGluR1 and iGluRs, and iGluR responses are evoked in SPNs by stimulation of other glutamate inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>), but not mGluR1 responses. Furthermore, mGluR1 is not enriched in ChIs. Thus, the different glutamate responses in ChIs and SPNs â mGluR1 in ChIs and iGluRs in SPNs â appear to depend on the differential distribution of the receptors at postsynaptic sites of DA neuron glutamate cotransmission in the two cell types.</p><p>Perfusion of group I mGluR agonists evokes a TrpC3/7 mediated depolarization in dStr ChIs in rat brain slice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berg et al., 2007</xref>); our expression studies show that dStr ChIs express both mGluR1 and TrpC3. TrpC3 is also a major mediator of mGluR1-mediated slow EPSCs in cerebellar Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hartmann et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that ldStr ChIs share with Purkinje cells the same mGluR EPSC mechanism. mGluR1 is also expressed in ventral midbrain DA neurons and their terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fiorillo and Williams, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang and Sulzer, 2004</xref>), and presynaptic mGluR1s reduce DA release in the Str (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang and Sulzer, 2004</xref>). Since activation of presynaptic receptors requires transmitter spillover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scanziani et al., 1997</xref>), activation of presynaptic mGluR1 on DA neuron terminals by single spikes is less likely. However, when DA neurons fire in bursts, mGluR1-mediated presynaptic inhibition would limit glutamate cotransmission in the ldStr, and likely reduce temporal summation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Glutamate cotransmission from substantia nigra dopamine neurons</title><p>While DA neuron cotransmission consistently evokes iGluR EPSCs in the NAc medial shell, reports of EPSCs in the dStr have varied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chuhma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mingote et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stuber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tritsch et al., 2012</xref>). Our present results reveal that iGluR EPSCs vary based on recording location, with small or no responses in the mdStr and larger responses in the ldStr. mGluR1 responses in ChIs are prominent in the ldStr. Thus, the ldStr â in addition to the NAc medial shell â is a hotspot of DA neuron glutamate cotransmission. Given the topography of DA neuron projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haber et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ikemoto, 2007</xref>), the ldStr should receive input solely from the SNc. Although our CTB results showed the existence of non-topographical projections from VTA DA neurons to the ldStr, as has also been observed in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maurin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pennartz et al., 2009</xref>), these non-topographical VTA projections do not mediate glutamate cotransmission in the ldStr. Considering the very sparse expression of ZsGreen in the VTA following ldStr injections, the non-topographic projection appears to arise from non-glutamate cotransmitting DA neurons, which may contribute to D1- or D2-like receptor responses in ldStr ChIs. Our retrograde viral tracing showed that most glutamate cotransmission in the ldStr ChIs arises from SN DA neurons, where VGLUT2 expression has not been reported in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morales and Root, 2014</xref>). This discrepancy could be due to the difficulty of detecting a small population of neurons with relatively low expression levels by in situ hybridization.</p><p>The INTRSECT strategy revealed that about a fifth of SN DA neurons coexpress VGLUT2, which was more than found by in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morales and Root, 2014</xref>) or CAV2-FLEX-ZsGreen retrograde labeling. Similarly, the INTRSECT strategy revealed a few fibers in the mdStr, but there was no retrograde labeling with ZsGreen. This could be due to a lack of CAV receptors on mdStr projecting DA neurons, but was more likely due to the sparse distribution of mdStr projecting DA neurons and the more restricted volume of the CAV injection. While DA neurons capable of glutamate cotransmission constitute a minority of SN neurons, they elicit substantial excitation due to their relatively restricted projection area. The INTRSECT strategy showed TH/VGLUT2 colocalization in the VTA as well. Since TH<sup>+</sup>/VGLUT2<sup>+</sup> neurons in the VTA made little contribution to the non-topographic projection to the ldStr, these coexpressing VTA neurons presumably project topographically to the NAc. There were ChR2<sup>+</sup>/TH<sup>â</sup> neurons in the SN, apparently showing lower specificity of the INTRSECT strategy. This could be due to a combination of slightly higher non-specific expression of TH-driven gene expression than DAT-driven gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lammel et al., 2015</xref>), recombination efficacy/specificity of the particular INTRSECT virus, and limitations in identifying colocalization of cytosolic TH and membrane-targeted ChR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stuber et al., 2015</xref>). Some non-specific expression, notwithstanding, the INTRSECT results showed substantial SN DA neuron glutamate projections to the ldStr, and sparse projections to the mdStr, consistent with the CAV2 results, showing that DA/glutamate neurons in the SN project to the ldStr.</p><p>Our retrograde tracing studies revealed that about 40% of mdStr or ldStr projecting neurons are non-DAergic, presumably GABA-only or glutamate-only neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morales and Root, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morello and Partanen, 2015</xref>). Glutamate-only neurons are seen in both the VTA and SNc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hnasko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morales and Root, 2014</xref>), and indeed we observed 30â40% TH<sup>-</sup>/VGLUT2<sup>+</sup> neurons in both the VTA and the SN (SNc/SNr). Both TH<sup>+</sup>/VGLUT2<sup>+</sup> and TH<sup>-</sup>/VGLUT2<sup>+</sup> (glutamate-only) neurons projecting to the ldStr reside in the SN, and do not project to the mdStr, consistent with the recognized segregation of DA neurons projecting to the medial and lateral dStr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lerner et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, glutamate cotransmitting DA neurons and glutamate-only neurons appear to project similarly to the dStr.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional implications</title><p>DA neurons may engage ChIs as a hub to control Str circuits. Although ChIs comprise only 1â2% of striatal neurons, they exert a strong control of striatal circuits with their large axonal fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kawaguchi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kreitzer, 2009</xref>). In response to reward-related cues or outcomes, dStr ChIs frequently show a burst-pause-burst firing pattern, coincident with DA neuron burst firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schulz and Reynolds, 2013</xref>). While the early burst is mediated by thalamic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding et al., 2010</xref>), the pause appears to be principally D2R mediated. The subsequent rebound in firing is highly variable, suggesting that it is generated and modulated independently of the D2-mediated pause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schulz and Reynolds, 2013</xref>). Multiple mechanisms likely contribute to the rebound firing, one of which is the DA neuron mediated slow EPSC. The presence of the slow EPSC in the ldStr, and not the mdStr, likely contributes to subregional variability in ChI rebound firing.</p><p>The slow EPSC is likely to shorten or cancel the D2R mediated firing pause in ldStr ChIs. Although the circuit functions of ChI pauses have not been totally elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang and Cragg, 2017</xref>), there are several suggestive physiological observations. Silencing ChIs reduces spontaneous IPSCs in SPNs, while ChI firing increases sIPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Rover et al., 2002</xref>), presumably through activation of a class of GABA interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">English et al., 2011</xref>). Cortical or thalamic glutamatergic inputs are reduced by activation of presynaptic muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Higley et al., 2009</xref>), and a single ChI spike is sufficient to reduce cortical glutamate EPSCs in SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pakhotin and Bracci, 2007</xref>) 391-400). Thus, we can presume that pausing ChIs provides a window facilitating excitation of SPNs by lessening GABA inhibition, and simultaneously accentuating glutamate inputs by removing mAChR-mediated inhibition. The delayed increase of firing in ChIs caused by the slow EPSCs may regulate the excitation window for SPNs in the ldStr.</p><p>At a local circuit level, cholinergic tone in the dStr modifies frequency dependence of DA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Threlfell and Cragg, 2011</xref>), excitatory input strength, including long-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanimura et al., 2016</xref>), and GABA tone by affecting Str interneurons and SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">English et al., 2011</xref>). DA neuron tonic activity may affect basal cholinergic tone differentially in the mdStr and ldStr due to the mGluR component in the ldStr. Str ChIs play important roles in behavioral flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okada et al., 2014</xref>); chemogenetic activation of ldStr ChIs enhances switching habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the slow EPSC may modulate habit switching by transiently countering tonic DA neuron DA modulation of ldStr ChIs.</p><p>While DA neurons elicit excitatory signals via D1R and inhibitory signals via D2R across the dStr, subregional differences in the dStr involve differences in the strength of the signals. In contrast, glutamate cotransmission varies in timing and synaptic mechanism, with hotspots of fast cotransmission in the NAc medial shell and ldStr and slow excitation limited to ChIs in the ldStr.

After confirmation of full anesthesia, mice were decapitated and brains quickly removed in ice-cold high-glucose artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (in mM: 75 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.7 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 100 glucose, pH 7.4) saturated with mixture of 95% O2% and 5% CO2 (carbogen). Coronal sections of the striatum were cut, 300 Âµm thick, with a vibrating microtome (VT1200S, Leica), incubated in high glucose ACSF at room temperature for at least 1 hr for recovery, then transferred to the recording chamber (submerged, 500 Âµl volume) on the stage of an upright microscope (BX61WI, Olympus), continuously perfused with standard ACSF (in mM: 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 25 glucose, pH 7.4) saturated with carbogen. ChR2-EYFP, D2-EGFP or ChAT-eGFP expression was confirmed by field illumination with a 470 nm LED; D1-tdTomato expression was confirmed with 530 nm LED illumination (DC4100, Thorlabs). Recorded neurons were visualized using enhanced visible light differential interference contrast (DIC) optics with a scientific c-MOS camera (ORCA-Flash4.0LT, Hamamatsu Photonics).</p><p>In DAT<sup>IREScre</sup>:Ai32 mice, ChIs were identified visually by large soma size, confirmed by spontaneous firing, shallow resting membrane potentials (around â60 mV) and voltage sag by â400 pA current injection (700 msec duration) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chuhma et al., 2014</xref>). Recording patch pipettes were fabricated from standard-wall borosilicate glass capillary with filament (World Precision Instruments). Pipette resistance was 3â7 MÎ©. Composition of intracellular solution for firing and the slow EPSC recording was (in mM): 135 K<sup>+</sup>-methane sulfonate (MeSO<sub>4</sub>), 5 KCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 2 ATP and 0.1 GTP, pH 7.25. For G-protein coupled receptor blockade, GTP was replaced with 0.5â1 mM GDPÎ²S. GDPÎ²S pipette solution was made from powder just before recording, kept on ice and discarded after 2 hr. For fast glutamate EPSC recording, Cs<sup>+</sup>-based pipette solution was used; K<sup>+</sup>-MeSO<sub>4</sub> was replaced with Cs<sup>+</sup>-MeSO<sub>4</sub>, with QX314 (lidocaine N-ethyl bromide) 5 mM. Both voltage and current clamp recordings were performed with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Holding potential was â70 mV. Current clamp recordings were done in fast current clamp mode. Series resistance (8â26 MÎ©) was compensated online by 70â75%. Liquid junction potentials (10â12 mV) were adjusted online. Synaptic responses were evoked with five msec field illumination with a high-power blue LED (Thorlabs) delivered either as a single pulse at 0.1 Hz, or in a train of five pulses at 20 Hz, repeated at 30 s intervals. Since some slow EPSC recording showed a build up with repeated stimulation, the control pre-drug responses were recorded after the EPSC had reached a plateau.</p><p>For pharmacological studies, drugs were delivered by perfusion. For wash off of the effects of mGluR antagonists and D1-antagonist on isolated slow EPSCs, slices were perfused with regular ACSF for 15â25 min, followed by control antagonists (CNQX, D-APV, SR95531 and sulpiride) for at least 5 min. Recording from VGLUT2 cKO mice and control mice were done genotype blind. All the recordings were done at 32â34Â°C (TC 344B Temperature Controller, Warner Instruments). Data were filtered at 5 kHz using a 4-pole Bessel filter, digitized at 5 kHz (Digidata 1550A, Molecular Devices) and recorded using pClamp 10 (Molecular Devices; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011323">SCR_011323</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Data analysis for electrophysiology</title><p>Electrophysiological data were analyzed with Axograph X (Axograph Science; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014284">SCR_014284</ext-link>). Firing z score during or post train stimulation was calculated as the difference of average firing frequency during (0â0.4 s from train onset) or post train (0.5â0.9 s from train onset), minus the average baseline firing frequency, divided by the standard deviation of baseline firing frequency. Plus score indicates increase of firing from the baseline, while minus score indicates decrease of firing. Since ChIs were firing continuously and it was hard to identify resting state of membrane, we regarded averaged membrane potentials after action potentials were truncated as the resting membrane potentials. PSC evaluation was done from averages made from 10 consecutive traces. Slow EPSCs were evaluated by measuring charge transfer in a 1 s or 1.5 s window (âarea under the curveâ) for more reliable comparison. Since synaptic responses to the first stimulus after a long interval were artificially large, we discarded them.

Slice preparation and recording environment were the same as described in the Slice electrophysiology section. DA release was evoked with either a single pulse (five msec duration) or a train (5 pulses at 20 Hz; 5 ms duration pulses) of field illumination of blue LED. Photostimulation trains was applied at intervals of 1â2 min. DA release was measured using carbon fiber electrodes placed 30â100 Âµm below the slice surface. Carbon fibers was calibrated in 1 ÂµM DA after each experiment. A triangular voltage wave (â400 toÂ +Â 800 mV at 300 V/sec vs. Ag/AgCl) was applied to the electrode at 10 Hz and the resulting currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B (Molecular Devices), filtered at 10 kHz with a 4-pole Bessel filter. Offset currents were not applied to avoid saturation of the amplifier. DA currents were confirmed by examination of the cyclic voltammograms for the signature DA oxidation current waveform. Traces of DA release were obtained by plotting current measured at the potential of peak DA oxidation for each voltage command as a function of time, in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000325">SCR_000325</ext-link>) using custom routines (Eugene Mosharov, sulzerlab.org).

Brains were removed and post-fixed for 2â16 hr in 4% PFA. Coronal sections, 50 Âµm thick, were cut using a vibrating microtome (Leica VT1200S), and stored in a cryoprotectant solution (30% glycerol, 30% ethylene glycol in 0.1 M Tris HCl, pH 7.4) at â20Â°C until processing. Sections were washed in PBS and incubated in glycine (100 mM) for 30 min to quench aldehydes. Non-specific binding was blocked with 10% normal goat serum (NGS; Millipore) in 0.1 PBS Triton X-100 (PBS-T) for 2 hr. The sections were incubated with primary antibodies in 0.02% PBS-T and 2% NGS for 24 hr, at 4Â°C on a shaker. Primary antibodies were: anti-TH (1:5,000â10,000 dilution, mouse monoclonal, Millipore, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2201528">AB_2201528</ext-link>), anti-CTB (1:1000 dilution, List Biological Laboratories, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10013220">AB_10013220</ext-link>), anti-EGFP (1:2000 dilution, rabbit polyclonal, Millipore, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_91337">AB_91337</ext-link>) and anti-choline acetyltransferase (ChAT; 1:1000 dilution, goat polyclonal, Millipore, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2079751">AB_2079751</ext-link>).

Images were taken in 1 Âµm steps to subtend the entire thickness of slices (18â22 images per slice), and each z-section image was examined for immuno- or tracer-fluorescence. The SN and VTA were delineated based on TH staining and mouse brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paxinos and Franklin, 2008</xref>). SN pars compacta (SNc) and pars reticulata (SNr) were not delineated, since the boundaries between SNc and SNr was not clear in caudal sections. While the retrorubral field (RRF) was delineated (see Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), cell counts in the region were not included. Cell counts from each midbrain section were summed per animal and then averaged across animals according to injection location. For CTB injected animals, CTB<sup>+</sup> neurons were counted in every fifth section (sampling interval 250 Âµm). For CAV2 injected animals, all ZsGreen<sup>+</sup> cells in all sections containing VTA/SN DA neurons were counted, since the number of labelled cells was small. The number of TH<sup>+</sup> retrogradely labelled cells (TH<sup>+</sup>/ZsGreen<sup>+</sup> or TH<sup>+</sup>/CTB<sup>+</sup>) and TH<sup>â</sup> cells (TH<sup>â</sup>/ZsGreen<sup>+</sup> or TH<sup>â</sup>/CTB<sup>+</sup>) were counted, and percent colocalization calculated for all tracer+Â neurons. For the INTRSECT study, neurons were counted in every second section (sampling interval 100 Âµm) in the SN, counting SNc and SNr together.</p><p>For estimates of the density of ChIs in the dStr, the dStr was split into medial and lateral parts based on previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lerner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Voorn et al., 2004</xref>), and ChAT<sup>+</sup> cells were counted using the Optical Fractionator Probe in Stereo Investigator (MBF Bioscience) using a 10x objective. In each brain, 17â18 slices were analyzed. Stereo Investigatorâs Cavalieri Estimator Probe with a 100 Ã 100 Âµm grid was used to determine the volume of the subregions. Stereological studies were performed unilaterally.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Extraction of ChI mRNA and qPCR</title><p>We used RiboTag immunoprecipitation (IP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sanz et al., 2009</xref>), as modified by Lesiak <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lesiak et al., 2015</xref>). Double hemizygous RiboTag;ChAT<sup>cre</sup> mice (P57-76) were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine. After decapitation, brains were quickly removed in ice-cold PBS. Thick coronal sections of the dStr were cut with a razor blade, and divided into mdStr and ldStr segments; to avoid contamination from cholinergic neurons in the septum or pallidum, only the ldStr was sampled in the caudal most section. Tissue from three mice was gathered to make one replicate in order to obtain sufficient mRNA from ChIs. Tissue was homogenized at 5% w/v in homogenization buffer (HB: Tris pH 7.4 50 mM, KCl 100 mM, MgCl<sub>2</sub>12 mM and NP-40 1%) supplemented with protease inhibitors (SigmaAldrich), RNase inhibitor (200 U/ml, Promega), DTT (1 mM, SigmaAldrich) and cycloheximide (100 Âµg/ml, SigmaAldrich), and then centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min at 4Â°C. Supernatant, 12.5 Âµl for each segment, was set aside as the input fraction (control sample for all Str cells) and stored at â80Â°C. The remaining supernatant was diluted to 50% with HB and incubated with anti-HA.11 epitope tag antibody (1:160 dilution, Biolegend) on a tube rotator for 4 hr at 4Â°C. Then Dynabeads Protein G (15 mg/ml; ThermoFisher Scientific) was added to the supernatant and incubated on the tube rotator overnight at 4Â°C. The Dynabead suspension was put on a magnet rack (Promega) to isolate the beads, which were then washed three times with high-salt buffer (Tris pH 7.4 50 mM, KCl 300 mM, MgCl2 12 mM, NP-40 1%, DTT 1 mM, cycloheximide 100 Âµg/l). After the final wash, each sample of beads was resuspended in 350 Âµl RLT buffer (RNeasy Micro Kit, Qiagen) with Î²-mercaptoethanol (bME; 10 Âµl/ml, Gibco). The suspension was then vortexed at full speed for 30 s, and put on the magnetic rack again to remove the beads, and the supernatant was then used as the immunoprecipitation (IP) fraction. Similarly, 350 Âµl RLT buffer with bME was added to the input fraction, which was vortexed for 30 s and the RNA extracted. Both IP and input samples were eluted in 17 Âµl water.</p><p>After extraction, RNA was quantified using the Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). The measured amount of RNA, in a volume of 17 Âµl, was in the range of 1.7â22.4 ng for IP samples, and 104â609 ng for input samples. RNA was reverse transcribed, from 16 Âµl of the 17 ÂµL RNA solution, with the RT2 First Strand Kit (Qiagen). The resulting cDNA was stored at â20Â°C pending quantitative PCR (qPCR) determinations. qPCR was performed in Custom RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays (Qiagen, 96 well, #330171, CLAM23840) using RT2 SYBR Green qPCR Mastermix (Qiagen). In addition to the genes of interest, mGluR1, mGluR5, TrpC3 and TrpC7, other genes analyzed included ChAT and VAChT as IP controls, and D1, D2 and D5 receptors as genes of known differential expression in ChIs. GAPDH and Î²-actin were measured as housekeeping genes. RT controls included a positive PCR control and negative genomic DNA control. cDNA from IP samples was used for PCR without dilution, while cDNA from input samples was diluted 1:1 (with water). PCR was done with a CFX96 Touch thermocycler (BioRad), following a cycle protocol of 95Â°C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95Â°C for 15 s and 60Â°C for 1 min, followed by a melting curve. Genomic DNA controls were not amplified in any samples. Expression was normalized to GAPDH using Ct values (âCt). Differences in expression between dStr regions were expressed as 2<sup>-âCt</sup>. For analysis of enrichment of expression in ChIs, the âCtâs of the IP sample and the input sample were compared using ââCt, and the fold-change 2<sup>-ââCt</sup> calculated. A fold-change greater than one reflects enrichment in the IP sample. One replicate was omitted as it had more than a 3 SD deviation in 2<sup>-ââCt</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample size estimation was done with G*Power 3.1 (Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_013726">SCR_013726</ext-link>), setting Î±=0.05, and powerÂ =Â 0.9. Effect size was estimated from previous experiments. For t-tests, effect size for experiments anticipating complete blockade (e.g. CNQX effects on fast EPSCs) was set at 2.5. For experiments anticipating partial blockade or enhancement (<italic>e.g.</italic> sulpiride effects on PSCs), effect size was set at 1.5. These analyses required an n per group of 5 or 7, respectively. For repeated measures ANOVA (including mixed ANOVA), effect sizes for complete blockade and partial blockade were set at 0.8 and 0.5, giving a required n per group of 4 or 7, respectively. For regional comparisons (independent sample comparisons), we set an effect size of 0.8, based on previous recordings from different striatal subregions, giving a required n per region of 10. We did not use non-parametric tests, because (1) generally non-parametric tests are less sensitive with small sample numbers (e.g. less than 20), (2) the variables we measured were continuous numeric variables (not ranked variables), which are likely to show a normal distribution, and (3) non-parametric alternatives do not exist for some parametric tests (<italic>e.g.</italic> mixed ANOVA).</p><p>Statistical analysis was done with SPSS 23 (IBM; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002865">SCR_002865</ext-link>) and JASP ver 0.8.6 (JASP Team, 2018; jasp-stats.org; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015823">SCR_015823</ext-link>). Comparisons of two values were done using a t-test. When sample size (biological replicate number) was smaller than 10 or variances were not equal, a t-test without assumption of equal variances (Welchâs t-test) was used. For evaluation of drug effects, comparison was made on a percent basis to the pre-drug response (100%) using a one-sample t-test. For more than three variable comparisons, ANOVA was used. In repeated-measures ANOVA, when sphericity was violated, Greenhouse-Geisser correction was conducted. For gene expression studies, regional differences were compared using a general linear model multivariate analysis. For one-way or two-way ANOVA, Scheffeâs post-hoc test was used to identify significant differences. For mixed ANOVA, when significant interactions were found, post-hoc t-tests were done for between-subject effects. For CTB cell counts, Ï<sup>2</sup> test was used. For CAV2 counts, a mixed ANOVA was used, as Ï<sup>2</sup> failed with zeros in some cells. p values smaller than 0.05 were regarded as significant. Data are reported as meanÂ Â±Â S.E.M., unless otherwise noted. In the graphs, dots show the average measurements for each biological replicate, and bars show the mean and S.E.M. for all biological replicates. Exact values of n, what n represents, p values, and F values for ANOVA tests are presented in the figure legends. Numbers of animals used for electrophysiological recordings are indicated in the figure legends. For the main electrophysiological experiments, no more than 3 cells were recorded per animal; for the VGLUT2 cKO experiments and AAV-DIO-ChR2 injection experiments, 3 to 6 cells were recorded per animal. p values are shown to the third decimal place, so p=0.000 reflects p&lt;0.001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Larry Zweifel for

While spread to SPNs proximate to the injection sites made the injections appear larger, the limited SPN projections in the SNr showed that the injection sites were smaller than they appeared, confirming the differential targeting of the medial or lateral dStr.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be outstanding if the authors could design a strategy allowing to identify whether or not DA neurons projecting to distinct striatal territory are part of the same population or not.</p></disp-quote><p>Lerner et al., 2015, showed that different DA neuron populations project to the medial and lateral dStr, with CAV injections into the medial or lateral dStr and non-cell-selective cre injections into the SN. Our CAV2-FLEX-ZsGreen experiments show no projections to the medial dStr, consistent with this segregation. These results are also consistent with the recognized anatomy of SN DA neurons, whose axonal projections are restricted to a single striatal compartment, and do not branch to innervate other compartments (Matsuda et al., 2009, J Neurosci). So, medial and lateral dStr projecting DA neurons do form separate populations, except possibly for the small number projecting to the border between the medial and lateral dStr, which could be seen as projecting to both compartments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second is the genetic analysis, which I find interesting per se, yet slightly detached from the rest of the paper and indeed weakly present also in the Discussion.

It is the same for D2 antagonists; sulpiride is a âD2 antagonistâ, but is actually a âD2-like receptor antagonistâ. We added the explanation that the D1 antagonist SCH blocks D1-like (D1/D5) receptors at the first mention of SCH (Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The anatomical exploration in Figures 8-10 is a bit puzzling.

Are they described in earlier literature?</p></disp-quote><p>Since the VTA-ldStr projections showed very little VGLUT2 expression, based on the CAV2-ZsGreen experiment (Figure 8), we presumed that the non-topographic projections were from non-glutamate cotransmitting DA neurons. However, those neurons may contribute to D2 or D5 responses in ChIs in the ldStr. The non-topographical projections are described in rat, as we cited, but have not been described in other species.

Regarding the demonstration of dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission, the conditional VGLUT2 knockout (cKO) experiment is better controlled, as it depends on DAT (Figure 7), rather than TH, as the conditional driver.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 9, subsection âGlutamate cotransmission from substantia nigra dopamine neuronsâ, last paragraph. What is the basis of the TH-/ChR2+ neurons in Figure 9? If leaky ChR2 expression, how can glutamate-only transmission be excluded as an explanation for the ldStr EPSCs? Were previously published validation procedures for INTRSECT employed?</p></disp-quote><p>The INTRSECT experiment and electrophysiological experiments used different transgenic mice with different drivers for DA-neuron specific expression of ChR2. For electrophysiology, we used DAT<sup>IREScre</sup>; floxSTOP-ChR2 (Ai32) double mutant mice. The DAT<sup>IREScre</sup>driver shows high specificity for DA neurons: about 98% of ChR2<sup>+</sup> neurons immunostain for TH (Mingote et al., 2017). Therefore, a contribution from glutamate-only neurons is unlikely.</p><p>There are several possibilities for the lower specificity with the INTRSECT strategy. There may be more non-specific expression from the TH promoter than DAT (Lammel et al., 2015). The TH<sup>2A-flpo</sup> mice used for the INTRSECT experiment show 93% specificity of reporter expression in DA neurons (Poulin et al., 2018), which is lower than the specificity with DAT<sup>IREScre</sup>. Expression specificity is presumably affected by the viral vectors as well. The AAV-hSyn-Con/Fon-hChR2-EYFP-WPRE virus we used may have a higher incidence of non-conditional recombination.</p><p>ChR2/TH colocalization is harder to visualize than staining with two cytoplasmic epitopes; since ChR2 is membrane-targeted, ChR2/TH double positive neurons are recognized as TH<sup>+</sup> soma surrounded by ChR2<sup>+</sup> membrane. Although we imaged both color channels in all z-stack planes carefully, some colocalized neurons may have been overlooked. Finally, TH expression varies in DA neurons (Bayer and Pickel, Brain Res, 1991; Stuber, Stamatakis and Kantak, 2015), so that weakly TH<sup>+</sup> neurons may be missed. Lower specificity may be due to the combination of these factors.</p><p>Even with some non-specific ChR2 expression, examining TH<sup>+</sup>/VGLUT2<sup>+</sup> fibers in the dStr, we see fibers in the ldStr, but only rare fibers in the mdStr. This supports the result of the CAV2 experiment, which was the major purpose of the INTRSECT experiment. We added this to the Discussion in âGlutamate cotransmission from substantia nigra dopamine neuronsâ (second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The CAV2 and INTRSECT strategies are fancy, but given that several caveats are noted for these, why not employ the older but better validated approach of combining retrograde labeling with immunostaining and/or ISH for vGLUT2 and TH?</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of the CAV2 and INTRSECT experiments was to reevaluate the results obtained by classical techniques. Although the new techniques have pitfalls; e.g. specificity of ChR2 expression with the INTRSECT strategy, as mentioned above, the well-established methods have their own limitations as well. Specifically, the issue was how to detect low levels of VGLUT2 expression in DA neurons. Although in situ hybridization (ISH) is a well-established and widely used technique, it does not have sufficient sensitivity to detect low-abundance messages. The CAV2 and INTRSECT enable better detection of VGLUT2 expression. Indeed, we found DA neurons in the SN, which were not previously detected by ISH; see also Poulin et al., 2018.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>Subsection âSynaptic currents underlying different ChI responses in the mdStr and ldStrâ, first paragraph.
