Abnormalities typically associated with ASD include; corneal opacity, cataract, posterior embryotoxon, iris hypoplasia, corectopia or polycoria, and adhesions between the iris and cornea or lens and cornea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reis and Semina, 2011</xref>). Approximately 50% of ASD patients develop glaucoma that can lead to visual impairment and blindness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cvekl and Tamm, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ito and Walter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reis and Semina, 2011</xref>). Although mutations in genes encoding transcription factors, transporters, and glycosylating proteins have been described in patients with ASD, several ASD cases still await genetic elucidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cvekl and Tamm, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ito and Walter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reis and Semina, 2011</xref>), and the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of different ASD conditions remain unknown. During development, most AS structures are derived from the neural crest cells (NCC), including the corneal stroma and endothelium, ciliary body muscle and body, iris stroma, and the trabecular meshwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gage et al., 2005</xref>). Migrating NCC of the periocular mesenchyme (POM) begin to invade the AS of the eye between E11.5 and E12.5 during murine development and differentiate into corneal endothelial cells and keratocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pei and Rhodin, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Swamynathan, 2013</xref>). By E16.5, the presumptive iris is visible and detaches from the cornea, while the drainage structures (trabecular meshwork and Schlemm’s canal) continue to develop postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gould et al., 2004</xref>). NCC also gives rise to the sclera, pericytes of the choroid and hyaloid vasculature, orbital cartilage and bone, and oculomotor tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavodeassi et al., 2019</xref>). The neural crest is a transient embryonic structure in vertebrates that delaminates from the border between the neural plate and the non-neural ectoderm; NCC migrate throughout the embryo to multiple locations and differentiate into a wide variety of cell types and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mayor and Theveneau, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sauka-Spengler and Bronner-Fraser, 2008</xref>). Recent studies have shown that primary cilia play essential roles in morphogenetic processes involving neural crest-derived cells such as craniofacial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schock and Brugmann, 2017</xref>). It has been proposed that primary cilia mediate tissue-tissue interactions requiring reciprocal signaling rather than purely NCC specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brugmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tobin et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Primary cilia are microtubule-based cellular organelles that emanate from the basal body and extend from the plasma membrane. A bidirectional movement of protein particles along the axoneme, called intraflagellar transport (IFT), ensures the appropriate assembly and maintenance of cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Iomini et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kozminski et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rosenbaum and Witman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Taschner and Lorentzen, 2016</xref>). Primary cilia play a pivotal role in the development and tissue homeostasis by regulating multiple signaling pathways, most notably Hedgehog (Hh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bangs and Anderson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>), and also Wnt, Notch and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">May-Simera et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pala et al., 2017</xref>). Upon cilia binding to one of the three mammalian Hh ligands (Sonic hedgehog (SHH), Indian hedgehog (IHH) or Desert hedgehog (DHH)) to the receptor Patched (PTCH), the Hh transducer Smoothened (SMO) accumulates in the cilia and PTCH is excluded. Subsequently, SMO activates the Gli transcription factors which translocate to the nucleus and activate the expression of Hh target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elliott and Brugmann, 2019</xref>) involved in cell proliferation, maintenance of stemness, cell-fate determination, cell survival and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Katoh and Katoh, 2009</xref>).</p><p>A wide range of human diseases can be attributed to dysfunctions of cilia, known as ciliopathies, which affect most human organ systems, including the AS of the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>). Patients affected by Meckel syndrome, a severe ciliopathy, present AS abnormalities including microphthalmos/anophthalmos, aniridia, cryptophthalmos, sclerocornea, abnormal corneal thickness, corneal neovascularization, and abnormal iridocorneal angle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">MacRae et al., 1972</xref>). Oral-facial-digital syndrome has recently been reported to include several cases of microphthalmia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abuhamda and Elsous, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cortés et al., 2016</xref>) and a patient affected by Joubert syndrome has been described with corneal opacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zaki et al., 2011</xref>). More commonly, glaucoma and cataract are conditions associated with Bardet-Biedl and Lowe syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eibschitz-Tsimhoni, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Luo et al., 2014</xref>), cataract and keratoconus with Leber’s congenital amaurosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eibschitz-Tsimhoni, 2003</xref>), and one of the features of the Biedmond syndrome type 2, resembling to the Bardet-Biedl syndrome, is the presence of iris colloboma (OMIM #210350) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schachat and Maumenee, 1982</xref>).</p><p>Several studies focusing on craniofacial development have demonstrated that ablation of the primary cilium via inactivation of the IFT in NCC leads to severe craniofacial defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brugmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Millington et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Snedeker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Watanabe et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, systemic mutations in ciliogenic genes causing an increase in Hh activity and a deletion of <italic>Gli3</italic>, which acts predominantly as a repressor of the Hh target genes, lead to similar abnormal ocular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burnett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Franz and Besecke, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Furimsky and Wallace, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Johnson, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wiegering et al., 2019</xref>). Conversely, loss or downregulation of Hh activity leads to severe craniofacial and ocular defects including anophthalmia, cyclopia, microphthalmia, and coloboma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavodeassi et al., 2019</xref>), leading us to hypothesize that the primary cilium plays a pivotal role in the development of the AS and that dysfunction of the primary cilium in NCC could lead to conditions similar to those associated with ASD.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the primary cilium in the development of NCC derived ocular structures and its possible role in ASD. We showed that NCC of the POM are ciliated and that primary cilia persist in keratocytes of adult mice. By ablating primary cilia in NCC, we were able to induce an ASD phenotype with impaired corneal stroma organization and dimension, abnormal iridocorneal angle and corneal neovascularization. We also observed a reduction of the Hh signaling pathway and the cell proliferation specifically in a subset of cells in the POM surrounding the retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE), and a decreased expression of <italic>Foxc1</italic> and <italic>Pitx2</italic>, two transcription factors identified as major ASD causative genes. Furthermore, we identified the endothelial cells of the choroid as the cells expressing <italic>Ihh</italic>, which is the Hh ligand maintaining the Hh activity in the POM surrounding the RPE layer in normal eye development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Primary cilium ablation in NCC leads to ASD phenotype</title><p>In order to categorize the role of primary cilia in the development of NCC-derived tissue of the POM we first determined spatiotemporal distribution of primary cilia during murine development by immunofluorescence (IF) using an anti-Arl13b Ab, a widely accepted ciliary marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caspary et al., 2007</xref>) in genetically labeled NCC.

To assess the presence/absence of primary cilia in adult corneas we utilized a transgenic mouse line expressing the ciliary membrane protein somatostatin receptor three fused to GFP under the ubiquitous promoter for actin (Sstr3::GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">O'Connor et al., 2013</xref>). Intravital microscopy revealed that cilia were present in all keratocytes of the corneal stroma of 3-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, despite a common embryonic origin with the corneal endothelium, keratocytes maintained cilia into adulthood. To gain ultrastructural insights we analyzed corneal stroma and POM in developing eyes. TEM showed that in developing eyes, cilia emanated from the cellular surface into the extracellular matrix, whereas cilia of newborn keratocytes appeared to be intracellular or largely invaginated in a long ciliary pocket with their axis parallel to the cell plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). Interestingly, the tip of cilia in developing cornea and POM were observed to interact with cellular protrusions of neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). Moreover, the plasma membrane of these cellular protrusions at the contact point with ciliary tips appeared to be highly electron-dense, suggesting the presence of protein components or modified lipids in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>).</p><p>In order to determine if primary cilia are involved in the development of AS we set out to ablate <italic>Ift88</italic>, a subunit of the IFT machinery required for cilia assembly and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pazour et al., 2000</xref>) in NCC.

In control mice (<italic>Wnt1-Cre;Ift88<sup>fx/+</sup>;mT/mG</italic>), virtually all the NCC of the POM appeared ciliated during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) while in <italic>Wnt1-Cre;Ift88<sup>fx/fx</sup>;mT/mG</italic> cKO mice, cilia were absent in most of the POM cells expressing Cre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We confirmed ablation of cilia in keratocyte precursors by TEM and observed the basal body apparatus to reach the apical plasma membrane in both control and cKO corneas, however, primary cilia were only observed emanating from basal bodies of control keratocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). <italic>Wnt1-Cre;Ift88<sup>fx/fx</sup></italic> mutant mice died at birth and E18.5 embryos displayed strong craniofacial defects including increased frontal width, wider frontonasal prominence and increase of the distance between the nasal pits, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Watanabe et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, we detected abnormalities in the anatomy of the eye. At E14.5, a developmental stage preceding the closure of the eyelids, the axis of the eyeballs was misaligned facing downward in cKO whereas, in control it remained perpendicular to the sagittal plane of the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, the outline of the presumptive iris appeared irregular in cKO while in the control it described a nearly perfect circle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Later in development (E18.5), the irregularities of the iris were exaggerated in cKO and the developing cornea appeared smaller than that of the control, strongly arguing toward severe defects of the AS including a reduced anterior chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, these macroscopic anatomical abnormalities suggest a morphogenetic condition of the AS in the eye of the cKO mice.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Primary cilium ablation in NCC leads to ASD phenotype.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of control and cKO eyes at E14.5 and E18.5.

The eye field of cKO embryos at E10.5 and 14.5 appeared indistinguishable from that of the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, at E15.5, we observed a significant reduction of the anterior chamber in the cKO samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). At this stage, the mutant was lacking most of the mesenchymal cells condensing at the developing iridocorneal angle between the cornea and the presumptive iris that was clearly visible in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). As a result, the iridocorneal area appeared disorganized in the mutant with a narrower angle than in the control. Between E16.5 and E18.5, the corneal stroma thickness and the corneal diameter were both significantly reduced in the cKO embryo compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). Moreover, the iridocorneal angle abnormalities found in the mutant eye persisted with the presumptive iris significantly shorter than that of the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Plastic cross sections of the cornea revealed that the density of keratocytes was significantly higher in the cKO stroma compared to control however, the total number of cells in corneal stroma remained unchanged in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The increased keratocyte density was therefore attributed to the smaller volume cornea in cKO embryos compared to control. The unchanged number of keratocytes in the stroma of both genotypes suggests that primary cilium ablation did not impair the NCC migration into the corneal stroma. Thus, the ablation of the primary cilium in the NCC leads to ASD that is not due to NCC migration defects.</p><p>Because of the differences in cornea dimensions and stroma cell density, we examined the 3D organization and the morphology of keratocytes in the mutant and control corneas. Keratocyte morphology and spatial distribution across the stroma vary in mammals, with an increased density, flattening, and extension of the keratocytes in the posterior part of the stroma in late embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Haustein, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Poole et al., 2003</xref>). To determine stromal organization, we developed a quantitative tool using live confocal imaging on mT/mG mice. Segmentation of the stromal extracellular spaces was carried out with Ilastik (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haubold et al., 2016</xref>) to then quantify the amount (%) and the average size of extracellular spaces using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In control embryos, the amount of extracellular spaces was significantly lower in the posterior than the anterior portion of the corneal stroma, defining an antero-posterior gradient of keratocyte density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This was mirrored in the stroma in control embryos with the size of the extracellular spaces in the posterior part being significantly smaller than in the anterior part, defining an antero-posterior gradient of the extracellular space size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In cKO embryos, the antero-posterior gradient of the keratocyte density was maintained as in control, while the average size of extracellular spaces was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The amount of extracellular space was significantly reduced in both the anterior and posterior parts of the cKO stroma compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>) making the keratocyte distribution in the corneal stroma of the cKO embryos denser than that of the control. Differences in the anterior-posterior extracellular space gradient and the average size of single extracellular spaces were abnormal in the cKO suggesting a defective tridimensional organization of the keratocytes in the mutant. Thus, the ablation of the primary cilium in NCC impairs the spatial organization of keratocytes in the stroma independently from cell migration.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Primary cilium ablation in NCC impairs the spatial organization and the morphology of keratocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative ex vivo confocal optical sections taken at different levels (Anterior or Posterior) of the corneal stroma of E18.5 cKO and control embryos crossed with the mT/mG reporter.

We therefore hypothesized that Hh activity could influence cell proliferation rates in the Hh-active POM subpopulation surrounding the RPE cell layer.

In addition, we also arbitrarily defined a Hh-negative area of the POM encompassed between 20 µm and 50 μm from the RPE cell layer functioning as an internal control together with the Hh-negative cornea. Proliferation rates were assessed by counting the number of cells stained with an anti-Ki67 or anti-BrdU Ab 2 hr after BrdU injection and normalized to the total number of cells in the same area stained with DAPI or to the total area, respectively.

To gain mechanistic understanding of how this process occurs we analyzed the presence of cilia and Hh components in the ciliary compartment of Hh-negative POM cells. In the presence of a Hh ligand, its receptor PTCH exits the ciliary compartment allowing SMO to concentrate in the cilium, an essential step to activate Hh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elliott and Brugmann, 2019</xref>). To determine whether POM cells were still ciliated and able to respond to a Hh signal, we stained primary cilia and SMO of wild-type sclera in whole mount preparations. Confocal optical sections of the POM between the RPE layer and the periphery of the sclera were collected as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>. At E14.5 and P0, all cells of the POM were ciliated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) and therefore we excluded the possibility that NCC of the peripheral POM lost Hh activity due to resorption of the primary cilium. At E14.5, we observed an accumulation of SMO in primary cilia on the inner cell layers of the POM surrounding the RPE (0–18 μm), consistent with the Hh activity detected in these cell layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast, we did not detect SMO in the primary cilium of cells of the peripheral POM (&gt;18 μm from the RPE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>). At P0, SMO was undetectable in primary cilia of NCC in the entire POM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>). However, when eyeballs from P0 mice were treated with a SMO agonist (SAG), SMO accumulated in cilia of POM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>).

Because <italic>FOXC1</italic> and <italic>PITX2</italic> are indispensable to specify corneal angiogenic privilege (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gage et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kidson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reis and Semina, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seo et al., 2012</xref>), we examined the neovascularization process in the cKO mutant. To visualize blood vessels, we stained whole corneas with an Ab directed to endomucin, a marker of the vascular endothelium. Abnormal spread of blood vessels was detected into the corneas of E18.5 cKO mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>) where vessels covered about 8% of the total corneal area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). To gain additional insight into the abnormal neovascularization process, we performed live imaging using confocal microscopy at the cornea periphery using enucleated eyes from E18.5 embryos with the <italic>mT/mG</italic> reporter. Due to their mesenchymal origin, blood vessels were easily detectable as red (mT) tubular networks clearly distinct from the green (mG) NCC-derived POM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). By confocal optical sectioning we identified the major arterial circle which served as a reproducible reference between the end of the sclera and the beginning of the cornea. The average area occupied by blood vessels in microscope fields selected at the corneal periphery occupied ~30% of the total area in the cKO but only ~4% in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–F</xref>). In addition, while peripheral blood vessels of the control were present only in superficial layers of the sclera-cornea interface on both sides of the major arterial circle (~20% of the thickness), those of the mutant invaded the lower layers of both, the sclera (~50% of the thickness) and the cornea (~80% of the thickness). This demonstrates that ablation of the primary cilium in the NCC leads to the loss of the angiogenic privilege in the cornea as well as vascular abnormalities in the sclera, potentially due to the lowered expression of <italic>Foxc1</italic> and <italic>Pitx2</italic>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Primary cilium ablation in NCC leads to corneal neovascularization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Foxc1</italic>, <italic>Pax6</italic> and <italic>Pitx2</italic> expression in the cornea (including the iridocorneal angle) (n = 3–6 embryos/group).

However, the pathogenesis of these conditions remains largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that conditional ablation of the primary cilium in NCC led to ASD with conditions similar to those observed in humans. We showed that primary cilia are present in virtually all neural crest-derived cells of the POM including keratocytes. However, we found that primary cilia were required for the propagation of the Hh pathway in a subpopulation of POM cells surrounding the RPE layer but not in neural crest-derived cells of the cornea where the Hh pathway is not active. We showed that the expression of genes implicated in the pathogenesis of ASD, including <italic>Foxc1</italic> and <italic>Pitx2</italic>, was strongly reduced in the cornea and iridocorneal angle tissue lacking cilia in the NCC which is consistent with AS phenotypes, including the loss of corneal angiogenic privilege. Thus, we have established an important functional connection between cilia-dependent signaling and ASD. Overall, this study demonstrated the novel and fundamental role of the primary cilium in the development of structures of the AS derived from the NCC.</p><p>Mice carrying somatic null mutations in genes encoding proteins required for cilia assembly or ciliary function display severe microphthalmia and anophthalmia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreu-Cervera et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burnett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caspary et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cela et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dyson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jacoby et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). These conditions are likely due to aberrant Hh activity in cells of the neuroepithelium of the developing optic vesicle that precedes the development of the AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakrania et al., 2010</xref>). To overcome this obstacle and test the function of the primary cilium in AS development, we ablated IFT88 in the NCC, a multipotent progenitor cell population that produces a large range of differentiation fates including a large portion of AS structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gage et al., 2005</xref>). Relevant to our study, conditional deletions of ASD causative genes such as <italic>Foxc1</italic>, <italic>Pitx2</italic> or <italic>Ext1</italic> in NCC, lead to defects of the AS including anophthalmos, abnormal corneal thickness, reduced anterior chamber, defective iridocorneal angle, and corneal neovascularization similar to abnormalities observed in ASD patients carrying dominant mutations in these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Evans and Gage, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Iwao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seo et al., 2012</xref>). While the cKO mice revealed a direct connection between the primary cilium and ASD, severe craniofacial defects caused late embryonic death and prevented us from following the postnatal development of structures such as the iris, trabecular meshwork and Schlemm’s canal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gould et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, further studies involving conditional ablation of the cilium in specific AS tissues will be required, notably using the Keratocan-rtTA mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Low expression levels of <italic>Foxc1</italic> and <italic>Pitx2</italic> in the cornea of the cKO mutant could explain some of its AS phenotypes, including abnormal corneal vascularization and thinning of the cornea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asai-Coakwell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">D'haene et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Evans and Gage, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gage et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kidson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kume et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reis and Semina, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seo et al., 2012</xref>). Mice carrying only one copy of <italic>Foxc1</italic> (<italic>NC-Foxc1<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) in the NCC do not lose cornea angiogenic privilege meaning their cornea remains avascular. Whereas loss of both <italic>Foxc1</italic> copies in the NCC leads to severe neovascularization of the whole cornea suggesting a strong relationship between the maintenance of the corneal angiogenic privilege and the expression level of <italic>Foxc1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seo et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with this possibility, we observed a partial vascularization in the cornea of the cKO mouse. The expression level of <italic>Foxc1</italic> and <italic>Pitx2</italic> also differentially regulates corneal thickness. While the corneal thickness increases in <italic>NC-Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and <italic>Pitx2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, it remains unaltered in <italic>NC-Foxc1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and decreases in <italic>Pitx2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asai-Coakwell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gage et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seo et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the reduction of <italic>Pitx2</italic> expression could be one of the concomitant causes leading to thinning of the cornea observed in the cKO embryos. In summary, the partial corneal vascularization and decreased stroma thickness observed in the cKO embryos are consistent with a decreased expression of <italic>Foxc1</italic> and <italic>Pitx2</italic> in the cornea.</p><p>The abnormal corneal neovascularization observed in the cKO could also derive from a reduction or absence of Hh activity in the POM. In a zebrafish model, the loss of Hh signaling induces excess sprouting of blood vessels in the dorsal eye and impairs growth of blood vessels in the ventral eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Weiss et al., 2017</xref>), observations which are consistent with the aberrant expansion of blood vessel domains deep into the sclera of cKO embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). A thorough analysis of the choroid in NCC conditional mutants with reduced Hh activity obtained independently from the ablation of the primary cilium could elucidate a specific role of the Hh pathway in development and patterning of the choroid.</p><p>Decreased expression of <italic>Foxc1</italic> and <italic>Pitx2</italic> in tissues of the AS in the cKO mouse suggests a possible direct or indirect mechanism of gene expression regulation of these transcription factors by cilia-dependent signaling. A recent study showed that mutations in the <italic>FOXC1</italic> gene in humans cause, in addition to ASD, systemic conditions similar to those found in ciliopathic patients including polydactyly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lehmann et al., 2019</xref>). This study also showed that lowering the level of <italic>Foxc1</italic> expression in epithelial cells induced a reduction of cilia length and interfered with cilia localization of Hh components, most notably GLI2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lehmann et al., 2019</xref>). FOXC1 also appeared to directly interact with GLI2 and promoted the expression of Ihh target genes, including <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Ptch1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yoshida et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these data suggest a strong relation between primary cilia, <italic>Foxc1</italic> expression and Hh activation, explaining why similar ocular and systemic phenotypes are observed in ASD and ciliopathic patients.</p><p>The process of corneal innervation occurs in parallel with the establishment of the corneal angiogenic privilege. The majority of corneal nerves derive from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal ganglion of NCC origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lwigale, 2001</xref>). The cKO mouse displays a defective corneal innervation consisting of abnormalities in the nerve projections similar to those described in <italic>Semaphorin three</italic> deficient mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McKenna et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Taniguchi et al., 1997</xref>). <italic>Semaphorin three</italic> regulates the navigation process of the nerves by guiding the direction of axon growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Taniguchi et al., 1997</xref>). In our ciliary model, the decreased number of nerve bundles at E13.5 and the less centripetal migration of the corneal nerves at E18.5 suggest that the navigation process of trigeminal nerves in the cornea is affected. Consistent with these exciting possibilities, ciliogenic proteins including KIF3A, IFT88, and ARL13B, are required for the directional migration of GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baudoin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Higginbotham et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, assembly of the primary cilium on trigeminal nerves could be critical in reestablishing corneal innervation following corneal transplant or during recovery from corneal trauma.</p><p>The Hh signal transduction pathway is intimately linked to the primary cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bangs and Anderson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>), and its activation level is critical to ensure normal eye development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burnett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chiang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gordon et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we showed that during early stages of AS development, virtually all POM cells are actively responding to Hh signaling. However, as the AS development progresses only a subpopulation of NCC of the POM surrounding the RPE cell layer and in the iridocorneal angle, maintains Hh responsiveness by actively expressing <italic>Gli1</italic> and localizing SMO to the primary cilium compartment. Moreover, the NCC derived components of the cornea, which includes keratocyte precursors and corneal endothelium, were not found to be Hh responsive at any developmental stage. It was therefore imperative to determine how differential distribution of Hh responsiveness was achieved in cells of similar embryonic origin. We found that cells of the POM maintained the ability to respond to Hh stimulation at several levels: all cells of the POM and the corneal stroma were found ciliated throughout development and after birth. In addition, in vitro SAG treatment of ocular tissues indicated that all POM cells maintained the ability to respond to Hh stimuli by promoting SMO localization to their primary cilium. We identified CD31 positive cells of the POM as the main source of Ihh, suggesting that endothelial cells of the choroid vasculature could be the principal source of Ihh in the eye. Consistent with this possibility, a previous study showed that <italic>Ihh</italic> expression in the POM colocalizes with collagen IV, a marker for the vasculature, next to the RPE layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dakubo et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the secretion of Ihh by the choroid vessels is likely to regulate the propagation of the Hh responsiveness in the periocular space and the cornea.</p><p>Our data suggest that one of the main functions of Hh activity in the POM during late gestation is to promote cell division in the subpopulation of NCC surrounding the RPE layer. Surprisingly, although the size of the cornea in the cKO mouse was considerably reduced, the number of keratocyte precursors within the corneal stroma was similar to that of control corneas. Thus, the reduction of cell proliferation in this subpopulation of POM cells did not account for the number of cells that populate the cornea. However, we identified a group of mesenchymal cells at the iridocorneal angle in control mice that were absent or reduced in number in the cKO mutant. These cells could be precursors of drainage structures of the AS, such as the trabecular meshwork and/or the iris stroma. Comparative studies involving differential single cell analysis of the POM cells from the AS of the cKO and control mice will therefore be crucial to identify this distinct cell population at the iridocorneal angle.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that primary cilia are indispensable for normal development of NCC-derived structures in the ocular AS. When the primary cilium is ablated in NCC, an ASD phenotype is induced including small and thinner cornea, abnormal iridocorneal angle, disorganized corneal stroma and neovascularization. In addition, primary cilium ablation in NCC reduces the cell proliferation in a subpopulation of POM cells surrounding the RPE which are normally responsive to Ihh, the main Hh ligand expressed by endothelial cells of the choroid. Moreover, primary cilium ablation in NCC decreases the expression of transcription factors associated with ASD in patients. These findings suggest that the primary cilium might contribute to the pathology of ASD, and associated complications like glaucoma.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

Half head or enucleated eyes from the embryos were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and embedded in paraffin for histological analysis. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was performed following standard procedures. Corneal stromal thickness was determined in the center of the cornea on HE sections from three mice per age.</p><p>Endomucin and TUJ1 staining were performed on fixed whole corneas as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McKenna and Lwigale, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McKenna et al., 2014</xref>). For immunofluorescence (IF) and X-gal staining on sections, half head and enucleated eyes from embryos were embedded and frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA). For detection of the β-galactosidase activity by X-Gal staining, sections were fixed 10 min with 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> in PBS at room temperature, and then incubated overnight in a solution containing 1 mg/mL Xgal, 5 mM K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN), 5 mM K<sub>4</sub>Fe(CN), 0.01% deoxycholate, 0.02% NP40 and 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> in PBS at 4°C. Sections were imaged with a Zeiss AxioImager.Z2M microscope equipped with a Zeiss Axiocam 503 color camera. For immunofluorescent staining, sections were fixed 10 min with 4% PFA at room temperature. After blocking with 2% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), 0.1% Triton in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, primary cilia were stained using a rabbit anti-Arl13b Ab (17711–1-AP, Proteintech Group, Rosemont, IL), pSmad2/3<sup>+</sup> cells were stained using a goat anti-pSmad2/3 Ab (sc11769, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX) and proliferative cells were stained using a rabbit anti-Ki67 Ab (ab15580, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom).

After 10 min of postfixation with 4% PFA and wash with PBS, sections were incubated in 2 N HCl for 25 min at 37°C and subsequentially processed for immunofluorescence using a rat anti-BrdU Ab (ab6325, Abcam) as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>SAG stimulation</title><p>Enucleated eyes from P0 mice were cut in half on the sagittal axis and the lens and the retina were removed. Eyeball pieces were incubated for 5 hr in keratinocyte-SFM with or without 100 nM SMO agonist (SAG, MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA) at 37°C in 5% CO2. Tissues were fixed 12 min with 4% PFA in PBS, incubated 12 min with 5% Triton in PBS and then primary cilia and SMO were stained using a mouse anti-acetylated tubulin Ab (6-11B-1, Sigma-Aldrich) and a rabbit anti-SMO Ab (1:100, ABS1001 MilliporeSigma), respectively. Whole-mount eyeball tissues were imaged using a Zeiss LSM800 confocal. Cilia and SMO staining were also performed on ocular tissues from E14.5 embryos, without prior incubation with or without SAG.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Ex vivo imaging</title><p>Confocal imaging was performed on whole eyes from E18.5 <italic>Wnt1-Cre;Ift88<sup>fl/fl</sup>;R26<sup>mT/mG</sup></italic> and <italic>Wnt1-Cre;Ift88<sup>fl/+</sup>;R26<sup>mT/mG</sup></italic> embryos as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grisanti et al., 2016</xref>). Live GFP and tdTomato fluorescences were recorded by a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope, using a 40X water immersion objective lens and used to scan a 0.05 mm<sup>2</sup> field of view to study the keratocyte organization and 0.005 mm<sup>2</sup> field of view to quantify the cytoplasmic processes. For the keratocyte organization, serial optical sections were acquired in 0.45 μm steps, through the entire cornea, from the corneal epithelium to the lens epithelium (49–89 μm per z-stack). For the quantification of cytoplasmic processes, serial optical sections were acquired in 0.2 μm steps, from the last epithelial cell layer before the corneal stroma to the first layer of keratocytes (~5 μm per z-stack).</p><p>Quantification of the protrusions in Wnt1-Cre-positive keratocytes was done by counting cytoplasmic processes at the interface between corneal epithelium and stroma. From the acquired z-stacks, images from the first one where green fluorescent cytoplasmic processes are visible to the last one before keratinocyte cell bodies are imaged were selected and a maximum intensity projection was done with Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). For each mouse, cytoplasmic processes were manually counted in four distinct areas in the center of the cornea and expressed as number of cytoplasmic processes per 100 μm<sup>2</sup>. Keratocyte organization in the stroma was assessed by quantifying the amount and the average size of extracellular spaces in the first 1/10 of the z-stack just under the corneal epithelium, corresponding to the anterior part of the stroma, and the last 1/10 of the z-stack above the corneal endothelium, corresponding to the posterior part of the stroma (2.25–4.5 μm thickness/stack). After segmentation of the stacks with Ilastik (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haubold et al., 2016</xref>), the amount and average size of extracellular spaces were quantified using Fiji (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The amount of extracellular spaces was defined as the sum of the areas of each extracellular space (shown in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) detected in a single confocal optical section and normalized to the total area of the section (5–12 optical sections were analyzed per embryo for each selected stack). The amount of extracellular spaces was expressed as % of the total area of the section. The average size of extracellular spaces was quantified from the same optical sections and expressed in µm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>For visualization of the blood vessels at the corneal periphery, the microscope field was centered on the major arterial circle which was considered as the border between the cornea and the sclera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Serial optical sections were acquired from the epithelium to the presumptive iris (49 to 109 μm per z-stack). After maximum intensity projections, the corneal area covered by blood vessels and the percentage of corneal and scleral thicknesses with blood vessels were quantified with Fiji.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Intravital imaging</title><p>Intravital imaging of cilia in the mouse cornea was performed with an Olympus FV1200MPE microscope, equipped with a Chameleon Vision II Ti:Sapphire laser. Mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine (15 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL, respectively in PBS). A custom made stage was used to immobilize the mouse head and expose the eye globe. Mice were then placed under the microscope onto a heating pad and kept anesthetized with a continuous delivery of isoflurane through a nose cone (1% in air). A laser beam tuned at 930 nm was focused through a 25X water immersion objective lens (XLPlan N, N.A.1.05; Olympus USA) and used to scan a 0.5 mm<sup>2</sup> field of view. Serial optical sections were acquired in 2–3 μm steps, starting from the surface of the eye and capturing the entire thickness of the cornea (epithelium ~40 μm, stroma ~80 μm).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cell sorting</title><p><italic>Unstained cells</italic>.

mediated by cilia present on neural crest cells is essential for cell proliferation and for development of the anterior segment of the eye. The revisions made by the authors to the recent set of editorial suggestions are now taken into account.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Primary cilia deficiency in neural crest cells causes Anterior Segment Dysgenesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joseph Gleeson as the Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Joon Kim (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a comprehensive data set exploring the role of cilia and Hedghog (Hh) signalling in the development of the anterior segment of the eye. In this study, Portal et al. provided evidence that primary cilia of neural crest cells are required for the development of the anterior segment of the eye. Using a conditional knockout mouse model, the authors ablated neural crest primary cilia and showed that loss of cilia causes a phenotype similar to that of Anterior Segment Dysgenesis (ASD) in humans. The article focuses on neural crest cells which are ciliated and allow the normal development of the anterior segment of the eye. The authors found that choroidal endothelial cells in the sclera express Indian hedgehog, and the ablation of neural crest primary cilia reduces hedgehog signaling in periocular mesenchyme. This study is novel and adeptly dissects the link between primary cilia and the anterior segment development. The paper is a good example of the value of specific murine models to ask fundamental questions regarding development that other methods are unable to answer at the moment. Defects in this pathway lead to a number of phenotypes including changes in the cornea. The authors show that Ihh is the specific signalling pathway used by periocular mesenchyme cells and that the transcriptions factor Foxc1 and Pitx2 are target genes that are required for normal AS development. The work is well presented with a rich data set and good supplementary data to support findings. This is a significant advance in the field: it provides an explanation for the frequent incidence of ASD in more severe ciliopathies such as Meckel-Gruber syndrome, and offers insights into the pathogenesis of non-syndromic ASD. Reviewers appreciated the challenging nature and high quality of data from intravital microscopy of cilia in corneal stroma and the elegant use of mouse reporter lines. Wnt1-Cre is a very well-established Cre-driver line for neural crest linage tracing, and is the appropriate choice for this study. The three reviewers were mostly positive, but offered some suggestions to increase the impact of the work. But because the reviewers were so positive on the overall study, eLife has included these into the Minor Revisions for your consideration. <italic>eLife</italic> does not consider these to be essential for acceptance of the manuscript for publication, but suggests that you consider to either address these points experimentally or in the text as research questions for the future.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In Figure 5A, there is a dramatic increase in Ki67 staining intensities in the retina of cKO.

We have realized that for the art work in Figure 5 the intensities of the projections of confocal optical sections were not normalized. In the revised version of Figure 5 we have included in the panels of the enlargements a portion of the retina, the retinal Ganglion Cell Layer (GCL), that does not present Ki67 staining in both control and cKO eyes. Thus, we have utilized the GCL to normalized the intensity of Ki67 positive cells in the rest of the eye tissue. We have corrected this discrepancy and now the intensity of the Ki67 staining in the retina and the periocular mesenchyme is similar in both, control and cKO maximum intensity projections. The quantification didn’t change, since Ki67 positive cells were all counted. In addition, we performed a similar experiment using BrdU pulse labeling (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Unfortunately, the BrdU staining requires an acidic treatment that was not compatible with DAPI staining of the nuclei. Thus, BrdU positive cells number was normalized to the selected area of the periocular mesenchyme. The results obtained with the BrdU pulse labeling are consistent with those obtained with Ki67 staining and were added as a supplement to Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) The authors showed that the ablation of primary cilia caused a significant reduction of the expression of Foxc1 and Pitx2 in the cornea (Figure 7A), suggesting the relevance of this study to human ASD.

One possibility is that Gli transcription factors directly interact with regulatory elements of <italic>Foxc1</italic> and/or <italic>Pitx2</italic> promoting their expression, as suggested by the reviewer. My laboratory is committed to investigate this possibility and further elucidate the relationship between ciliary elements, including components of the HH signaling, and the <italic>Foxc1</italic> or <italic>Pitx2</italic> genes.

Development, 146(10)). Rather, the differences between paralogs appear to be in the timing and location of expression (Ingham et al., 2011, Nat Rev Genet, 12(6):393-406; Jeong and McMahon, 2002, J ClinInvest, 110(5):591-596; Varjosalo and Taipale, 2008, Genes Dev, 22(18):2454-2472). Therefore, we expect that each HH ligand would bind to PATCH receptors of the periocular mesenchyme and activate the HH pathway.</p><p>To determine the localization of Ihh in the periocular mesenchyme, we have attempted immunohistochemistry experiments using two different commercial antibodies directed to Ihh: ab52919 (Abcam) and ab39634 (Abcam). Unfortunately, the results were not conclusive. We detected abundant non-specific fluorescent signal in the retina with the antibody ab52919 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and the antibody ab39634 gave high background also in the retina (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Because Ihh is not expressed in the retina (Figure 6A), these staining patterns argued against the specificity of these antibodies in eye tissue. Thus, we do not feel confident to investigate tissue localization of Ihh.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52423-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) An OMIM ref is given for Biedmond syn type 2 but not for other syndromes mentioned.

Moreover, the corneal endothelial cilium projects into the lumen of the anterior chamber whereas the cilium of keratocytes interacts with collagen fibers of the extracellular matrix. Thus, the cilia in the two cell types may carry out distinct functions. Because at this point we don’t have data supporting this possibility, we prefer not to speculate in this regard.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 1—figure supplement 1 title Ift88 – italics?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this inaccuracy. <italic>Ift88</italic> has been italicized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 6A please give p values for corneal Dhh Ihh and Shh.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the <italic>P</italic> values for corneal Dhh, Ihh, and Shh.

To compare our two variables, the genotype (CTRL / cKO) and the position within the corneal stroma (anterior side / posterior side), we would need a two-way ANOVA. The two-way ANOVA requires having independence of the observations, which means that there is no relationship between the observations in each group or between the groups themselves. In our case, the amount of extracellular spaces in the anterior part and the amount of extracellular spaces in the posterior part are measured on the same corneas (this is also true for the average size of extracellular space). Thus, our observations are not independent, so we cannot use a two-way ANOVA.</p><p>In this instance a <italic>t</italic>-tests appears appropriate to analyze our data-set, as stated in the legend of Figure 3. Paired two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to compare the anterior and posterior parts of the stroma in one given genotype (dependent individuals).

However, the complexity of the pictures did not allow us to easily segment them. To avoid adding excessive pretreatments of the pictures which could skew the analysis, we opted to adopt “Ilastik”. Differently from Fiji, Ilastik takes into consideration the value of a pixel and the values of its surrounding pixels and it is based on machine learning technology. The legend of Figure 3—figure supplement 1 has been reformulated for more clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) In Figure 5B, the panel shows proliferation data measured by Ki67+ cells, whereas the legend states that BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells were also counted.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this substitution in the legend. “The number of Ki67<sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells…” has been replaced by “The number of Ki67<sup>+</sup>/DAPI<sup>+</sup> cells…” as displayed in Figure 5B.</p></body></sub-article></article>
