Yet, their role in organizing neuronal ensemble activity remains incompletely understood. Here, in a functionally well-characterized system – neuroendocrine tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA) neurons - we demonstrate a striking species difference in network behavior: rat TIDA cells discharge in highly stereotyped, robust, synchronized slow oscillations, whereas mouse oscillations are faster, flexible and show substantial cell-to-cell variability. We show that these distinct operational modes are explained by the presence of strong TIDA-TIDA gap junction coupling in the rat, and its complete absence in the mouse. Both species, however, encompass a similar heterogeneous range of intrinsic resonance frequencies, suggesting similar network building blocks. We demonstrate that gap junctions select and impose the slow network rhythm. These data identify a role for electrical junctions in determining oscillation frequency and show how related species can rely on distinct network strategies to accomplish adaptive control of hormone release.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gap junctions</kwd><kwd>oscillation</kwd><kwd>neural network</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>neuroendocrine</kwd><kwd>species difference</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>261286</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Broberger</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014-3906</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Broberger</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004047</institution-id><institution>Karolinska Institutet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SRP Diabetes, Rolf Luft Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Broberger</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004191</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Broberger</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003792</institution-id><institution>Hjärnfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pérez</surname><given-names>Carolina Thörn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An unexpected species difference in electrical coupling of analogous neuroendocrine dopamine neurons in rats and mice reveals a role for gap junction connectivity as a band-pass filter for oscillation frequency in neural networks.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The default activity pattern of a neuronal network emerges from the combination of the intrinsic electrical characteristics of the constituent neurons and the wiring and properties of cell-to-cell connections within the circuit. In order to understand the operations of the brain, it is therefore necessary to elucidate the precise contribution of membrane electrophysiology, as well as different modes of communication, to ensemble activity. Neuronal gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furshpan and Potter, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watanabe, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 1963</xref>) impact on both these features. While once surmised to be exclusive to invertebrate species and/or early development, steadily accumulating evidence has established that electrical junctions formed by gap junctions are both common and consequential within many populations in the adult, mammalian CNS (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Connors and Long, 2004</xref>). By mediating ultra-fast, subthreshold, bidirectional (albeit not always symmetrical) cell-cell communication, gap junctions have been implicated most obviously in the synchronization (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christie et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beierlein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dugué et al., 2009</xref>) of neuronal activity. The particular kinetics of electrical junctions further allow them to for example interact with the parallel chemical synaptic transmission between neurons (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Llinas et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mathy et al., 2014</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pereda, 2014</xref>) and spread intracellular messengers between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsien and Weingart, 1974</xref>). The presence of gap junctions changes the computational rules within circuits.</p><p>Gap junctions are of particular interest in the context of neuronal oscillations, a collective behavior that involves the coordination, and often harmonization, of neuronal discharge (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Manor et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Draguhn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hormuzdi et al., 2001</xref>). Oscillations are intrinsic to brain networks throughout the neuraxis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzsáki and Watson, 2012</xref>), appearing in wide, but stereotyped, frequency spectra. Shifts in network frequency have been proposed to correspond to changes in the information carried across neuronal transmission (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Singer and Gray, 1995</xref>), and a switch in period can denote the conversion of a physiological oscillation into a pathological rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kostopoulos et al., 1981</xref>). While the issue of whether (and if so, how) gap junctions influence, or even set, the specific frequency of a network oscillation has been the subject of a limited number of elegant modeling and theoretical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kepler et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meunier, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pedersen et al., 2005</xref>), there is little experimental data addressing this important issue. This dearth of information can in no small measure be ascribed to limitations in the available methodological repertoire: pharmacological tools are compromised by poor specificity (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beaumont and Maccaferri, 2011</xref>), whereas genetically manipulated animals, although informative in several aspects, often exhibit incomplete loss-of-function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Zeeuw et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Additional models could thus be of substantial value to forward our understanding. Here, studying the neuroendocrine tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA) neurons, which oscillate between depolarized UP and hyperpolarized DOWN states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lyons et al., 2010</xref>), we uncover an unexpected rat-mouse species difference in electrical coupling that we exploit to reveal principles of how gap junctions can constrain and dictate ensemble network behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Tuberoinfundibular dopamine neurons in the hypothalamic dorsomedial arcuate nucleus (dmArc) of rats exhibit a slow, robust, highly rhythmic, synchronized network oscillation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lyons et al., 2010</xref>). Reports on mouse TIDA neurons, however, describe notably irregular fast phasic firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Romanò et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang and van den Pol, 2015</xref>). Such dichotomy across analogous rodent circuits are rare in the literature. This intriguing observation prompted us to systematically compare rat and mouse TIDA neurons under identical recording conditions to first determine if these discordant accounts reflect a species difference proper or discrepancies in methodology.</p><p>Male rat TIDA cells identified by their location in the dmArc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>) and characteristic electrical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lyons et al., 2010</xref>), exhibited a stereotyped slow (0.15 ± 0.01 Hz; n = 29, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,G</xref>) and highly regular (coefficient of variation (CV) for frequency = 1.99 ± 0.69%; n = 8 slices; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) oscillation with similar membrane voltage across neurons within slices and between animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lyons et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B,D</xref>).

An oscillatory current was seen in voltage clamp mode only in rat TIDA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F</xref>). Furthermore, rat TIDA oscillation frequency was insensitive to hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–K</xref>), whereas mouse TIDA cells progressively decreased their frequency in response to negative current until it collapsed to a stable membrane potential below <italic>ca</italic>. −80 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L–N</xref>). To evaluate entrainability, we used the sinusoidal (‘ZAP’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hutcheon and Yarom, 2000b</xref>) current command of increasing frequency. Rat TIDA oscillations maintained their frequency when challenged with ZAP <italic>I</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O,P</xref>). In contrast, application of the same protocol to mouse TIDA neurons resulted in a full entrainment of the cells’ rhythm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q,R</xref>). The cross-correlation coefficient of the frequency of the recorded cell and the current command was thus significantly lower in rat (0.61 ± 0.03; n = 10) compared to mouse (0.87 ± 0.01; n = 10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1S,T</xref>), demonstrating the rat TIDA oscillation is robust against perturbation, in contrast to the mouse.</p><p>We next addressed if the rat-mouse differences in single-cell features are reflected at the network level. Paired recordings from rat TIDA neurons revealed pronounced phase-locked synchronicity between cells (n = 63 pairs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lyons et al., 2010</xref>) in contrast to mouse TIDA cells, which were asynchronous (n = 40 pairs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). To record TIDA activity at the population level we performed two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. Using Oregon green-BAPTA in rat slices, a cluster of cells in the dmArc exhibited spontaneous, slow synchronized Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (0.15 ± 0.01 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F,I</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes were visualized in murine TIDA cells using DAT-GCaMP3 mice. Simultaneous whole-cell and Ca<sup>2+</sup> recordings in mouse TIDA neurons revealed strongly correlated fluctuations in membrane potential and Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity, indicating that they reflect the same underlying cellular phenomena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In agreement with electrophysiology, cells exhibited asynchronous, fast (0.40 ± 0.05 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–I</xref>) oscillation frequencies, with large variability.

First, we show that rat (electrically coupled) and mouse (electrically uncoupled) TIDA neurons exhibit fundamentally different oscillatory activity: while electrically coupled TIDA cells discharge in a stereotyped, highly regular, synchronized slow rhythm, the same neurons in the absence of electrical coupling, display a range of faster, asynchronous, and less regular frequencies. We exploit these differences to show that, while both species harbor a similar range of cellular heterogeneity within the TIDA population (assessed as preferred frequency and membrane properties), the presence of gap junctions imposes a slow, harmonized, narrow frequency band across the ensemble.

Our experimental data show that in a gap junction-linked hypothalamic dopamine circuit, the network assumes a harmonized slow rhythm emerging from the preferred resonance frequency imposed by the electrical coupling. Early studies of neuronal gap junctions suggested that they operate as low-pass current filters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furshpan and Potter, 1957</xref>). As oscillatory current passes between cells through gap junctions – and filtered via the active and passive properties of membranes on either side of the junction – the variable frequencies generated by individual TIDA neurons are restricted and streamlined toward a slow network frequency. The mechanistic demonstration of the role of gap junctions in current transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) argues against the interpretation that the low frequency of the rhythm in this system is the result of ‘network load’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hooper and Marder, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meunier, 1992</xref>), the drag imposed upon a connected neural ensemble by its slowest members, whose biophysical constraints may act as a brake on the entire network. The specific frequency emerging out of the electrically coupled network is likely not to be an exclusive product of the biophysical properties of the proteins (in this case Cx36) that form the conducting connexons; there have been several Cx36-linked rhythmically active populations described in the CNS, which oscillate in a wide range of frequencies. Other factors specific to the coupled population, for example the subcellular distribution of gap junctions, cellular geometry and associated proteins, may be hypothesized to contribute.</p><p>These findings also allow for some observations on biological diversity, by revealing how two related species have adopted different cellular solutions to a common biological problem – the adaptive control of pituitary prolactin secretion. While the two rodent TIDA populations responsible for this control accommodate a similar range of cellular heterogeneity among their intrinsic oscillators, the connectivity that imposes network rules thus differs critically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In the rat TIDA network, cellular diversity is shown to be accommodated through a powerful gap junction connectivity. Cellular diversity also within seemingly homogeneous neuronal populations has been demonstrated to be not only a core characteristic of how nervous systems are organized, but a feature that contributes critically to the flexibility and adaptability necessary for survival under variable environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Manor et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Golowasch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manor et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prinz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grashow et al., 2010</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marder et al., 2015</xref>). How the different configurations (electrically connected vs. not connected) impact on the physiology of the two species remains to be determined, but it may be speculated that these features are of particular potential benefit in a system tasked with adjusting the animal for recurrent reproductive stages, including pregnancy, and is subject to circadian modulation, as is the case for the TIDA-prolactin axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grattan et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Diversity within neuronal networks, as described here in the TIDA system, presents a trade-off: while it increases flexibility, it also risks compromising reliable circuit performance. One means of ensuring robustness is thus by adding constraining properties in the mode(s) whereby the cells are connected. We here provide evidence that connecting intrinsically oscillating neurons together via strong electrical coupling can impose a slow network rhythm that overrides the individual frequencies of cells within the population. This work suggests a principle whose applicability to other systems can now be addressed.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source of reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Mouse strain, strain background</td><td valign="top">DAT-Cre mouse (C57Bl/6J)</td><td valign="top">Reference: PMID 17227870.</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Gift from Dr. N-G Larsson, Karolinska Institutet.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Mouse strain, strain background</td><td valign="top">tdTomato floxed mouse (C57Bl/6J)</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jax.org/strain/007905">www.jax.org/strain/007905</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Mouse strain, strain background</td><td valign="top">GCaMP3 floxed mouse (C57Bl/6J)</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jax.org/strain/014538">www.jax.org/strain/014538</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-tyrosine hydroxylase</td><td valign="top">Source: Millipore.

The intracellular recording solution used in experiments contained (in mM) 140 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, and 2 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, pH 7.3 (with KOH). All pharmacological compounds were bath applied. Blockade of ionotropic glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission was achieved by adding 10 μM of the AMPA/kainic acid antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), 25 μM of the NMDA antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5) and 10 μM of gabazine (all from Abcam) to the extracellular recording solution. The concentration used for TTX (Alomone Labs) was 0.5 μM. (-)-quinpirole hydrochloride, 5-HT, prolactin and TRH were obtained from Sigma.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Paired recordings and electrical coupling</title><p>The strength of coupling between neurons was quantified by the coupling coefficient (CC), which was typically measured by injecting a 0.5 s current step to one neuron and measuring the resulting voltage deflections in both neurons. To minimize distortion of CC by voltage-activated conductances, the current step amplitude was set sufficiently large to produce a steady voltage response in the coupled neuron. For TIDA neurons with input resistance (<italic>R<sub>input</sub></italic>) of 500–700 MΩ and a minimum CC of 0.05, we used 20–40 pA current injections while both cells were entering the DOWN state (phase1) resulting in 20–40 mV presynaptic deflections (ΔV) in the injected cell, resulting in stable deflections (ΔV) equal to or larger than 1 mV in the postjunctional cell. 50-sweep negative pulse protocols were routinely used allowing quantification of CC at different voltages via sweep averages. CC was calculated at different voltages, as conductances can amplify/dampen both prejunctional and postjunctional measurements and coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Curti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haas and Landisman, 2011</xref>). For current injection <italic>I<sub>1</sub></italic> into cell 1, the coupling measured in cell 2 is CC<sub>12</sub>=ΔV<sub>2</sub>/ΔV<sub>1</sub> and vice versa for CC<sub>21</sub>. The quantity CC<sub>12</sub> measures coupling in the direction of cell 2. Postjunctional resistance between pairs was 80 ± 10 MΩ (n = 10).</p><p><italic>Recordings</italic> were performed using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier, a DigiData 1440 and pClamp10.2 software (Molecular Devices). Slow and fast capacitative components were automatically compensated for. Access resistance was monitored throughout the experiments, and neurons in which the series resistance was more than 25 MΩ or changed 15% were excluded from the statistics. Liquid junction potential was 16.4 mV and not compensated. Sampling frequency in all electrophysiology data was 10 kHz. Raw data in figures were filtered at 1 kHz or 2 kHz for illustrative purposes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Logarithmic ZAP function</title><p>To investigate the possibility of resonance/preferred frequency of TIDA neurons, we performed sinusoidal current injections of fixed amplitude but sweeping frequencies in a given range. The impedance (Z) Amplitude Profile (ZAP) was thus generated for TIDA neurons to determine neurons’ preferred frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tseng and Nadim, 2010</xref>) generated by a combination of passive and active properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Puil et al., 1986</xref>).

The amplitude of the ZAP current was selected as the minimum amplitude that produced a voltage response within the physiological range of the TIDA neuron subthreshold oscillation (−80 mV to −40 mV). This amplitude was typically set to 15–20 pA. Extra caution was placed at targeting resonance within close limits of the membrane voltage, since resonance is described to be voltage dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Puil et al., 1987</xref>). This protocol was performed in the presence of TTX, resulting in a resting membrane potential and eliminating AP interference with likely resonance mechanisms. A bias direct current (DC) of ∼−20 pA was added to compensate for the depolarizing action of TTX. Furthermore, to avoid transients at the beginning of the oscillations, the ZAP waveform was preceded with three cycles of a sinusoidal waveform of the <italic>f<sub>min</sub></italic> before transition into the ZAP function.</p><p>The impedance of neurons was calculated as a function of the frequency of the injected ZAP current.

For simplicity here we ignore phase, and in our results, we refer to the impedance power as impedance. Lastly, as negative control for the resonance experiments we analyzed the impedance of a passive neuron showing, as expected, no peak. Additionally, as previous studies suggest (Puil et al., 1994), we tested and concluded that direction (slow-to-fast vs fast-to-slow frequencies) and frequency spectrum (0.05 - 3 Hz <italic>vs</italic> 0.05 – 10 Hz) of the ZAP current do not alter the TIDA neuron resonance frequency.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Entrainment of TIDA neurons</title><p>To test entrainability of TIDA neurons, the ZAP function was applied in the 0.05–3 Hz frequency spectrum.

Slices were incubated for 40 min in oxygenated aCSF containing the cell-permeable OGB-1 AM dye solution. The activity of oscillating neurons of rats (AM dye) and mice (DAT-GCaMP3) was monitored by imaging fluorescence changes under visual control by two-photon imaging and CCD camera (water immersion objective, Zeiss) at ~900 nm. Scanning and image acquisition were controlled by custom software (LSM) during periods of 120 s at intervals of 300 ms. Imaging frames were acquired at 3 Hz. Image sequences were analyzed with custom programs written in ImageJ (NIH) and MATLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smedler et al., 2014</xref>). The recorded intensity signals are presented as relative changes of fluorescence in each of the selected ROIs and expressed as (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>), where F<sub>0</sub> is the baseline fluorescence measured over a period of low activity of each cell. Simultaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup>imaging and whole-cell recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) were performed on a Zeiss microscope system (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Fluorescence images were captured with a CCD camera (Evolve, Photometrics) during periods of 120 s at intervals of 300 ms. A 64x water-dipping objective was used when a neuron was being simultaneously patched. In these cases, no EGTA was used in the intracellular solution. Whole-cell recordings were performed through visualizing positive cells and then adjusting to DIC images. For temporal synchronization of acquired images and recorded membrane potential oscillations, marker pulses indicating the occurrence of each frame were obtained from the imaging system and recorded together with the intracellular signal using pClamp10.2 software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Rats and mice were perfused first with pre-fixative (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 0.1% sodium nitrite, 0.9% NaCl and 1 unit/mL of heparin, pH 7.4) and next with cold fixative (0.16 m sodium phosphate buffer, 0.2% picric acid, 1–2% formaldehyde prepared from freshly depolymerized paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4), and finally with 10% sucrose/25 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), to wash out excess fixative.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom Ronald Calabrese is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Farzan Nadim (Reviewer #2); Yosef Yarom (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This very interesting paper reports on a species difference in electrical coupling between neuroendocrine tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA) neurons in rats vs. mice. It leverages this rather simple observation into a done-by-nature experiment to show how electrical coupling can set network period in a network that shows rhythmic activity. The authors make the conclusion that the coupling in the rat system not only harmonizes network period but also acts as a filter to set a network period that is below the average period of the resonance frequency in the individual neurons. The authors use sophisticated electrophysiological methods to approach these questions and provide strong quantitative data.</p><p>The general appeal of this work derives from the important species difference uncovered, albeit the functional implications for the TIDA network are unexplored, and the very nice exploration of how network period is set in the rat TIDA network.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are concerns that although the observations are sound that they are in some cases over interpreted.</p><p>1) Whereas the presence and absence of gap junctions is rather convincing, the conclusion that it is the sole difference between the species is not fully supported. Figure 4 is supposed to show similar membrane properties, but other than the input resistance there is no quantitative comparison and some seeming inconsistencies. For example, the current clamp records show there is little effect IA like current in mouse neurons (Figure 4E) and the voltage clamp records do not show any AHP current in mouse neurons (Figure 4F). Finally, one would like to know, if there is a difference in size of neurons between species that could account for the different in input resistance. The cells presented in Figure 5 (M and N) seems to support such a possibility. The authors should quantify as much as possible and should temper their claims about equivalence of membrane properties.</p><p>2) The use of ZAP current injection to measure the resonance properties of the neurons, demonstrating that although both types of neurons display similar resonance, the frequency of oscillation in the coupled network is lower than the resonance frequency is convincing. This was followed by an elegant experiment where cross gap-junction resonance was measured. However, the conclusion derived from this experiment is not fully justified. We do not agree that the data: &quot;challenge the idea of electrical synapses operating merely as low pass current filters&quot; Nor do we agree that the junction &quot;acts as a band-pass filter for selecting and setting the oscillation frequency&quot;. In fact, the reduction in the resonance frequency across the junction, seems to conform to the low pass filtering expected due to passive or active filtering by the pre/post-junctional neurites.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Network Oscillation Rules Imposed by Species-Specific Electrical Coupling&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

My only concern is the finding that the two types of cells differ in their IA current (by a factor of 2-3; Figure 4I). To the best of my understanding this should shift the resonance frequency of the cells to higher value and yet Figure 6 shows similar resonance. An explanation is needed here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33144.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are concerns that although the observations are sound that they are in some cases over interpreted.</p><p>1) Whereas the presence and absence of gap junctions is rather convincing, the conclusion that it is the sole difference between the species is not fully supported.

We fully agree and apologize if this was the impression given in the manuscript. In accordance with the request from the referees, we have now performed quantification of the three conductances mentioned: the A-like current, the AHP current and the I<sub>Kir</sub>. The numbers are now included in the updated version of Figure 4 (Figure 4I-K) and described in the Results section. This analysis revealed that the AHP current is not statistically different between the species, but that the A-like current is bigger and the I<sub>Kir</sub> smaller in rat TIDA neurons. While we do not think that these data alter the main conclusions of the study (as the resonance frequency of rat and mouse TIDA neurons is similar), they enrich our understanding of how the TIDA system is different (and similar) across species, and we thank the referees for this request.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, one would like to know, if there is a difference in size of neurons between species that could account for the different in input resistance. The cells presented in Figure 5 (M and N) seems to support such a possibility.

To get an estimate of how TIDA neurons compare between the species, we filled neurons during recording with neurobiotin, stained with Streptavidin and reconstructed them using Neurolucida. We measured soma surface, but also dendrite length and included Sholl analysis to get a measure of the complexity of dendritic branching; they have been included in the new Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and are described in Results section. Though these indices do not give a complete estimate of cell volume, they address several aspects of morphometry and neither of the numbers showed significant differences between the species. Thus, this is unlikely to be a major factor underlying the different input resistance numbers for the species. We agree with the referees that Figure 5M-N gave the impression (not supported by the analysis that has now been added; <italic>vide supra</italic>) that rat TIDA neurons may be larger than their mouse counterparts. For this purpose, we have replaced Figure 5M with a more representative example of Cx35/36-stained rat TIDA neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The use of ZAP current injection to measure the resonance properties of the neurons, demonstrating that although both types of neurons display similar resonance, the frequency of oscillation in the coupled network is lower than the resonance frequency is convincing.

In our previous reasoning, we focused on the fact that rat neurons all oscillate within a very narrow interval, which individual cells essentially neither exceed nor subceed (for lack of a better term). But given the data distribution, this could still reflect a low-pass filter condition, and the data do not then negate that possibility. We have rephrased in the Abstract, Results section and the Discussion section to better reflect that our data are not disharmonious with earlier gap junction literature in this regard.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The revisions have made the manuscript better and the overall quality of the data is commendable.

My only concern is the finding that the two types of cells differ in their IA current (by a factor of 2-3; Figure 4I). To the best of my understanding this should shift the resonance frequency of the cells to higher value and yet Figure 6 shows similar resonance. An explanation is needed here.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this point; the referee predicts that a difference in A-current amplitude should impact on the average resonance and is therefore concerned that the latter parameter is the same between rat and mouse TIDA neurons whereas the former is not. The impact of the A-current on resonance is, as far as we have been able to determine, relatively poorly explored in the literature, compared to other currents. It is therefore difficult to estimate – and discuss within the context of the present data – exactly how changes in this membrane property would affect intrinsic resonance, although a shift to higher frequencies, as suggested by the referee, is a reasonable assumption. Importantly, however, resonance the product of several membrane properties interacting and a difference in a single one of these may be counteracted by other, as yet undetermined changes.</p><p>It’s important in this context to bear in mind that rat and mouse TIDA neurons differ in input resistance. Interestingly, the rat neurons with the lower input resistance (Rinput = 0.6 GΩ) have higher IA amplitude while the mouse TIDA neurons with the higher input resistance (1.2 GΩ) have a lower IA amplitude. A low amplitude current would be expected to have a greater effect on a high-input-resistance cell (and <italic>vice versa</italic>), providing a potential explanation to the paradox noted by the Referee. In electrophysiological terms, the impact could be simply the degree of hyperpolarization and resonance frequency.</p></body></sub-article></article>
