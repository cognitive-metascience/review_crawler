ganglia (BG) network and together innervate BG downstream structures using GABA and glutamate, respectively. Comparison of the neuronal activity in BG input and downstream structures reveals that subthalamic, not striatal, activity fluctuations correlate with modulations in the increase/decrease discharge balance of BG downstream neurons during temporal discounting classical condition task. After induction of parkinsonism with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), abnormal low beta (8-15 Hz) spiking and local field potential (LFP) oscillations resonate across the BG network. Nevertheless, LFP beta oscillations entrain spiking activity of STN, striatal cholinergic interneurons and BG downstream structures, but do not entrain spiking activity of striatal projection neurons. Our results highlight the pivotal role of STN divergent projections in BG physiology and pathophysiology and may explain why STN is such an effective site for invasive treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease and other BG-related disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16443.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16443.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16443.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The symptoms of Parkinson’s disease include tremor and slow movement, as well as loss of balance, depression and problems with sleep and memory. The death of neurons in a region of the brain called the substantia nigra pars compacta is one of the major hallmarks of Parkinson’s disease. These neurons produce a chemical called dopamine, and their death reduces dopamine levels in another area of the brain called the striatum. This structure is one of five brain regions known collectively as the basal ganglia, which form a circuit that helps to control movement.</p><p>The most effective treatment currently available for advanced Parkinson’s disease entails lowering electrodes deep into the brain in order to shut down the activity of part of the basal ganglia. However, the target is not the striatum; instead it is a structure called the subthalamic nucleus. The striatum and the subthalamic nucleus are the two input regions of the basal ganglia: each sends signals to the other three structures downstream. So why does targeting the subthalamic nucleus, but not the striatum, reduce the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease?</p><p>To shed some light on this issue, Deffains et al. recorded the activity of neurons in the basal ganglia before and after injecting two monkeys with a drug called MPTP. Related to heroin, MPTP produces symptoms in animals that resemble those of Parkinson’s disease. Before the injections, spontaneous fluctuations in the activity of the subthalamic nucleus produced matching changes in the activity of the three downstream basal ganglia structures. Fluctuations in the activity of the striatum, by contrast, had no such effect. Moreover, injecting the monkeys with MPTP caused the basal ganglia to fire in an abnormal highly synchronized rhythm, similar to that seen in Parkinson’s disease. Crucially, the subthalamic nucleus contributed to this abnormal rhythm, whereas the striatum did not.</p><p>The results presented by Deffains et al. provide a concrete explanation for why inactivating the subthalamic nucleus, but not the striatum, reduces the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Further research is now needed to explore how the striatum controls the activity of downstream regions of the basal ganglia, both in healthy people and in those with Parkinson's disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16443.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16443.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

rid="bib97">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>) divide the BG network into two functionally related subsystems. First, the main axis (or 'actor' in machine learning terminology) which corresponds to the BG structures that connect state-encoding thalamo-cortical areas to cortical and brainstem motor centers. Second, the neuromodulators (machine learning's 'critics', e.g., the midbrain dopaminergic neurons and striatal cholinergic interneurons) that adjust activity along the BG main axis by encoding a prediction error signal capable of modulating the efficacy of cortico-striatal transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Deffains and Bergman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Reynolds et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Shen et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The input structures of the BG main axis (the striatum and subthalamic nucleus, STN) receive considerable glutamatergic inputs from the cortex and the thalamus. The striatum and STN provide major inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory glutamatergic drive respectively to the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) and the BG output structures (internal segment of the globus pallidus and substantia nigra reticulata, GPi/SNr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Parent and Hazrati, 1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">1995b</xref>). In return, the GPe emits feedback GABAergic projections to the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Carpenter et al., 1981</xref>) and the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hegeman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mallet et al., 2012</xref>) as well as massive feedforward GABAergic projections to the GPi/SNr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Parent and Hazrati, 1995b</xref>). Thus, aside from the action of the BG neuromodulators and lateral connectivity, the increase-decrease balance of spiking activity (I/D balance) of pallidal and nigral neurons is fined-tuned by the inhibitory and excitatory drives exerted by the striatum and STN, respectively. However, how these antagonistic drives operate to convey relevant information from the state-encoding thalamo-cortical areas through the central (GPe) and output (GPi and SNr) BG structures to brain motor centers is still unknown.</p><p>Many human disorders are caused by malfunctions of the BG neuromodulators which impact neuronal activity along the BG main axis. Traditionally, in Parkinson's disease (PD), it is assumed that degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons leads to striatal dopamine depletion which provokes a cascade of physiological disturbances in the BG main axis, notably the emergence of synchronized oscillatory activity in the BG and cortical networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Levy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nini et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Oswal et al., 2013</xref>). These abnormal oscillations likely compromise information flow through the BG main axis and result in the release of abnormal commands by BG output structures.</p><p>Despite evidence of subthalamic dopamine depletion in PD and its role in the pathophysiology of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Francois et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Galvan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rommelfanger and Wichmann, 2010</xref>), the striatum remains the main site of dopamine depletion in human patients and animal models of PD. In addition, the striatum is much larger than the STN (10<sup>7</sup> vs. 10<sup>5</sup> neurons in non-human primates, respectively, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hardman et al., 2002</xref>). Nevertheless, the STN, not the striatum, is the prime target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) of human patients with advanced PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Limousin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Odekerken et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that STN-DBS abolishes abnormal synchronized oscillations in the BG network of animal models of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Meissner et al., 2005</xref>) and human PD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kühn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wingeier et al., 2006</xref>). These findings suggest that STN plays a pivotal role in the release of commands by BG output structures, but the respective influence of the striatum and STN activity on the activity of the BG central and output structures in PD are still unknown.</p><p>To tackle these issues, we recorded the neuronal activity of the BG input and downstream (central and output) structures of two monkeys engaged in a classical temporal discounting conditioning task (i.e., normal/healthy state, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the task, we manipulated the value of 2-s cues (predicting future appetitive, aversive or neutral outcomes) and the delivery time of the outcome (immediate or 6-s delayed). Then, once we completed the recordings in the normal state, we proceeded to record neuronal activity in the BG network of the same two monkeys after systemic induction of PD symptoms (i.e., parkinsonian state) with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). These multi-site recordings in both the normal and parkinsonian states served us to reveal how BG activity propagates along the BG main axis in health and parkinsonism. Moreover, it sheds light on which BG input structure (striatum or STN) is more influential in shaping the activity of the BG downstream structures in the recorded conditions.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16443.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Task design and behavioral monitoring.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Temporal discounting classical conditioning task.

The striatum is composed of the posterior putamen (motor area), the caudate nucleus (associative area) and ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens (limbic area) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Parent and Hazrati, 1995a</xref>). In this study, striatal (MSN and TAN) spiking activity was preferentially collected within the posterior putamen. The remaining striatal recordings were made in the caudate nucleus. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Graybiel et al., 1994</xref>), we did not find significant differences in the activity of MSNs and TANs between these two striatal sub-regions (data not shown). Therefore, we grouped each striatal cell-type recorded from the putamen and caudate nucleus for further analysis.</p><p>We also recorded the activity of the neurons of the STN and the high-frequency discharge (HFD) neurons of the GPe, GPi and SNr. HFD neurons of the GPe, GPi and SNr comprise &gt;85% of the neurons in these structures and, like striatal MSNs and STN neurons, are probably the projection neurons of these structures. Thus, a unique, and very advantageous for the current study, feature of the BG network is that each BG nucleus forms a single layer network; in other words, the BG projection neurons are innervated by the projections of the upward structures.

In both conditions (immediate and delayed) of the behavioral task, the frequency of the licking and blinking movements increased in response to food and airpuff delivery, respectively. Remarkably, the animals responded with appropriate anticipatory licking and blinking behavior to the outcome delivery in the immediate condition. In contrast, in the delayed condition, the animals did not display any robust anticipatory licking and blinking movements during the cue and delay periods. Together, these behavioral results indicate that the animals learned the cue values (appetitive, aversive or neutral) and differentiated between cues predicting an immediate or a delayed outcome. However, the introduction of a 6-s delay period after cue offset probably compromised the temporal predictability of the outcome delivery in the delayed condition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Persistent modulations of activity along the BG main axis</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> depicts the mean (for each BG neuronal assembly) relative (gray) and absolute (green) peri-stimulus histograms (PSTHs). The mean relative PSTH is calculated as the arithmetic average of the single neurons' PSTHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and is more standard in neuroscience. The mean relative PSTH reflects the common assumption that the on-going activity of the studied population is close to zero and that the studied neurons excite their neuronal targets that act as integrate-and-fire neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Izhikevich, 2007</xref>). On the other hand, most BG neurons fire at tonic high frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C and D</xref>) and a large fraction of their responses to behavioral events consists of decreases in discharge rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Espinosa-Parrilla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Joshua et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Turner and Anderson, 2005</xref>). Thus, neurons of the BG network might follow resonance rather than integrate-and-fire rules when they are activated by their afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Izhikevich, 2007</xref>). We therefore calculated the mean absolute PSTH (absolute deviation from the baseline of the firing rate, see Materials and methods) of the BG neurons recorded in our study. These absolute PSTHs revealed that the average population response to the cue of each neuronal assembly of the BG main axis persisted until the outcome delivery in both conditions (immediate and delayed) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, green lines). Therefore, these persistent modulations of activity along the BG main axis temporally bridged sensory visual information (provided by cue presentation) and the actions (licking and blinking movements) wired to outcome delivery and continued even when the visual information was no longer available during the 6-s delay period in the delayed condition. The persistent responses in the BG main axis contrast with the transient response of the TANs (i.e., one of the BG neuromodulators) to the cue onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16443.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Relative and absolute population responses to the task behavioral events.</title><p>The response of a single neuron to the cue was calculated as the relative or absolute deviation from the baseline of the firing rate.

However, using extracellular recording method, we can only record changes in the discharge rate of neurons but not the corresponding changes in synaptic and membrane potentials. Since both an increase in excitation and an abolition of inhibition can lead to an increase in discharge rate (and vice versa for decreases in discharge rate), we used the more conservative nomenclature of the increase/decrease discharge rate balance (I/D balance).</p><p>To assess the time-varying I/D balance within the different neuronal assemblies of the BG main axis, we calculated the fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and the magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) of increases and decreases in spiking activity. This was done for each neuronal assembly, from cue onset to outcome delivery, in the two behavioral conditions (immediate and delayed). This way, we examined the I/D balance (i.e., relative increase vs. decrease dominance of activity as measured by the fraction weighted by the magnitude) over time along the BG main axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, left and central histograms). We found that during the cue periods in both conditions, increases in activity (positive I/D balance) strongly predominated in all BG structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, right bar plots). In contrast, during the delay period, although the I/D balance was still strikingly biased towards increases in activity for the MSNs, this imbalance was significantly reduced in the STN and reversed in the GPe, GPi and SNr (one-way ANOVA, p&lt;0.001, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, right bar plots). Thus, whereas the inhibitory GABAergic drive from the striatum was unchanged over the different task periods, the STN excitatory glutamatergic drive was reduced when moving from the cue to the delay periods.

The STA LFP analysis revealed that except for MSNs, the coincidence between the spikes of the STN, GPe, SNr neurons, as well as those of the TANs, and the negative waves of the LFP oscillations increased after MPTP intoxication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16</xref>, left and central columns). Finally, to rule out the possibility that differences in the population STAs LFP were not a mere consequence of the differences in discharge rate (and the total number of triggers) of the different BG neuronal components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17</xref>), we also calculated the STAs LFP after random dilution of the spike trains of the neurons (see Materials and methods). We found that the random dilution of the spike trains did not affect the STA-LFP results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16</xref>, right column). Therefore, in the parkinsonian state, spike-LFP synchronization was not influenced by the firing rate of BG neuronal components and more importantly, the absence of phase locking between MSN spiking activity and striatal LFPs was probably not due to the confounding effects of the slow discharge rate of the MSNs.<fig id="fig16" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16443.029</object-id><label>Figure 16.</label><caption><title>Population spike-triggered averages of LFP after MPTP intoxication show larger fluctuations around spike times of STN, BG downstream neurons and striatal TANs, but not around spike times of striatal MSNs.</title><p>For each BG neuronal assembly, population STA LFP was defined as the average of the STAs LFP of all neurons.

Therefore, it is crucial to show that persistent modulatory activity (i.e., during prolonged delays between sensory perception and action, especially when sensory information is no longer available) is not a unique property of the frontal cortex and other cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Curtis and Lee, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Durstewitz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Goldman-Rakic, 1995</xref>), but can also be found along the BG main axis.</p><p>Unlike the cortex, many projection neurons of the BG use the inhibitory transmitter GABA as a carrier of information within and between BG nuclei. Nevertheless, the STN is a major source of glutamate (an excitatory transmitter) to the BG downstream structures (GPe, GPi and SNr). Accordingly, in most BG structures, modifications of spiking activity by behavioral events consist of either increases or decreases in firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Espinosa-Parrilla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Joshua et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Turner and Anderson, 2005</xref>). Due to their low baseline firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17A</xref>), it might be posited that like other low-discharge rate neurons (e.g., in the cortex), the neuronal responses of the striatal MSNs would be restricted to increases in activity. Nevertheless and in line with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Báez-Mendoza et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Samejima et al., 2005</xref>), we found task-related decreases (albeit less frequent than increases) in the discharge rate of MSNs. This suggests that neurons in the BG main axis (including striatal MSNs) exhibited diverse timing and directional (increase or decrease) patterns of discharge modulations from cue onset to outcome delivery.</p><p>These diverse patterns of BG discharge modulations resulted in persistent population activity, even in the absence of sensory stimulation (after cue offset) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>).

In addition, a formal clustering analysis of the MSN responses from cue onset to outcome delivery in both conditions (data not shown) found no evidence for two distinct MSN sub-groups (e.g., one group that responded during cue presentation and another group that responded during the extended delay period) that could account for the reversal of I/D balance in the BG downstream network during the delay period in the delayed condition.</p><p>Although there is an ongoing debate on the distribution of STN output in the BG downstream network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mathai and Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sato et al., 2000</xref>), a compelling functional model of action selection process in the BG network claims that information transfer via the hyper-direct (cortex-STN-GPi/SNr) pathway is faster and more broadly distributed in the BG output structures than the information flowing along the direct and indirect (striatum-GPi/SNr) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mink, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Nambu et al., 2002</xref>).

Thus, the STN would exert a powerful glutamatergic and apparently GABAergic striatal-free control over the release of BG output commands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baunez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Frank et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jahanshahi et al., 2015</xref>) prior to their fine modulation by the direct and indirect pathways. Nonetheless, this specific correlation between the divergent excitatory STN projections and BG downstream neurons was only shown here for a classical conditioning task with immediate and delayed outcomes and should be tested in the future under a range of behavioral conditions and paradigms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Abnormal oscillatory activity is not shared by all BG neuronal components in parkinsonism</title><p>In this study, we used a harsh MPTP intoxication procedure (see Materials and methods) rather than a slower regimen of MPTP intoxication (i.e., that would have led to a L-DOPA responsive parkinsonian monkey capable of executing behavioral tasks). This decision was made to induce a large striatal dopamine depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and guarantee the emergence of the full spectrum of pathological synchronous oscillations in the BG. Indeed, earlier studies have failed to find abnormal BG oscillatory activity at the early stage of chronic MPTP treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Leblois et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, the stability of the parkinsonian symptoms during the complete duration of the recordings was critical in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) to enable the comparison of activities at the different stages of the BG. Therefore, we favored severe MPTP-treated monkeys that usually develop stable clinical symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Potts et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The emergence of synchronized oscillatory activity in the BG network of animal models of PD and human PD patients has been well-described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brown, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wichmann and DeLong, 2003</xref>). These abnormal oscillations are thought to alter the information flow through the BG main axis, thus leading to the release of abnormal commands by BG output structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bergman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brown et al., 2001</xref>). However, the frequency range of these oscillations varies across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Stein and Bar-Gad, 2013</xref>). In line with earlier studies conducted on MPTP-treated monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bergman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Raz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Soares et al., 2004</xref>), we found that abnormal spiking oscillatory activity after MPTP intoxication of African green monkeys (vervets) occurred in the low beta (8–15 Hz) range. In addition, we showed that this pathological oscillatory activity, at least at the level of spiking activity, was not shared by all BG neuronal components in parkinsonism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>). Even though earlier rodent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Costa et al., 2006</xref>) and primate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Singh et al., 2015</xref>) studies have shown that MSN activity patterns are altered in parkinsonism, we found that MSNs apparently failed to express pathological 8–15 Hz neuronal oscillations, as did the STN and BG downstream structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>). The lack of oscillatory activity of MSNs in the MPTP-treated monkey is consistent with our unpublished observations of no oscillatory spiking activity in the striatum of parkinsonian human patients undergoing DBS procedures. However, not all components of striatal activity were deprived of abnormal oscillatory activity after MPTP intoxication. Indeed, as already described in earlier studies of TANs in MPTP-treated monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Raz et al., 1996</xref>), we found that TANs also exhibited 10 Hz oscillatory activity. This MSN-TAN incongruity is in line with the view of a weak functional in vivo connectivity between MSNs and TANs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adler et al., 2013b</xref>) and probably reflects their different synaptic drives.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Abnormal oscillations in parkinsonism resonate across the BG network through the STN, not the striatum</title><p>In each structure of the BG main axis, including the striatum, we found exaggerated 8–15 Hz oscillations of LFP after MPTP intoxication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). Nevertheless, 8–15 Hz LFP oscillations (although sparser) were also observed in the healthy state (before MPTP). In normal behavior control, beta oscillatory activity is known to play a role in the maintenance of the current sensorimotor or cognitive state (the status quo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brittain and Brown, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Engel and Fries, 2010</xref>). Therefore, the 8–15 Hz LFP oscillations observed in the healthy state likely correspond to one of the neuronal processes involved in state-to-action mapping. Consequently, exaggeration of 8–15 Hz oscillatory activity after induction of parkinsonism would compromise the ability of human PD patients to adjust their behavior to situational demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Brown and Marsden, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cools et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Frank et al., 2007b</xref>) due to an abnormal persistence of the BG 'status quo' signal.</p><p>The LFP probably represents a global signature of the synaptic input and dendritic processing, whereas MUA reflects the efferent (output) activity of the local neuronal population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Buzsáki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Logothetis, 2003</xref>). Thus, as for other structures in the closed loop of the BG network, we found that the dopamine-depleted striatum was also bombarded with pathological oscillations by its major afferent neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). However, these striatal oscillating synaptic inputs apparently only entrained the spiking activity of the TANs, but not the MSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>). Spike-field coherence analysis revealed that the single-unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>) and multi-unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s1">Figure 14—figure supplement 1</xref>) spiking activities of the STN, GPe and SNr neurons after MPTP intoxication were synchronized to the 8–15 Hz oscillatory LFP recorded in their surrounding areas. On the other hand, in the dopamine-depleted striatum, only TAN (single- and multi-unit) spiking activity was phase locked to the striatal 8–15 Hz LFP oscillations. After MPTP intoxication, we found no evidence for a (linear) relationship between the strength of the 8–15 Hz LFP oscillations and the degree of spike-field coherence in the 8–15 Hz range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15s1">Figure 15—figure supplement 1</xref>) along the BG network. Therefore, whatever the strength of the 8–15 Hz LFP oscillations within the striatum, MSN spiking activity failed to lock with these LFP oscillations.</p><p>Unlike the low discharge rate of the isolated MSNs (lower than the frequency of the 8–15 Hz oscillations, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17</xref>), the MUA recorded in the vicinity of the isolated striatal MSNs reflects the discharge of many neurons. Therefore, given the consistency of the spike-field coherence results using spike trains of isolated MSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>) or striatal MUAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s1">Figure 14—figure supplement 1</xref>), the absence of coherence between MSN spiking activity and LFP after MPTP intoxication was most likely not confounded by the slow MSN discharge. Indeed, STA LFP analysis (even after random dilution of the spike trains of the neurons) also indicated that MSN spikes did not synchronize with LFP oscillations, as did the spikes of TAN, STN, GPe and SNr neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16</xref>). Finally, in line with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Goldberg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kühn et al., 2005</xref>), we showed that these synchronized spiking activities occurred during the negative wave of the 8–15 Hz oscillatory LFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figures 14</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">16</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s1">Figure 14—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, these results rule out the possibility that the absence of synchronization between MSN spiking activity and abnormal oscillating LFP striatal inputs in parkinsonism was due to the low discharge rate of the MSNs. Rather, the abnormal striatal synaptic inputs may not have been strong enough to depolarize the membrane potential of the MSNs above the spike threshold.</p><p>Based on the classical rate model of the BG network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albin et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bergman et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gerfen et al., 1990</xref>), striatal dopamine depletion leads to a reduction of the D1-MSM discharge and an elevation of the D2-MSN discharge. In contrast to an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Liang et al., 2008</xref>), we did not find any robust increase in the firing rate of the MSNs recorded within the dopamine-depleted striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17</xref>). This inconsistency could be due to differences in the experimental approaches, such as the species, the methods of MPTP intoxication, the time elapsed between MPTP treatment and neuronal recordings, and the severity of the parkinsonian symptoms. In any case, our methods of extracellular recording in behaving animals cannot discriminate between D1- and D2-MSNs. However, in agreement with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bergman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Filion and Tremblay, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Miller and DeLong, 1987</xref>), we also found that after MPTP intoxication, the firing rate decreased in the GPe and increased in the STN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17</xref>). Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that the slight elevation of the striatal GABAergic drive to the GPe (via D2-MSNs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) may have induced oscillatory activity in the BG downstream structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Terman et al., 2002</xref>), probably through changes in the activity pattern of the GPe-STN closed circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bevan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Plenz and Kital, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Noticeably, despite the abnormal oscillating synaptic inputs in the striatum, striatal projection neurons (MSNs) failed to express spiking (output) activity. Therefore, abnormal oscillatory activity within dopamine-depleted striatum did not propagate to the BG downstream structures. In this study, we did not assess the striatal vs. extra-striatal dopamine depletion after MPTP intoxication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and we cannot exclude the possible role of dopamine degeneration of the STN and BG downstream structures in the emergence of oscillatory activity in the STN and along the BG network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Francois et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Galvan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rommelfanger and Wichmann, 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, the abnormal oscillatory spiking activity of the STN neurons emerged in tandem with an increase in synchronization between the oscillatory spiking activity of the STN neuronal targets (i.e., BG downstream neurons) and their abnormal LFP oscillations (i.e., BG downstream oscillating synaptic inputs). Therefore, our results are in line with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nambu and Tachibana, 2014</xref>) and suggest that the abnormal oscillations observed in PD resonate across the closed loop of the cortico-BG network through the STN, not the striatum.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Overall, the current study conducted on both normal and parkinsonian animals support the idea that the STN may be the driving force behind the physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kitai and Kita, 1987</xref>) as well as the pathophysiology of the BG. Nevertheless, the striatum obviously remains a major player in BG functioning in health and disease. Striatal dopaminergic input is involved not only in the modulation of the efficacy of the cortico-striatal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Reynolds et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Shen et al., 2008</xref>), but also in the excitability of the striatal projection neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Nicola et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Onn et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, the coincidence of cortical/thalamic and midbrain dopaminergic activity might be a necessary condition for MSN spike generation. Consequently, MSN spiking activity would be shaped by striatal inputs only during brief, but functionally important periods (probably marked by transient dopaminergic activity). This refined control of striatal output patterns was probably undetected in the current population analysis.</p><p>Moreover, in parkinsonism, due to the utilization of a harsh MPTP intoxication procedure, our MPTP-treated monkeys developed stable and severe motor symptoms, and were unable to execute the behavioral task. Therefore, the study of the neuronal activity along the BG network in similar classical (but also operant) conditioning tasks using MPTP-treated monkeys that exhibit moderate parkinsonian symptoms is undoubtedly a necessary step that should enhance our understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of the BG.

In contrast, in the GPi, nearly all the neurons exhibit a continuous (without pauses) high-frequency discharge.</p><p>Beyond the internal capsule (discernible by the high density of fibers), the STN and SNr were differentiated based on the depth of the electrode, the level of background activity (higher background activity in the STN due to higher neuronal density), the electrophysiological features (narrower spike shape and higher firing rate in SNr) of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bergman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">DeLong et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Schultz, 1986</xref>) and the detection of the surrounding neurons (e.g., neurons of the zona incerta for the STN, and neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta for the SNr).</p><p>Spike detection and sorting were done online (see 'data collection and physiological recordings' section above). Each sorted unit was offline subjected to visual inspection of the stability of its firing rate over its recording span and the longest stable period was manually selected for further analysis while the rest of the data was discarded. Then, the quantification of its isolation quality (only for the stable period) was graded by calculating its isolation score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Joshua et al., 2007</xref>). The isolation score ranged from 0 (i.e., multi-unit activity) to 1 (i.e., perfect isolation). Only cells exhibiting a stable firing rate for ≥15 min (≥9 min for MSNs and STN neurons) and an isolation score ≥0.7 (≥0.6 for MSNs and STN neurons) were included in the database. The adjustment of the inclusion criteria for MSNs and STN neurons was due to the extremely small soma of the MSNs and the highly dense cellular structure of the STN which make cell stability and isolation difficult. Analysis of the subset of MSNs and STN neurons that fulfilled the same inclusion criteria of TANs, pallidal and nigral neurons (stability ≥15 min, isolation score ≥0.7) yielded similar results to those reported here.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Time-varying increase-decrease balance of spiking activity</title><p>Neuronal activities for the different task cues were characterized by their relative and absolute peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). The PSTHs (i.e., 6 PSTHs per neuron) were calculated in 1 ms bins and smoothed with a Gaussian window (SD = 20 ms). For each smoothed PSTH, we calculated the relative deviation from the baseline (i.e., relative PSTH) by subtracting the baseline firing rate (i.e., mean firing rate in the last 500 ms of the ITI) from the PSTH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We also calculated the absolute deviation from the baseline (i.e., absolute PSTH). Given that this operation does not provide a natural zero baseline, the average of the absolute deviation from the baseline during the last 500 ms of the ITI was subtracted from this statistic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Next, the relative PSTH was segmented into consecutive and non-overlapped 20 ms bins. A bin was considered responsive when the bin activity ≥2 or ≤ – 2 SD of the baseline firing rate (p&lt;0.05, empirical 68-95-99.7 rule). To examine the time course of the modulations of activity, we calculated the fraction of responsive bins at each time bin (20 ms). The fraction of responsive bins was calculated for all neurons in one of the BG structures, from cue onset to outcome delivery in both conditions (immediate and delayed) and for the different trial types (appetitive, neutral and aversive). BG main axis neuronal responses to behavioral events are composed of either increases or decreases in discharge rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Espinosa-Parrilla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Joshua et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Turner and Anderson, 2005</xref>). For this reason, at each time bin, we determined for each neuron and for each trial condition and type (immediate/delayed conditions and appetitive/neutral/aversive types): (1) the fraction of increases and decreases in activity out of the total number of responsive bins, depending on whether the bin activity ≥ 2 or ≤ - 2 SD of the baseline firing rate, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>); (2) the mean magnitude of increases and decreases in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>); (3) the relative dominance of the increases and decreases in activity <italic>[(increase - decrease) / (increase + decrease)]</italic> after having weighted the fractions of increases and decreases by their respective magnitude (i.e., increase-decrease balance of spiking activity or I/D balance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This way, we examined the temporal evolution of the I/D balance over the different task periods in each neuronal assembly of the BG main axis. Note that for each condition (immediate/delayed) we tested each neuron three times (for appetitive, neutral and aversive trials). Grouping all trial types of a single neuron revealed similar results (data not shown). Finally, segmentation of the relative PSTH using 50 ms bins yielded the same qualitative results as those reported (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Similarity/dissimilarity of neuronal responses between BG input and downstream neurons</title><p>For each neuronal activity (i.e., binned relative PSTH) of the BG main axis, we determined the principal polarity (increase or decrease) of the neuronal response during each task period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The neuronal response was defined as an increase or a decrease when at least 75% of the modulated bins exhibited increases or decreases in activity, respectively.</p><p>Then, for each task period and each trial type, we calculated the zero lag coefficient of the cross correlation function (i.e., similarity coefficient) between the neuronal activities of each BG input-downstream neuron pair. Neuron pairs were clustered according to the principal polarity of their neuronal responses. This yielded four distinct scenarios: neuron pairs exhibiting a similar (increase-increase or decrease-decrease) or opposite (increase-decrease or decrease-increase) polarity of their neuronal responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The similarity coefficient ranged from −1 (i.e., opposite neuronal activity) to +1 (i.e. same neuronal activity). The similarity coefficients for the three trial types (appetitive, neutral and aversive trials) were pooled since no significant difference was detected between them.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Power spectral density</title><p>For the power spectral density (PSD) calculations, the raw signal (1 to 8000 Hz, multi-unit activity, MUA) recorded in the vicinity of the cells that fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this study (stable discharge rate duration ≥15 or 9 min and isolation score ≥0.7 or 0.6 for TANs, pallidal, nigral neurons and MSNs, STN neurons, respectively) was online band-pass filtered from 250 to 6000 Hz (four-pole Butterworth filter). The filtered signal was Z-score normalized to obtain an unbiased estimate (by the electrode impedance or the amplitude of the recorded neuronal activity) of the oscillatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zaidel et al., 2010</xref>). The Z-normalized signal was rectified by the 'absolute' operator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Deffains et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Moran et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zaidel et al., 2010</xref>). The rectified signal follows the envelope of the MUA and therefore enables the detection of burst frequencies below the range of the online band-pass filter (250–6000 Hz). Since the local field potential (LFP) frequency domain was filtered out, the resulting PSD only represented the oscillatory features of the spiking activity.</p><p>The PSD of each signal was calculated using Welch's method with a 3-s Hamming window (50% overlap) and a spectral resolution of 1/3 Hz (nfft = 75000, sampling frequency = 25,000 Hz). Any DC component generated by the sampling processes and by the 'absolute' operator was removed by subtracting the mean of every windowed segment of the rectified signal. For each neuronal assembly, the mean PSD was defined as the average of the PSDs of all signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>).</p><p>Quantification of the peak value of every PSD between 8–15 Hz was carried out by using a <italic>Z</italic>-score method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Moshel et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, for every PSD, the peak value (maximum value) of the PSD between 8 and 15 Hz was measured, and a <italic>tail</italic> mean and standard deviation was defined in the frequency range of 55 to 75 Hz. In this <italic>tail</italic> range, no particular power spectrum phenomena were observed between before and after MPTP intoxication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The PSD peak value in the 8–15 Hz range was defined as the Z-score amplitude of the PSD peak value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, we also calculated the PSD of the LFP (1 to 250 Hz) recorded in the vicinity of the isolated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). To do so, the PSD of each Z-normalized LFP was calculated using Welch's method (see above for the parameters; but nfft = 2344, sampling frequency = 781.3 Hz) and without prior rectification by the absolute operator. Given the use of high-impedance microelectrodes, the LFPs were often contaminated by noise, which manifested as sharp peaks in the PSD. For this reason, we applied custom-made artifact removal software on the PSD of each LFP. For each peak of the PSD (PSD fpeak), if <italic>PSD fpeak &gt; 2*[(PSD fpeak<sub>−2</sub> + PSD fpeak<sub>+2</sub>) / 2]</italic>, where fpeak was the frequency of the peak, PSD fpeak was considered as an artifact and PSD fpeak<sub>−2</sub>, PSD fpeak<sub>−1</sub>, PSD fpeak, PSD fpeak<sub>+1</sub> and PSD fpeak<sub>+2</sub> were removed (replaced with Matlab Not a Number, NaN).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Spike-field coherence</title><p>For each sorted unit that fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), the spike train (i.e. time epochs of the detected spikes) was low-passed filtered (cutoff frequency = 100 Hz) and Z-normalized. Synchronization between the Z-normalized spiking activity and the Z-normalized LFP recorded in the vicinity of the sorted unit was done by using the magnitude squared (MS) coherence method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>, left plots). Welch's method was utilized (see PSD calculation for the parameters). Coherence values ranged (by definition) from 0 to 1. For every coherence estimate, we determined the coherence peak value (the highest coherence) in the 8–15 Hz range.</p><p>We also calculated the cross power spectrum density for all spike-LFP pairs. For each, we computed the cross spectrum phase and determined the phase lag value at the frequency of the 8–15 Hz coherence peak value. Then, for every neuronal assembly, we built the phase histogram of the phases of the spiking activity relative to the LFP at the frequency of the 8–15 Hz coherence peak values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>, right polar histograms).</p><p>To examine the relationship between the strength of the LFP oscillations and the degree of spike-LFP phase locking in the 8–15 Hz range, we performed a linear regression analysis between the 8–15 Hz LFP PSD peak values (see calculation of the 8–15 Hz MUA PSD peak values for the details) and the 8–15 Hz spike-field coherence peak value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref>). Finally, we carried out a similar spike-field coherence analysis using the MUA rather than the spike train (single-unit activity) of the sorted units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s1">Figure 14—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15s1">Figure 15—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Spike-triggered average of the LFP</title><p>To investigate the spike-LFP relationship in the temporal domain and not only in the frequency domain (i.e., spike-field coherence analysis), we also calculated the spike-triggered average (STA) of the LFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Goldberg et al., 2004</xref>) for each sorted unit included in the neuronal database. To do so, each Z-normalized LFP was offline low-pass filtered (four-pole Butterworth filter, filtfilt Matlab function, cutoff frequency = 30 Hz). This low-pass filter removed the ringing artifacts following spike time and the residual waveform of the spikes in the LFP recorded in the vicinity of the sorted unit (i.e., from the same electrode). For each neuronal assembly, the population STA LFP was defined as the average of the STAs LFP of all neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16</xref>).</p><p>Finally, in the parkinsonian state, to rule out the possibility that STA LFP results in the striatum were influenced by the slow discharge rate of the MSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17</xref>), we randomly diluted the spike trains of every sorted units (MSNs included) firing at a higher rate than the mean discharge rate of the MSNs. Following the random dilution, the discharge rate of these units equaled the mean discharge rate of the MSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17</xref>) and then we repeated the STA-LFP analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16</xref>, right column).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistics</title><p>Analysis was conducted identically on the different neuronal assemblies. The data from the two monkeys were pooled since no significant difference was detected between them. All statistical analyses were done using custom-made MATLAB 7.5 routines (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). Statistical comparisons between the different task periods were tested with one-way ANOVAs. If necessary, Bonferroni correction was used to adjust the chosen significance level according to the number of multiple comparisons. In addition, differences in fractions of neuronal responses depending on their principal polarity (increase vs. decrease) were assessed by using χ<sup>2</sup> test and two-way ANOVAs were used to statistically compare the similarity coefficients between BG input (striatum or STN) and downstream (GPe, GPi or SNr) structures. Finally, for every neuronal assembly, two-sample t-test was used for statistical comparisons between the healthy (before MPTP) and parkinsonian (after MPTP) states. The criterion for statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Yaron Dagan for assistance with animal care, Dr. Atira Bick and Dr. Nanette Freedman for assistance with the coordination and execution of the MRI and PET scans, and Esther Singer for editing.

Can the responsive MSNs be sorted into two general subgroups, one group that responds during cue presentation and another group that responds during the extended delay period?

It is probably better to introduce these observations in the Results section.</p><p>STN output broadly distributed?: At several points, the Discussion describes STN output to be divergent or &quot;broadly distributed.&quot; Evidence for such a divergence is slim. Mathai et al. (Mvt Disord 2013) addresses a different topic completely. Nambu (2002) provides no new evidence for such an organization.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Deffains et al. aim at showing that subthalamic, not striatal MSN, activity correlates with basal ganglia downstream activity in normal and MPTP monkeys. This is an interesting study that regroups, in one experimental design, several notions that were so far scattered into different pieces of literature. In that respect it is a novel and informative study that takes advantage of well-defined methodologies routinely used in the contributing team. This reviewer wishes to express two concerns: the first is the lack of systematic approach caused by the use of a harsh MPTP intoxication procedure. While the first 6 figures deal with an elegant study of the whole BG physiology during a temporal discounting classical conditioning task, such investigation is not made possible by the &quot;severe&quot; parkinsonian syndrome displayed by the animals. Slower regimens of intoxication enable to produce dopa-responsive parkinsonian monkeys capable of operant behaviour. The resulting disconnection between part I (first 6 figures) and part II (following figures) sections dampen this reviewer's enthusiasm. The second concern is that no detailed anatomo-pathological study accompanies the comprehensive physiological investigations. It is surprising, especially given the low n of animals, that no post-mortem assessment has been performed. MPTP-induced dopamine neuron (and terminals) degeneration should have been studied so that the extent and pattern of neurodegeneration is characterized in the vicinity of recording tracks. A high magnification dopamine fibers (TH, DAT, VMAT) counting possibly associated with a direct anti-DA immunohistochemistry should be performed in all BG recorded structures in order to assess the striatal vs extra-striatal impact of MPTP-induced lesions. Indeed, MPTP induces a loss of DA terminals not only in the striatum but as well in all BG nuclei although with disparate intensities.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16443.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers appreciated the importance and novelty of the study showing that STN is a major input driving function and dysfunction of the basal ganglia.</italic></p><p><italic>However, they ask for a few clarifications about the analyses of electrophysiology.</italic></p><p>We believe that we have clarified the referees' questions about the electrophysiology analyses in the revised manuscript.

Is this simply a matter of firing rate or of how far these neurons are below threshold?</italic></p><p>We thank the referee for his comment and fully agree that the investigation on the incapacity of abnormal striatal local field potential (LFP) to entrain spiking activity of striatal projection neurons in parkinsonism should be expanded in both the frequency and temporal domains.</p><p>For this reason, we conducted additional analyses to determine whether or not the absence of locking between MSN spiking activity and abnormal oscillating (LFP) striatal synaptic inputs in the parkinsonian state is simply a consequence of the low firing rate of the MSNs or due to the high spike threshold of the MSNs. We believe that our new analysis supports the high spike-threshold hypothesis, i.e., the abnormal striatal synaptic inputs are not strong enough to depolarize the membrane potential of the MSNs above their threshold potential. To support the threshold hypothesis we carried out two new analyses:</p><p>First, we examined the coherence between the multi-unit activity (MUA) in the striatum (and elsewhere) and the LFP (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s1">Figure 14—figure supplement 1</xref>) before and after MPTP intoxication. Unlike the low discharge rate of isolated MSNs (~2 Hz and below the frequency of the 8-15 Hz LFP oscillations; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17</xref> in the revised manuscript) the MUA recorded in the striatum in the vicinity of isolated MSN is representative of the discharge of many neurons; hence the coherence results are not confounded by the slow discharge rate of single MSN. Comparison of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s1">Figure 14—figure supplement 1</xref> (MUA-LFP coherence) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref> (single-unit-LFP coherence) did not reveal any significant differences.</p><p>In addition, for each BG neuronal component, we calculated the spike-triggered averages of the LFPs (STA LFPs) recorded in the vicinity of the spiking neurons (i.e., from the same electrode; New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16</xref> in the revised manuscript). Again, this analysis overcomes the putative confounding effect of the low discharge rate of the MSNs, because if the MSN's spikes are triggered by the LFP oscillations but not at every cycle of them (Brunel and Hakim, Chaos. 2008; 18(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">1</xref>):015113; Kopell and LeMasson, PNAS. 1994; 91:10586-10590), one should see a locking between the spikes and the LFP oscillations. Indeed, although spikes of STN, GPe, SNr neurons and striatal TANs, were locked to the trough of the LFP oscillations after MPTP intoxication, striatal MSN spiking activity did not exhibit such locking.</p><p>Finally, to rule out the possibility that the STA LFP results in the parkinsonian state were influenced by the lower discharge rate of the MSNs, we randomly diluted the spike train of each neuron (MSNs included) firing at a higher rate than the mean discharge rate of the MSNs. After the random dilution, the discharge rate of all studied neuronal populations equaled the mean discharge rate of the MSNs and then we repeated the STA LFP analysis (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16</xref>, right column). The &quot;diluted&quot; STAs LFP resembled the original STAs, and thus supports our claim of a significant difference between striatal MSNs vs. STN and BG downstream neurons.</p><p>The description of the new methods and results are given in the text of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) What then does the striatal outflow achieve if it is not patterned by input? Should we presume that what is demonstrated pertains to time and spatially averaged changes (over a few seconds and compiled from many neurons), and the striatal outflow may be more directly related to input for brief but functionally important periods and/or with a much more refined/focal patterning missed in the current analysis?</italic></p><p>We thank the referee for his comment which has led to extensive changes in the Discussion. We believe that we now present a better view of the physiology and pathophysiology of the BG.</p><p>Briefly, we agree with the referee that in most brain areas the output (spikes) is shaped by the input (LFP). However, while we have no doubt that the output of the striatum (MSN spiking activity) is shaped by the striatal synaptic input, we would like to emphasize the possible differences between striatal LFP and striatal synaptic input.</p><p>First, there is still an on-going debate concerning the physical correlates of sub-cortical LFPs, especially when recorded by a mono-polar electrode (vs. a remote ground). If the striatal LFP mainly reflects cortical EEG, it might differ from the striatal synaptic input for several reasons: <italic>(1)</italic> only a fraction of the cortical neurons project to the striatum (Turner and DeLong, J. Neurosci. 2000; 20(18):7096-7108) and therefore cortical EEG might be different from the activity of cortico-striatal neurons; <italic>(2)</italic> the thalamus is a prominent glutamatergic input to the striatum (Smith et al., Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27(9):520-527) and thalamic activity, especially the activity of thalamic intra-laminar nuclei, might be hidden from the EEG point of view.</p><p>Even if striatal LFP reflects striatal sub-threshold (synaptic) activity, it probably reflects the (cortical and thalamic) glutamatergic activity and may only be marginally influenced by the lateral GABAergic connectivity or the dopaminergic input to the striatum. Modern striatal models concur that the dopaminergic input to the striatum plays a major role not only in modulation of the efficacy of the cortico-striatal synapses, but also as regards the excitability of the striatal projection neurons. Thus, coincidence between cortical and midbrain dopaminergic activity may be a necessary pre-condition for MSN spike generation.</p><p>In summary, we agree with the referee's suggestions that striatal outflow may be more directly related to input for brief but functionally important (probably marked by dopaminergic bursts) periods and with a much more refined pattern that was probably missed in the current population/average analysis. We have modified the Discussion of the revised manuscript to reflect these issues.</p><p><italic>Related to the above, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref> is interesting in showing that there are perhaps two types of LFP activity, even in the healthy state, albeit much more sparse in the latter; with and without β activity. This presence of β, even in health deserves highlighting more, but the authors might also elect to see if there is any MUA locking in striatum within the vicinity of the sub-population of LFPs with a β peak, and whether, in turn, these selected MUAs correlate with BG outflow activity at least in the Parkinsonian state. In short, with striatum being so much bigger than STN, with less convergence, do we have to look on a finer scale for input-output correlations?</italic></p><p>We thank the referee for his insights and very valuable comment. We have made the necessary modifications in the revised manuscript to address this point.</p><p>First, we modified the text of the Discussion to highlight the presence of LFP β oscillations in the normal state and relate this finding to the extensive literature on the role of β oscillation in normal (status-quo, stop) behavior (Engel and Fries, Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2010; 20:156–165 and Brittain and Brown, Neuroimage. 2014; 85:637–647).</p><p>Second, following this comment, for each spike-LFP pair recorded in the parkinsonian state, we performed a linear regression analysis between the strength of the 8-15 Hz LFP oscillations and the degree of spike-field coherence. This analysis has been done using both single-unit activity (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref> in the revised manuscript) and MUA (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15s1">Figure 15—figure supplement 1</xref>) for the calculation of the spike-field coherence. Note that the linear regression analysis using MUA as representative of the spiking activity was done to be consistent with the MUA-LFP coherence analysis of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s1">Figure 14—figure supplement 1</xref>). We preferred to conduct this continuous examination of the relationship between spiking activity and LFP oscillation because it does not impose a definition of an artificial threshold to determine whether or not LFP is oscillatory. Our results indicated that regardless of the BG neuronal component (i.e., including the striatal MSNs) the strength of the 8-15 Hz LFP oscillations was not related to the emergence of synchronization between spiking activity and LFP oscillations along the BG network after induction of parkinsonism. Thus, we can probably rule out the possibility that there was spike or MUA locking in striatum within the vicinity of the sub-population of LFP with a strong β peak.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>In this manuscript, Deffains et al. describe important new findings regarding the general organization of basal ganglia (BG) circuits.

Many readers will wonder why it is important to devote so many paragraphs of text and figures to the points made in this section. Do these results address a controversy? Do they provide ground breaking insights?</italic></p><p>In the revised manuscript we allocated more space to explaining the importance of the finding showing persistent fractions of modulated neurons along the BG main axis. Briefly, the BG main axis connects the brain areas encoding the current state of the subject and the brain areas controlling action. Therefore, it is important to show that persistent modulatory activity (i.e., during prolonged delays between sensory perception and action, especially when sensory information is no longer available) is not a unique property of the frontal cortex and other cortical areas, but can also be found along the BG main axis. Here, the demonstration that the BG main axis generates persistent modulatory activities is in line with the model that the BG main axis is able to convert transient sensory inputs into persistent internal representations. These BG persistent representations can be held and evaluated until they can be used later by the cortical and brainstem motor centers to guide the optimal action/response.</p><p>In addition, the evidence for persistent fractions of modulated neurons along the BG main axis, especially during the delay period is behind our finding that STN, not striatum, is correlated with the time-varying increase-decrease balance of spiking activity in BG downstream structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Indeed, we found that the reversal of the increase/decrease discharge balance in the BG downstream structures during the delay period was concurrent with the relative changes in the increase/decrease discharge balance of the STN during the transition from cue to the delay period.</p><p>We modified the Discussion to better reflect the novelty and importance of these results concerning BG persistent activity.</p><p><italic>I/D balance in striatal neurons: It comes as little surprise that striatal projection neurons have a strongly positive I/D balance. Given their characteristic very low baseline firing rates, task related decreases in firing rate are nearly impossible to detect. I think it would be helpful to acknowledge this fact and explain how the similarity/dissimilarity analyses used go beyond a simple comparison of raw I/D balances.</italic></p><p>We agree with the referee's comment. Given the low discharge rate of striatal MSNs, it is unexpected to observe decreases in MSN discharge rate. Nevertheless, such decreases in the discharge rate of the MSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) have been already described (e.g., Adler et al., J. Neurosci. 2012; 32(7):2473-2484; Samejima et al., Science. 2005; 310(5752):1337-1340; Báez-Mendoza et al., J. Neurophysiol. 2016; 115(1):68-79). We have made the necessary changes in the Discussion of the revised manuscript to clarify this point.</p><p>More importantly, in order to statistically compare the similarity/dissimilarity of the activities between BG input and downstream structures beyond a simple comparison of the raw I/D balance, we performed a cross-correlation analysis of the neuronal responses of the input structures (striatum or STN) and the BG downstream structures (GPe, GPi or SNr). Details of this new analysis are described in the Materials and methods of the revised manuscript in the section &quot;Similarity/dissimilarity of the neuronal responses between BG input and downstream structures&quot;. Briefly, cross-correlations were calculated between the neuronal responses (relative PSTHs) of each BG input-downstream neuron pair. Each pair was clustered according to the (principal) polarity of the neuronal responses. This way, we obtained four distinct scenarios and examined the similarity/dissimilarity of the neuronal responses of neuron pairs exhibiting a similar (increase-increase or decrease-decrease) or opposite (increase-decrease or decrease-increase) polarity. We found that STN, compared to striatal MSN, responses to behavioral events were more strongly correlated with BG downstream responses. In the revised manuscript, these results are depicted in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and incorporated into the main text of the Results section.</p><p><italic>Striatal neuron subtypes: STN and SNr populations show a striking change in I/D balance at cue offset. Is it possible that subtypes of MSN activity can account for the striking change in STN and SNr? It is virtually guaranteed that a variety of different response subtypes are included in the MSN population. Can the responsive MSNs be sorted into two general subgroups, one group that responds during cue presentation and another group that responds during the extended delay period? Inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> suggests that is not the case, but it is worth addressing this point explicitly. Doing so would dispel one source of doubt that skeptics will bring to the manuscript.</italic></p><p>Like the referee, we also wondered whether the striking changes at cue offset in the increase/decrease discharge balance of BG downstream neuronal populations would account for two distinct subtypes of MSN activity. Examination of the temporal patterns of changes in activity in the MSN assembly during the delay condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) did not reveal two distinct sub-groups, such that one group responded during cue presentation and the other group responded during the delay period. Nevertheless, as the referee requested, we carried out a formal clustering analysis of the MSN responses. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Author response image 1</xref> we show the clustering analysis of the MSN activities during the immediate and delayed conditions. Briefly, for each trial condition, salient features of MSN activities (relative PSTHs) were extracted with principal component analysis, using the scores of the first two principal components (PCs) as features for clustering. Identification of different MSN activity clusters was accomplished via the k-means clustering method, using the silhouette method to determine the optimal number of clusters between the limit of 1 and 4. In both conditions, we obtained three distinct clusters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Author response image 1A</xref>) reflecting three different MSN activity profiles (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Author response image 1B</xref>): unmodulated activity (black); increase in activity (red); decrease in activity (blue). Our clustering analysis revealed that MSN activity profiles represented two distinct MSN sub-populations that exhibited persistent increase or decrease in activity from cue onset to outcome delivery in both conditions. However, we found no evidence for two general MSN sub-groups, where one group responded during cue presentation and the other group responded during the extended delay period.</p><p>We added these observations to the Discussion of the revised manuscript.

Mathai et al. (Mvt Disord 2013) addresses a different topic completely. Nambu (2002) provides no new evidence for such an organization.</italic></p><p>Here, we believe that the reviewer is referring to Mathai and Smith (Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2011) and not Mathai et al. (Mov. Disorders. 2013). We did not quote the latter (Mathai et al., Mov. Disorders. 2013) whose main finding is that the primate STN is traversed by numerous myelinated axons which occupy as much as 36-45% of its associative and sensorimotor regions. However, this paper does not discuss the STN output to its pallidal and nigral targets.</p><p>Concerning the broad distribution of STN output and the review by Mathai and Smith (2011), referee is right; there is no clear evidence for broad STN distribution and we agree that this point is still being debated.</p><p>Our claim for an anatomical broad distribution of STN (vs. a more narrow distribution of the striatal output) is based mainly on the number of cells in the BG input and downstream structures. For example, Oorschot DE (J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 366:580–599) found that the rat BG consists, on average, of 2.790,000 neostriatal neurons, 13,600 STN neurons, 46,000 GPe, 3,200 GPi, and 26,300 SNr neurons. Similar relationships were reported by Percheron et al. for non-human primates (The basal ganglia related system of primates: definition, description and informational analysis, The basal ganglia IV, 1994, pp 3-20) and by Yelnik for the human STN (Functional Anatomy of the Basal Ganglia, Mov. Disorders. 2002; 17(3):S15–S21).</p><p>In addition, single-axon tracing of STN neurons revealed a very broad distribution of their terminals in the GPe, GPi and SNr (Sato et al., J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 424(1):142-152). Therefore, we believe that although quantitative data are still lacking, we can assume (in line with Mink, 1996; Nambu et al., 2002 and many others) that the STN output is broadly distributed in the BG downstream structures. Nevertheless, we made the necessary changes in the Discussion of the revised manuscript to clarify that evidence for STN output divergence is still slim.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>Deffains et al. aim at showing that subthalamic, not striatal MSN, activity correlates with basal ganglia downstream activity in normal and MPTP monkeys. This is an interesting study that regroups, in one experimental design, several notions that were so far scattered into different pieces of literature. In that respect it is a novel and informative study that takes advantage of well-defined methodologies routinely used in the contributing team.</italic></p><p>We thank the referee for his comprehensive summary and support.</p><p><italic>This reviewer wishes to express two concerns: the first is the lack of systematic approach caused by the use of a harsh MPTP intoxication procedure. While the first 6 figures deal with an elegant study of the whole BG physiology during a temporal discounting classical conditioning task, such investigation is not made possible by the &quot;severe&quot; parkinsonian syndrome displayed by the animals. Slower regimens of intoxication enable to produce dopa-responsive parkinsonian monkeys capable of operant behaviour. The resulting disconnection between part I (first 6 figures) and part II (following figures) sections dampen this reviewer's enthusiasm.</italic></p><p>We agree with the referee that it would be very interesting to study the behavior and the BG neural correlates in animal models with slower regimens of MPTP intoxication (i.e., that produce dopa-responsive parkinsonian monkeys capable of operant behavior). The use of MPTP-treated monkeys that exhibit moderate parkinsonian symptoms is undoubtedly a necessary step that would broaden our understanding of the physiology and the pathophysiology of the BG, as well as the early stages of Parkinson's disease.</p><p>In the current study, we decided to use the more severe MPTP model that probably mimics end-stage Parkinson's disease (off dopaminergic medication) in order to capture the full spectrum of synchronous oscillations in the BG network. Indeed, previous studies (Leblois et al., Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 26(6):1701-1713) failed to find BG oscillatory activity in early stages of chronic MPTP treatment. In addition, it has been shown that severe MPTP-treated monkeys usually develop stable clinical symptoms (Potts et al., Exp. Neurol. 2014; 256:133-143). In our study, the stability of the clinical symptoms in the MPTP-treated monkeys was a critical issue. Given the relatively long period of recordings after induction of parkinsonism (due to the number of BG structures in which we had to record – striatum, STN, GPe and SNr) we had to guarantee the stability of the parkinsonian symptoms in both animals during the entire duration of the recordings to be able to further compare activities at the different stages of the BG.</p><p>We modified the text in the Discussion of the revised manuscript to better clarify these points.</p><p><italic>The second concern is that no detailed anatomo-pathological study accompanies the comprehensive physiological investigations. It is surprising, especially given the low n of animals, that no post-mortem assessment has been performed. MPTP-induced dopamine neuron (and terminals) degeneration should have been studied so that the extent and pattern of neurodegeneration is characterized in the vicinity of recording tracks. A high magnification dopamine fibers (TH, DAT, VMAT) counting possibly associated with a direct anti-DA immunohistochemistry should be performed in all BG recorded structures in order to assess the striatal vs extra-striatal impact of MPTP-induced lesions. Indeed, MPTP induces a loss of DA terminals not only in the striatum but as well in all BG nuclei although with disparate intensities.</italic></p><p>After completion of the neuronal recordings in the parkinsonian state, a dynamic fluoro-dopa positron emission tomography (PET) study and post-mortem tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry (Monkey K and S, respectively) were used to assess the severity of dopamine depletion following the MPTP treatment.</p><p>The details of the PET study and the post-mortem TH immunohistochemistry are given in the Materials and methods of the revised manuscript in the section &quot;<italic>Assessment of dopamine depletion in the MPTP-treated monkeys&quot;.</italic> The results are incorporated into the main text and depicted in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8A and 8B</xref>. Briefly, the results showed that both MPTP-treated monkeys (in comparison with healthy animals) exhibited a large dopamine depletion in the dorsal striatum (i.e., caudate nucleus and putamen) similar to that observed in the brain of human patients suffering from advanced Parkinson's disease. Therefore, at this stage, even though we cannot assess dopamine degeneration of the STN and BG downstream structures in the parkinsonian state, we are confident of the validity of our non-human primate model of Parkinson's disease. Nevertheless, we did the necessary changes in the Discussion of the revised manuscript to highlight this point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
