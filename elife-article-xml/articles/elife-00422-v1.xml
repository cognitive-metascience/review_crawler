important for mitochondrial distribution and function. Recent data have demonstrated that ER–mitochondria contacts mark mitochondrial division sites, but the molecular basis and functions of these contacts are not understood. Here we show that in yeast, the ER–mitochondria tethering complex, ERMES, and the highly conserved Miro GTPase, Gem1, are spatially and functionally linked to ER-associated mitochondrial division. Gem1 acts as a negative regulator of ER–mitochondria contacts, an activity required for the spatial resolution and distribution of newly generated mitochondrial tips following division. Previous data have demonstrated that ERMES localizes with a subset of actively replicating mitochondrial nucleoids. We show that mitochondrial division is spatially linked to nucleoids and that a majority of these nucleoids segregate prior to division, resulting in their distribution into newly generated tips in the mitochondrial network. Thus, we postulate that ER-associated division serves to link the distribution of mitochondria and mitochondrial nucleoids in cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00422.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00422.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00422.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mitochondria generate most of the energy used by cells, and they also play key roles in cellular growth, death, and differentiation.

Mitochondrial division is mediated by a dynamin-related protein, Dnm1 (in yeast)/Drp1 (in mammals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lackner and Nunnari, 2009</xref>), which self-assembles in a regulated manner on the surface of the mitochondrial outer membrane into helices that mediate mitochondrial scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ingerman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mears et al., 2011</xref>). Dnm1 and Drp1 form helices in vitro, whose diameters are significantly smaller than the diameter of unconstricted mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ingerman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bossy et al., 2010</xref>). This observation suggests that a mechanism for Dnm1/Drp1-independent constriction may exist to facilitate helix assembly as a first step toward mitochondrial division.</p><p>We recently discovered that ER tubules wrap around mitochondria and mark a majority of mitochondrial division sites in yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>). These findings suggest that the process of ‘ER-associated Mitochondrial Division’ (ERMD) facilitates the creation of mitochondrial constriction sites, or geometric ‘hot spots’, for Dnm1/Drp1 helix assembly. Consistent with this model, the association of ER tubules with mitochondrial constriction sites is independent of mitochondrial division components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>). ERMD is also independent of known ER tubule-shaping proteins and Mfn2-mediated ER–mitochondria contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Brito and Scorrano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, the composition and biogenesis of ERMD sites are unknown.</p><p>A candidate for tethering ER and mitochondria at ERMD sites is the ER-Mitochondria Encounter Structure (ERMES)—a multiprotein complex localized at an interface between the ER and mitochondria in budding yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kornmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Toulmay and Prinz, 2012</xref>). The ERMES complex is composed of four core subunits, each of which is required for the formation of multiple ERMES foci per cell: Mdm10 and Mdm34 are integral to the mitochondrial outer membrane; Mdm12 is predicted to be cytosolic; and Mmm1 is an ER transmembrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kornmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stroud et al., 2011</xref>). ERMES is thought to function as a physical ER–mitochondria tether that serves to distribute mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boldogh et al., 2003</xref>) and to facilitate the exchange of lipids between the two organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kornmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Voss et al., 2012</xref>). ERMES foci are localized adjacent to a subset of nucleoids, which are engaged in replicating DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hobbs et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanekamp et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meeusen and Nunnari, 2003</xref>), suggesting that ERMES plays an active role in nucleoid regulation. In agreement with this notion, deletion of core ERMES components disrupts nucleoid structure and transforms the tubular mitochondrial network into spherical mitochondria with relatively large diameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgess et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Youngman et al., 2004</xref>). The ERMES-deficient mitochondrial morphology phenotype is epistatic to the characteristic net-like mitochondrial structures that result from the deletion of genes encoding mitochondrial division components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Youngman et al., 2004</xref>), consistent with ERMES functioning upstream of the mitochondrial division machinery in mitochondrial distribution.</p><p>Cytological, biochemical, and genetic data indicate that the highly conserved Miro GTPase Gem1 is associated with ERMES at steady state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kornmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stroud et al., 2011</xref>). In yeast cells lacking Gem1, mitochondria form a distinct spectrum of abnormal structures, from tubules to clustered spheres, mitochondrial distribution into daughter cells is less efficient than that of wild-type mitochondria, and cells lose mitochondrial DNA at a significantly higher frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frederick et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koshiba et al., 2011</xref>). Gem1, however, is not an essential structural component of ERMES, as ERMES foci are observed in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells. However, in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells, it has been reported that ERMES foci are larger in size and fewer in number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kornmann et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that Gem1 acts as a regulator of ERMES.</p><p>Here, we show that ERMES and Gem1 are spatially and functionally linked to ERMD. Our data suggest a model where ERMES and Gem1 function in ERMD to facilitate the engagement and resolution of ER–mitochondria contacts, respectively. Our data indicate that Gem1 acts as a negative regulator of ER–mitochondria contacts at ERMD sites and is required for the spatial resolution of newly formed mitochondrial tips generated by a division event. We also provide evidence that ERMD positions division sites adjacent to mitochondrial nucleoids to bias their distribution into newly generated tips following division. Thus, we postulate that ERMD evolved to link the distribution of nucleoids and mitochondria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To assess whether ERMES foci are spatially linked to mitochondrial division, we simultaneously imaged fluorescent protein (FP)–tagged ERMES components and mitochondria over time in living yeast cells. To this end, we expressed functional C-terminal GFP fusions of Mdm12, Mdm34, or Mmm1 from their respective endogenous loci and labeled mitochondria using mitochondrial matrix-targeted DsRed (mito-DsRed). We observed a majority of mitochondrial division events associated with Mdm12, Mdm34, or Mmm1-labeled ERMES foci, which subsequent to the division segregate to only one of the two newly generated tips in the mitochondrial network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The fraction of division events associated with ERMES foci (54–60%) is significantly higher than that predicted for a random association (approximately 10%), based on the surface area of mitochondria associated with ERMES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and ‘Materials and methods’). The detection of ERMES foci by fluorescence imaging may underestimate ERMES foci associated with mitochondrial division as we observed a positive correlation between the percentage of mitochondrial divisions associated with a given ERMES subunit and its estimated whole-cell abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huh et al., 2003</xref>). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that non-ERMES–associated mitochondrial division sites exist in cells.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00422.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ERMES marks sites of ER-associated mitochondrial division.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A timelapse series of Mdm34-yEGFP and mito-DsRed.

Examination of differentially FP-tagged Mdm34 and Mmm1 or Mdm12 indicated that all components colocalize at mitochondrial division sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with the finding that each core ERMES subunit is necessary for assembly of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kornmann et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, these two components associated with the same mitochondrial tip generated by division, indicating that the complex remains intact during the division process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, these observations demonstrate that mitochondrial division events are spatially linked to the ERMES complex.</p><p>We assessed the relationship of ERMES to ERMD by imaging cells expressing Mdm34-yEGFP, an ER marker (DsRed-HDEL), and a mitochondrial matrix-targeted blue fluorescent protein (mito-TagBFP). As shown in a representative series of time lapse images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, we observed ERMES foci at interfaces between the ER and mitochondria and subsequently at ER-associated mitochondrial constriction and eventual division events. Consistent with this observation, the yeast mitochondrial division machine, marked by Dnm1-mCherry, was observed adjacent to Mdm34-labeled ERMES foci at mitochondrial division sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Given that ERMES null mutations are epistatic to <italic>DNM1</italic> null mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Youngman et al., 2004</xref>), these observations suggest that ERMES functions early in ERMD at a step distinct from Dnm1 by bridging interactions between the ER and mitochondria.</p><p>The conserved Miro GTPase Gem1 associates with the ERMES complex, potentially as a regulatory subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kornmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stroud et al., 2011</xref>).

Similar to ERMES, Gem1-labeled foci were spatially linked to mitochondrial division sites and segregated to only one tip following division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>To gain insight into the function of Gem1 in ERMD, we characterized the behavior of ERMES and mitochondria in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells. As previously published, we observed that mitochondrial structure in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells is both aberrant and diverse, ranging from tubules to clustered spheres, with both having an increased mitochondrial diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frederick et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, regardless of the mitochondrial structure type, we observed that ERMES foci in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells were associated with apparent mitochondrial constriction sites, defined as a narrowing and/or resolved separation of the mitochondrial matrix labeled by mito-DsRed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, arrow heads). A vast majority of ERMES-marked mitochondrial constriction sites in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells were stable, typically persisting for the duration of image capture (3–3.5 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). This behavior was in contrast to wild-type cells, where ERMES-marked mitochondrial constriction sites resolved into two spatially separated tips within 15–60 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). These observations indicate that Gem1 function is required for the resolution of mitochondrial constriction sites associated with division and/or in the subsequent segregation of mitochondrial tips generated by division events.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00422.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Gem1 is required for mitochondrial distribution during ER-associated mitochondrial division.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ERMES foci are found at mitochondrial constriction sites in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells.

Under our conditions, expression of Gem1 mutants harboring abrogating mutations in either EF-hand I or II motifs or both rescued all mitochondrial phenotypes in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells to a similar extent as wild-type <italic>GEM1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This observation is consistent with the published work demonstrating that the EF-hand regions play a relatively minor role in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and distribution, with only EF-hand I acting to stabilize Gem1 expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frederick et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koshiba et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, expression of Gem1S19N or Gem1S462N, whose mutations abrogate the GTPase activity of GTPase domains 1 and 2, respectively, failed to fully rescue mitochondrial morphological phenotypes in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells. The Gem1S19N mutation was the least functional, consistent with previously published observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frederick et al., 2004</xref>). Abrogating mutations in the first GTPase domain, such as the Gem1S19N mutation, have been shown to reduce the steady-state localization of Gem1 to ERMES foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kornmann et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the severe phenotypes associated with Gem1S19N underscores the functional importance of Gem1’s localization to ERMES foci. Significantly, we also observed stable ERMES-associated mitochondrial constrictions in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells expressing either Gem1S19N or Gem1S462N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2 fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 2D and 3A,B</xref>). Thus, our structure function analysis of Gem1 indicates that similar features, specifically both Gem1 GTPase domains, are required for Gem1’s roles in both the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and in the resolution of ERMES-marked mitochondrial constriction sites. Thus, the resolution of ERMES-associated mitochondrial constriction sites into segregated mitochondrial tips is a central function of Gem1.</p><p>We addressed whether the stability of ERMES-marked mitochondrial constriction sites is a consequence of defective mitochondrial division in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells by examining the behavior of the division machine, labeled with Dnm1-mCherry, over time. We observed that stable mitochondrial constriction sites in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells (mito-TagBFP) were persistently associated with ER tubules (GFP-HDEL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In addition, Dnm1 puncta localized to these ER-associated mitochondrial constriction sites in a dynamic manner similar to that observed in wild-type cells, associating and dissociating on a 10-s time scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frederick et al., 2004</xref>). These observations indicate that neither ER engagement with nor Dnm1 recruitment to mitochondrial constriction sites is significantly altered in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells, suggesting that mitochondrial division per se is not defective. This conclusion is supported by the observation that in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells lacking Fzo1, an outer mitochondrial membrane dynamin-related protein required for mitochondrial fusion, mitochondria are fragmented, which is a morphology that requires mitochondrial division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frederick et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, taken together, these observations indicate that the stable ERMES-associated mitochondrial constriction sites in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells is a consequence of defective resolution of mitochondrial tips, perhaps as a consequence of altered ER–mitochondria contacts.</p><p>To explore this idea, we analyzed wild-type and <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells using three-dimensional electron tomography to determine whether mitochondrial constriction sites in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells represent division intermediates or fully resolved division events and to examine ER–mitochondria contact sites at higher resolution.

The surface area of individual ER–mitochondria contacts was, on average, smaller in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells as compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, the total ER–mitochondria contact surface was approximately three times greater than that observed for wild-type mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These findings are consistent with fluorescence data demonstrating that, in comparison to wild-type cells, ER tubules in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells were observed associated in a relatively stable manner with mitochondrial constriction sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In addition, our EM analysis suggests that the reported larger ERMES foci observed by fluorescence imaging in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells may represent multiple unresolved ER–mitochondria contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kornmann et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The average diameter of <italic>gem1</italic>Δ mitochondria, measured along their short axis, was also greater than that of wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), consistent with our fluorescence imaging analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, the average diameter of ER-associated mitochondrial constriction sites in wild-type and <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>), consistent with our light imaging data demonstrating that Dnm1 is still efficiently targeted to mitochondrial constriction sites in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Together, these data suggest that Gem1 functions downstream of ER-associated mitochondrial constriction and division as a negative regulator of ER–mitochondria contacts, which is required for the efficient resolution and spatial distribution of mitochondria following division.</p><p>To further investigate the functional significance of these observations, we explored the idea that ERMD serves to position division sites adjacent to actively segregating mitochondrial nucleoids, which is based on the observation that ERMES is spatially linked to actively replicating mitochondrial nucleoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hobbs et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meeusen and Nunnari, 2003</xref>). To visualize nucleoids, we created a functional FP fusion to the nucleoid component, Yme2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1 fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 1 and 2</xref>), an integral mitochondrial inner membrane protein with homology to exonucleases whose deletion alters nucleoid structure and copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hanekamp and Thorsness, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with the previously published work, we observed that over time a subset of Yme2-GFP–labeled nucleoids persistently localize adjacent to ERMES foci, marked by Mdm34-tdTomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition, ERMES-linked nucleoids were associated with mitochondrial division events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To characterize the behavior of yeast nucleoids at division sites, we simultaneously imaged mitochondria (mito-dsRed) and nucleoids (Yme2-GFP). Quantitative analysis indicated that mitochondrial nucleoids are associated with over 80% of mitochondrial division events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Temporal analysis of Yme2-GFP–labeled nucleoids positioned at future sites of mitochondrial division indicated that they exhibit short-ranged oscillatory movements and often rapidly segregate and recoalesce prior to mitochondrial division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Following mitochondrial division, a majority of Yme2-GFP foci were observed at the ends of both newly generated mitochondrial tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, we also observed division events that resulted in a nucleoid in only one of the newly generated mitochondrial tips, indicating that division and nucleoid segregation are not obligatorily linked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Consistent with a role of ERMES in nucleoid positioning, published data indicate that deletion of core ERMES components disrupts nucleoid structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgess et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Youngman et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, we observed that nucleoids, as labeled by Yme2-GFP, maintained their discrete focal localization in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells, similar to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In addition, similar to ERMES distribution, Yme2-GFP foci were observed associated with stable mitochondrial constrictions in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), consistent with the idea that the spatial resolution of ER–mitochondria contacts following division is fundamentally important for nucleoid distribution. Thus, our findings suggest that ERMD functions to position division sites in proximity to nucleoids to increase the probability of their distribution upon mitochondrial division.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00422.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Nucleoid segregation is linked to mitochondrial division.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Yme2-GFP coaligns with ERMES foci, marked by Mdm34-TdTomato, at mitochondrial division events.

Specifically, our data support a model in which ERMES creates ER–mitochondria contacts along the mitochondrial network that serve to link actively replicating nucleoids to mitochondrial division and the subsequent Gem1-dependent spatial resolution of newly generated mitochondrial tips. Such a mechanism is likely required for efficient mtDNA distribution throughout the cell in addition to nucleoid segregation <italic>per se</italic>, as long-range movement of nucleoids within the organelle is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nunnari et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Okamoto et al., 1998</xref>). In mammalian cells, nucleoids are similarly localized at mitochondrial division sites and mitochondrial tips, suggesting that ERMD also plays this fundamental role in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garrido et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iborra et al., 2004</xref>). In this context, although the Miro GTPase family is highly conserved in eukaryotes, Miro orthologs are not found in organisms that lack mtDNA, such as <italic>Giardia intestinalis</italic> and <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic>, and possess mitochondrial-related mitosomes or hydrogenosomes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vlahou et al., 2011</xref>). This correlation is consistent with a fundamental role of Miro in mtDNA segregation. Also consistent with this view, <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells lose mitochondrial DNA at a significantly higher frequency than wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frederick et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism of mitochondrial division site placement is apparently divergent from that utilized by ancestral bacteria, where division sites are determined in part by a nucleoid occlusion mechanism, which prevents cell division in the vicinity of the bacterial chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu and Errington, 2012</xref>). However, we currently lack an understanding of what drives mitochondrial nucleoid segregation and of the mechanism underlying the spatial coupling of ER–mitochondria contact sites and nucleoids. Thus, alternative mitochondrial-specific mechanisms may exist to coordinate the timing of nucleoid replication and segregation with mitochondrial division.</p><p>In ERMD, mitochondrial constrictions observed at the sites of ER–mitochondria contact, where the ER likely wraps around a mitochondrial tubule, are independent of the mitochondrial division dynamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>). Our data are consistent with the model in which ERMES functions early in ERMD to mediate the biogenesis of this specialized region of ER–mitochondria contact. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the ERMES complex functions to generate the ER tubules associated with constriction and/or to actively produce mitochondrial constriction at the sites of contact. ERMES has also been implicated as a bridge between mitochondria and the actomyosin network and thus may function at division sites to coordinate the recruitment of cytoskeletal and motor proteins, which could generate force required for mitochondrial constriction and/or distribution following division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boldogh et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2003</xref>). Indeed, a recent study suggests that the actin cytoskeleton may be involved in mitochondrial division at ER–mitochondria contacts in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to ERMES, our data indicate that Gem1 functions relatively late in ERMD to promote the physical separation of mitochondrial tips generated by membrane scission. Specifically, our data point to a role for Gem1 post-scission in the negative regulation of ER–mitochondria contacts to facilitate the resolution of mitochondrial tips. Evidence from higher eukaryotes suggests that the Gem1 ortholog, Miro1/2, functions in mitochondrial distribution by connecting mitochondria directly to a kinesin-1 adaptor protein Milton/TRAK to enable the microtubule based transport of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fransson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glater et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang and Schwarz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Misko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Analogously, Gem1 in yeast may also function to negatively regulate ER–mitochondria contacts by facilitating the recruitment of motility factors to mitochondrial tips following division. However, while the Miro GTPase family is remarkably conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vlahou et al., 2011</xref>), the mechanisms of mitochondrial transport are divergent in eukaryotes. In many fungi, including budding yeast, mitochondrial distribution is actin dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hermann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boldogh et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2003</xref>), and in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, Miro is not required for microtubule-dependent mitochondrial transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vlahou et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, alternatively, Gem1 may function in ERMD more directly to regulate the physical link between mitochondria and the ER via ERMES. Consistent with this idea, Gem1 associates with ERMES foci, and, in the absence of Gem1, it has been reported that ERMES forms fewer and larger foci per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kornmann et al., 2011</xref>). This model of Gem1 function is also supported by the observation that mutations in the first GTPase domain of Gem1 abolish both Gem1’s function in ERMD and its association with ERMES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frederick et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kornmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koshiba et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, in mammalian cells, Miro1 is found at ER–mitochondria contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kornmann et al., 2011</xref>). In this context, the defect in mitochondrial segregation observed in <italic>gem1</italic>Δ cells at ER-associated mitochondrial constriction sites could result from the ER physically hindering mitochondrial motility. In this case, it is also possible that the mitochondrial motility defects in higher eukaryotes caused by Miro1/2 dysfunction are a secondary consequence of enhanced ER–mitochondria contacts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>All strains were constructed in either the W303 (<italic>ade2–1</italic>; <italic>leu2–3</italic>; <italic>his3–11</italic>, <italic>15</italic>; <italic>trp1–1</italic>; <italic>ura3–1</italic>; <italic>can1–100</italic>) or BY4741 (<italic>his3</italic>Δ1; <italic>leu2</italic>Δ0; <italic>met15</italic>Δ0; <italic>ura3</italic>Δ0) genetic background, both of which have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rothstein, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brachmann et al., 1998</xref>).

Z-stacks were taken at 0.4-μm increments over approximately 6 μm of the cell every 15 s for 3.5 min. Mitochondrial divisions were identified independently of ERMES foci by hiding the GFP channel and retrospectively analyzed for their association with ERMES. An ERMES focus was considered linked to mitochondrial division if its center was within 300 nm of the division site, which is 1.5 times the average radius of an ERMES focus (205 ± 45 nm, n = 68). To calculate the ERMES to mitochondrial surface area ratio, Z-series of cells expressing Mdm34-yEGFP and mitoDsRed were collected at 0.4-μm increments. Separate channels for each marker were manually threshold in ImageJ, and the ‘Analyze Particles’ function was used to measure areas for each in all focal planes collected. Ratios were calculated for each plane and were averaged. This ratio (4.5%) was used to calculate the percentage of ERMES foci associated with mitochondrial divisions due to random chance (approximately 10%) based on the requirement that mitochondrial division occurred less than 300 nm from the center of an ERMES focus.</p><p>For three-color fluorescence imaging in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1C-E and 2C</xref>, cells were imaged on DeltaVision-Real Time microscope (IX70 DeltaVision; Olympus) using a 60× 1.4 NA objective lens (Olympus) and a 100 W mercury lamp (Applied Precision).

Individual tomograms were reconstructed using the IMOD package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kremer et al, 1996</xref>), and its newest viewer 3DMOD 4.0.11 and serial tomograms were merged together in X-, Y-, and Z-direction to obtain a large continuous volume. The 3DMOD modeling software was used for the assignment of the outer leaflet of organelle membrane contours, and IMODINFO was used to obtain surface area and volume data of contour models. Images were further enhanced and manipulated in Adobe Photoshop 7. We sorted, analyzed, and graphed the data using Microsoft Excel for Mac 2008 and Prism 5 for Mac OS X. Movies were made in 3DMOD, assembled in QuickTime Pro 7.5, and movie size was reduced to less than 10 MB by saving movies as HD 720p in QuickTime.

Your article was found to be rigorous and very interesting after evaluation by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor, Richard Youle, and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) The role of Gem1 for the inheritance of mt-DNA remains less developed, especially as division and nucleoid segregation appear not to be linked obligatorily. Does a deletion of GEM1 affect the distribution of YME2-GFP?</p><p>2) It has been reported that the GTPase domain and the first calcium binding domain of Gem1 might be differentially involved in ERMES foci localization and lipid exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kornmann et al., 2011</xref>). It would be important to determine if either of these Gem1 mutations would rescue the unresolved ERMES complex phenotypes of <italic>Δgem1</italic> deletion strains.</p><p>3) In panels such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the authors describe ERMES at sites of ERMD. However, it is not clear that these mitochondria have not already divided by time 0, and are merely tethered to one another, and what we are seeing is the break of the tether. This might be more obvious if the individual channels for the 0 time point could be reviewed. This seems to be shown better in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, but the putative division events are hard to see. Perhaps the authors could do an enlargement for panel C as they did in panel A?</p><p>4) As above, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> one has trouble establishing whether these sites are mitochondrial constriction sites vs separate mitochondria with an ER tubule between them. Perhaps a series of enlargements below would help to clarify this.</p><p>5) It was shown previously that ERMES foci are larger in size and fewer in number in <italic>Δgem1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kornmann et al., 2011</xref>). However, the authors find that <italic>Δgem1</italic> mutants have more ER-mitochondrial contact sites but the surface area of individual contacts is smaller (Figure 5C). Are some of the greater number of ER-mitochondrial contact sites in <italic>Δgem1</italic> mutants lacking in ERMES complexes? And are the large contact areas in <italic>Δgem1</italic> mutants lacking ERMES proteins from most of the interface? Or is there a discrepancy between this aspect of Kornmann’s paper and the current work? Some comment on this in the manuscript seems warranted.</p><p>6) During cell division in bacteria, constriction sites are often formed at a distal position relative to nucleoids. This is thought to prevent shedding of the genome and facilitate DNA segregation to daughter cells.

We observed that like ERMES, Yme2-GFP is predominantly localized to mitochondrial constrictions, consistent with our proposed role of ERMD in nucleoid distribution.</p><p><italic>2) It has been reported that the GTPase domain and the first calcium binding domain of Gem1 might be differentially involved in ERMES foci localization and lipid exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kornmann et al. 2011</xref>).

These data are presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>. Our structure function analysis of Gem1 indicates that similar features, specifically both Gem1 GTPase domains, are required for Gem1’s roles in both the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and in the resolution of ERMES-marked mitochondrial constriction sites into segregated mitochondrial tips. Thus, the resolution of ERMES-associated mitochondrial constriction is a central function of Gem1.</p><p><italic>3) In panels such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the authors describe ERMES at sites of ERMD.

Perhaps a series of enlargements below would help to clarify this</italic>.</p><p>To address points 3 and 4, we constructed plots of pixel intensity vs distance (line-scan) of the mito-DsRed fluorescence signal of ERMES-associated mitochondrial division and constriction sites in wild-type and <italic>Δgem1</italic> cells in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1A and 2B</xref>, respectively. These line scans have been placed below each of the corresponding image frames and clearly show that: A) For the wild-type event, mitochondria have not already divided by time 0; B) The “constrictions” we observe in <italic>Δgem1</italic> cells are stable, i.e., do not segregate, and, when compared to wild type division sites, are consistent with mitochondria that have already divided. However, fluorescence images lack sufficient resolution to make this conclusion. These line scans were performed for all of the examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and validated the quantification shown in part C of this figure supplement, but were not included.</p><p><italic>5) It was shown previously that ERMES foci are larger in size and fewer in number in</italic> Δgem1 <italic>mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kornmann et al., 2011</xref>). However, the authors find that</italic> Δgem1 <italic>mutants have more ER-mitochondrial contact sites but the surface area of individual contacts is smaller (Figure 5). Are some of the greater number of ER-mitochondrial contact sites in</italic> Δgem1 <italic>mutants lacking in ERMES complexes? And are the large contact areas in</italic> Δgem1 <italic>mutants lacking ERMES proteins from most of the interface? Or is there a discrepancy between this aspect of Kornmann’s paper and the current work? Some comment on this in the manuscript seems warranted</italic>.</p><p>The differences in ERMES foci reported by Kornmann et al. were not large. We did not extensively analyze the difference in ERMES foci in wild type and <italic>Δgem1</italic> cells, but the trend we observed was consistent with that previously reported. Probing the differences in ERMES in <italic>Δgem1</italic> cells will require the development of more dynamic and more quantitative assays that are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>The increased number of smaller contacts may be below detection by fluorescence microscopy, but we cannot exclude the possibility that some ER-mitochondria contacts are ERMES-independent. Indeed, we anticipate that there are many different molecular types of ER-mitochondria contacts in cells and these may be modulated in response to loss of Gem1. In addition, we observed that the distance between any pair of ER-mitochondria contacts is decreased in <italic>Δgem1</italic> cells. This distance approaches diffraction-limited resolution of fluorescence microscopy, raising the possibility that the brighter ERMES foci observed by fluorescence microscopy in <italic>Δgem1</italic> cells could represent multiple unresolved ER-mitochondria contacts.</p><p><italic>6) During cell division in bacteria, constriction sites are often formed at a distal position relative to nucleoids. This is thought to prevent shedding of the genome and facilitate DNA segregation to daughter cells. As the authors argue differently for the inheritance of mt-DNA, some comments on the differences might be helpful</italic>.</p><p>We have included a short paragraph in the Discussion about the potential divergence of division site placement mechanisms in mitochondria and bacteria.</p></body></sub-article></article>
