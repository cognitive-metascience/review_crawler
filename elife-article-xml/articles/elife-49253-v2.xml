neurological diseases. For particular applications, genetically-encoded HVACC blockers may enable channel inhibition with greater tissue-specificity and versatility than is achievable with small molecules. Here, we engineered a genetically-encoded HVACC inhibitor by first isolating an immunized llama nanobody (nb.F3) that binds auxiliary HVACC Ca<sub>V</sub>β subunits. Nb.F3 by itself is functionally inert, providing a convenient vehicle to target active moieties to Ca<sub>V</sub>β-associated channels. Nb.F3 fused to the catalytic HECT domain of Nedd4L (Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, ablated currents from diverse HVACCs reconstituted in HEK293 cells, and from endogenous Ca<sub>V</sub>1/Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channels in mammalian cardiomyocytes, dorsal root ganglion neurons, and pancreatic β cells. In cardiomyocytes, Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator redistributed Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels from dyads to Rab-7-positive late endosomes. This work introduces Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator as a potent genetically-encoded HVACC inhibitor, and describes a general approach that can be broadly adapted to generate versatile modulators for macro-molecular membrane protein complexes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>calcium channel</kwd><kwd>nanobody</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>Nedd4</kwd><kwd>calcium channel beta</kwd><kwd>cavia porcellus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL142111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colecraft</surname><given-names>Henry M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM107585</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colecraft</surname><given-names>Henry M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 DK118866</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morgenstern</surname><given-names>Travis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10RR027050</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morgenstern</surname><given-names>Travis</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Jinseo</given-names></name><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Qing R</given-names></name><name><surname>Colecraft</surname><given-names>Henry M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA013696</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morgenstern</surname><given-names>Travis</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Jinseo</given-names></name><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Qing R</given-names></name><name><surname>Colecraft</surname><given-names>Henry M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel engineered protein that uncouples electrical signals from downstream biological responses in excitable cells provides a unique investigative tool with potential therapeutic applications.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inhibition of high-voltage-activated calcium channels (HVACCs) is an important prevailing or potential therapy for diverse cardiovascular (hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, cerebral vasospasm) and neurological diseases (epilepsy, chronic pain, Parkinson’s disease) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zamponi et al., 2015</xref>). Small molecule HVACC inhibitors include Ca<sub>V</sub>1 blockers (dihydropyridines, benzothiazepenes phenylalkylamines) and venom peptides that target Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 (<italic>ω</italic>-agatoxin), Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 (<italic>ω</italic>-conotoxin), and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.3 (SNX-482) channels. When introduced into an organism, small-molecule HVACC blockers are typically widely distributed leading to off-target effects that can narrow the therapeutic window and, thereby, adversely impact therapy. Genetically-encoded HVACC inhibitors can circumvent off-target effects because they can be selectively expressed in target tissues or cells; thus, they may be useful alternatives or complements to small molecule therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murata et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>There are seven distinct HVACCs (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 - Ca<sub>V</sub>1.4; Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 - Ca<sub>V</sub>2.3) which exist in cells as multi-subunit complexes comprising pore-forming α<sub>1</sub>-subunits assembled with auxiliary proteins which include β, α<sub>2</sub>-δ, and γ subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zamponi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buraei and Yang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dolphin, 2012</xref>). HVACCs are named according to the identity of the component α<sub>1</sub> subunit (α<sub>1A</sub>-α<sub>1F</sub>; α<sub>1S</sub>) which also contains the voltage sensor, selectivity filter, and channel pore. The various auxiliary subunits typically regulate HVACC trafficking, gating, and modulation, and are recognized as potential targets for developing HVACC-directed therapeutics. For example, gabapentin, which is clinically utilized for treating epilepsy and neuropathic pain, targets HVACC α<sub>2</sub>-δ subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gee et al., 1996</xref>). Based on the presumption that the association of α<sub>1</sub> with β is obligatory for the formation of surface-targeted functional HVACCs as indicated by heterologous expression experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buraei and Yang, 2010</xref>), disruption of the α<sub>1</sub>-β interaction has been long pursued as a strategy to develop HVACC inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Young et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Findeisen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khanna et al., 2019</xref>). To this end, over-expression of peptides derived from the α<sub>1</sub>-interaction domain (AID) which contains the amino acid sequence responsible for high-affinity α<sub>1</sub>-β association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pragnell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Van Petegem et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Opatowsky et al., 2003</xref>), has been utilized by several groups as putative genetically-encoded HVACC inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Findeisen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). However, the efficacy of this approach in vivo may be limited as recent data suggests that in some adult tissue the α<sub>1</sub>-β interaction is not absolutely essential for surface trafficking of HVACCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meissner et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Rad/Rem/Rem2/Gem/Kir (RGK) proteins are endogenous small Ras-like G-proteins that profoundly inhibit all HVACCs when over-expressed in either heterologous cells or native tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Béguin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Finlin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). They form ternary complexes with HVACCs via binding to constituent β subunits and inhibit currents via multiple mechanisms including removal of surface channels and impairing gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang and Colecraft, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). Despite their efficacy, utility of RGKs as genetically-encoded HVACC inhibitors is confounded by potential off-target effects since they interact with and regulate other binding partners such as cytoskeletal proteins, 14-3-3, calmodulin, and CaM kinase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang and Colecraft, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Correll et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Royer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Béguin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ward et al., 2004</xref>). A critical unmet need is the development of genetically-encoded HVACC inhibitors that possess the high efficacy of RGKs but lack the problematic interactions with other signaling proteins. Here, we achieve this by fusing the homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus (HECT) catalytic domain of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, neural precursor cell developmentally down-regulated protein 4 (Nedd4-2 or hereafter referred to as Nedd4L), to a Ca<sub>V</sub>β-targeted nanobody. The resulting construct, termed Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator, eliminated diverse HVACCs both in both reconstituted systems and native excitable cells, providing a unique new tool for probing Ca<sub>V</sub>1/Ca<sub>V</sub>2 signaling and regulation in vivo, and potential development into a therapeutic.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Isolation and characterization of Ca<sub>V</sub>β-targeted nanobodies</title><p>We sought to develop a nanobody targeted to Ca<sub>V</sub>βs that would be incorporated into Ca<sub>V</sub> channel complexes but be functionally silent, to serve as a vehicle to potentially address distinct enzymatic moieties or sensors to endogenous channels.

A tripartite construct consisting of individual nanobodies fused to CFP and the C1 domain of PKCγ was cloned into a CMV expression vector and transiently co-transfected with YFP-tagged Ca<sub>V</sub>βs into HEK293 cells. After pilot experiments, we chose one nanobody clone, nb.F3, for in-depth characterization and development. Both nb.F3-CFP-C1 and YFP-β<sub>1</sub> were uniformly expressed in the cytosol of transfected HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Application of 1 μM phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PdBu) led to the rapid and dramatic redistribution of nb.F3-CFP-C1 from the cytosol to the plasma and nuclear membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Reassuringly, YFP-β<sub>1</sub> concomitantly redistributed to the plasma and nuclear membranes, providing a convenient visual confirmation that it associates with nb.F3 inside cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Similar experiments conducted with the other Ca<sub>V</sub>βs (β<sub>2</sub>-β<sub>4</sub>) showed that they all bind with nb.F3-CFP-C1 in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating the nanobody interacts with an epitope conserved among Ca<sub>V</sub>βs.

Ca<sub>V</sub>α<sub>1C</sub> in uninfected cardiomyocytes presented with a characteristic striated punctate distribution pattern that co-localized with that of ryanodine (RyR2) receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), reflecting their well-known predominant localization at dyadic junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scriven et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bers, 2002</xref>). A similar distribution pattern for α<sub>1C</sub> was observed in cardiomyocytes expressing nb.F3-Nedd4L[C942S], consistent with the lack of effect of this protein on <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca,L</sub>. In cardiomyocytes expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator, the signal intensity for punctate α<sub>1C</sub> staining was unchanged from control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting no impact of the presumed increase in ubiquitination on the stability of the protein. However, there was a redistribution of α<sub>1C</sub> from dyadic junctions, as reported by a dramatic loss of co-localization between α<sub>1C</sub> and RyR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Rather, the punctate α<sub>1C</sub> signals in Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator-expressing cardiomyocytes coincided with Rab7, but not Rab5 or LAMP1, immunofluorescence signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the mechanism of Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator inhibition of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca,L</sub> is redistribution of α<sub>1C</sub> from dyadic junctions to intracellular compartments, specifically Rab7-positive late endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rink et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Cardiomyocytes expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator also showed no difference in total Ca<sub>V</sub>β<sub>2</sub> levels as compared to either uninfected or nb.F3-Nedd4L[C942S]-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator-mediated redistribution of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 in cardiomyocytes cannot be explained as simply due to an absence of Ca<sub>V</sub>β. An intriguing possibility was that though Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator is specifically targeted to Ca<sub>V</sub>β in channel complexes, it is also able to directly catalyze ubiquitination of α<sub>1</sub> subunits within the macro-molecular complex. Indeed, in pulldown experiments of recombinant Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels, Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator substantially increased ubiquitination of both α<sub>1C</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e,f</xref>) and Ca<sub>V</sub>β<sub>1b</sub> subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). Nevertheless, the overall levels of α<sub>1C</sub> expression was unchanged with Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator despite the increased ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that direct ubiquitination of α<sub>1C</sub> by Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator may underlie the redistribution of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels from dyads to Rab7-positive late endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlation in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and pancreatic β cells</title><p>We next tested the efficacy of Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator to suppress HVACCs in murine dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons which were of interest because they express multiple Ca<sub>V</sub>1/Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channel types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murali et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCallum et al., 2011</xref>), and also play a key role in the processing of noxious signals including pain and itch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2016</xref>).

Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator combines the exquisite specificity of a Ca<sub>V</sub>β-targeted nanobody and the powerfully consequential catalytic activity of an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We discuss four distinct aspects of this work, based on viewing Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator from different perspectives; 1) as a unique tool to selectively erase HVACCs in cells, 2) as a method to probe mechanisms of HVACC regulation and trafficking, 3) as a potential therapeutic, and 4) as a prototype engineered protein that enables probing new dimensions of macro-molecular membrane protein signaling.</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a universal second messenger critical to the biology of virtually all cells. In excitable cells, both LVACCs and HVACCs transduce electrical signals encoded in action potentials into changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> that then drive many biological responses. In cells expressing both classes of channels, the physiological effects mediated specifically through LVACCs versus HVACCs in vivo can be difficult to decipher. Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator now presents as a tool that can be deployed in target cells to virtually erase all HVACCs while leaving LVACC actions intact. The closest existing proteins that can similarly eliminate HVACCs are RGK GTPases which are capable of potently inhibiting Ca<sub>V</sub>1/Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channels when over-expressed in target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Puckerin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bannister et al., 2008</xref>). However, a distinct disadvantage of RGKs is their propensity for off-target effects due to their known interactions with, and regulation of, cytoskeletal proteins and other signaling molecules including 14-3-3, calmodulin, and CaM kinase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang and Colecraft, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Correll et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Royer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Béguin et al., 2005</xref>). Over the last two decades, several groups have sought to disrupt the α<sub>1</sub>-Ca<sub>V</sub>β interaction with either small molecules or by over-expressing the AID peptide as a Ca<sub>V</sub>β sponge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Findeisen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khanna et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). While this approach has shown some efficacy in certain instances, the potency of HVACC inhibition falls well short of that achieved here with Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator. Indeed, over-expressing the AID peptide in adult cardiac myocytes is not effective in inhibiting Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2019</xref>), because in this context α<sub>1C</sub> binding to Ca<sub>V</sub>β is not absolutely required for channel trafficking to the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meissner et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, the ability of Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator to essentially eradicate <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca,L</sub> in adult cardiomyocytes indicates that under normal physiological conditions essentially all α<sub>1C</sub> subunits are associated with a Ca<sub>V</sub>β in ventricular heart cells.</p><p>Ca<sub>V</sub>1/Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channels and other surface membrane proteins spend a significant portion of their life cycles in intracellular compartments reflecting their biogenesis, recycling, and ultimate destruction. The signals regulating HVACC degradation and trafficking among compartments are arcane and poorly understood, but likely prominently involve post-translational modifications of channel subunits. Here, we show that targeted ubiquitination of α<sub>1C</sub>/β<sub>2</sub> complexes in cardiomyocytes with Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator specifically arrests Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels in Rab7-positive late endosomes. Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator possesses the catalytic HECT domain of Nedd4L which is known to principally catalyze the addition of K63-linkage polyubiquitin chains to target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim and Huibregtse, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scheffner and Kumar, 2014</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that K63-ubiquitin chains on α<sub>1C</sub>/β<sub>2</sub> subunits may be a key signal directing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels to late endosomes. We further found that targeted ubiquitination of HVACC α<sub>1</sub> subunits with Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator did not lead to their enhanced degradation either in heterologous cells or cardiomyocytes. By contrast, using a GFP nanobody to target the Nedd4L HECT domain to YFP-tagged KCNQ1, a known substrate of endogenous Nedd4L, resulted in reduced expression of this K<sup>+</sup> channel pore-forming α<sub>1</sub> subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kanner et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, the impact of Nedd4L HECT domain on the stability of membrane proteins is likely substrate-dependent. We speculate that arming nb.F3 with the catalytic domains of other types of E3 ligases that catalyze formation of different polyubiquitin chains will elucidate the precise signals dictating Ca<sub>V</sub>1/Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channel degradation and trafficking among distinct compartments. Beyond ubiquitination, the approach could also be potentially used to elucidate functional consequences and mechanisms of other post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation/dephosphorylation on Ca<sub>V</sub>1/Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channels, as well as to localize sensors that report on signals within HVACC nano-domains in live cells.</p><p>Blocking the activity of specific HVACCs with small molecules is a prevailing or potential therapy for many cardiovascular and neurological diseases including; pain, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, epilepsy, and Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zamponi, 2016</xref>). A limitation of small molecule or toxin blockers for HVACCs is the propensity for off-target effects due to their inevitable widespread distribution when administered to a patient. In some circumstances such off-target effects may limit the therapeutic window sufficiently to adversely affect treatment efficacy. Genetically-encoded HVACC inhibitors have great potential to be useful therapeutics with the advantage that their expression can be restricted to target tissues/cell types, or even to spatially discrete channels within single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makarewich et al., 2012</xref>). Given its potency in silencing HVACC activity, Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator could be a lead molecule for future development into a gene therapy for particular applications where a genetically-encoded HVACC inhibitor is warranted. For this purpose, it may be desirable to generate Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator versions whose time course and extent of action could be tuned by either a small molecule or light. Indeed, this is a focus of ongoing work.</p><p>Finally, an exciting prospect is the potential of Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator as a prototype that can be further developed to engineer proteins that regulate Ca<sub>V</sub>1/Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channel complexes with new dimensions of specificity. For example, a prevailing idea is that Ca<sub>V</sub>1/Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channels of a particular type (e.g. Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels in cardiomyocytes) may yet form discrete signaling units with different functional outputs in single cells based on their incorporation into divergent macro-molecular complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shaw and Colecraft, 2013</xref>). There are tantalizing hints that different Ca<sub>V</sub>β isoforms could be a node of signal diversification by promoting formation of molecularly distinct HVACC macro-molecular complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McEnery et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brice and Dolphin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campiglio and Flucher, 2015</xref>). Hence, the ability to inhibit specific Ca<sub>V</sub> channel macro-molecular complexes based on the identity of the constituent Ca<sub>V</sub>β is biologically important, yet not rigorously addressable with conventional knockout/knockdown approaches. However, this capability may be readily achieved with Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlators directed towards particular Ca<sub>V</sub>β isoforms. A challenge to realize this possibility is the development of Ca<sub>V</sub>β isoform-specific nanobodies which should be feasible given that there is sequence divergence among Ca<sub>V</sub>βs outside the conserved <italic>src</italic> homology 3 (SH3) and guanylate kinase (GK) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buraei and Yang, 2010</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A potent voltage-gated calcium channel inhibitor engineered from a nanobody targeted to auxiliary Ca<sub>V</sub>β subunits&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Mark T Nelson as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kurt Beam (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Morgenstern et al. describe the development of a genetically encoded, nanobody-based system that inhibits the activity of high-voltage-activated calcium channels (Ca<sub>V</sub>1/Ca<sub>V</sub>2) without affecting the activity of low-voltage-activated calcium channels. To accomplish this, they fused a nanobody isolated from an antibody raised against Ca<sub>V</sub>β subunits (β1-4)-which was functionally inert alone-to the catalytic domain of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Nedd4L. They then showed that this fusion protein, termed Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator, was capable of completing eliminating Ca<sub>V</sub>1/Ca<sub>V</sub>2 currents of reconstituted channel complexes in HEK cells and endogenous channels in cardiomyocytes, dorsal root ganglion neurons and pancreatic β-cells. They further demonstrated that Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator produced its inhibitory effects on Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels by promoting their ubiquitination-dependent accumulation in Rab-7-positive late endosomes without promoting ubiquitin-dependent degradation of channel subunits. Further development of this system could lead to selective targeting of specific cell types or channels with different subunit composition. Overall, this elegantly conceived study makes excellent use of appropriate experimental approaches to convincingly demonstrate the operation and potential adaptability of their system.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is difficult to make sense of results presented in Figure 3B and C without more stage-setting. Specifically, the absence of an effect of nb.F3-Nedd4L on Ca<sub>V</sub>β subunit expression runs counter to the expectation that Nedd4L, given its function as a ubiquitin ligase (and the fact that it binds directly to Ca<sub>V</sub>β), might cause Ca<sub>V</sub>β degradation. This becomes clear in subsequent Results sections, but it would be helpful to provide more context by setting up these earlier experiments as a test of whether Nedd4L acts broadly through degradation or via some other mechanism. The absence of an effect of nb.F3-Nedd4L on Ca<sub>V</sub>β subunit expression would then support the sub-conclusion that nb.F3-Nedd4L acts through a mechanism independent of ubiquitin-dependent degradation. It may be a minor point, but there's no good reason to be coy about the mechanism if doing so might leave some readers scratching their heads.</p><p>2) A cartoon showing the overall mechanism of action of Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlation would be helpful.</p><p>3) Interestingly, in addition to localizing to the plasma membrane, β1 and β3 subunits, but not β2 or β4 subunits, also showed substantial accumulation in nuclear membranes. Do the authors have any thoughts on what causes this differential distribution and how it might be exploited in the context of their system?</p><p>4) Specific concerns about Figure 5. The text states that the data in Figure 5 show that the infection of cardiomyocytes with F3-Nedd4L causes the ubiquitination of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Ca<sub>V</sub>ß (I agree) and causes the channel complex to re-locate away from dyads and to become associated with Rab7. The latter appears unconvincing: the co-localization with RyR2 in the control myocytes is not robust (Figure 5C) and the distribution pattern of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 in the F3-Nedd4L infected cells is very different in Figure 5C (a scattered pattern, which is supposed to show movement away from dyads) and in Figure 5D (concentrated near the sides of the myocyte, which is supposed to show association with Rab7). These imaging data should be removed.</p><p>5) The data support the notion that the nanobody interacts with an epitope conserved among Ca<sub>V</sub>βs, thus allowing for a single construct with pan-Ca<sub>V</sub> β binding. This is a nice feature for the first pass of experiments but much of the downstream utility/promise for the approach would require isoform specific nanobody development. While this is obviously theoretically possible, its notable that despite using two Ca<sub>v</sub> β isoforms for nanobody production, the best performing hit is nonselective. The authors could do better in pointing out this area of future optimization for the reader.</p><p>6) The results are presented in a way that mostly ignores complexities of likely importance. In particular, if this technique is to be used either therapeutically or as an investigative tool, one would want to know something about the time course of the effect and about whether it would be possible to regulate the extent of action of the nanobody complex. It would be a major undertaking to obtain such information. Nonetheless, it would useful to discuss these potential complications.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49253.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is difficult to make sense of results presented in Figure 3B and C without more stage-setting.

In the original manuscript, we prefaced the results presented in Figure 3 with a reference to our previous work which demonstrated that targeting the catalytic domain of the E3 ligase CHIP to YFP-tagged potassium or calcium channels using a GFP-nanobody selectively reduced their surface density without promoting degradation. In response to the reviewer’s concern we have changed the order of presentation in Figure 3 to better set the stage to communicate the results. Principally, we now present our examination of the impact of Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator on Ca<sub>V</sub>β expression first (original Figure 3A-C is now swapped with Figure 3D-F in the revised manuscript) and have added the following sentence:</p><p>“Given the classical role of E3 ubiquitin ligases in mediating degradation of target proteins, we first assessed if nb.F3-Nedd4L affected total Ca<sub>V</sub>β expression (Figure 3A, B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A cartoon showing the overall mechanism of action of Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlation would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have included such a cartoon in Figure 5H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Interestingly, in addition to localizing to the plasma membrane, β1 and β3 subunits, but not β2 or β4 subunits, also showed substantial accumulation in nuclear membranes. Do the authors have any thoughts on what causes this differential distribution and how it might be exploited in the context of their system?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that differential targeting of Ca<sub>V</sub>β isoforms to distinct sub-cellular compartments is interesting. However, we wish to emphasize that these are exemplar images obtained from overexpressing Ca<sub>V</sub>βs in a heterologous system. While the approach was sufficient for us to confirm binding of nanobodies to Ca<sub>V</sub>βs inside cells, we believe it is prudent to not over-interpret the potential basis or functional relevance of the differential Ca<sub>V</sub>β distribution from these data. While Ca<sub>V</sub>β subunits have been reported to have differential distributions and binding partners, that is not the focus of our current work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Specific concerns about Figure 5.

These imaging data should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and have worked to make the data presented in Figure 5 clearer and more compelling. We have included magnifications of each image using a high-zoom box, that more clearly conveys the differential co-localization of α<sub>1C</sub>/RyR2 and α<sub>1C</sub>/Rab7 under the different conditions. This change has been described in the legend to Figure 5. Together with the quantitative Pearson’s correlation coefficient analyses, we believe these images affirm our finding that Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator predominantly directs Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 to Rab7-positive late endosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The data support the notion that the nanobody interacts with an epitope conserved among Ca<sub>V</sub>βs, thus allowing for a single construct with pan-Ca<sub>V</sub> β binding.

The authors could do better in pointing out this area of future optimization for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that development of isoform-specific nanobodies would be important to realize the full potential of this approach. From our llama immunization we have obtained a number of nanobodies and are systematically working our way through to find potential isoform-specific variants. This is ongoing work that is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. We have added the following sentence to address this important future direction:</p><p>“However, this capability may be readily achieved with Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlators directed towards particular Ca<sub>V</sub>β isoforms. A challenge to realize this possibility is the development of Ca<sub>V</sub>β isoform-specific nanobodies which should be feasible given that there is sequence divergence among Ca<sub>V</sub>βs outside the conserved src homology 3 (SH3) and guanylate kinase (GK) domains.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The results are presented in a way that mostly ignores complexities of likely importance. In particular, if this technique is to be used either therapeutically or as an investigative tool, one would want to know something about the time course of the effect and about whether it would be possible to regulate the extent of action of the nanobody complex. It would be a major undertaking to obtain such information. Nonetheless, it would useful to discuss these potential complications.</p></disp-quote><p>We concur. We have integrated these points into our Discussion:</p><p>“For this purpose, it may be desirable to generate Ca<sub>V</sub>-aβlator versions whose time course and extent of action could be tuned by either a small molecule or light. Indeed, this is a focus of our ongoing work.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
