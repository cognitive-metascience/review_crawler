assembly by cleaving Nedd8 from cullins. Free CSN is autoinhibited, and it remains unclear how it becomes activated. We combine structural and kinetic analyses to identify mechanisms that contribute to CSN activation and Nedd8 deconjugation. Both CSN and neddylated substrate undergo large conformational changes upon binding, with important roles played by the N-terminal domains of Csn2 and Csn4 and the RING domain of Rbx1 in enabling formation of a high affinity, fully active complex. The RING domain is crucial for deneddylation, and works in part through conformational changes involving insert-2 of Csn6. Nedd8 deconjugation and re-engagement of the active site zinc by the autoinhibitory Csn5 glutamate-104 diminish affinity for Cul1/Rbx1 by ~100-fold, resulting in its rapid ejection from the active site. Together, these mechanisms enable a dynamic deneddylation-disassembly cycle that promotes rapid remodeling of the cellular CRL network.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12102.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12102.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12102.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Just like you might clear out the old food in your refrigerator to make room for new groceries, cells constantly break down existing proteins to provide space for new ones. The enzymes that generally carry out the first step of this breakdown process are called ubiquitin ligases and human cells make hundreds of different ones. These ubiquitin ligases are not always active and a large group of them can be switched off by a group of proteins known as the COP9-Signalosome (or CSN for short). To achieve this, CSN recognizes and cuts off a structure called Nedd8 from these ubiquitin ligases. However, CSN itself remains inactive until it finds and binds to ubiquitin ligases that have Nedd8 attached.</p><p>Mosadeghi et al. have now used biophysical techniques to study how purified CSN binds to ubiquitin ligases, removes Nedd8 and then releases the inactivated enzymes. The experiments provided a clearer picture of what the CSN looks like when it binds its targets and revealed which parts of the proteins are involved in the interaction. Furthermore, the data showed that, immediately after Nedd8 is removed from the ubiquitin ligase, CSN quickly switches back into an “off” position that allows it to release the now inactive ubiquitin ligase. This helps to explain how CSN can remove Nedd8 from many ubiquitin ligase molecules in a short period of time.</p><p>Mosadeghi et al. also confirmed these findings in human cells with various versions of CSN that have different levels of activity. A future challenge is to understand exactly how the newly revealed mechanisms actually play out in cells. Also, some components of CSN are present in abnormally large amounts in cancer cells and therefore this knowledge may eventually lead to new ideas about how to treat cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cullin–RING ubiquitin ligases comprise one of the largest families of regulatory enzymes in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009</xref>). With as many as 240 different enzyme complexes, these E3s control a broad array of biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>). CRLs comprise seven distinct cullin–RING cores, each of which interacts with its own dedicated set of adaptor–substrate receptor complexes. Although ubiquitination by CRL enzymes is often regulated by covalent modifications of the substrate that stimulate binding to the substrate receptor, the CRL enzymes themselves are also subject to regulation.</p><p>A key mechanism that controls the activity of all known CRLs is the conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 to a conserved lysine residue in the cullin subunit (e.g. K720 in human Cul1)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Enchev et al., 2015</xref>). The available structural and biochemical data indicate that Nedd8 conjugation (neddylation) stabilizes a profound conformational change in the C-terminal domain of the cullin. It loosens the interaction of the WHB domain with the RING subunit, allowing both of them to sample a greater conformational space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duda et al., 2008</xref>), thereby enhancing the ability of the RING domain to promote ubiquitin transfer to substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Saha and Deshaies, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yamoah et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In addition to direct effects on ubiquitin ligase activity, Nedd8 also protects Skp1/Cul1/F-box (SCF) complexes from the substrate receptor exchange factor (SREF) Cand1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pierce et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zemla et al., 2013</xref>). Cand1 binds unmodified SCF complexes and promotes rapid dissociation of the F-box protein (FBP)/Skp1 substrate receptor–adaptor module from the Cul1/Rbx1 core. Cand1 can subsequently be dissociated from Cul1 by a different FBP/Skp1 complex, and as a result Cand1 functions as an SREF that accelerates the rate at which Cul1/Rbx1 comes to equilibrium with different FBP/Skp1 substrate receptor–adaptor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pierce et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, the SREF activity of Cand1 is tightly restricted by Nedd8. Cand1 is not able to bind stably to Cul1 and promote dissociation of FBP/Skp1 when Cul1 is conjugated to Nedd8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pierce et al., 2013</xref>). These observations underscore the importance of neddylation not only for controlling the enzymatic activity of CRLs, but also potentially for controlling the repertoire of assembled CRLs.</p><p>The key role of Nedd8 in CRL biology highlights the importance of the enzymatic pathways that attach and remove Nedd8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Enchev et al., 2015</xref>). Of particular significance is the rate of Nedd8 deconjugation, because it serves as the gateway for the exchange cycle; once Nedd8 is removed, a CRL complex is susceptible to the potent SREF activity of Cand1, and its substrate receptor can be exchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pierce et al., 2013</xref>). Deconjugation of Nedd8 is mediated by the COP9-signalosome (CSN), which is an eight-subunit Nedd8 isopeptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lyapina et al., 2001</xref>). The enzymatic activity of CSN resides in its Csn5 subunit, which contains a metalloprotease active site referred to as the ‘JAMM’ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cope et al., 2002</xref>). The JAMM domain has the general structure E<sub>76</sub>-Xn-H<sub>138</sub>-X-H<sub>140</sub>-X10-D<sub>151</sub> (the subscripts refer to the sequence position of these residues in human Csn5), wherein the H and D residues coordinate a zinc ion. The fourth zinc-coordination site is occupied by a water molecule that that also forms a hydrogen bond to E76 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambroggio et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tran et al., 2003</xref>). Deneddylation of CRLs by CSN is rapid but can be regulated by CRL substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emberley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enchev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischer et al., 2011</xref>). Structural analysis suggests that a CRL ubiquitination substrate bound to a substrate receptor sterically prevents concurrent binding of CSN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enchev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischer et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests a model wherein a CRL complex has a higher probability of being conjugated to Nedd8 (and therefore of being shielded from Cand1) as long as it is bound to substrate. Upon dissociation of substrate, a race ensues between binding of either a new substrate or CSN. If CSN wins, Nedd8 is removed, paving the way for Cand1 to initiate substrate receptor exchange.</p><p>Recently, a crystal structure of free CSN was determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lingaraju et al., 2014</xref>). A major insight to emerge from the structure was the unexpected finding that Csn5 was present in an autoinhibited state, wherein a glutamate (Csn5-E104) within the ‘insert-1’ (INS1) sequence common to JAMM family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sato et al., 2008</xref>) forms a fourth ligand to the zinc, displacing the catalytic Csn5-E76-bound water molecule and shifting Csn5-E76. Csn5-E104 is found in all Csn5 orthologs, but not in other JAMM proteins, suggesting that this mode of regulation is conserved but unique to CSN. Comparison of the structure of free CSN to the structure of a catalytically-dead mutant CSN bound to Nedd8-conjugated SCF<sup>Skp2</sup> determined by negative stain electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enchev et al., 2012</xref>) implied that binding of substrate to CSN may induce several conformational changes in the latter, including movement of the N-terminal domains (NTD) of Csn2 and Csn4 towards the cullin. The latter movement, in turn, might be further propagated to the Csn5/6 module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lingaraju et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, it is reasonable to expect that during catalysis INS1 moves out of the active site and Csn5-E76 adopts a position similar to that observed in a crystallographic structure of Csn5 in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Echalier et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, if Csn5-E104 is mutated to an alanine, CSN more rapidly cleaves the simple model substrate ubiquitin-rhodamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lingaraju et al., 2014</xref>). This was interpreted to mean that the primary reason for the autoinhibited state is to keep CSN off until it binds a physiologic substrate, which would prevent spurious cleavage of non-cullin Nedd8 conjugates and possibly even ubiquitin conjugates. However, the full extent of the conformational changes required to form an activated complex between CSN and its neddylated substrate, as well as the detailed molecular basis for these changes remain to be established. Therefore, at present, the mechanism of how CSN is switched on and off and the significance of this switching behavior remain unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structural insights from cryo EM and single particle analysis of a CSN-SCF-Nedd8<sup>Skp2/Cks1</sup> complex</title><p>To gain detailed insights into the molecular determinants underlying activation of CSN, we performed cryo electron microscopy (cryo EM) and single particle analysis of CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> (we use the nomenclature CSN<sup>#x</sup> where # refers to subunit number and x to the specific mutation) in complex with neddylated SCF<sup>Skp2/Cks1</sup> (the sample is described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enchev et al., (2012)</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Specifically, this allowed us to describe movements of the N-terminal domains of Csn2 and Csn4, the MPN domains of Csn5 and Csn6. Moreover, in contrast to our previous work, we could locate the RING domain of Rbx1, as well as Nedd8 and the winged-helix B (WHB) domain of Cul1 relative to Csn5. Nevertheless, the present resolution precludes the determination of the exact orientations of the latter domains but notably, the relative positions of the RING, WHB and Nedd8 reported here have not been reported in any structural model of a cullin, and strongly suggest that both the enzyme and substrate undergo significant conformational rearrangements to enable catalysis.</p><p>To obtain the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we initially docked the crystal structure of CSN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lingaraju et al., 2014</xref>) and a model of Cul1-Nedd8/Rbx1/Skp1/Skp2/Cks1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enchev et al., 2012</xref>) as rigid bodies into the electron density map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–E</xref> ). We observed very good matches between the respective map segments and the atomic coordinates for the scaffold subunits Csn1, Csn3, Csn7 and Csn8, the winged-helix domains of Csn2 and Csn4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), and the helical bundle formed by the C-termini of all eight CSN subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>) as well as the expected recovery of secondary structure at this resolution. Similarly, there was a very good overlap between the coordinates of Cul1 (with the exception of helix29 and the WHB domain, see below) and Skp1 and the corresponding electron density segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). However, the local resolution was lower without recovery of secondary structure in the N-terminal domain of Cul1. Moreover, the density of the substrate receptor Skp2/Cks1 was poorly defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>), indicating a potential flexibility in this region. Since the presence of Skp1/Skp2 had modest effects on the affinity and deneddylation activity (see below), we did not interpret this observation further.</p><p>In contrast to the large segments of CSN that were unaltered upon binding substrate, there was nearly no overlap between the EM density map and the N-terminal portions of Csn2 and Csn4, as well as the MPN-domains of Csn5 and Csn6, the RING domain of Rbx1, the WHB domain of Cul1, and Nedd8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). We thus docked these domains individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). A Csn2 N-terminal fragment encompassing the portion between its crystallographically resolved N-terminus (amino acid 30) through to a flexible loop at amino acid 180, was docked as a rigid body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>), positioning it close to the four-helical bundle and helix 24 of Cul1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zheng et al., 2002</xref>). An N-terminal fragment of Csn4, spanning amino acids 1 to 295, which ends in a previously reported hinge loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lingaraju et al., 2014</xref>), was also docked independently as a rigid body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The resulting conformation of Csn4 resembles a crystal form of Csn4 observed in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lingaraju et al., 2014</xref>). The two N-terminal helical repeat motifs of Csn4 make contacts with the winged-helix A domain of Cul1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>, right hand panel, red arrow and green circle). Moreover, these positions of Csn2 and Csn4 delineated a density in the map, which could accommodate the RING domain of Rbx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>, right hand panel, black ellipse), with the RING proximal to two conserved helices between amino acids 160 and 197 of Csn4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>, black arrow) and a loop in Csn2 located between residues 289 and 306.

The local resolution in this region was lower, presumably due to higher flexibility around the catalytic site. Importantly, after docking Csn5, we observed two empty neighboring densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>, right hand panel, circles), which accommodated the two yet undocked protein components – Nedd8 and the WHB domain of Cul1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>). The docking of the latter was enabled by allowing helix 29 and the WHB, amino acids 690 to the C-terminus of Cul1, to move as a rigid body towards Csn5. However, we did not observe an electron density around helix 29 of Cul1, consistent with a structural flexibility in this region. This model places the neddylated WHB domain in close binding proximity to the RING domain, as well as both INS1 and INS2 of Csn5. The hydrophobic patch of Nedd8 is facing INS1, and not the WHB domain, as has been reported for the isolated neddylated C-terminal domain of Cul5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duda et al., 2008</xref>). Similar to the RING domain, we cannot be fully certain about the exact orientations of Nedd8 and the WHB domain at the present resolution. Nevertheless, to further substantiate this docking, we mutagenized conserved charged residues in the INS2 domain of Csn5 as well as the WHB domain, and as expected all of these constructs showed reduced catalytic activity in deneddylation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E, F</xref>).</p><p>We sought orthogonal experimental validation for the molecular docking of the individual subunits and domains in the electron density map by performing cross-linking coupled to mass spectrometric analysis of the cross-linked peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leitner et al., 2014</xref>) following the procedure described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birol et al., (2014)</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary files 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">6</xref>).

However, all of these larger-distance links are connected to the flexibly positioned Skp2 density. Moreover, we further performed similar cross-linking experiments on a number of different CSN-CRL complexes, varying the substrate receptor, the cullin and the neddylation state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary files 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">6</xref>).

To this end, we measured binding of CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> to Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 and observed an unexpectedly low <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of ~10 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), which was confirmed with an independent preparation of CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Thus, neddylation improved affinity of Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 for CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> by ~6-fold, whereas the Csn5-H138A mutation improved affinity for Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 by ~30-fold. The high affinity binding of CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> to substrate was supported by an orthogonal competition experiment in which 100 nM CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> completely blocked deneddylation of 75 nM Cul1-N8/Rbx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We considered the possibility that the Csn5-H138A mutation might enable formation of an aberrant, super-tight enzyme:substrate ([ES]) complex that does not normally form between the wild type proteins. However, as will be described later on, this hypothesis was rejected based on kinetic arguments.</p><p>We next sought to determine whether the large differences we observed in <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> values were due to differences in <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> or <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>. Remarkably, despite a 200-fold difference in <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> for CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> binding to substrate compared to CSN binding to product, the <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> values for formation of these complexes were nearly identical (2.0 x 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup> for CSN–product and 2.2 x 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup> for CSN<sup>5H138A</sup>–substrate; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This suggested that the difference in affinity was driven by a large difference in <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>. To test this hypothesis, we directly measured <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> values for select [ES] and enzyme-product complexes by pre-forming the complex and then adding excess unlabeled Cul1/Rbx1 chase and monitoring the reduction in dansyl fluorescence over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F–I</xref>; for this and a subsequent experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, we used CSN<sup>5E76A/ 5H138A</sup> in one of the assays instead of CSN<sup>5H138A</sup>; the double mutant behaved like CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> in that it bound Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 with the same affinity as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Consistent with the predictions from the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> values, substrate dissociated very slowly from CSN<sup>5E76A,5H138A</sup>, whereas product dissociated ~65-fold faster from CSN.

First, we investigated the roles of the NTDs of Csn2 and Csn4, both of which, upon binding substrate, underwent conformational changes and made contact with Cul1 and the RING domain of Rbx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lingaraju et al., 2014</xref>). To measure the effect of these mutations on binding to Cul1<sup>d</sup>-N8/Rbx1, we combined them with Csn5-H138A to prevent deneddylation. Deletion of the first 269 amino acids of Csn2, observed to interact with Cul1 but not the RING domain of Rbx1, caused a massive loss in binding to substrate (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> &gt; 1300 nM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Thus, the contact we observed between Csn2-NTD and N8-SCF<sup>Skp2/Cks1</sup> was critical to formation of the [ES] complex. By contrast, deletion of the first 297 amino acids NTD of Csn4 (4∆N), a portion which was observed to form interfaces with both Cul1 and the RING domain of Rbx1, had a relatively modest effect; CSN<sup>4∆N,5H138A</sup> bound Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 and Cul1<sup>d</sup>-N8/Rbx1 with <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> values of &gt; 750 nM and 20 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the motions of the Csn2 and Csn4 NTDs, our structural analysis revealed formation of substantial interfaces between CSN and the RING domain of Rbx1. To test the role of the RING domain in complex formation, we generated both Cul1/Rbx1 and Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 in which the RING domain can be deleted by introducing a TEV protease cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dougherty et al., 1989</xref>) after residue 37 of Rbx1 to generate Cul1 (or Cul1<sup>d</sup>)/Rbx1<sup>TEV</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This was essential, because it would not be possible to conjugate Nedd8 to Cul1/Rbx1 expressed as a mutant lacking the RING domain. After conjugating Nedd8 to the purified complex, we treated it with TEV protease to remove the RING domain, yielding Cul1 (or Cul1<sup>d</sup>)-N8/Rbx1<sup>∆RING</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The truncated Cul1/Rbx1<sup>∆RING</sup> was inactive in an ubiquitylation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) but behaved as a monodisperse sample with the expected hydrodynamic radius upon size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Notably, Cul1<sup>d</sup>-N8/Rbx1<sup>∆RING</sup> bound CSN<sup>5E76A,5H138A</sup> and CSN<sup>5E76A</sup> with affinities (12 nM and 13 nM respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>) similar to that observed for binding of wild type Cul1<sup>d</sup>-N8/Rbx1 to CSN<sup>4∆N,5H138A</sup>. Given the similar effects of the Csn4-∆NTD and Rbx1-∆RING mutations on complex formation, we next tested whether their effects arose from loss of the interface that forms between these domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). However, double mutant analysis suggested that the Csn4-∆N and Rbx1-∆RING mutations had largely independent effects on binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The overall picture that emerged from these studies in light of the structural data is that the interaction of Csn2-NTD with neddylated substrate makes a large contribution to binding energy, with modest enhancements independently provided by the Csn4-NTD and Rbx1-RING domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The ‘E-vict’ enables efficient clearance of product from the CSN active site</title><p>The striking difference in the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> for CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> binding to substrate compared to CSN binding to product suggested that a conformational rearrangement of the [ES] complex occurs upon cleavage of the isopeptide bond, resulting in a large increase in the product <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>, thereby preventing the enzyme from becoming product-inhibited. However, we were puzzled by the relatively minor impact of Nedd8 on the affinity of Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 for CSN<sup>5H138A</sup>; whereas substrate bound with <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of 1.6 nM, product binding was only ~6-fold weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Why, then, did CSN bind so much less tightly to product? We reasoned that a key difference between CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> and CSN is the absence of the active site zinc from CSN<sup>5H138A</sup>, which prevents formation of a stable apo-CSN complex in which E104 of the INS1 domain of Csn5 is bound to the active site zinc. If this conjecture is correct, it makes the prediction that CSN<sup>5E104A</sup>, which should also be unable to form stable apo-CSN, should likewise exhibit high affinity for product. This was confirmed: CSN<sup>5E104</sup> bound Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 with a <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of 26 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Furthermore, measurement of <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> values revealed that product dissociated from CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> and CSN<sup>5E104A</sup> about eightfold more slowly than it dissociated from CSN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Based on these observations, we propose the ‘E-vict’ hypothesis, which is described in more detail in the Discussion. The essence of this hypothesis is that, following cleavage of the isopeptide bond and dissociation of Nedd8, INS1 of Csn5 engages the active site zinc. This accelerates the rate of dissociation of deneddylated Cul1/Rbx1, thereby preventing CSN from becoming clogged with product. We note that Csn5-E76 also contributes to the operation of this mechanism, because CSN<sup>5E76A</sup> bound tightly to product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>). We speculate that engagement of the active site zinc by Csn5-E104 forces Csn5-E76 into a configuration that promotes egress of product. Further insights into the exact sequence of events that accelerates product dissociation await high-resolution structures of CSN bound to Cul1/Rbx1 in various states.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Kinetic effects of binding-defective mutations on substrate deneddylation</title><p>We next sought to address the effects of the enzyme and substrate mutations described in the preceding sections on the deneddylation reaction. We previously showed that CSN<sup>2∆N</sup> has severely reduced catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enchev et al., 2012</xref>), which is consistent with the binding data reported here. CSN<sup>4∆N</sup> exhibited a 20-fold defect in substrate cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Meanwhile, the <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> for cleavage of Cul1-N8/Rbx1<sup>∆RING</sup> by CSN was reduced by a staggering ~18,000-fold relative to wild type substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A–B</xref>). Given that the neddylated ∆RING substrate bound to CSN with only modestly reduced affinity, we surmised that the principal defect of this mutant might be its failure either to induce the activating conformational change in CSN, and/or to position accurately the isopeptide bond in the active site. Although we do not have the tools to address the latter point, we queried the former by examining the Csn6-∆INS2 mutation, which partially mimics the effect of substrate binding in that it destabilizes the autoinhibited state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lingaraju et al., 2014</xref>). The Csn6-∆INS2 mutation slightly weakened binding to wild type product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F</xref>) but completely suppressed the modest binding defect of the neddylated ∆RING substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G</xref>) and promoted an ~8-fold increase in its deneddylation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This partial suppression effected by Csn6-∆INS2 suggests that the RING domain contributes to the constellation of conformational changes in CSN that occur upon substrate binding. Note that the CSN<sup>6∆INS2</sup> enzyme nevertheless exhibited a &gt;1000-fold defect towards the Cul1-N8/Rbx1<sup>∆RING</sup> substrate, strongly indicating further functions of the RING domain, which may include a potential role in substrate positioning as well.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12102.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The N-terminal domains of Csn2 and Csn4 and the RING domain of Rbx1 are important for CSN-mediated deneddylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Summary of kinetic parameters for the indicated CSN mutants in multi- or single-turnover deneddylation reactions with Cul1-N8/Rbx1 or Cul1-N8/Rbx1<sup>∆RING</sup> substrate.

Whereas these results imply that deletion of the Csn4-NTD or Rbx1-RING improved affinity of the [ES] complex, our direct binding measurements indicated this was not the case. To understand this apparent paradox, it is essential to consider the kinetic behavior of CSN-mediated deneddylation. The formal definition of <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> for a deneddylation reaction (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>), as stipulated by Briggs and Haldane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Briggs and Haldane, 1925</xref>), is: <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> = (<italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> + <italic>k<sub>cat</sub>)/k<sub>on.</sub></italic>. In the special case of Michaelis-Menten kinetics, which is based on the assumption that <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> is much larger than <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> the expression simplifies to <italic>k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub></italic>, or <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>. However, <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> for CSN (~1.1 sec<sup>-1</sup>) is actually much faster than <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> measured for dissociation of substrate from the CSN<sup>5E76A, 5H138A</sup> mutant (0.017 sec<sup>-1</sup>). The implication of this is that almost every binding event between CSN and substrate results in catalysis, and <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> (200 nM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emberley et al., 2012</xref>) is much larger than <italic>K<sub>d </sub></italic>(1.6 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). But, if <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> is reduced by mutation, the Briggs-Haldane equation predicts that <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> should approach <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>. Indeed, this is exactly what we see for reactions that exhibit reduced <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>, including reactions with mutant CSN<sup>4∆N</sup> enzyme or mutant ∆RING substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In the slowest reaction (cleavage of Cul1/Rbx1<sup>∆RING</sup> by CSN) the <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> (5 nM) is in the same range as the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> with which this substrate bound to CSN<sup>5E76A, H138A</sup> (12 nM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and approaches the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> measured for binding of substrate to CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> (1.6 nM). This provides strong support for our proposal that the CSN<sup>5H138A</sup>–Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 complex is representative of the affinity that develops during normal catalysis.<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>CSN</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>Cul</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mspace width="-2px"/><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="-2px"/><mml:mtext>N</mml:mtext><mml:mn>8</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>Rbx</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>]</mml:mo><mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mo>⇄</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext mathvariant="italic">k</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext mathvariant="italic">k</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>CSN</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>Cul</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mspace width="-2px"/><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="-2px"/><mml:mtext>N</mml:mtext><mml:mn>8</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>Rbx</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>]</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mover><mml:mo>→</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mtext mathvariant="italic">k</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mover><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>CSN</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>Cul</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mtext>N</mml:mtext><mml:mn>8</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>Rbx</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>]</mml:mo><mml:mrow/></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Functional significance of Csn5 INS1 in vitro and in cells</title><p>To understand the significance of the E-vict mechansim to CSN function in vitro and in cells, we measured the <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> for CSN<sup>5E104A</sup> and observed that it is 2.5-fold slower than for CSN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>).

In contrast to wild type <sup>Flag</sup>Csn5, cells expressing <sup>Flag</sup>Csn5-E104A, H138A or E76A did not regain a normal pattern of Cul1 neddylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The same was observed for Cul2, Cul3, Cul4A, and Cul5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistent with reduced CSN activity, as revealed by increased cullin neddylation, Skp2 levels were reduced in cells expressing mutant Csn5 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cope and Deshaies, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wee et al., 2005</xref>).

Indeed, like Csn5-E104A, Csn5-T103I did not restore a normal Cul1 neddylation pattern when expressed in Csn5-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and exhibited low deneddylase activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

Panels A-C shows a schematic view of the structural transitions that occur upon substrate binding, and collectively contribute to efficient catalysis, whereas panel D provides the rate constants for the deneddylation cycle. We tentatively propose the following sequence of events. Free CSN exists in an inactive state in which E104 of Csn5-INS1 forms a fourth ligand to zinc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lingaraju et al., 2014</xref>). In this state the NTDs of both Csn2 and Csn4 are in “open” conformations relative to the cullin substrate, and the MPN domains of Csn5/Csn6 are in a distal position relative to it. Substrate binds this state rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), likely driven by electrostatic interactions between Cul1 and Csn2-NTD. This would account for the similar, extremely fast <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> values that we measured for different combinations of Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 and CSN. Binding of CSN to neddylated substrate results in a series of conformational changes in both complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These include (i) the translocation of the N-terminal helical repeats of Csn2 towards the CTD of Cul1, (ii) the movement of the NTD of Csn4 towards the RING domain of Rbx1 and the WHA domain of Cul1, (iii) the translocation of the MPN domains of Csn5–Csn6 towards the neddylated WHB domain of Cul1, (iv) movement of the WHB domain towards Csn5, (v) the opening of the interface between Nedd8 and the WHB domain, and (vi) the formation of a new interface between Csn5 and Nedd8 probably involving the hydrophobic patch of Nedd8 and neighboring residues, as well as a tenuous interface between the WHB and the Rbx1 RING domain. Furthermore, although not structurally resolved in the present study, movements of Csn5-E76 and E104 towards and away from the zinc atom (vii), respectively, probably similar to the conformation reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Echalier et al., 2013</xref>), must occur to enable catalysis. Finally, a series of other unresolved movements are likely to be germane including (viii) positioning of the extended C-terminus of Nedd8, and the corresponding portion of the WHB domain for catalysis as well as contacts between the INS1 and INS2 domains of Csn5 and the WHB domain of Cul1.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12102.020</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Structural and kinetic models for CSN activation and the CSN enzyme cycle.</title><p>(<bold>A-C</bold>) Proposed conformational changes that precede substrate cleavage.

Deletion of Csn2-NTD virtually eliminated substrate binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1K</xref>), suggesting that movement of this domain (motion i) enables a high affinity interaction between CSN and neddylated CRLs. Meanwhile a mutant lacking Csn4-NTD, CSN<sup>4∆N,5H138A</sup>, bound Cul1-N8/Rbx1 ~10-fold less tightly than CSN<sup>5H138A</sup>, albeit still with a relatively high affinity (20 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). A similar effect on binding affinity was seen with a substrate lacking the RING domain of Rbx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Even though the RING and Csn4-NTD domains are adjacent in the enzyme-substrate [ES] complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), double mutant analysis suggests that they make substantially independent contributions to binding energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, enzyme assays revealed a much greater effect of deleting the RING than deleting the Csn4-NTD, suggesting that the RING domain makes a profound contribution to catalysis in a manner that does not depend on its proximity to Csn4-NTD. We do not know the extent to which the reduced catalytic rates for these mutants arise from defects in enzyme activation versus substrate positioning, but we note that cleavage of ∆RING substrate was accelerated by ~8-fold upon deletion of Csn6-INS2, suggesting that at least a small part of the problem with this substrate is that it failed to properly trigger activating conformational changes in CSN.</p><p>In addition to the movements of individual domains, formation of the [ES] complex is accompanied by wholesale translocation of the Csn5 and Csn6 subunits. We suggest that this motion contributes primarily a <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> effect, because deletion of Csn6-INS2, which is proposed to facilitate this motion, enhanced <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> but had no noteworthy impact on binding to substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and removal of Csn5 from the complex did not substantially affect CSN assembly with substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enchev et al., 2012</xref>). We cannot conclude much about the other motions enumerated above, but we note that mutations that are predicted to reside near the interface of the Csn5-INS2 and Cul1-WHB domains cause significant reductions in substrate deneddylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E, F</xref>). In addition, reorientation of Nedd8 away from Cul1-WHB and towards Csn5 as predicted here is consistent with the prior observation that the hydrophobic patch of Nedd8 recruits UBXD7 to neddylated CRLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">den Besten et al., 2012</xref>). Presumably, the conformational changes that occur during the activation process are connected in some manner. Interestingly, CSN<sup>5E104A</sup> and CSN<sup>6∆INS2</sup> both cleave ubiquitin-rhodamine at 0.04 sec<sup>-1</sup> (which is ~6-fold faster than wild type CSN), but CSN<sup>5E104A,6∆INS2</sup> is yet fivefold faster (0.2 sec<sup>-1</sup>) than either single mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lingaraju et al., 2014</xref>). The activities of the single and double mutants imply that the Csn6-∆INS2 mutation must destabilize binding of Csn5-E104 to the catalytic zinc, but only in a small fraction (≤20%) of complexes. Meanwhile, movements at the Csn4/6 interface must do more to the active site than simply disrupt the interaction of Csn5-E104 with the catalytic zinc, implying the existence of at least two inputs to CSN activation. Resolving how binding of substrate is connected to enzyme activation awaits high-resolution structural analyses of the enzyme and substrate in various states.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A kinetic model for the CSN enzyme cycle reveals an essential role for the E-vict mechanism in sustaining rapid catalysis</title><p>Upon formation of an [ES] complex, the conformational changes that occur in both CSN and substrate culminate in cleavage of the isopeptide bond that links Nedd8 to cullin.

The actual cleavage may be even faster because this measurement was made under multi-turnover conditions, in which case product dissociation may have been rate limiting. Regardless, the sum total rate of the activating conformational motions plus isopeptide bond cleavage reported here (~1 s<sup>-1</sup>) is considerably faster than substrate dissociation from CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> (~0.017 s<sup>-1</sup>), indicating that CSN conforms to Briggs-Haldane kinetics and essentially every [ES] complex that forms proceeds to cleavage, the physiological implications of which are considered in the next section.</p><p>Cleavage of the isopeptide bond initiates a series of events leading to product release. Removal of Nedd8 increases dissociation of Cul1/Rbx1 by ~7–10 fold. We propose that dissociation of the cleaved Nedd8 also removes an impediment to Csn5-INS1, which can now bind the catalytic site zinc via E104 to return CSN to its apo state. This engagement, which we refer to as the ‘E-vict’ mechanism, is a critical step in what is likely to be a series of conformational rearrangements that include repositioning of Csn5-E76. Collectively, these movements reduce the affinity of CSN for product and accelerate its rate of dissociation by an additional order of magnitude. The removal of Nedd8 and E-vict together bring about an ~100-fold loss in affinity of Cul1/Rbx1 for CSN. The slow dissociation of product from CSN mutants that were unable to undergo E-vict (0.12–0.16 s<sup>-1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) suggests that this mechanism is important for maintaining physiological rates of CRL deneddylation. This is further supported by the observation that Csn5-E104A, but not wild type Csn5, co-precipitates substantial amounts of deneddylated Cul1 from cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Slow clearance of product could explain, in part, the failure of this mutant to complement a Csn5 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The E-vict mechanism presents an elegant solution to a fundamental challenge facing enzymes: how to achieve high specificity without compromising rapid turnover.</p><p>We note that the product <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> for Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 (1.1 s<sup>-1</sup>) is similar to the <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> we measured for both single- and multi-turnover reactions. This suggests that depending on the exact structure of the neddylated CRL substrate, the rate-limiting step may vary from one deneddylation reaction to another. Regardless, our biochemical and cell-based data suggest that if the E-vict mechanism did not exist, product dissociation would become the Achilles heel of deneddylation reactions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>CSN in its cellular milieu</title><p>The kinetic parameters reported here coupled with quantitative measurements of protein concentrations by selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennett et al., 2010</xref>] and JR and RJD, unpublished data) allow a preliminary estimate of the steady-state distribution of CSN in cells. The total cullin concentration in the 293T cell line used in this work is ~2200 nM. Meanwhile, the CSN concentration is ~450 nM. Although the total amount of Nedd8-conjugated cullins was not measured, immunoblot data suggest that ~1000 nM is a reasonable estimate. The <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> reported here for the [ES] complex (~2 nM), thus predicts potentially near-complete saturation of the cellular CSN pool with neddylated cullins. This implies that formation of new [ES] complexes is limited by the slowest step in the catalytic cycle, i.e. either the conformational rearrangements or product dissociation. In vitro, CSN follows Briggs-Haldane kinetics and cleaves Nedd8 off nearly every neddylated CRL that it binds. Because CSN is not in equilibrium with its substrates in our simplified in vitro system, it cannot rely on differences in substrate <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> to achieve specificity. Thus, differences in <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> on the order of ≤10-fold, which might occur with different cullins or substrate adaptors, would be predicted to have minimal effects on catalytic efficiency provided that <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> remains roughly the same, as was observed for different configurations of substrate and product in this study. Importantly, this parameter can potentially be profoundly altered by ubiquitylation substrates, E2 enzyme, or other in vivo binding partners of Nedd8-conjugated CRLs, which compete with CSN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emberley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enchev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischer et al., 2011</xref>) and thus should reduce its apparent <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic>. It is also conceivable that binding partners might alter the partitioning of the CSN–N8-CRL complex either by increasing <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> and/or reducing <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>, such that N8-CRL bound to an ubiquitylation substrate dissociates prior to completion of the conformational rearrangements that culminate in its deneddylation.</p><p>Based on measurements reported here, it is likely that CSN complexes in cells are constantly undergoing catalysis, dissociating rapidly from product, and rebinding other CRLs on the time-scale of a few seconds or less. Consistent with this picture, addition of a Nedd8 conjugation inhibitor to cells leads to nearly complete disappearance of neddylated cullins within 5 min, and this does not account for the time it takes the drug to equilibrate across the membrane and deplete the cellular pool of Nedd8~Ubc12 thioesters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Soucy et al., 2009</xref>). The dynamic properties of CSN measured here reveal a CRL network of extreme plasticity that can be reconfigured in minutes to respond to changing regulatory inputs. Although quantitative studies of CRL network dynamics remain in their infancy, it is evident that the tools are at hand to begin to understand how these remarkable enzymes function and are regulated within cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning</title><p>All eight wild type CSN subunits were cloned into a single pFBDM baculovirus transfer MultiBac vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger et al., 2004</xref>).

Binding assay with Cul1<sup>d</sup>-N8/Rbx1 (substrate) and CSN<sup>5E76A</sup> were allowed to equilibrate for only 45 s, because although this mutant exhibited an ~300-fold decrease in activity (data not shown) the residual activity was high enough to cause substantial deneddylation in a 10 min incubation.

Nevertheless, different investigators in Zurich and Pasadena have consistently obtained an estimate of 1.6–5 nM for binding of CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> to Cul1<sup>d</sup>-N8/Rbx1 and of 9–13 nM for binding to CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> to Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1, using different protein preparations.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structural and kinetic analysis of CSN activation and the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase deneddylation cycle&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ivan Dikic (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Wade Harper, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper provides a structural and kinetic analysis of the Cop9/Signalosome complex (CSN). The authors provide a structure of the 8 subunit CSN complex bound to a CRL. They investigate the mechanism of action using kinetic approaches and describe an &quot;E-swap&quot; model the catalytic mechanism. This provides the first systematic analysis of CSB kinetics.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One reviewer felt that, from the data available, it was unclear whether the fit of Nedd8 and Rbx1 in the EM structure was as good as suggested in the text. For example, the statement &quot;…allowed us to precisely describe the movements…&quot; may be overstating the case somewhat. So the text should be toned down and it should be made clear what the limits of resolution and fitting are in this structure, given that it is only at ~7A.</p><p>2) A second major comment concerns how the kinetic studies were performed in order to obtain <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> values. The kinetic binding studies were performed with a fixed concentration of Cul1 at 30 nM. However, the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> values are in the single nM range, raising questions about the accuracy of the data due to the difficulty in getting accurate values when the protein concentration is higher than <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> due to the steepness of the equilibrium binding graph (see Pollard T.D. 2010, Molecular Biology of the Cell v.21 p4061-4067). For example, the plot of equilibrium binding of WT CSN with Cul1/Rbx1 reports a <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of 310 nM, which can be easily identified by inspection of the graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. In contrast the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> values when <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> &lt; 30 nM cannot be inferred from their respective graphs. The problem becomes apparent if one were to plot theoretical graphs of equilibrium binding of <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>s of 1.6 nM, 5 nM, and 10 nM where the fixed protein concentration is 30 nM. These graphs would almost lie entirely on top of each other. The data in the paper suggests this problem as the 5 nM <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> measured for CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1K</xref> doesn't match the previously stated value of 1.6 nM or 10 nM. The differences in dissociation constants are large enough between WT and mutant CSN that the general message of the paper is very likely correct, but it would probably be best if key measurements could be attempted with lower CUL1 levels. However, if this isn't possible for technical reasons, you could perhaps emphasize the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>s in the low nanomolar range (those higher than the reported limit of 1.5 nM). It was also suggested that you may want to describe the limits of the calculated <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of 4 nM reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref> for the SCF Fbxw7-CSN5H138A complexes as the error bars are large.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12102.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>1) One reviewer felt that, from the data available, it was unclear whether the fit of Nedd8 and Rbx1 in the EM structure was as good as suggested in the text.

So the text should be toned down and it should be made clear what the limits of resolution and fitting are in this structure, given that it is only at ~7A.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the cautioning remark and have re-worded the text in the second paragraph of the Results section, as well as the ends of the respective paragraphs describing the docking of the RING domain and Nedd8 and the WHB domain of Cul1 (subsection “Structural insights from cryo EM and single particle analysis of a CSN-SCF-Nedd8Skp2/Cks1 complex”). We have thus made it clear that the current resolution does not permit the precise fitting of small subunits like Rbx1 or Nedd8. Nevertheless, the primary advance over previous structural work is that we could position these small subunits/domains relative to CSN, and consequently formulate hypotheses, tested by mutants predicted from the structure.</p><p><italic>2) A second major comment concerns how the kinetic studies were performed in order to obtain K<sub>d</sub> values. The kinetic binding studies were performed with a fixed concentration of Cul1 at 30 nM. However, the K<sub>d</sub> values are in the single nM range, raising questions about the accuracy of the data due to the difficulty in getting accurate values when the protein concentration is higher than K<sub>d</sub> due to the steepness of the equilibrium binding graph</italic> (<italic>see Pollard T.D. 2010, Molecular Biology of the Cell v.21 p4061-4067</italic>)<italic>. For example, the plot of equilibrium binding of WT CSN with Cul1/Rbx1 reports a K<sub>d</sub> of 310 nM, which can be easily identified by inspection of the graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. In contrast the K<sub>d</sub> values when K<sub>d</sub> &lt; 30 nM cannot be inferred from their respective graphs. The problem becomes apparent if one were to plot theoretical graphs of equilibrium binding of K<sub>d</sub>s of 1.6 nM, 5 nM, and 10 nM where the fixed protein concentration is 30 nM. These graphs would almost lie entirely on top of each other.</italic></p><p>We agree with the concern of the reviewer, and we are also familiar with the Pollard article that the reviewer cites. We settled on a Cul1<sup>d</sup> concentration of 30 nM because it is the lowest concentration at which we can consistently get reliable experimental measurements. While it is possible, when everything works perfectly, to drop the Cul1<sup>d</sup> concentration somewhat below 30 nM, under no circumstances can we work at single digit nM concentrations. We thus cannot make the simplifying assumption that [CSN]<sub>free</sub> = [CSN]<sub>tot</sub> and resorted to the standard practice of using a quadratic equation to estimate the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>. While it is more challenging (and the results are more prone to error) to measure a <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> below the concentration of the species that is held fixed, it is not impossible. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref> shows theoretical curves calculated for a ligand that binds a receptor (held at 30 nM) with a <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of, 10 nM, 5 nM and 2 nM. As can be seen, distinguishing between 1.6 and 5 nM is difficult, but the shape of the binding curve we see appears to be consistent with a <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> well below 10 nM. We feel the most appropriate response given the technical challenges is to state very clearly in the text the limitations of measuring a <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> that is below the concentration of the species that is held constant. Accordingly, we now state the following: “Note that the estimated <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> falls well below the fixed concentration of Cul1<sup>d</sup>-N8/Rbx1 used in the assay. This introduces greater uncertainty into our estimate but nevertheless our data suggest that the binding of substrate to CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> is tight (≤5 nM; see Materials and methods for further discussion of this matter)”.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12102.027</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12102.027">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12102.027</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-12102-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig></p><p>In the Methods we state: “It should be noted that several of the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> values reported for CSN binding to Cul1<sup>d</sup>-N8/Rbx1 or Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 are below the concentration of the dansylated ligand (30 nM). While this is not optimal, we found that 30 nM was the lowest concentration that consistently yielded highly reproducible results. A <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> was estimated by the standard approach of using a quadratic equation as described above. The estimated <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> is very sensitive to the density of data points at the inflection point of the curve, and thus these estimates can be more prone to error. Nevertheless, different investigators in Zurich and Pasadena have consistently obtained an estimate ranging from 1.6 to 5 nM for binding of CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> to Cul1<sup>d</sup>-N8/Rbx1 and of 9 to 13 nM for binding to CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> to Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1, using different protein preparations.”</p><p><italic>The data in the paper suggests this problem as the 5 nM K<sub>d</sub> measured for CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1K</xref> doesn't match the previously stated value of 1.6 nM or 10 nM.</italic></p><p>We are aware of this, but we wish to emphasize that the point of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1K</xref> was to show that deletion of the N-terminal domain of Csn2 had a massive effect on substrate binding. The CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> was included as the control for the experiment. Because we knew the difference would be huge, we collected a smaller number of data points for CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> in this experiment. Consequentially the estimate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1K</xref> is less accurate. This does not in any way affect the interpretation of this experiment.</p><p><italic>The differences in dissociation constants are large enough between WT and mutant CSN that the general message of the paper is very likely correct, but it would probably be best if key measurements could be attempted with lower CUL1 levels. However, if this isn't possible for technical reasons, you could perhaps emphasize the K<sub>d</sub>s in the low nanomolar range (those higher than the reported limit of 1.5 nM).</italic> </p><p>We hope the editor agrees that the additional text we have added to the Results and Materials and methods adequately deals with this issue.</p><p>It was also suggested that you may want to describe the limits of the calculated K<sub>d</sub> of 4 nM reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref> for the SCF Fbxw7-CSN5H138A complexes as the error bars are large.</p><p>We are aware of this problem but did not invest a great deal of effort in addressing it because we did not use Fbxw7-Skp1 in subsequent experiments. As noted above, measurements within the range of 1.6-5 nM are within the error of estimation. We now state in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>: “Note that addition of Fbxw7–Skp1 greatly increased the variability in the measurement for unknown reasons.”</p><p>To maintain some perspective here, we would like to emphasize that the binding of substrate to enzyme is exceedingly tight. Whether it is 1.6 nM or 5 nM is inconsequential. The big surprise is that it is so tight (obviously far below 30 nM). This is unexpected given that the <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> is ~200 nM and the affinity for product is ~100-fold lower, despite the fact that Nedd8 itself appears to have relatively limited affinity for CSN. This extremely high affinity for substrate, the large disconnect between <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> and <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic>, and the great drop in affinity upon cleavage of Nedd8 have important implications for physiology, as we describe in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
