poorly understood. We tested whether individual amygdala neurons encode a critical requirement for goal-directed behavior: the evaluation of progress during sequential choices. As monkeys progressed through choice sequences toward rewards, amygdala neurons showed phasic, gradually increasing responses over successive choice steps. These responses occurred in the absence of external progress cues or motor preplanning. They were often specific to self-defined sequences, typically disappearing during instructed control sequences with similar reward expectation. Their build-up rate reflected prospectively the forthcoming choice sequence, suggesting adaptation to an internal plan. Population decoding demonstrated a high-accuracy progress code. These findings indicate that amygdala neurons evaluate the progress of planned, self-defined behavioral sequences. Such progress signals seem essential for aligning stepwise choices with internal plans. Their presence in amygdala neurons may inform understanding of human conditions with amygdala dysfunction and deregulated reward pursuit.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18731.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18731.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>amygdala</kwd><kwd>decision-making</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd><kwd>planning</kwd><kwd>emotion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>Rhesus Macaque</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schultz</surname><given-names>Wolfram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schultz</surname><given-names>Wolfram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Caltech Conte Center</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schultz</surname><given-names>Wolfram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neurons in the amygdala, a brain system usually associated with emotion, track progress during sequential reward-directed choices according to an internal plan in Rhesus macaques.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The amygdala, a nuclear complex in the medial temporal lobe, is a key structure for the internal evaluation of sensory events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Janak and Tye, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">LeDoux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morrison and Salzman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murray and Rudebeck, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rolls, 2000</xref>).

A central, integrative valuation role is compatible with the amygdala’s extensive sensory and prefrontal connections, its outputs to attentional, autonomic, and behavioral control systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duvarci and Pare, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">LeDoux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Price, 2003</xref>), and its processing of social cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adolphs, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gothard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leonard et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Livneh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mosher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rutishauser et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, amygdala lesions across different species impair reward-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balleine and Killcross, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baxter and Murray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baylis and Gaffan, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bechara et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Everitt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rudebeck et al., 2013</xref>). However, beyond basic reward processing, the functions of amygdala neurons in advanced behaviors, such as economic decision-making, are poorly understood.</p><p>Advanced economic behaviors often require sequences of choices organized by an internal plan. In economic saving, for example, the plan to obtain a reward in the future guides sequential choices and actions in the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benhabib and Bisin, 2005</xref>). A critical requirement during planned choice sequences is the continual evaluation of progress, to ensure alignment of individual choices with long-term plans and successful navigation toward reward goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benhabib and Bisin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berkman and Lieberman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson and Busemeyer, 2001</xref>). Physiological studies of frontal cortex identified activity patterns underlying action sequences and the execution and updating of motor plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mushiake et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shima and Tanji, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shima et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sohn and Lee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tanji and Shima, 1994</xref>). Furthermore, during externally instructed, multistep reward schedules, neurons in frontal cortex, amygdala and striatum respond to cues signaling schedule onset, reward contingency and reward proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shidara and Richmond, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Simmons et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sugase-Miyamoto and Richmond, 2005</xref>). These studies uncovered important neural components of externally instructed sequential behaviors but did not address the internal progress evaluation that is typical of economic choice plans toward self-defined goals.</p><p>Here we tested whether amygdala neurons encode the internally evaluated progress of economic choice sequences. The amygdala is a prime candidate structure for this process. Its diverse anatomical connections would make a sequence progress signal widely available for cognitive, motivational and behavioral computation in different downstream neurons. Moreover, amygdala dysfunction occurs in humans with deregulated reward pursuit and affective disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koob and Volkow, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Price and Drevets, 2010</xref>), which impact on the motivation to plan for and pursue distant rewards. In a series of experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grabenhorst et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hernadi et al., 2015</xref>), we recorded amygdala single-neuron activity while monkeys performed self-defined choice sequences toward distant rewards. Previously, we reported prospective amygdala signaling of immediate, current-trial choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grabenhorst et al., 2012</xref>) and forthcoming choice sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hernadi et al., 2015</xref>). Although such signals are essential for internally planned behavior, they cannot by themselves guide stepwise choices toward a final reward goal.</p><p>In the present study, we report gradually increasing amygdala responses that evolved dynamically during internally planned choice sequences lasting up to two minutes. These gradual responses had several remarkable characteristics. They occurred in the absence of external progress cues that could have induced sensory evidence accumulation and in the absence of opportunities for motor preplanning. The gradual amygdala responses were mostly specific to free, internally guided choices as they typically disappeared in externally instructed sequences, despite similar behavioral reward expectation. Importantly, their gradual build-up rate readily adapted to the forthcoming, internally planned choice sequence length, suggesting reference to an internal plan. Decoding analysis showed that the neuronal population provided a highly accurate progress code. These data suggest that primate amygdala neurons encode internally evaluated progress during planned economic choice sequences. Such gradual activity seems suited to support multistep decision-making and motivational regulation during the pursuit of self-defined distant rewards.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sequential choice task and economic behavior</title><p>Two monkeys performed in a sequential choice task in which they made consecutive, trial-by-trial choices to save (i.e. accumulate) liquid reward until they chose to spend (i.e. consume) the accumulated reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The animals indicated their save-spend choice on each trial by a saccade towards the save or spend cue. Accumulation of reward over consecutive save choices depended on the current interest rate; pre-trained save cues indicated different interest rates. The animals were free to produce saving sequences of different lengths, which allowed them to plan their behavior over several trials within a sequence and anticipate final reward amounts. Save-spend cues appeared pseudorandomly in left-right positions, preventing action planning before cue onset. To compare internally guided choices with externally instructed behavior, we tested ‘imperative’ save-spend sequences of comparable lengths.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18731.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sequential choice task and behavior.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Monkeys made sequential choices to save (accumulate) or spend (consume) reward.

This parameter, which we term ‘sequence progress’, evolved dynamically within a sequence and thus determined both reward proximity and accumulated reward amount (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>). Crucially, neither free choice task nor imperative control task provided external cues about how many trials had been completed within a sequence, requiring the animals to track progress internally.</p><p>In a typical session, the animals produced saving sequences of different lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The behavioral relevance of sequence progress can be assessed by its relationship with the animals’ choice probability. By design, spend choice probability increased with sequence progress (as each sequence ended with a spend choice). However, the relationship between spend probability and sequence progress varied between interest rate conditions, reflecting the animals’ preferences for different sequence lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The animals typically preferred shorter sequences when interest was low (early peak in the probability distribution) and preferred longer sequences with higher interest (later peak; correlation between mean sequence length and interest rates across animals: r = 0.71, p=0.003). Thus, the animals’ choices depended on sequence progress.</p><p>Analysis of reaction times confirmed the behavioral relevance of sequence progress. We focused our main reaction time analysis on the latencies with which the animals released a touch key at the end of a trial to initiate reinforcer delivery (liquid reward on spend trials, auditory cue on save trials). This measure has previously been shown to reflect a differential reward expectation related to reward type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Watanabe et al., 2001</xref>) and reward magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hernadi et al., 2015</xref>), with typically faster responses for preferred rewards and high magnitude rewards. We focused on key release latencies because in the present task they may reflect more closely the animal’s reward expectancy compared to saccadic reaction times, as key release was the final behavioral response required before reinforcer delivery. Key release reaction times shortened with sequence progress, separately for spend and save trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which suggested higher motivation in later trials of a sequence. The effect was significant when controlling for other task-relevant variables including subjective choice values (p&lt;0.001, partial correlation). The relationship between reaction times and sequence progress depended on the final length of each sequence: reaction times declined at a faster rate with the progress of shorter sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that the animals adjusted their motivation according to planned sequence length. In the imperative control task, reaction times also decreased with sequence progress depending on anticipated sequence length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Statistical modeling of reaction times from both tasks in the same multiple regression model suggested that the strongest factors across tasks were sequence progress and current-trial save-spend choice. An additional regressor for task type (free choice vs. imperative task) and its interaction with other variables accounted for insignificant portions of variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Critically, the influence of sequence progress on reaction times did not depend on task type, suggesting similar behavioral relevance for sequence progress across tasks. Saccadic reaction times, measured as the latency from the choice cue onset to fixation of the chosen cue were also related to sequence progress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), although the effect was smaller compared to key release latencies and had a positive rather than negative direction. (We are cautious in interpreting saccadic reaction times, as touch key reactions were overall more directly related to the animals’ motivation: release of touch key was the final behavioral response on each trial before reinforcer delivery and, in further analyses, touch key release latencies showed a stronger relationship to upcoming reward magnitude on spend trials (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.116, p&lt;0.0001) compared to saccade reaction times (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.017, p&lt;0.001). Overall, reaction time analyses confirmed that sequence progress was a behaviorally and motivationally important parameter.</p><p>Behavioral data from control tests reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hernadi et al., 2015</xref>) confirmed that saving was adaptive and internally controlled: both animals (i) followed uncued changes in interest rate (R = 0.97, p&lt;0.001; linear regression of mean sequence length on interest rate); (ii) maximized reward rate for extreme interest conditions (R = 0.73, p=3.3 × 10<sup>−7</sup>, linear regression of relative choice frequency on normalized rate of reward return across animals); and (iii) successfully tracked accumulated reward, shown by interspersed challenge trials offering saved vs. fixed reward amounts (p=5.06 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, Mann-Whitney test on choice frequencies for fixed reward when it exceeded saved reward). In addition, the animals’ choices were well described by a behavioral model based on the subjective values of save and spend choice options (p&lt;1.0 × 10<sup>−16</sup>, t-test on regression coefficients for subjective save value and spend value, logistic regression). Taken together, the animals’ saving choice sequences were economically meaningful and internally planned. Sequence progress was a key task parameter that influenced the animals’ choices and motivation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Encoding of sequence progress by individual amygdala neurons</title><p>As the animals progressed through the self-determined choice sequences, a substantial number of amygdala neurons showed gradually changing neuronal responses over consecutive trials in a sequence (single linear regression, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>: 194/326 neurons, 59%; multiple stepwise regression, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ7">Equation 7</xref>: 127/326 neurons, 39%). The activity of these neurons thus seemed related to sequence progress. We identified such neurons by regressing their trial-by-trial activity in fixed time windows on the current, cumulative number of trials in a sequence (p&lt;0.05, linear regression, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>, following selection of task-related responses: p&lt;0.0083, Wilcoxon test, corrected for multiple comparisons). Additional sliding window and multiple regression analyses confirmed the main results and controlled for other behavioral and task variables, as detailed below.</p><p>The neuron in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> showed a phasic response related to sequence progress at the time of choice on each trial. The activity increased gradually over consecutive trials within a sequence and reset with the start of a new sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This gradual activity occurred specifically in the cue phase and preceding fixation phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>); it was neither a tonic increase in baseline activity nor a trial outcome response. Crucially, there were no external cues that could have signaled current trial position; accordingly, the observed activity reflected purely internal tracking of sequence progress. The graded activity disappeared in the cue phase of the imperative task, when behavior was externally instructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), confirming the relationship to an internal process. Regression analysis (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>) established a linear, trial-by-trial relationship between cue-period activity and sequence progress in the free choice task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) but not in the imperative task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Importantly, sensory stimulation, motor requirements and behavioral reward expectation were matched between free choice and imperative task, and random cue positions precluded planning of action sequences. This suggested that the gradually increasing activity did not reflect sensory evidence accumulation or preparation of a motor response. Thus, at the time of choice on each trial, the neuron showed gradually increasing activity related to sequence progress, specifically during internally guided choice sequences.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18731.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Gradually increasing activity related to sequence progress in a single amygdala neuron.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Neuronal response in the fixation and cue periods, plotted for each step of a six-trial choice sequence.

A significant majority of progress-related activities increased (rather than decreased) over consecutive trials within a sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; 294/408 responses with positive regression slope, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>, 72%; p=1.0 × 10<sup>−19</sup>, binomial test). We compared neuronal progress encoding between free choice and imperative tasks in a subset of neurons recorded in both tasks (N = 155). Although a fraction of these neurons also showed progress-related activity in the imperative task, the significant majority showed progress-related activity specifically during free choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; p&lt;0.001, z-test for dependent samples). This suggested that progress signals were mostly specific to a situation that required internally guided behavior. Consistent with this observation, at the population level, the strength of neuronal progress coding transiently declined on trials when the animals committed an error (failed to perform a correct saccade or prematurely released the touch key), and subsequently reappeared on the following trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This result suggested a relationship between amygdala progress signals and the animals’ performance. Sliding window regression identified progress activities in a similar numbers of neurons as the main fixed-window regression (214/326 neurons, 65.64%, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>) and confirmed their occurrence throughout different task periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The majority of sequence progress activities were phasic responses that occurred transiently at specific task events and subsequently disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), rather than reflecting lasting, tonic modulations in activity. Additional multiple regression models confirmed the robustness of these results and distinguished sequence progress activities from closely related task-relevant variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). For example, few neuronal responses (27/408, 6.6%) reflected sequence progress in addition to previously described sequence length signals, suggesting distinct encoding of sequence progress and length. Our strictest regression model included sequence progress in addition to planning variables (sequence value, sequence length, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ7">Equation 7</xref>) and current-trial save-spend choice. This model identified 127 neurons with relation to sequence progress (39%) of which 31 neurons (10% of all recorded neurons) encoded sequence progress without relation to explicit planning variables or choices, suggesting a significant number of neurons with ‘pure’ progress activity. For comparison, 78 neurons (24%) neurons encoded ‘pure’ planning activities (i.e. not coding choice or progress variables) and 112 neurons (34%) encoded ‘pure’ choice activities (i.e. not coding planning or progress variables). Thus, amygdala progress neurons were in many cases distinct from previously described planning and choice neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grabenhorst et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hernadi et al., 2015</xref>).

We further examined adaptation by pooling data across neurons. As for the single neuron, increases in population activity with sequence progress were steep for short sequences and successively shallower for longer sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). This was quantified by a linear positive relationship between the rate of activity increase (population progress slope) and inverse sequence length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Confirming a prospective adaptation, progress-related activity at specific sequence steps allowed prediction of the forthcoming sequence lengths, as early as the second trial of a sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This effect was found for all sequence steps (all p&lt;0.001, linear regression) except first sequence trials (p=0.26), which implied a constant starting point of progress activity in each sequence.

For example, consider a two-trial sequence followed by a five-trial sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Accurate progress tracking would require a neuron to adapt its activity slope flexibly from one sequence to the next. This is exactly what we observed in population activity. After a steep activity increase during two-trial sequences, activity increase was much shallower during immediately following five-trial sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). This rapid downward adaption of progress slope reversed when sequential order was reversed, i.e. when a two-trial sequence followed a five-trial sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). We quantified this dynamic adaptation across all pairs of consecutive saving sequences by a significant regression of the (signed) progress activity slope difference on the (signed) difference in sequence length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>).

Accordingly, we examined whether single-neuron activity was best fit by an adaptive model that normalized sequence progress by sequence length (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Linear regression revealed that this adaptive progress model explained a higher number of responses than a non-adaptive progress model (447 vs. 408 significant responses, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>), with a significantly higher number of best fits (391 vs. 104 responses with higher R<sup>2</sup> for adaptive model; p&lt;1.0 × 10<sup>−23</sup>, z-test for dependent samples). Across all responses that were significant for both models, the R<sup>2</sup> distribution was shifted significantly towards the adaptive model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, left) and the R<sup>2</sup> difference between models was significantly in favor of the adaptive model (p=3.2 × 10<sup>−8</sup>, one-sample t-test). A stepwise regression in which both models competed to explain neuronal responses also favored the adaptive model (284 vs. 121 significant responses). The adaptive sequence progress model also proved superior to other alternatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>), including models based on the accumulated reward magnitude (saved juice, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4</xref>), elapsed time (incorporating error trials, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref>), and tuning to specific sequence steps (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ6">Equation 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In all cases, the adaptive progress model explained a higher number of responses, with a significantly higher number of best fits (all p&lt;1.0 × 10<sup>−20</sup>, z-test for dependent samples), and with significant shifts in R<sup>2</sup> distribution towards the adaptive model (all p&lt;1.0 × 10<sup>−7</sup>, one-sample t-test). We also tested a partial adaptive progress model that included both adaptive and non-adaptive progress regressors in the same regression model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ8">Equation 8</xref>). This analysis was motivated by the observation that the population activity on spend trials varied to some extent across different sequence lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which suggested that adaptation may have been incomplete. The partial adaptation model was also motivated by related approaches in economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koszegi and Rabin, 2006</xref>) that model dependence of individuals’ preferences on external reference points using partial adaptation, although with different formalisms. Similar to the full adaptive model, a partial adaptation provided a better fit to the data than the non-adaptive model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). However, even though some individual responses were better explained by partial adaptation compared to full adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>), and aspects of population activity seemed more consistent with partial adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), on average both full adaptation and partial adaptation fit the data equally well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and explained similar numbers of responses (full adaptive model: 447/1126 task-related responses, 39.7%; partial adaptive model: 435/1126 responses, 38.6%).

Exceptions were the elapsed time and tuning models (p&lt;1.0 × 10<sup>−4</sup>), which provided generally poorer fits in the free choice task.

Cross-validated decoding performance of a nearest-neighbor classifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Quian Quiroga et al., 2006</xref>) was significantly above chance in all trial phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; mean accuracy: 78.13 ± 0.56%) with maximum accuracy of 89% in the fixation phase.

Decoding based on these small subsets of randomly selected neurons was well above chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, ‘Random’). Restricting subsets to those neurons that were individually significant for sequence progress (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>) resulted in substantially higher performance, although accuracy was slightly reduced compared to decoding from all neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, ‘Significant’ compared to ‘All”). This suggested that even individually non-significant neurons contributed to decoding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, ‘N-signif’). Overall, however, decoding performance depended strongly on individual neurons’ sensitivities (slopes) to sequence progress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Thus, the population of amygdala neurons allowed decoding of sequence progress with high accuracy, with individually sensitive neurons contributing most strongly to this population code.</p><p>We also compared decoding contributions of basolateral and centromedial amygdala neurons, as these amygdala regions differ in connectivity and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balleine and Killcross, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duvarci and Pare, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mosher et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Namburi et al., 2015</xref>). For both regions, decoding was well above chance in all task periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Notably, in the fixation period, decoding performance was significantly higher for basolateral neurons, whereas in the cue period performance was significantly higher for centromedial neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Regional differences were also evident when adding different numbers of neurons to the classifier. In the fixation period, adding more neurons increased performance for both basolateral and centromedial neurons, with overall higher accuracy for basolateral neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). By contrast, in the cue period, accuracy increased substantially as more centromedial neurons were added, with significantly lower accuracy increases for basolateral neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Subset analyses confirmed the relative importance of centromedial neurons for cue-phase decoding. In the fixation period, the relative number of centromedial neurons in a decoding subset had no impact on performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). By contrast, in the cue phase, adding more centromedial neurons (relative to basolateral neurons) significantly increased decoding accuracy, even irrespective of their progress sensitivities, which were covariates in the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). Thus, although neurons from both basolateral and centromedial amygdala allowed accurate progress decoding, there were significant regional differences between fixation and cue periods, potentially related to distinct behavioral requirements of these task periods (e.g. internal valuation during fixation compared to response to external events during the cue period).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We identified gradual, stepwise responses in amygdala neurons as monkeys executed economic choice sequences according to internal plans. These responses occurred in the absence of external progress cues and without opportunities to preplan specific actions. They were often specific for internally guided choice sequences, despite similar behavioral reward expectation in free choice and imperative control task. The slope of the gradual responses reflected prospectively the forthcoming choice sequence lengths, readily from one sequence to the next, suggesting adaptation to the animal’s internal behavioral plan. Accordingly, gradual amygdala activity was best described in terms of adaptive sequence progress (normalized by planned sequence length), rather than by reward expectation or timing models. Sequence progress activity fluctuated with performance as it was diminished on error trials and subsequently reinstated, suggesting the behavioral relevance of progress signals. Linear population decoding suggested a progress code that can be read out with high accuracy by downstream neurons. These gradual responses contrast markedly with other amygdala activities observed in the same reward-saving task: rather than directly predicting single-trial choices or choice sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grabenhorst et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hernadi et al., 2015</xref>), the present activities changed dynamically over consecutive trials as a function of sequence progress. Such continual evaluation of progress in amygdala neurons seems crucial for aligning individual choices with behavioral plans and for successfully navigating toward reward goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benhabib and Bisin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berkman and Lieberman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson and Busemeyer, 2001</xref>). These data implicate gradual amygdala responses in the evaluation of progress during internally planned choice sequences and support a role for the primate amygdala in advanced economic behaviors.</p><p>Amygdala neurons respond to reward-predictive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nishijo et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Paton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rolls, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sugase-Miyamoto and Richmond, 2005</xref>), encode related reward expectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bermudez and Schultz, 2010</xref>), and participate in regulating affective state and arousal in response to external events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis and Whalen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Janak and Tye, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">LeDoux, 2000</xref>). The majority of the presently described progress-related activities are probably not directly derived from these basic, reactive reward functions. First, in many neurons, the responses occurred specifically during freely determined choice sequences but not in closely matched imperative sequences. Notably, reaction time patterns were similar between both tasks, suggesting matched behavioral reward expectation. Second, gradual activity was better described by an adaptive progress model than by explicit reward expectation or timing. This neuronal adaptation was also specific to the free choice task, despite behavioral reaction time adaptation in both tasks. A minority of neurons showed non-adaptive gradual activity in both free choice and imperative tasks, potentially reflecting reward expectation or affective state regulation. In a previous study, primate amygdala neurons during visually guided reward schedules responded to sequence onset, aspects of the cued schedule, and reward delivery, without tracking schedule progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sugase-Miyamoto and Richmond, 2005</xref>). We suggest that our internally guided choice task, which allowed the animals to plan behavior over several steps, potentially engaged amygdala neurons to a greater extent than purely visually instructed tasks. The lower percentage of progress activities we observed in the imperative task is consistent with this interpretation. Thus, although activity in some neurons matched known amygdala reward expectation signals, the majority of amygdala progress activities reported here were unlikely due to basic reward expectation or affective reactions to external stimuli.</p><p>The amygdala contains heterogeneous cell types with varying projection targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Janak and Tye, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">LeDoux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Namburi et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, the functional significance of the present gradual activities likely depends on a neuron’s precise outputs. Amygdala progress-related activity during choice sequences could provide inputs for decision computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang, 2002</xref>) in cortical areas to which the amygdala projects. This could apply especially to basolateral neurons with projections to anterior cingulate cortex, where gradual activity changes occur in multistep reward schedules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shidara and Richmond, 2002</xref>) and foraging tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayden et al., 2011</xref>), and to orbitofrontal cortex, where neurons signal economic values during single-trial choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kennerley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Padoa-Schioppa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>). Consistent with this suggestion, reward value coding in orbitofrontal cortex depends partly on the integrity of the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rudebeck and Murray, 2008</xref>). In amygdala neurons with striatal projections, gradual activity could potentially exert a more direct influence on action, as amygdala-striatal connections are implicated in reward-seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Namburi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stuber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tye et al., 2008</xref>). This possibility seems consistent with the behavioral consequences of amygdala lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baxter and Murray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bechara et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brand et al., 2007</xref>). Although amygdala inactivation does not cause deficits in object choice once reward values have been updated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wellman et al., 2005</xref>), the amygdala is thought to make essential contributions to reward-guided behavior in situations that required dynamic valuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murray and Rudebeck, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, gradual activity in amygdala neurons with outputs to attentional and autonomic effector systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Price, 2003</xref>) could serve to progressively focus cognitive and motivational resources during internally directed choice sequences. These interpretations of the behavioral relevance of amygdala progress signals are supported in the present study by relationships between progress signals and performance on error trials, and by relationships between some amygdala neurons and the animals’ reaction times. Finally, we suggest that gradual activity in amygdala neurons with predominantly local connections could participate in putative decision computations within local amygdala circuits. From this perspective, the progress-related amygdala activity in the current task could be interpreted as reflecting the animal’s gradually increasing intention to make a spend choice. This suggestion is supported by the existence of explicit spend choice signals in amygdala neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grabenhorst et al., 2012</xref>) (which reflect the output of a decision computation), decision deficits in humans with amygdala lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bechara et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brand et al., 2007</xref>), decision-related activations in human imaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Martino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grabenhorst et al., 2013</xref>), and with features of amygdala inhibitory microcircuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duvarci and Pare, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Janak and Tye, 2015</xref>) that could support neural choice mechanisms by winner-take-all competition through mutual inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang, 2002</xref>). Although some amygdala neurons showed lasting, tonic activity modulation by sequence progress, most progress responses were phasic and time-locked to individual task events, suggesting they may have played specific roles during task performance, rather than reflect lasting changes in the animal’s state. Overall, gradual activity patterns in amygdala neurons could reflect a number of underlying processes related to behavioral control, decision-making, and the regulation of motivation, attention and affective state. This interpretation is supported by our finding that some individual neurons and population activity also exhibited gradual patterns in the imperative task, which likely reflected reward expectation and related processes. However, our main result that progress activity in a group of amygdala neurons was adapted to internal plans and occurred specifically during free choices seems more closely linked to internally guided decision processes. Testing these possibilities will likely require a circuit-based approach, e.g. using optogenetics tools, to examine the presently characterized gradual responses in amygdala subpopulations with defined projection targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Janak and Tye, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Namburi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In various brain systems, the gradual evolution of mental processes towards a decision is accompanied by gradually increasing, ‘ramping’ activity. This ramping activity is thought to reflect sensory evidence accumulation or motor response preparation through integration-to-bound or evidence accumulation mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanes and Schall, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maimon and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mazurek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murakami et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Okano and Tanji, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Romo and Schultz, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schultz and Romo, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stuphorn et al., 2010</xref>). Similar ramping activities also occur in reward structures including monkey striatum and amygdala, where neurons show ramping activity to reward-predicting cues on single trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bermudez and Schultz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schultz, 2015</xref>). Our results differ from these previous studies in important respects. In contrast to perceptual decisions or motor preparation, our task did not provide external stimuli to elicit evidence accumulation nor did it allow preplanning of specific motor responses. Furthermore, the presently reported gradual amygdala activity is morphologically different from ramping activity: it was not confined to the timescale of individual trials but reoccurred as a phasic response during choice sequences lasting up to two minutes. Finally, although resembling gradual activity observed in anterior cingulate cortex during foraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayden et al., 2011</xref>), the present gradual amygdala responses were mostly specific free choice situations (an aspect not tested in the previous study) and adapted prospectively to the monkey’s internal behavioral plan, rather than monitoring value changes of a foraging patch in the external environment.</p><p>The observed prospective adaptation to internally planned sequence length in the present amygdala neurons seems important to optimize neuronal discrimination of different sequence steps. Accurate signaling of progress is critical for guiding step-by-step choices according to internal plans and for regulating motivation during the pursuit of reward goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berkman and Lieberman, 2009</xref>). Adaptation is a fundamental process that enables accurate coding of variables by neurons with a limited activity range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fairhall et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laughlin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schultz, 2015</xref>). Across neurons, our data were consistent with both full adaptation and partial adaptation to planned sequence length. Conceivably, incomplete adaptation in some neurons may enhance flexibility of sequence progress encoding across a neuronal population by retaining some information about the absolute, non-adapted sequence length. Our model of partial adaptation was motivated by related approaches in economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koszegi and Rabin, 2006</xref>) that model dependence of individuals’ preferences on external reference points using partial adaptation, although with different formalisms. Our population decoding results, obtained using linear, biologically plausible classifiers, confirm the accuracy of progress coding across the population of amygdala neurons. Previously reported amygdala neurons signaling length and value of planned sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hernadi et al., 2015</xref>) seem well suited to guide this prospective adaptation, although the underlying neurophysiological mechanism remains unclear. As our neurophysiological experiments were necessarily restricted to choice sequences lasting up to several minutes, our data do not provide evidence concerning planned behaviors over even longer timescales, which likely involve additional mechanisms.</p><p>Achieving rewards in the real world typically requires sequences of choices, often according to an internal plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benhabib and Bisin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berkman and Lieberman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson and Busemeyer, 2001</xref>). Our data indicate that amygdala neurons participate in the evaluation of progress during internally planned choice sequences. Given the amygdala’s diverse anatomical outputs, such progress signals could potentially support a range of behavioral functions, including multistep decision-making and the focusing of motivation, affective state and cognitive processes on self-defined goals. The present results may also shed new light on the behavioral and mental deficits of humans with psychiatric conditions involving amygdala dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koob and Volkow, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Price and Drevets, 2010</xref>). Future studies could test whether impaired progress evaluation by the amygdala might contribute to deficits in reward pursuit and goal-directed behaviors in these conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Neurophysiological recordings</title><p>All animal procedures conformed to the US National Institutes of Health Guidelines and were approved by the Home Office of the United Kingdom (Home Office Project Licenses PPL 80/2416, PPL 70/8295, PPL 80/1958, PPL 80/1513).

Choice sequences were self-determined in that monkeys were free to produce save-spend sequences of different lengths (following one required save choice per sequence). For high interest rates, we delivered a fixed amount of 8 ml after seven consecutive save trials, as this was the maximum amount the animals could consume on one trial. The animals were still free to produce longer saving sequences (no imposed upper limit on sequence length). After training, the animals only generated sequences that resulted in reward amounts that they could comfortably drink.</p><p>A computer-controlled solenoid valve delivered juice reward from a spout in front of the animal's mouth. For monkey A the base rate of reward magnitude, b from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>, was set to 0.11 ml for all sessions, for monkey B the base rate was set to 0.11 ml for half of the sessions and 0.13 ml for the other half of the sessions. The animal's tongue interrupted an infrared light beam below the adequately positioned spout. An optosensor monitored licking behavior with 0.5 ms resolution (STM Sensor Technology).</p><p>The animals initiated trials by placing their hand on an immobile, touch-sensitive key, followed by presentation of an ocular fixation spot on a computer monitor (1.3° visual angle). The animals were required to fixate within 2–4° for 1500 ms plus mean of 500 ms (truncated exponential distribution). We monitored eye position using an infrared eye tracking system at 125 Hz (ETL200; ISCAN). Two save and spend visual stimuli of 7.0° then appeared on the left and right side of the monitor (pseudorandomized). In blocks of typically 40–100 consecutive trials, we used different pre-trained stimuli as save cues to indicate different interest rates. (Each neuron was typically tested with one to two different interest rates. The duration required for testing neurons with statistically sufficient numbers of trials in both free choice and imperative tasks usually precluded using more than two interest rates) Animals could indicate their choice with a saccade towards the save or spend cue as soon as the cues appeared. The chosen stimulus was replaced by a peripheral fixation spot of 7.0° of visual angle. Following a delay of 1500 ms, the peripheral fixation spot changed color and signaled the animal to release the touch key which resulted in delivery of the reinforcer (auditory or visual cue on save trials vs. a liquid reward on spend trials). Crucially, there were no external cues that signaled sequence progress to the animals. Thus, the animals were required to track progress internally. Failures of key touch or fixation resulted in trial cancellation; more than three sequential errors led to a pause in behavioral testing. Accumulated saved rewards were retained across error trials. The animals were overtrained by the time of neuronal recording and showed consistent, meaningful saving behavior for different interest rates without further signs of learning.</p><p>To provide an example of how rewards were calculated, consider a series of two successive save choices by the monkey with a base rate of reward b = 0.11 and interest rate q = 1.5. On the second trial of the choice sequence, after the first save choice, reward R = 0.11 × (1 + 1.5) = 0.275 ml. On the third trial, after two successive save choices, reward R = 0.11 × (1 + 1.5 + 1.5<sup>2</sup>) = 0.523 ml.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Imperative control task</title><p>In the imperative control task, the animals performed behavioral sequences of matched lengths to the free choice task. However, the behavior was not self-controlled but was externally instructed by a small visual cue presented next to either the save or the spend cue. The instruction cue indicated the correct choice on each trial. Trials were otherwise identical to a free choice trial. We matched the ratio of save to spend trials between imperative and free choice task for each monkey and interest rate to allow the animals to anticipate reward amounts which we confirmed by behavioral reaction times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The imperative task was performed for a subset of recorded neurons in a separate trial block. For these neurons, the tasks were on average counterbalanced so that either the free choice or imperative task was recorded first. Although we matched sequence lengths between both tasks for specific animals and interest rates, the counterbalanced order meant that for some sessions sequence lengths were not perfectly matched (e.g. if the imperative task was performed first and the animal subsequently produced a larger or smaller range of sequences during free choice). However, this is unlikely to be a major factor in our results as mean sequence lengths were highly correlated between pairs of free choice and imperative sessions (R = 0.527, p=2.1 × 10<sup>−12</sup>) and sequence length ranges did not differ significantly on average (p=0.949, t-test).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Linear regression analysis of reaction times and licking durations</title><p>As a measure of the animals’ trial-by-trial reward expectation, we analyzed the latencies with which the monkeys released the touch key at the end of the trial to initiate reinforcer delivery. Reaction times were z-normalized separately for each animal within each experimental session by subtracting the session mean and dividing by the session standard deviation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Analysis of neuronal data</title><p>We counted neuronal impulses in each neuron on correct trials in fixed time windows relative to different task events: 1000 ms before fixation spot (Pre-fixation), 1775 ms after fixation spot but before cues (Fixation, starting 25 ms after fixation spot onset), 300 ms after cues (Cue, starting 20 ms after cue onset), 1500 ms post-choice delay (Delay, starting 25 ms after the animal had indicated its choice), and 500 ms during the reward/outcome period (Outcome, starting 50 ms after reinforcer onset).</p><p>We first identified task-related responses in individual neurons and then used linear regression analysis to identify neuronal responses related to sequence progress. We identified task-related responses by comparing activity in the Fixation, Cue, Delay and Outcome periods to a control period (Pre-fixation) using the Wilcoxon test (p&lt;0.0083, Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons). A neuron was included as task-related if its activity in at least one task period was significantly different to that in the control period. Because the Pre-fixation period served as control period we did not select for task-relatedness in this period and included all neurons with observed impulses in the analysis. We chose the pre-fixation period as a control period because it was the earliest period at the start of a trial in which no sensory stimuli were presented. Our analysis strategy was to first examine gradual amygdala responses with a single linear regression model to determine how many responses could be described in terms of a linearly increasing (or decreasing) activity pattern. We used single linear regression in fixed time windows around task events as this provided the most direct way to detect and interpret such gradual activity patterns, and to allow direct comparison with results from previous studies using similar sequential choice tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayden et al., 2011</xref>). We used different single linear regressions to distinguish whether gradual activities were best described in terms of linear increase, or various non-linear increases related to task variables of interest. We also used a multiple stepwise regression model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ7">Equation 7</xref>) as an alternative analysis to determine the number of gradual responses when other task-relevant variables were accounted for. We also used additional sliding window regressions in combination with a bootstrap method without pre-selecting task-related responses to confirm that our results did not depend on the pre-selection of task-related responses or definition of fixed analysis windows. Finally, population decoding examined independence of our findings from pre-selection of task-related responses and served to assess information about gradual activity contained in the neuronal population. The statistical significance of regression coefficients was determined with a t-test using p&lt;0.05 as criterion. All tests performed were two-sided. Each neuronal response was tested with the following regression models:<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"

To determine whether neuronal activity was significantly related to sequence progress we used a bootstrap approach based on shuffled data as follows. For each neuron, we performed the sliding window regression 1000 times on trial-shuffled data and determined a false positive rate by counting the number of consecutive windows in which a regression was significant with p&lt;0.05. We found that less than five per cent of neurons with trial-shuffled data showed more than eight consecutive significant analysis windows. Therefore, we counted a sliding window analysis as significant if a neuron showed a significant (p&lt;0.05) effect for more than eight consecutive windows.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-5"><title>Normalization of population activity</title><p>We subtracted from the measured impulse rate in a given task period the mean impulse rate of the control period and divided by the standard deviation of the control period (z-score normalization).

The SVM classifier was trained on a set of training data to find a linear hyperplane that provided the best separation between patterns of neuronal population activity defined by a grouping variable based on sequence progress. Decoding was typically not improved by non-linear (e.g. quadratic) kernels. The NN classifier was similarly trained on a set of test data and decoding was performed by assigning each trial to the group of its nearest neighbor in a space defined by the distribution of impulse rates for the different levels of the grouping variables using the Euclidean distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Quian Quiroga et al., 2006</xref>). Both SVM and NN classification are biologically plausible in that a downstream neuron could perform similar classification by comparing the input on a given trial with a stored vector of synaptic weights. Both classifiers performed qualitatively similar, although SVM decoding was typically more accurate.</p><p>We aggregated z-normalized trial-by-trial impulse rates of independently recorded amygdala neurons from specific task periods into pseudo-populations. We used all recorded neurons that met inclusion criteria for a minimum trial number, without pre-selecting for value coding, except where explicitly stated. We only included neurons in the decoding analyses that had a minimum number of five trials per group for which decoding was performed, and we confirmed that results were very similar when changing this minimum number to 10 trials. For each decoding analysis, we created three n by m matrices with n columns determined by the number of neurons and m rows determined by the number of trials. We defined three matrices, one for each group for which decoding was performed. These included separate groups for low, medium, and high sequence progress, determined for each neuron by calculating sequence progress terciles. (We obtained very similar results by repeating the decoding analyses based on progress quartiles) Thus, each cell in a matrix contained the impulse rate from a single neuron on a single trial measured for a given group. Because neurons were not simultaneously recorded, we randomly matched up trials from different neurons for the same group and then repeated the decoding analysis with different random trial matching (within-group trial matching) 150 times. We found these repetition numbers to produce very stable classification results. (We note that this approach likely provides a lower bound for decoding performance as it ignores potential contributions from cross-correlations between neurons; investigation of cross-correlations would require data from simultaneously recorded neurons) We used a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure whereby a classifier was trained to learn the mapping from impulse rates to groups on all trials except one; the remaining trial was then used for testing the classifier and the procedure repeated until all trials had been tested. The results were very similar by using 80% of trials as training data and 20% as test data.</p><p>The SVM decoding was implemented in Matlab (Version R2013b, Mathworks, Natick, MA) using the ‘svmtrain’ and ‘svmclassify’ functions with a linear kernel and the default sequential minimal optimization method for finding the separating hyperplane. Decoding could typically not be improved by using radial basis function or quadratic kernels. The NN decoding was performed in Matlab using custom-written code. We quantified decoding accuracy as the percentage of correctly classified trials, averaged over all decoding analyses for different random within-group trial matchings. To investigate how decoding accuracy depended on population size, we randomly selected a given number of neurons at each step and then determined the percentage correct. For each step (i.e. each possible population size) this procedure was repeated 100 times. We also performed decoding for randomly shuffled data (shuffled group assignment without replacement) with 1500–5000 iterations to test whether decoding on real data differed significantly from chance. Statistical significance was determined by comparing vectors of percentage correct decoding accuracy between real data and randomly shuffled data using the rank sum test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Quian Quiroga et al., 2006</xref>). For all analyses, decoding was performed on neuronal responses taken from the same task period.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Ken-Ichiro Tsutsui for help with task design; Anthony Dickinson, John Assad, Raymundo Báez-Mendoza, Armin Lak, William Stauffer, and Martin O’Neill for helpful discussions; Mercedes Arroyo for histology.

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Primate amygdala neurons evaluate the progress of self-defined economic choice sequences&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by David Van Essen as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Joshua Gold, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors report on single-unit activity recorded from amygdala neurons in monkeys performing a sophisticated and novel decision-making task that requires them to plan a sequence of save-and-spend decisions at different interest rates. They found that nearly half of the 326 task-responsive neurons recorded showed gradually increasing activity as the sequence progressed in length, peaking when the animals chose the spend option and received their accumulated reward. Moreover, rate increases in activity adapted to the choice sequence length, consistent with principles of adaptive coding. This pattern of activity was not observed when spend or save decisions were externally instructed. Finally, the authors show that sequence progress can be linearly decoded, suggesting it is possible for a progress code to be read out by downstream areas/neurons.</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that the manuscript is technically sound and should be of wide interest. Moreover, it represents an important step in demonstrating the amygdala contributes to more sophisticated computations beyond processing of threat or reward.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is not entirely clear which exact regression model (Eqs. 2-7) was used for each analysis presented in the text and figures. This should at least be clarified, and the use of multiple models better justified. Alternatively, it is strongly suggested that the most complete model (Eq. 7) should be used throughout, because it accounts for a number of potentially confounding variables. That model should also be explained better, including descriptions of how <italic>CVspend</italic> and <italic>SVsave</italic> were computed.</p><p>2) Several questions were raised about the RT data and their implications. Are the reported RTs on the choice versus imperative task statistically indistinguishable? Such a finding would certainly bolster the argument that reward expectations are similar under the two conditions and thus cannot account for differences in neural activity. If they were different, however (which would not be terribly surprising, given the reported R<sup>2</sup> values), it should be noted and the implications discussed. Additionally, the reported RTs were computed based on the latency of key press release after a delay period that followed the animal indicating its choice with a saccade. These clearly indicate the behavioral relevance of sequence progress. Is a similar pattern observed for the saccadic RTs? Do they differ on the free choice and imperative tasks? Do they relate to neural activity on the two tasks? Is this relationship similar or different for basolateral and centromedial neurons?</p><p>3) Given the strong relationship between neural activity and progress on the choice task, it raises an interesting question about the activity on error trials. Do cells that show pre-fixation or fixation period progress-related activity increases/decreases exhibit aberrant activity on error trials? Or do other aspects of neural activity predict error trials?</p><p>4) What was the accuracy of decoding in the imperative control task? A similar figure as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> for comparison, along with a discussion of the implications of this analysis, would be useful.</p><p>5) The observation of &quot;adaptive encoding&quot; is quite interesting. However, according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, the adaptation seems only partial in that the normalized maximum firing rate is different for different sequence progress. Have the authors tested a partial adaption model, or adaptive models for reward magnitude and elapsed time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>)?</p><p>6) From inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, it appears that the majority of the sequence progress activity corresponded to a single, transient modulation that occurred at random times during a trial. The implications of this finding should be at least discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18731.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) It is not entirely clear which exact regression model (Eqs. 2-7) was used for each analysis presented in the text and figures.

That model should also be explained better, including descriptions of how CVspend and SVsave were computed.</italic> </p><p>We have now clarified throughout the Results and figure legends which specific regression model was used for each analysis by referring to the specific equation. We have also justified our use of multiple models by explaining our analysis strategy in the Methods, section ‘Analysis of neuronal data’, second paragraph. Briefly, we initially focus on the single linear regression model as it provided the most direct and intuitive way to detect and interpret gradual activity patterns and allowed direct comparison with previous studies using similar sequential tasks (Hayden et al., 2011). However, to be very clear about the numbers of neurons with specific effects, at the start of the Results we now directly compare the numbers of significant responses obtained with the single linear model with our most complete multiple regression model (section ‘Encoding of sequence progress by individual amygdala neurons’). We also provide a more comprehensive explanation of the multiple regression model as requested, including a new section on subjective value definition (Methods, final paragraph of section ‘Analysis of neuronal data’ and subsequent section ‘Definition of subjective values.’).</p><p><italic>2) Several questions were raised about the RT data and their implications. Are the reported RTs on the choice versus imperative task statistically indistinguishable? Such a finding would certainly bolster the argument that reward expectations are similar under the two conditions and thus cannot account for differences in neural activity. If they were different, however (which would not be terribly surprising, given the reported R<sup>2</sup> values), it should be noted and the implications discussed. Additionally, the reported RTs were computed based on the latency of key press release after a delay period that followed the animal indicating its choice with a saccade. These clearly indicate the behavioral relevance of sequence progress. Is a similar pattern observed for the saccadic RTs? Do they differ on the free choice and imperative tasks? Do they relate to neural activity on the two tasks? Is this relationship similar or different for basolateral and centromedial neurons?</italic> </p><p>We performed additional behavioral and neuronal analyses and included new results and figures to address these questions (Results, sections ‘Sequential choice task and economic behavior’, fourth paragraph and ‘Reaction time control analysis’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, panels C and D). Briefly, statistical examination with multiple regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) showed that a task indicator variable (free choice vs. imperative) did not explain additional variance in key touch reaction times compared to other task-relevant variables (neither did interaction effects between the task indicator and sequence progress). This result suggests that the influence of our main variable sequence progress on reaction times did not depend on task type, suggesting similar behavioral relevance for sequence progress across tasks. With respect to neuronal data and reaction times, some neuronal responses were indeed related to reaction times in a multiple regression that controlled for other variables (Results, section ‘Reaction time control analysis’). However, these neuronal reaction time effects did not account for our main finding of sequence progress coding. We found no significant differences between basolateral and centromedial amygdala neurons with respect to relations to reaction times. We include an interpretation of these effects in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>3) Given the strong relationship between neural activity and progress on the choice task, it raises an interesting question about the activity on error trials. Do cells that show pre-fixation or fixation period progress-related activity increases/decreases exhibit aberrant activity on error trials? Or do other aspects of neural activity predict error trials?</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this interesting suggestion. We have included a new analysis and result with respect to error trials (Results, section ‘Encoding of sequence progress by individual amygdala neurons’, third paragraph; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; Discussion, first and third paragraphs). Briefly, in a neuronal population analysis, the strength of sequence progress coding transiently declined on error trials and subsequently reappeared, which we interpret as additional evidence for the potential behavioral relevance of progress signals.</p><p><italic>4) What was the accuracy of decoding in the imperative control task? A similar figure as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> for comparison, along with a discussion of the implications of this analysis, would be useful.</italic> </p><p>We have included the requested analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and in the Results section ‘Linear population decoding of sequence progress’, first paragraph and discuss the implications in the Discussion section, third paragraph.</p><p><italic>5) The observation of &quot;adaptive encoding&quot; is quite interesting. However, according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, the adaptation seems only partial in that the normalized maximum firing rate is different for different sequence progress. Have the authors tested a partial adaption model, or adaptive models for reward magnitude and elapsed time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>)?</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this interesting suggestion. We now include an additional analysis in which we tested for a partial adaptive model. The results are described in the Results, section ‘Adaptive model of sequence progress activity’, first paragraph; Eq. 8; and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. Briefly, partial adaptation accounted better for our data than a non-adaptive model but across neurons was not significantly different from the full adaptive model. We did not test adaptive models for reward magnitude or elapsed time as we wished to restrict analysis to a comparison of model classes that were selected on theoretical grounds. For example, we did not consider an adaptive time model biologically plausible because this would presuppose that the animals know in advance the number of committed errors in a saving sequence. We provide an interpretation of the partial adaptive model in the Discussion, penultimate paragraph.</p><p><italic>6) From inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, it appears that the majority of the sequence progress activity corresponded to a single, transient modulation that occurred at random times during a trial. The implications of this finding should be at least discussed.</italic> </p><p>We now mention this observation in the Results, section ‘Encoding of sequence progress by individual amygdala neurons’, third paragraph, and discuss its implications in the Discussion, third paragraph.</p></body></sub-article></article>
