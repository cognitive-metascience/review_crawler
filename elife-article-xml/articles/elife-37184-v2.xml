with diverse functions. In a genome-scale expression screen for inducers of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), we found a striking enrichment of RNA-binding proteins. We validated that QKI and RBFOX1 were necessary and sufficient to induce an intermediate mesenchymal cell state and increased tumorigenicity. Using RNA-seq and eCLIP analysis, we found that QKI and RBFOX1 coordinately regulated the splicing and function of the actin-binding protein FLNB, which plays a causal role in the regulation of EMT. Specifically, the skipping of FLNB exon 30 induced EMT by releasing the FOXC1 transcription factor. Moreover, skipping of FLNB exon 30 is strongly associated with EMT gene signatures in basal-like breast cancer patient samples. These observations identify a specific dysregulation of splicing, which regulates tumor cell plasticity and is frequently observed in human cancer.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37184.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>As the human body develops, countless cells change from one state into another. Two important cell states are known as epithelial and mesenchymal. Cells in the epithelial state tend to be tightly connected and form barriers, like skin cells. Mesenchymal state cells are loosely organized, move around more and make up connective tissues. Some cells alternate between these states via an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT for short) and back again. Without this transition, certain organs would not develop and wounds would not heal. Yet, cancer cells also use this transition to spread to distant sites of the body. Such cancers are often the most aggressive, and therefore the most deadly.</p><p>The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is dynamically regulated in a reversible manner. For example, the genes for some proteins might only be active in the epithelial state and further reinforce this state by turning on other ‘epithelial genes’. Alternatively, there might be differences in the processing of mRNA molecules – the intermediate molecules between DNA and protein – that result in the production of different proteins in epithelial and mesenchymal cells.</p><p>Li, Choi et al. wanted to know which of the thousands of human genes can endow epithelial state cells with mesenchymal characteristics. A better understanding of the switch could help to prevent cancers undergoing an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.</p><p>From a large-scale experiment in human breast cancer cells, Li, Choi et al. found that a group of proteins that bind and modify mRNA molecules are important for the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Two proteins in particular promoted the transition, most likely by binding to the mRNA of a third protein called FLNB and removing a small piece of it. FLNB normally works to prevent the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, but the smaller protein encoded by the shorter mRNA promoted the transition by turning on ‘mesenchymal genes’.</p><p>This switching between different FLNB proteins happens in some of the more aggressive breast cancers, which also contain mesenchymal cells. Finding out which FLNB protein is made in a given cancer may provide an indication of its aggressiveness. Also, looking for drugs that can target the mRNA-binding proteins or FLNB may one day lead to new treatments for some of the most aggressive breast cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>QKI</kwd><kwd>RBFOX1</kwd><kwd>FLNB</kwd><kwd>EMT</kwd><kwd>basal-like breast cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009634</institution-id><institution>Susan G.

Regulation of alternative splicing occurs at several levels including the expression and the targeting of specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Dysregulation of alternative splicing plays a direct role in a variety of human diseases including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">David and Manley, 2010</xref>).</p><p>During cancer initiation and progression, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) triggers the dissociation and migration of carcinoma cells from primary to distant sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ye and Weinberg, 2015</xref>). We previously demonstrated that the EMT is also tightly linked to a stem-like cell state in breast cancer, as overexpression of EMT transcription factors induces the expression of tumor-initiating cell markers and increases the ability of cells to form mammospheres, a property associated with mammary epithelial stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mani et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, the EMT has been implicated in several other cancer-related phenotypes, for example, in cancers that acquired resistance either to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib or to the HER2 receptor inhibitor trastuzumab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boulbes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sequist et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>EMT also involves a dramatic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and concomitant formation of membrane protrusions to gain migratory and invasive properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yilmaz and Christofori, 2009</xref>). The dynamic change in the actin cytoskeleton, a prerequisite for cell motility and cancer cell invasion, is a highly controlled equilibrium of local assembly and disassembly of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yilmaz and Christofori, 2009</xref>). The filamin family proteins crosslink actin filaments and are also translocated into the nucleus to regulate the transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor and the FOXC1 transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bedolla et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Loy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>). The three members of this family (FLNA, FLNB and FLNC) are involved in both development and normal tissue homeostasis through regulating diverse processes including cell locomotion and integrin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>), and mutations in the <italic>FLNB</italic> gene cause a broad range of skeletal dysplasias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daniel et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Alternative splicing has been previously associated with EMT. Mesenchymal cancer cells show distinct alternative splicing patterns in comparison with their epithelial counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braeutigam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shapiro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Venables et al., 2013</xref>). While ESRP1 and ESRP2 are epithelial state-inducing RBPs that govern splicing patterns for the epithelial cell state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shapiro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Warzecha et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Warzecha et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2016</xref>), less is known about the identity and functional significance of RBPs that can promote the mesenchymal cell state. QKI and RBFOX2 have been shown to be responsible for alternative splicing events that occur during EMT, such as exon skipping in KIF13A and CTTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braeutigam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Venables et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2016</xref>) and in circular RNA formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conn et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the upregulation of any specific RBPs is sufficient or required for the induction of mesenchymal state transitions or is merely one of many downstream manifestations of the EMT. Furthermore, although many splicing changes occur during EMT, only a small number of specific splicing events are known to functionally contribute to EMT including changes in the splicing of CD44, FGFR2 and Exo70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Warzecha et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we have undertaken a comprehensive approach to identify genes that regulate the EMT in breast cancer and found that genes whose protein products participate in AS regulate the transition to mesenchymal- and stem-like cell states.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A genome scale ORF screen to identify regulators of the mesenchymal cell state</title><p>In prior work, we described a genetically defined, experimental model of breast cancer, derived from introducing vectors expressing the telomerase catalytic subunit, the SV40 large-T and small-t antigens, and an H-Ras oncoprotein into human mammary epithelial cells (HMLER cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Elenbaas et al., 2001</xref>). Subsequent work demonstrated that the CD44 cell surface antigen is a surrogate marker for the EMT cell state change in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaffer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaffer et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we separated the CD44-high and -low populations of HMLER cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and confirmed that the CD44-low cells displayed epithelial properties, as measured by levels of EMT marker expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The highly purified CD44-low cell population remained in the epithelial cell state for at least 4 weeks in the experimental conditions. In contrast, the CD44-high HMLER cells showed elevated expression of mesenchymal markers and a greater propensity to form mammospheres, an in vitro surrogate assay for the stemness of mammary epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).</p><p>To study inducers of the EMT and stem-like cell state, we performed a genome scale open-reading frame (ORF) screen to identify genes that convert the HMLER cells from the CD44-low state to the CD44-high state. Each ORF in the human ORFeome library collection 8.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2011</xref>) was tagged with a unique 24-nucleotide barcode and introduced into FACS purified CD44-low HMLER cells by lentiviral-mediated gene transfer.

First, we expressed the SNAI1 EMT-TF to induce EMT and then depleted QKI, RBFOX1 or other candidate RBPs with shRNAs (shSNAI1 as a positive control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>). shRNA-mediated suppression of QKI and RBFOX1 led to a significant reduction in the CD44-high cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that the expression of QKI and RBFOX1 was partially required for the induction of the CD44-high cell population after SNAI1 overexpression. To eliminate the potential off-target effects of the shRNAs, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to target the QKI and RBFOX1 genes and found that the ablation of QKI and RBFOX1 also significantly suppressed the induction of CD44-high cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), the expression of mesenchymal markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>) and the formation of mammospheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) after SNAI1 overexpression. Thus, these loss-of-function studies revealed that QKI and RBFOX1 are partially required for induction of the EMT.</p><p>We next examined whether the expression of QKI and RBFOX1 also correlated with mesenchymal features in murine or human tumor samples. We discovered that the expression of QKI was highly upregulated in mesenchymal breast tumor patient samples available from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ciriello et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charafe-Jauffret et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref> and the Materials and methods section for data analysis). The lack of a significant change in expression of RBFOX1 suggested that QKI instead may play a major role in driving the alternative splicing patterns in these samples. In addition, both Qk and Rbfox1 are highly associated with the activation of an EMT program in a murine mammary tumor model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B–D</xref> and the Materials and methods section) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goel et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, although QKI has been previously associated with AS changes occurring during EMT, our observations demonstrate that overexpression of QKI or RBFOX1 suffices to promote an intermediate mesenchymal and stem-like cell state and are also necessary for the SNAI1-induced EMT. Further, the expression of endogenous QKI and RBFOX1 were also induced by EMT-TFs such as SNAI1 or ZEB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). These results extend prior observations implicating these RNA binding proteins in EMT and confirm that our screen identified key regulators of EMT.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Characterizing alternatively spliced transcripts that are regulated by QKI and RBFOX1</title><p>Although QKI and RBFOX2 (a homolog of RBFOX1) have been shown to regulate AS events during EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braeutigam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Venables et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2016</xref>), it remains unclear whether QKI and RBFOX1 alter splicing of genes directly involved in EMT or if the expression of these RNA binding proteins merely correlate with the mesenchymal cell state. To dissect the mechanism by which QKI and RBFOX1 induce the intermediate mesenchymal and stem-like cell states, we overexpressed each of these or a control protein (hcRED or EGFP) in HME cells and used RNA-sequencing to assess changes in transcriptional programs. We subsequently used replicate multivariate analysis of transcript splicing (rMATS) to individually quantify and analyze differences in AS events in HME cells expressing either the hcRED or EGFP control proteins versus QKI, RBFOX1 or SNAI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shen et al., 2014</xref>).

We also discovered that FLNB exon 30 skipping induced a modest but significant increase in the CD44-high cell population and in the number of mammospheres under low attachment growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H,I</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we used two sets of siRNAs that targeted either exon 30, or the junction between exon 29 and exon 31 when exon 30 is skipped. The siRNAs that target the exon 29–31 junction selectively disrupt formation of the FLNB-ΔH1 isoform, since the FLNB-L isoform lacks the siRNA target sequences. This approach effectively altered the ratio of FLNB-L and FLNB-ΔH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>) and revealed that an elevated ratio of the FLNB-ΔH1 isoform over the FLNB-L isoform and a reduction of FLNB protein levels significantly increased the level of mesenchymal markers, consistent with the effect of ectopically expressing FLNB-ΔH1 or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of the splice junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–I</xref>). Together, these observations demonstrate that the skipping of FLNB exon 30 contributes to the acquisition of a mesenchymal-like cell state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>EMT mediated by FLNB exon 30 skipping is dependent on the FOXC1 transcription factor</title><p>In addition to their function in the cytoplasm, actin-binding proteins, such as the Filamin family, have been shown to localize to the nucleus and regulate transcription and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bedolla et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Olson and Nordheim, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>).

The recent genomic characterization of cancers has revealed recurrent somatic mutations and copy number alterations in RNA splicing factors and RBPs in a significant subset of human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dvinge et al., 2016</xref>). Cancer cells harboring aberrant splicing factor expression or mutations in genes encoding splicing factors display unique cancer-specific mis-splicing that may facilitate tumor formation and progression. Although alternative splicing has been associated with EMT previously, in-depth studies are needed to better understand the mesenchymal cell state-specific RBPs and their functional downstream targets. Here, we found that QKI and RBFOX1 regulate the splicing of an exon in the actin-binding protein FLNB to regulate the EMT in breast cancer. This finding suggests that the AS of a single exon may serve as a highly quantifiable surrogate molecular biomarker for the process of EMT in solid tumors.</p><p>Recent work has shown that cells often progress through a spectrum of intermediate states between the fully epithelial and fully mesenchymal cell phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">George et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nieto et al., 2016</xref>). We found that the mesenchymal cell state mediated by the expression of QKI and RBFOX1 exhibited upregulation of mesenchymal markers with continued retention of certain epithelial markers, indicating that this cell state is one that lies in-between the fully epithelial and fully mesenchymal poles of this spectrum. Consistent with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nieto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>), our results suggest that the intermediate/partial mesenchymal cell state displays a high degree of stem cell features and fosters tumor formation in vivo.</p><p>The control of AS by RNA-binding proteins is highly context dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fu and Ares, 2014</xref>) and tissue specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yeo et al., 2004</xref>). QKI has been shown to be a tumor suppressor in brain tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2012</xref>), colon cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taube et al., 2010</xref>) and prostate cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, QKI has also been reported to promote tumor formation in both esophageal carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">He et al., 2016</xref>) and glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xi et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we found that QKI promoted tumor formation in human mammary epithelial cells. These distinct observations may be due to the differences in the initial cell states in which the cancer cells may reside.</p><p>The RBFOX1 ORF that we isolated from the screen encodes an isoform (NM_145893.2) that has been previously shown to partially localized to the cytoplasm in neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). In breast cells, we observed that 38% of this RBFOX1 isoform (NM_145893.2) localize in the nucleus to regulate pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Further studies will be needed to determine whether the cytoplasmic fraction of RBFOX1 also plays an additional role in regulating EMT.</p><p>Interestingly, the overexpression of EMT-related TFs such as SNAl1 and ZEB1 induced the QKI<italic>-</italic> and RBFOX1<italic>-</italic>mediated splicing program. Moreover, overexpression of the QKI and RBFOX1 splicing factors themselves promoted a mesenchymal cell state in which SNAI1 and ZEB1 expression were also elevated. These observations indicate that transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of EMT complement and regulate one another, suggesting how EMT can be dynamically controlled.</p><p>Filamins bind to proteins with diverse functions and important roles in multiple cellular process such as the regulation of cell signaling, transcription and organ development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, we demonstrated that the skipping of exon 30 in FLNB, which encodes a hinge region (H1), not only serves as a marker for mesenchymal cells but also promotes EMT by releasing the FOXC1 transcription factor from an inhibitory complex. These observations provide a mechanistic explanation of how mesenchymal-specific splicing factors such as QKI and RBFOX1 induce EMT.</p><p>Collectively, we conclude that QKI and RBFOX proteins play important roles in establishing the mesenchymal and stem-like cell state in breast cancers, which is in part mediated through their mutual regulation of the skipping of FLNB exon 30. Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs represents a mechanism for flexibly regulating gene expression by enabling the generation of protein isoforms with distinct or even opposing functions without altering rates of transcription. As such, it offers yet another level of epigenetic control of gene expression. Accordingly, it may provide another means of regulation that tumor cells exploit in order to produce proteins that favor cell survival and cell state changes, such as the EMT programs studied here.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Pan-QKI</td><td>Millipore</td><td>MABN624</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-QKI</td><td>Bethyl</td><td>A300-183A <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2173160">AB_2173160</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-RBFOX1</td><td>Sigma</td><td>SAB2100002 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10600323">AB_10600323</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-MBNL1</td><td>Santa-Cruz</td><td>sc-47740 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_784435">AB_784435</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-MBNL2</td><td>Santa-Cruz</td><td>sc-136167 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2140469">AB_2140469</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-CELF4(Brunol4)</td><td>Santa-Cruz</td><td>sc-398292</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-RBFOX2 (RBM9)</td><td>Bethyl</td><td>A300-864A <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_609476">AB_609476</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-FLNB</td><td>Cell signaling</td><td>12979S</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-SNAI1</td><td>Cell signaling</td><td>3879S <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2255011">AB_2255011</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Vinculin</td><td>Cell signaling</td><td>4650S <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10559207">AB_10559207</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-V5</td><td>Cell signaling</td><td>13202</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-V5 (for eCLIP)</td><td>Life Technologies</td><td>R96025 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_159313">AB_159313</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-CD44-PE-Cy7</td><td>Affymetrix</td><td>25-0441-81 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_469622">AB_469622</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td>siRNA NS #1</td><td>GE Dharmacon</td><td>D-001810–01- 05</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td>siFLNB-L1 (3019)</td><td>GE Dharmacon</td><td>CTM-237650/ <break/>LJBYN-000019</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td>siFLNB-L2 (3021)</td><td>GE Dharmacon</td><td>CTM-237646/ <break/>LJBYN-000021</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td>siFLNB-S1 (2923)</td><td>GE Dharmacon</td><td>CTM-237648/ <break/>LJBYN-000023</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>siFLNB-S2 (2925)</td><td>GE Dharmacon</td><td>CTM-237649/ <break/>LJBYN-000025</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>siFOXC1 smart <break/>pool of 4 siRNAs</td><td>GE Dharmacon</td><td>M-009318-01-0005</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>siFLNB-U1 <break/>(targeting UTR region of FLNB)</td><td>GE Dharmacon</td><td>CTM-206669</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>siFLNB-U2 <break/>(targeting UTR region of FLNB)</td><td>GE Dharmacon</td><td>CTM-206671</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>Lipofectamine <break/>RNAiMAX Transfection <break/>Reagent</td><td>thermofisher</td><td>13778150</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial <break/>assay or kit</td><td>QIAamp DNA Mini Kit</td><td>Qiagen</td><td>51304</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial <break/>assay or kit</td><td>RNeasy Mini kit</td><td>Qiagen</td><td>74104</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene</td><td>QKI</td><td>NCBI Reference</td><td>NM_006775.2</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene</td><td>RBFOX1</td><td>NCBI Reference</td><td>NM_145893.2</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, <break/>strain background</td><td>NCr-nude mice</td><td>Taconic</td><td>NCRNU,F, <break/>CrTac:NCr,Foxn1nu</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human mammary epithelial (HME) cell line, and its derived cell lines HMLE and HMLER, were grown in Mammary Epithelial Cell Growth Medium (MEGM, Lonza, #CC-3150).

EMT is a key event in the progression of tumors to a metastatic state and is controlled by an array of genetic mechanisms, including the transcription factors SNAI1, Twist, ZEB1 and others, as well as splicing regulators such as ESRP, RBFOX2 and QKI. The authors previously developed a breast cancer model by transforming mammary epithelial cells with oncogenic factors. The derived cells (HMLER) can be segregated into pre and post EMT populations based on CD44 expression, a marker of metastasis. The CD44 high cells express other mesenchymal markers and exhibit additional properties of these cells, including mammosphere formation. To identify drivers of the transition, the authors infected CD44 low cells with a bar coded cDNA expression library and cells were sorted for CD44 expression. Barcodes enriched in the CD44 high population identified candidates for cDNAs that can induce EMT in HMLER cells. These included the known EMT factor, SNAI1, an indication that other hits in the screen could be similarly important for EMT. These other hits included a preponderance of RNA binding proteins (RBP), two of which, RBFOX1 and QKI, can induce EMT. The authors show that RBFOX1 and QKI alone can increase mesenchymal marker expression and stimulate mammosphere formation. These RBPs are upregulated by SNAI1, and depletion of these proteins by RNAi or CRISPR reduces the effect of SNAI1 on CD44 expression and mammosphere formation. QKI and to a lesser extent RBFOX1 are upregulated in other breast tumors and tumor progression models. Using RNAseq the authors identify changes in splicing induced by QKI and RBFOX1 in their cells and find exons that are coregulated by these RBPs, whose splicing changes are induced by SNAI1. Using CLIP to identify binding sites for QKI and RBFOX1, they show that the proteins bind to sequences adjacent some of the EMT regulated exons making them likely direct targets of QKI and RBFOX1. Focusing on an alternative exon in the actin binding protein Filamin B (FLNB), they show that its skipping correlates with the basal B type of breast cancer. The exon skipped isoform is more active in inducing mesenchymal markers. Using genome editing to force skipping of this exon, they observe modest increases in these markers, in the percent of CD44 high cells, and in mammosphere formation. FLNB was previously shown to bind to the transcription factor FOXC1. Through knockdown experiments the authors show that FOXC1 is needed for the marker expression induced by the RBPs and FLNB.</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that his study is a significant contribution to the growing literature on the roles of RBP's and posttranscriptional regulation in EMT and tumor progression. Some of the effects are not large, much smaller than SNAI1, leading to questions as to how central these new players are to EMT. Nevertheless, there is a lot of interesting data here, and the experiments are generally well performed and comprehensive. This work will be of broad interest to groups working on both RNA biology and cancer. However, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed before the paper can be considered for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is no characterization of which QKI and RBFOX1 isoforms came out of the screen. Both of these genes produce multiple isoforms, nuclear and cytoplasmic, that have different functions and can cross regulate each other. One cannot assess the true targets of whatever forms were isolated from the library without knowing their structure. Similarly, there needs to be an assessment of whether the endogenous Rbfox or QKI isoforms change with EMT or with ectopic expression of a particular isoform. It appears that the RBFOX1 isoforms could change between HME cells and HMLER cells from the immunoblots in Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><p>2) In Figure 2, did the cell proliferation change when the candidate RNA binding proteins were overexpressed? Were there any morphological differences between the CD44-high cells induced by SNAI1 overexpression and those induced by overexpression of QKI or RBFOX1?</p><p>3) RBFOX2 is expressed in a wide variety of cell types and was previously implicated in EMT. In contrast, RBFOX1 is reported to be most abundant in heart, muscle and brain. It is thus important to show validation of the RBFOX1 antibodies, confirming that they do not cross-react with RBFOX2. The isolation of RBFOX1 from an ectopic expression screen is not so surprising, but why was RBFOX2 not isolated? Is it not active for inducing EMT? Given the previous data on RBFOX2 and EMT, it seems surprising that it does not have similar activity.</p><p>4) Many RNA binding proteins co-immunoprecipitate because they bind to common RNAs. The interaction between QKI and RBFOX1 described in Figure 4—figure supplement 1C is not meaningful unless the sample has been treated with RNase.</p><p>5) In Figure 6, the effects of the two FLNB isoforms are relatively small, especially in the CRISPR experiments. It is difficult to draw conclusions from these data, and some of these results appear to be contradictory. In Figure 6C, FLNB-ΔH1 is shown to induce EMT marker expression. But the model in Figure 7 seems to be that the ΔH1 isoform sequesters less of the FOXC1 transcription factor leading to more expression of the EMT markers. If this were true, then over expression of FLNB-L should reduce marker expression and FLNB-ΔH1 should have no effect. The reduction in nuclear FLNB presented in Figure 7—figure supplement 1A is difficult to see and needs to be quantified. The proposed model does not agree with the reported data.</p><p>6) In Figure 6, the protein levels of Filamin B should be shown after siRNA and CRISPR knockdown.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;An alternative splicing switch in FLNB promotes the mesenchymal cell state in human breast cancer&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior Editor) and Reviewing Editor Douglas Black.</p><p>In this revised manuscript from Li and colleagues, the authors have added extensive new data and addressed nearly all of the concerns raised by the reviewers. The manuscript is largely ready for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, the editors request that one final point be addressed. The RBFOX1 isoform isolated from the screen and used in the analysis, NM_145893.2, appears to contain the third to last exon (hg38 chr16:7,693,315-7,693,367). Since isoforms containing this exon have been found to be largely localized to the cytoplasm (PMID: 15824060; PMID: 19762510), this raises questions regarding the mechanisms leading to the RBFOX1 dependent splicing change. It is possible that the localization may be different in the system studied here, but this should be confirmed and described. Alternatively, if the RBFOX1 protein driving EMT is cytoplasmic as seen previously, the authors should note this and revise their model in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37184.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is no characterization of which QKI and RBFOX1 isoforms came out of the screen.

The ORF encoding RBFOX1 is NM_145893.2 (transcript variant 3, also known as RBFOX1 beta). We have included this information in the revised manuscript (subsection “Expression of QKI and RBFOX1 are necessary and sufficient to induce an intermediate mesenchymal cell state”, first paragraph).</p><p>We agree that some RNA binding proteins such as MBNL1 and RBFOX2 undergo alternative splicing during EMT (Shapiro et al., 2011; Venables et al., 2013). To address whether endogenous QKI undergoes alternative splicing during EMT, we queried the RNA sequencing data that we generated in HME cells in which we expressed SNAI1. We found no significant changes in the distribution of endogenous QKI isoforms (main Refseq transcripts) upon expression of either RBFOX1 or SNAI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>).</p><p>For RBFOX1, we found that our RNA-sequencing data was of insufficient depth to adequately detect RBFOX1 isoform expression and therefore performed RT-PCR to assess alternative N-terminal exons and mutually exclusive exons to detect alternative splicing of internal cassette exons. We found that ectopic expression of QKI or SNAI1 did not result in any significant changes in the exons that we examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37184.029</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Endogenous QKI and RBFOX1 isoform expression in HME and HMLER cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of endogenous QKI isoforms based on RSEM quantification of RNA-sequencing data in HME cells expressing control EGFP, RBFOX1, or SNAI1.

To confirm this finding, we performed a side-by-side comparison of the RBFOX1 proteins in the HME and HMLER cell lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1C</xref>). As we found previously, RBFOX1 levels are higher in HMLER cells and showed a stronger 33 kDa lower band, in addition to the 42 kDa band that corresponds to the predicted size of RBFOX1. Through a genetic knockout experiment (see the response to major point #3), we confirmed that both bands are forms of RBFOX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2A</xref>). Since we failed to detect a shorter mRNA form of RBFOX1 (see above), it is likely that this short form of RBFOX1 was generated through post-translational modifications, possibly through endogenous proteolytic cleavage of RBFOX1 proteins. Using Expasy Peptidecutter tool (web.expasy.org/peptide_cutter/), we found that there are at least 20 proteolytic sites in RBFOX1 that may generate a shorter 33 kDa protein. Further experiments will be needed to determine the identity of the shorter RBFOX1 protein product detected in HMLER cells.

Were there any morphological differences between the CD44-high cells induced by SNAI1 overexpression and those induced by overexpression of QKI or RBFOX1?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewers’ question, we overexpressed EGFP, QKI, RBFOX1 and SNAI1 in HME cells and measured cell number after 7 days. We found that overexpression of QKI and RBFOX1 reduced cell proliferation by 40% and 45% respectively, while overexpression of EMT transcription factor SNAI1 decreased cell proliferation by 50%. These observations confirm prior work that showed that initiation of the EMT program slows cell proliferation (Tsai et al., 2012; Vega et al., 2004) and support that notion that expression of QKI and RBFOX1 induces the EMT program. We thank the reviewers for raising this important point and have now included these experiments in Figure 2—figure supplement 3C of the revised manuscript.</p><p>The reviewers also asked whether there are morphological differences between the CD44-high cells induced by SNAI1 overexpression and those induced by overexpression of QKI or RBFOX1. To address this question, we sorted for CD44-high HMLER cells induced by QKI, RBFOX1 and SNAI1 expression and stained for phalloidin (marker for F-actin filament) for better visualization of cell morphology. Compared with the control HMLER CD44-low cells, the CD44- high cells induced by QKI, RBFOX1 and SNAI1 all showed similar cell morphologies marked by elongated and spindle shaped cells (revised Figure 2—figure supplement 3A). Thus, despite the relatively lower occurrence of the CD44-high population in QKI- and RBFOX1- expressing cells comparing with SNAI1- expressing cells, the CD44-high cell populations generated by QKI, RBFOX1 or SNAI1 are morphologically similar. We now include these observations in the revised manuscript (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) RBFOX2 is expressed in a wide variety of cell types and was previously implicated in EMT. In contrast, RBFOX1 is reported to be most abundant in heart, muscle and brain. It is thus important to show validation of the RBFOX1 antibodies, confirming that they do not cross-react with RBFOX2. The isolation of RBFOX1 from an ectopic expression screen is not so surprising, but why was RBFOX2 not isolated? Is it not active for inducing EMT? Given the previous data on RBFOX2 and EMT, it seems surprising that it does not have similar activity.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct that RBFOX2 has been reported to regulate EMT (Venables et al., 2013; Braeutigam et al., 2014). Unfortunately, the RBFOX2 clone (TRCN0000478244) included in the human ORFome 8.1 (Broad Institute) that we used for the screen harbors three mutations (a 396-449 deletion, a 752-763 deletion and a C to T substitution at 1007), which apparently disrupts the function of RBFOX2 and likely explains why we did not isolate RBFOX2. We have added this information to the revised manuscript (subsection “A genome scale ORF screen to identify regulators of the mesenchymal cell state”, last paragraph).</p><p>To validate the specificity of the RBFOX1 antibodies, we used CRISPR-Cas9 editing to generate RBFOX1 and RBFOX2 knock-out cells and used them to test the antibody specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We found that RBFOX1 antibody (Sigma SAB2100002) recognized a strong band at 42 kDa and a weak band at 33 kDa (see response to major point #1). The RBFOX2 antibody (Bethyl A300-864A) detected two bands at 52 kDa and 45 KDa (likely to be two splicing isoforms), which were not detected after genetic ablation of the corresponding genes. Therefore, we conclude that the antibodies that we used are specific for RBFOX1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Many RNA binding proteins co-immunoprecipitate because they bind to common RNAs. The interaction between QKI and RBFOX1 described in Figure 4—figure supplement 1C is not meaningful unless the sample has been treated with RNase.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is an important specificity control. In response, we incubated the cell lysates with RNase at room temperature for 20 minutes to digest the RNAs before we performed the immunoprecipitation experiment using QKI antibody (revised Figure 4—figure supplement 1C). We found that RNase digestion did not substantially affect the association between QKI and RBFOX1. Therefore, we conclude that the interaction between QKI and RBFOX1 was not mediated through RNAs. We now include this figure in the revised manuscript.</p><p> <italic>5) In Figure 6, the effects of the two FLNB isoforms are relatively small, especially in the CRISPR experiments. It is difficult to draw conclusions from these data, and some of these results appear to be contradictory. In Figure 6C, FLNB</italic>-Δ<italic>H1 is shown to induce EMT marker expression. But the model in Figure 7 seems to be that the ΔH1 isoform sequesters less of the FOXC1 transcription factor leading to more expression of the EMT markers. If this were true, then over expression of FLNB-L should reduce marker expression and FLNB-ΔH1 should have no effect. The reduction in nuclear FLNB presented in Figure 7—figure supplement 1A is difficult to see and needs to be quantified. The proposed model does not agree with the reported data.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important question, which prompted us to further investigate the mechanism by which FLNB alternative splicing regulates EMT. First, to further investigate the function of FLNB-L in regulating EMT, we suppressed FLNB expression by siRNAs in HMLE cells, in which the majority of FLNB protein is the FLNB-L isoform. We found that suppression of FLNB-L upregulated the expression of the mesenchymal markers VIM and FN1, indicating that FLNB-L plays a negative role in regulating EMT (revised Figure 6C), consistent with the model in Figure 7.</p><p>Second, we investigated how FLNB-ΔH1 expression increased the expression of mesenchymal markers in the previous Figure 6D. We noted that in the previous Figure 6D, exogenous FLNB isoforms were expressed in the presence of the endogenous proteins. Importantly, it has been demonstrated that filamin proteins dimerize in cells (Berry et al., 2005; Pudas et al., 2005; Stossel et al., 2001). Therefore, it is possible that the exogenous FLNB-ΔH1 dimerized with the endogenous FLNB-L and affected the function of endogenous FLNB-L. Specifically, overexpression of FLNB-ΔH1 may promote the release of the nuclear FOXC1 by dimerizing with the endogenous FLNB-L. To test this possibility, we suppressed the endogenous FLNB using 2 siRNAs targeting the 3’UTR region of FLNB and rescued the FLNB expression by overexpression of two different FLNB isoforms (revised Figure 6D). Depletion of endogenous FLNB-L consistently promoted mesenchymal marker expression (Lane 2 from the left). In the context of endogenous FLNB suppression, FLNB-L expression reduced the expression of mesenchymal markers, FN1 and VIM (Lane 2, 3). In contrast, the expression of FLNB-ΔH1 did not decrease the mesenchymal marker expression (Lane 2-4). Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that FLNB-L plays a negative role in promoting EMT.</p><p>Third, as indicated by the reviewers and the new experiments that we described above, we expected to see a reduction of mesenchymal markers upon FLNB-L expression in mesenchymal cells. However, the cell line that we used in Figure 6C and D was human mammary epithelial cells (HMLE), which reside in an epithelial cell state. The effect of FLNB-L overexpression was not likely to make them even more epithelial. To further test this hypothesis, we overexpressed FLNB-L and FLNB-ΔH1 in a breast cancer cell line that exhibits the mesenchymal state, MDA-MD-231, and examined the expression of mesenchymal markers (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1A). We found that overexpression of FLNB-L in this mesenchymal cell line indeed reduced the expression of mesenchymal markers. Again, the expression of FLNB-ΔH1 did not seem to significantly further increase VIM expression probably because MDA-MD-231 cells are already in a mesenchymal state.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for prompting us to extend our understanding of the mechanism by which FLNB alternative splicing regulates EMT. We now include the new experiments and discussion in the revised manuscript (Figure 6C, D and Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, subsection “FLNB isoform switching promotes a mesenchymal - like cell state”, second paragraph). We also include the quantification of FLNB nuclear intensity in the revised Figure 7—figure supplement 1A (right).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 6, the protein levels of Filamin B should be shown after siRNA and CRISPR knockdown.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide the immunoblots for Filamin B in the revised Figure 6F (bottom) and revised Figure 6—figure supplement 1D where we assess Filamin B protein levels after CRISPR- or siRNA-mediated change of the endogenous ratios of the two FLNB isoforms (FLNB-L and FLNB-ΔH1). Specifically, we performed two experiments. In the first experiment, we used CRISPR-mediated editing of the splicing junction of the genomic locus and found a minor reduction of the endogenous FLNB proteins. We also performed a second experiment in which we used siRNA-mediated suppression of a specific mRNA isoforms and found a significant reduction of the total FLNB proteins, indicating that the siRNA approach has a more profound impact on the total protein levels. In both methods, the ratio of the endogenous FLNB isoforms changed substantially.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this revised manuscript from Li and colleagues, the authors have added extensive new data and addressed nearly all of the concerns raised by the reviewers. The manuscript is largely ready for publication in eLife. However, the editors request that one final point be addressed. The RBFOX1 isoform isolated from the screen and used in the analysis, NM_145893.2, appears to contain the third to last exon (hg38 chr16:7,693,315-7,693,367). Since isoforms containing this exon have been found to be largely localized to the cytoplasm (PMID: 15824060; PMID: 19762510), this raises questions regarding the mechanisms leading to the RBFOX1 dependent splicing change. It is possible that the localization may be different in the system studied here, but this should be confirmed and described. Alternatively, if the RBFOX1 protein driving EMT is cytoplasmic as seen previously, the authors should note this and revise their model in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>To determine the subcellular localization of this RBFOX1 isoform (NM_145893.2), we performed immunofluorescence for the RBFOX1 ORF that we used in these experiments (v5 tagged). In consonance with the prior report in neuronal cells [Figure 2, (Lee et al., 2009)], we found that the 62% of this protein isoform localized to the cytoplasm in human mammary epithelial cells. Meanwhile, 38% of RBFOX1 localizes to the nucleus (revised Figure 7—figure supplement 1D). This observation confirms that a substantial fraction of this RBFOX1 isoform is in the nucleus. In addition, our eCLIP data (Figure 4 in the manuscript) also suggested that a portion of the RBFOX1 isoform studied here binds to specific mRNAs. Therefore, although it remains possible that the cytoplasmic fraction of RBFOX1 may also contribute to EMT, the nuclear fraction of this RBFOX1 isoform likely plays an important role in regulating EMT-related pre-mRNA splicing. We have included a paragraph in the revised manuscript (Discussion, fourth paragraph; Figure 7—figure supplement 1D) to discuss this observation. We thank the editor for raising this important point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
