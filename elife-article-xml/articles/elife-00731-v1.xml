HERB-1 is distinct from all examined modern strains, but it is a close relative of US-1, which replaced it outside of Mexico in the 20th century.

The Spanish introduced Europeans to the South American staple crop potato shortly after their conquest of the New World, but for three centuries Europe stayed free of <italic>P. infestans</italic>, the causal agent of late blight. In 1845, the oomycete <italic>P. infestans</italic> finally reached Europe, spreading rapidly from Belgium to other countries of mainland Europe and then to Great Britain and Ireland. The impact of the epidemic reached catastrophic levels in Ireland, where the population was more dependent on potato for their subsistence than in other parts of Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bourke, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reader, 2009</xref>). The subsequent Great Famine killed around 1 million people, and an additional million were forced to leave the island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Turner, 2005</xref>). Even today, the Irish population remains less than three quarters of what it was at the beginning of the 1840s. These dramatic consequences of the <italic>P. infestans</italic> epidemic were due to the absence of chemical and genetic methods to combat it; such means became available only several decades later.</p><p>Ever since triggering the Irish famine, <italic>P. infestans</italic> has continued to wreak havoc on potato fields throughout the world. Late blight remains the most destructive disease of the third largest food crop, resulting in annual losses of potatoes that would be sufficient to feed anywhere from 80 to many hundreds of millions of people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> is an extraordinarily virulent and adaptable pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fry, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haas et al., 2009</xref>). In agricultural systems, sexual reproduction may trigger explosive population shifts that are driven by the emergence and migration of asexual lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fry et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooke et al., 2012</xref>). The species is thought to originate from Toluca Valley, Mexico, where it infects wild relatives of potato, frequently undergoes sexual reproduction and co-occurs with the two closely related species <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> and <italic>P. ipomoeae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tooley et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goodwin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grünwald and Flier, 2005</xref>). In its center of origin, <italic>P. infestans</italic> is characterized by high levels of genetic and phenotypic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grünwald and Flier, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The genomes of a few <italic>P. infestans</italic> strains have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raffaele et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooke et al., 2012</xref>). Compared to other species in the genus, the 240 Mb T30-4 reference genome of <italic>P. infestans</italic> is large, with three quarters of the genome consisting of repetitive DNA. A large number of genes codes for effector proteins, many of which are delivered inside plant cells to promote host colonization, for instance by suppressing plant immunity. RXLR proteins, the main class of host-translocated effectors, are encoded by about 550 genes in the <italic>P. infestans</italic> T30-4 genome. RXLR effectors that can be recognized by plant immune receptors, known as Resistance (R) proteins, are said to have ‘avirulence’ activity. Upon introduction of a cognate <italic>R</italic> gene into the host population, such avirulence effectors become a liability for the pathogen, and natural selection favors the spread of pseudogenized or mutated alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vleeshouwers et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The detailed descriptions and drawings of Heinrich Anton de Bary and the reports of several other pioneers of plant pathology leave no doubt that the 19th century blight epidemic was triggered by <italic>P. infestans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Bary, 1876</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bourke, 1964</xref>). What remains controversial is the relationship of the 19th century strains to modern isolates. The quest for understanding the origin of the strain that resulted in the Irish famine began with extant samples. Prior to the late 1970s, global <italic>P. infestans</italic> populations outside of South America and Mexico, the centers of diversity of the host and the pathogen, were dominated by a single clonal lineage that had the mitochondrial (mtDNA) haplotype Ib and was called US-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goodwin et al., 1994</xref>). It was therefore proposed that the US-1 lineage was a direct descendant of the strain that first caused widespread late blight in North America from 1843 on, and then triggered the Irish famine beginning in 1845 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bourke, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goodwin et al., 1994</xref>). This hypothesis was subsequently directly addressed by PCR analysis of infected 19th century potato leaves stored in herbaria. The conclusion from these studies was that the historic strains belonged to a mtDNA haplotype, Ia, that was distinct from that of the US-1 lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ristaino et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">May and Ristaino, 2004</xref>). Because Ia was at the time not only the predominant haplotype in the Toluca Valley in Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gavino and Fry, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flier et al., 2003</xref>), but had also been found in South America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Perez et al., 2001</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">May and Ristaino (2004)</xref> speculated that the 19th century and US-1 lineages represented two independent epidemics of divergent lineages that had both originated in South America and spread from there to North America and Europe. A caveat was that these far-reaching conclusions were based on only three mtDNA SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ristaino et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">May and Ristaino, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Since these first herbarium analyses, the retrieval and sequencing of DNA from museum specimens, fossil remains and archaeological samples—collectively known as ancient DNA (aDNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pääbo et al., 2004</xref>)—have seen impressive advances thanks to the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies. The combined analysis of modern and ancient genomes of human pathogens has begun to solve important questions about their history and evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bos et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2012</xref>). Here we show that aDNA methods hold similar promise for plant pathology and that they can improve our understanding of historically important plant pathogen epidemics.</p><p>To determine how the historic <italic>P. infestans</italic> strain(s) relate to extant isolates, we shotgun-sequenced 11 herbarium samples of infected potato and tomato leaves collected from continental Europe, Great Britain, Ireland, and North America in the period from 1845 to 1896, and extracted information on <italic>P. infestans</italic> mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. To understand the subsequent evolution of the pathogen, we compared the historic <italic>P. infestans</italic> genomes to those of 15 modern 20th century strains that span the genetic diversity of the species, and to the two sister species <italic>P. ipomoeae</italic> and <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>. Our analyses revealed that the 19th century epidemic was caused by a single genotype, HERB-1, that persisted for at least 50 years. While it is distinct from all examined modern strains, HERB-1 is closely related to the 20th century US-1 genotype, suggesting that these two pandemic genotypes may have emerged from a secondary metapopulation rather than from the species’ Mexican center of diversity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Preservation of ancient DNA and genome statistics</title><p>Nineteenth-century samples of potato and tomato leaves with <italic>P. infestans</italic> lesions were obtained from the herbaria of the Botanische Staatssammlung München and the Kew Royal Botanical Gardens (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Shorter evolutionary time usually translate into branch shortening in phylogenetic trees that include both modern and ancient pathogen strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bos et al., 2011</xref>).

The molecular clock hypothesis for the modern strains could not be rejected at a 5% significance level (p=0.12). Therefore, a strict molecular clock and a birth-death tree prior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stadler, 2010</xref>) were used for the Bayesian framework analysis. Collection dates for all herbaria samples and the isolation dates for all modern strains were used as tip calibration points, so that substitution rates per time interval could be calculated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Three Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs with 147 million iterations were carried out. Stability of the estimated prior and posterior probability distributions (ESS values &gt;5000) and likelihood values (ESS values &gt;9000) were observed in the trace files throughout the merged iterations using the software Tracer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rambaut and Drummond, 2007</xref>). From this procedure, we estimated the mtDNA substitution rate to be 2.4 × 10<sup>−6</sup> per site and year (1.5–3.3 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, 95% HPD).

As a caveat, the random sampling of SNPs at heterozygous positions will inflate bootstrap support. Nevertheless, a heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) highlights that the two US-1 strains are both most closely related to HERB-1 and the most distinct among modern strains.

To test whether the global replacement of HERB-1 by US-1 in the 20th century was due to adaptive mutations, we searched for positively selected genes using PAML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang, 2007</xref>). We did not find any evidence for genes or sites that had experienced branch-specific positive selection in any of the lineages, only a mosaic pattern with potentially positively selected genes shared across lineages. Alternative scenarios could be that inactivating mutations were more important than non-synonymous substitutions, or that higher overall diversity and re-assortment of beneficial gene variants by recombination contributed to the success of US-1.</p><p>Genetic diversity can be increased by polyploidy, which has been reported in isolates of <italic>P. infestans</italic> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daggett et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Catal et al., 2010</xref>), and which has major evolutionary implications for asexual organisms. To estimate ploidy level in our specimens, we investigated the distribution of read counts at biallelic SNPs for high-coverage genomes. In a diploid species, the mean of read counts at heterozygous positions should have a single mode at 0.5, while there should be two modes, 0.33 and 0.67, for triploid genomes, and three modes, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 for tetraploid genomes. We compared the observed distributions of read counts with computational simulations of diploid, triploid and tetraploid genomes. Based on the shape and kurtosis of the distributions we concluded that the historic M-0182896 genome was apparently diploid. Of the modern genomes, only NL07434 and P17777 were diploid, whereas the majority, including the two US-1 strains DDR7602 and LBUS5 as well as P13527 and P13626 were triploid. One strain, 06_3928A, even seemed to be tetraploid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Because we wanted to interpret our findings in the context of extant genetic diversity, we investigated several modern strains as well. We could reconstruct the phylogenetic relationship between historic and modern strains using dozens of variants in complete mtDNA genomes, and millions of SNPs in the nuclear genomes, compared to previous work that had to rely on three mtDNA SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ristaino et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">May and Ristaino, 2004</xref>). The topologies of mtDNA and nuclear phylogenies were very similar, with the nuclear genomes yielding additional insights into differences in heterozygosity, ploidy levels and effector gene complement between historic and modern strains. Contrary to previous inferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ristaino et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">May and Ristaino, 2004</xref>), the 19th century strains are closely related to the modern US-1 lineage, but are characterized by a single, distinct mtDNA haplotype, HERB-1. Finally, from estimates of the divergence times of the different lineages, we were able to associate key events in <italic>P. infestans</italic> evolution with historic records of human migration and late blight spread.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Relationship between historical and modern strains</title><p>Historic strains from different geographic locations all carried a mtDNA haplotype, HERB-1, that had not been recognized before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Although collected over a period of 50 years, the strains were distinguished from each other by few nuclear SNPs, indicating that the 19th century outbreak was a true pandemic of a rapidly spreading clonal genotype. That HERB-1 has so far not been found in any modern strain may point to its extinction after the 19th century pandemic, possibly associated with the onset of resistance gene breeding in the 20th century. We cannot, however, exclude that HERB-1 still infects some localized, genetically unimproved host populations, since we have explored only a fraction of current <italic>P. infestans</italic> genetic diversity. With the diagnostic variants we have discovered, one can now probe modern populations to determine whether or not HERB-1 still persists somewhere.</p><p>Historic pathogen samples are molecular fossils that can be used as tip calibration points to estimate major divergence events in the evolution of a pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bos et al., 2011</xref>). Using the collection dates of the herbarium samples and isolation dates of the modern <italic>P. infestans</italic> strains, we estimated that type I and type II mtDNA haplotypes diverged close to the beginning of the 16th century (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). This coincides with the first contact between Americans and Europeans in Mexico, which potentially fuelled <italic>P. infestans</italic> population migration and expansion outside its center of diversity. This major event in human history might thus have been responsible for wider dissemination of the <italic>P. infestans</italic> pathogen in the New World, several centuries before its introduction to Europe. In addition, the divergence estimates allowed us to date the split between <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> and <italic>P. infestans</italic> about 1300 ya. Even though this was firmly during the period of pre-Columbian civilization, what led to their relatively recent speciation remains unknown.</p><p>To test the congruence of mtDNA and nuclear phylogenies, we reconstructed phylogenies with over 4 million nuclear SNPs from high-quality genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This confirmed the historic sample M-0182896 as a sister group to US-1 strains, a conclusion that was supported by a broader analysis that included the low-coverage historic samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The private SNPs shared by the HERB-1 lineage ruled out that US-1 isolates are, as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goodwin et al., 1994</xref>), direct descendants of the historic strains. Nevertheless, US-1 is more closely related to the historic strains than to the modern strains that have come to dominate the global population in the past two decades.</p><p>We therefore propose a revision of the previous scenario, which posited that a single <italic>P. infestans</italic> lineage migrated around 1842 or 1843 from Mexico to North America, from where it was soon transferred to Europe, followed by global dissemination and persistence for over hundred years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goodwin et al., 1994</xref>). Our data make it likely that by the late 1970s, direct descendants of HERB-1 had either become rare or extinct. On the other hand, the close relationship between HERB-1 and US-1 suggests that the US-1 lineage originated from a similar source as HERB-1, with our divergence estimates indicating that the two lineages separated only in the early 19th century. Given the much greater genetic diversity at the species’ likely origin in Mexico, it seems unlikely that HERB-1 and US-1 spread independently from this region. An alternative scenario is that a small <italic>P. infestans</italic> metapopulation was established at the periphery of its center of origin, or even outside Mexico, possibly in North America, some time before the first global <italic>P. infestans</italic> pandemic. The first lineage to spread from there was HERB-1, which persisted globally for at least half a century. Subsequently, the US-1 lineage expanded and spread, replacing HERB-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00731.025</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Suggested paths of migration and diversification of <italic>P. infestans</italic> lineages HERB-1 and US-1.</title><p>The location of the metapopulation that gave rise to HERB-1 and US-1 remains uncertain; here it is proposed to have been in North America.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00731.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00731.025</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00731-fig11-v1.tif"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Genetic and genomic differences between historic and modern strains</title><p>Host <italic>R</italic> genes that confer resistance to historic <italic>P. infestans</italic> strains, such as <italic>R3a</italic>, were bred into cultivated potato <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> from the wild species <italic>S. demissum</italic> at the beginning of the 20th century, years after our youngest historic sample had been collected in 1896.

Polyploidization could have provided an opportunity for US-1 isolates to enhance allelic diversity in the absence of frequent sexual reproduction, and could thus have contributed to their global success. Asexual reproduction leads to an increase of deleterious mutation in the population due to a lack of meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Felsenstein, 1974</xref>). Therefore, if the major selection pressure that led to the replacement of HERB-1 by US-1 was the introduction of resistance gene breeding, greater variation at effector genes in polyploid US-1 strains could have contributed to the replacement of HERB-1 soon after <italic>R</italic> genes from <italic>S. demissum</italic> and other wild species had been introduced into modern potato germplasm.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We present the first genome-wide analyses of historic plant pathogen strains.

For herbarium and modern samples with genome-wide coverage depth less than 20×, we merged BAM files from each strain into a single BAM file, and used this to estimated breadth of coverage.</p><p>We also tested for presence/absence polymorphisms of RXLR effector genes between herbarium samples and modern strains using de novo assembly of short reads. First, we extracted 140 bp fragments from M-0182896 merged reads, and assembled these with SOAPdenovo v1.05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luo et al., 2012</xref>). We aligned the six-frame translation of resulting contigs to a non-redundant protein database using blastx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>). Most contigs matched proteins from either potato, <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic>, or to microbial species <italic>P. infestans</italic>, <italic>Pantoea vagans</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. To focus on <italic>P. infestans</italic>, we aligned fragments that were at least 140 bp to the genomes of <italic>P. infestans</italic>, <italic>S. tuberosum</italic>, <italic>P. vagans</italic>, <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>syringae</italic>, and <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> with blastn. We extracted fragments that aligned the <italic>P. infestans</italic> genomic regions encoding RXLR effector genes, but over at most 90 bp. These and unmapped fragments were de novo assembled with SOAPdenovo v1.05. A <italic>k</italic>-mer size of 67 was deemed optimal, because it resulted in the highest coverage of <italic>Avr1</italic>, <italic>Avr2</italic> and <italic>Avr3a</italic>, and resulted in the largest number of RXLR proteins with TBLASTN hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). We obtained partial sequences of <italic>Avr4</italic> and <italic>Avrblb1.</italic> We visually evaluated BWA alignments of M-0182896 in the <italic>Avr4</italic> and <italic>Avrblb1</italic> genomic regions and identified T30-4 sequences uncovered by alignments using Integrative Genomics Viewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>). We then identified T30-4 genomic regions with at least 99% similarity to these uncovered regions. In BWA, if reads match several genomic regions, one genomic location is randomly chosen as default (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>). Thus, it is possible that BWA alignment distributes reads coming from the same gene across several, closely related genes in the target genome. We assembled such reads that mapped to closely related sequences in the reference genome together with the partial sequences of <italic>Avr4</italic> and <italic>Avrblb1</italic> using Geneious Pro 5.6.3 to obtain full-length sequences of these <italic>Avr</italic> genes.</p></sec><sec id="s5-7"><title>Selection tests</title><p>Homozygous SNPs from modern <italic>P. infestans</italic> strains EC3527, EC3626, NL07434, 06_3928A, DDR7602, LBUS5, P17777 and the historic strain M-0182896 were used for selection tests. Gene sequences were converted into amino acid sequences using EMBOSS tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rice et al., 2000</xref>), and Pla2Nal v14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suyama et al., 2006</xref>) was used to convert protein alignments to codon alignments. The codeml module of PAML package v4.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang, 2007</xref>) was used for positive selection studies with site models M7 (parameters NSsites = 7, fix_omega = 0, omega = 2 and kappa = 3) and M8 (NSsites = 8, fix_omega = 0, omega = 2 and kappa = 3). A 5% level of significance was established with Likelihood ratio test. Genes were considered to be under positive selection if at least one site was found to be under selection with a Bayes Empirical Bayes confidence &gt;95%.</p></sec><sec id="s5-8"><title>Ploidy analyses</title><p>To estimate ploidy levels, we assessed the distributions of read counts at biallelic SNPs. For diploid species, the mean frequency of reads for each allele at non-homozygous sites is 1/2, while we expect two modes for triploid genomes, at 1/3 and 2/3, and four modes for tetraploid genomes, at 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We simulated genomes with different ploidy levels using pIRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu et al., 2012</xref>), based on two strains, <italic>P. infestans</italic> T30-4 and EC3527. The SNPs used for the construction of two simulated chromosomes were determined with SAMtools v0.1.8 mpileup and bcftools v0.1.17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2009</xref>). For the diploid genome, we simulated 10x coverage reads for each of two different chromosomes. For the triploid genome, we merged simulated 5× and 15× coverage reads from two different chromosomes. For the tetraploid genome, we merged simulated 10× coverage reads from two different chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Next, we aligned the simulated reads to the <italic>P. infestans</italic> T30-4 reference genome with BWA and called heterozygous SNPs under the following criteria: minimum coverage of 10 for high-quality calls, and concordance between 20% and 80% for heterozygous SNPs. Since tetraploid species are considered to be a mixtures of two ratio, we mixed SNPs from the 20× coverage diploid reads and the 20× coverage tetraploid reads in following ratios: 0:100, 10:90, 20:80, 30:70, 40:60, 50:50, 60:40, 70:30, 80:20, 90:10 and 100:0. Finally, we estimated frequency of reads assigning each allele at each SNP position. Based on shapes, standard deviation, skewedness and kurtosis of the observed distributions and comparison with the simulated distributions, we classified the tested <italic>P. infestans</italic> genomes as diploid, triploid and tetraploid.</p></sec><sec id="s5-9"><title>Substitution rates and divergence times for <italic>P. infestans</italic></title><p>In order to test whether we can detect a temporal signal in the ancient <italic>P. infestans</italic> mtDNA sequences compared to modern strains, that is, shorter branches in the ancient strains compared to the modern ones, we calculated the nucleotide distance as the number of substitutions between HERB-1, haplotype Ia and haplotype Ib mtDNA genomes to the outgroup P17777. The analysis involved 19 nucleotide sequences. All positions with less than 90% site coverage were eliminated, resulting in 34,174 informative positions. The samples were subsequently grouped into ancient and modern strains. The ancient and modern nucleotide distances were significantly different (Mann–Whitney U-test, p=0.0003). We furthermore correlated the nucleotide distance of HERB-1, haplotype Ia and haplotype Ib mtDNA genomes to the outgroup P17777 with the tip age of each sample.</p><p>To estimate divergence times of <italic>P. infestans</italic> strains, substitution rates were calculated in a Bayesian framework analysis using the software package BEAST 1.7.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drummond et al., 2012</xref>). A multiple sequence alignment that included all 12 nearly complete modern <italic>P. infestans</italic> mtDNA sequences plus all 13 herbaria samples was used as input. In order to test if the mtDNAs evolved clock like a likelihood ratio test was performed in MEGA5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tamura et al., 2011</xref>) by comparing the maximum likelihood (ML) value for the given topology using only the modern strains with and without the molecular clock constraints. The null hypothesis of equal evolutionary rate throughout the tree was not rejected at a 5% significance level (p=0.115). All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated resulting in a total of 22,591 positions in the final dataset.</p><p>As a result a strict molecular clock and the HKY sequence evolution model were used for the Bayesian framework. For the tree prior, five different models were tested including four coalescence models: constant size, expansion growth, exponential growth, logistic growth and a epidemiology birth–death model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stadler, 2010</xref>). For each tree prior, three MCMC runs were carried out with 10,000,000 iterations each and subsequently merged using LogCombiner 1.7.5 from the BEAST package. Resulting ESS values and overall posterior likelihoods were compared using the software Tracer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rambaut and Drummond, 2007</xref>). The birth-death model gave the highest ESS values and posterior likelihood and was therefore chosen for the subsequent dating analysis. The collection dates for all herbaria samples as well as the isolation dates for all modern strains were used as tip calibration points (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Three MCMC runs were carried out with 50,000,000 iterations each, sampling every 10,000 steps. The first 1,000,000 iterations were discarded as burn-in resulting in a total of 147,000,000 iterations.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are indebted to Bryn Dentinger, curator of the herbarium of the Kew Royal Botanical Gardens, and to Dagmar Triebel, curator of the herbarium of the Botanische Staatssammlung München, for providing the historic specimens used in this study.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 4 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission want to reveal their identity: David Baulcombe (Reviewing editor); Paul Birch (peer reviewer); William Fry (peer reviewer).</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this is an interesting and important paper. It draws on both the availability of historic samples of <italic>P. infestans</italic> and the power of next-generation sequencing to re-evaluate the 19th century pandemic that precipitated the Irish Famine. Overall, the conclusion of a single clonal lineage, HERB-1, dominating the late blight population outside of Mexico for at least 50 years, closely related to US-1, but perhaps giving way to variants derived from the latter, is well supported by the data. The derivation of both HERB-1 and US-1 from a common ancestor within a “metapopulation” outside of Mexico, the accepted centre of <italic>P. infestans</italic> diversity, again seems likely. Of interest is the apparent increase in ploidy levels in 20th century isolates, compared to HERB-1 and US-1, although it should be stressed that this is based entirely on projected allele frequencies (rather than backed up by other means).</p><p>In addition, there is part of the analysis that they consider to lack detail and that the conclusions may be reaching too far. These concerns are summarised by one of the reviewers who writes:</p> <p>1) The authors state: “Given that nineteenth century potato strains [surely they mean cultivars?] in North America and Europe did not yet contain resistance genes to control HERB-1, one would expect HERB-1 to contain a full effector gene complement”, as it has not yet been disrupted “…by the selective forces imposed by resistance gene breeding”. What exactly is meant by a “full effector gene complement”? I guess they intend the focus to be on avirulences recognised by the <italic>S. demissum R</italic> genes? These would be AVR1, 2, 3a, 3b, and 4 of those shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>; the others are not pertinent to their line of logic. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, the coverage of AVR2 is 100% for the isolate 06_3928A, a “Blue_13” genotype representative. Actually, this genotype lacks AVR2, expressing instead AVR2-like, which suggests that the % coverage they show in this table is lacking the detail to reach their conclusion: “consistent with the expectation that the HERB-1 genotype was avirulent on the first potato cultivars that acquired late blight resistance through breeding”. The focus is on AVR3a, and it is interesting that the KI allele alone exists in the HERB-1 lineage. Did they specifically amplify and sequence this gene from all of the herbarium samples? If their conclusions are based entirely on sequence assemblies (from NGS of ancient DNA), then they need to be backed up by additional experiments. AVR4 has been well documented to be “lost” through mutation that leads to truncated proteins. Is AVR4 intact in the historical samples? I am surprised by the apparent absence of <italic>Avr3b</italic>. This is a gene that is conserved in <italic>P. parasitica</italic>, for example. Indeed, they show good coverage in mirabilis and ipomeae in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. Did they specifically check this absence by alternative means (i.e., PCR and sequencing)?</p><p>2) The reviewers believe that these concerns can be addressed in a straightforward fashion, if you amplify and directly study AVR3a (done), AVR2/2-like and AVR4 sequences across the samples to add weight to conclusions about HERB-1 being avirulent. You could also include <italic>Avrblb1</italic>, <italic>avrBlb2</italic>, and <italic>AvrVnt1</italic> in this, as controls. The corresponding <italic>R</italic> genes have not been bred into the cultivated potato, so they represent a contrast in terms of the selection pressures that they refer to in 20th century breeding efforts (i.e., introduction of the demissum <italic>R</italic> genes).</p><p>Please respond to these suggestions, including additional data where appropriate, in a revised manuscript.</p><p>An expert reviewer on phylogenetic analysis makes the following substantive point:</p><p>3) Before running the BEAST analysis, the modern sequences alone are clock tested. I doubt whether these data contain enough signal to detect substantial rate variation, but it is important to test whether there is enough temporal signal in the data to trust the dating analyses.</p><p>To do this, it is common to correlate the sampling date against the root-to-tip distance from the ML tree (or NJ tree). This would give a visual indication of the amount of temporal signal in these data (e.g., Harris et al. Science 2010). Second, (and optionally) it is also common to carry out randomisation tests, rerunning the BEAST dating analyses a few times after randomly permuting the sampling dates (see e.g., Firth et al. MBE 2010).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00731.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Of interest is the apparent increase in ploidy levels in 20th century isolates, compared to HERB-1 and US-1, although it should be stressed that this is based entirely on projected allele frequencies (rather than backed up by other means)</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for your interest in the change of ploidy levels in 20th century isolates.

These would be AVR1, 2, 3a, 3b, and 4 of those shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"><italic>Table 2</italic></xref><italic>; the others are not pertinent to their line of logic</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for your careful comments. We agree that the expression “full effector gene complement” may lead to a misunderstanding and we modified the text accordingly. As you indicated, our focus is on the genes encoding the avirulence effectors AVR1, AVR2, AVR3a, AVR3b, and AVR4, whose cognate <italic>R</italic> genes were introduced from <italic>S. demissum</italic> through breeding. We rewrote the paragraph on “Effector genes” to better describe the targeted avirulence effectors, particularly those that were the targets of the first breeding efforts.</p><p><italic>In</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"><italic>Table 2</italic></xref><italic>, the coverage of AVR2 is 100% for the isolate 06_3928A, a “Blue_13” genotype representative. Actually, this genotype lacks AVR2, expressing instead AVR2-like, which suggests that the % coverage they show in this table is lacking the detail to reach their conclusion: “consistent with the expectation that the HERB-1 genotype was avirulent on the first potato cultivars that acquired late blight resistance through breeding”. The focus is on AVR3a, and it is interesting that the KI allele alone exists in the HERB-1 lineage. Did they specifically amplify and sequence this gene from all of the herbarium samples? If their conclusions are based entirely on sequence assemblies (from NGS of ancient DNA), then they need to be backed up by additional experiments. AVR4 has been well documented to be “lost” through mutation that leads to truncated proteins. Is</italic> AVR4 <italic>intact in the historical samples? I am surprised by the apparent absence of</italic> Avr3b. <italic>This is a gene that is conserved in</italic> P. parasitica, <italic>for example. Indeed, they show good coverage in mirabilis and ipomeae in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. Did they specifically check this absence by alternative means (i.e., PCR and sequencing)</italic>?</p><p>We appreciate the detailed review of the data and we acknowledge that we did not provide enough details for experts in the field. We now provide details on the alleles of the avirulence effectors we examined in a new table and source data files. In all cases, the alleles recovered are known to be recognized by the corresponding <italic>R</italic> genes and are therefore in their “avirulence” configuration.</p> <p>We rechecked the coverage of <italic>AVR2 (PITG_22870)</italic> using both alignments to the reference genome and de novo assembly of HERB-1 sequences. The coverage of <italic>AVR2</italic> for the isolate 06_3928A is 81%. There are 15 amino acid differences between the <italic>R2‐recognized AVR2</italic> and unrecognized <italic>AVR2‐like</italic> (FigureS4 in Gilroy et al. New Phytologist 191, 763-76 [2011]). We aligned short reads using BWA software. The BWA cannot align short reads on highly polymorphic regions. This means that we can discriminate <italic>AVR2</italic> and <italic>AVR2‐like</italic> based on the coverage of aligned short reads when the data has enough depth coverage. On the other hand, we could rebuild full length of <italic>AVR2</italic> from HERB-1 reads. We also compared amino acid sequences of HERB-1 with those of the intact <italic>AVR2</italic> and <italic>AVR2‐like</italic>. The deduced HERB-1 <italic>AVR2</italic> sequences were not consistent with those of <italic>AVR2‐like</italic> and instead matched the intact <italic>AVR2</italic> known to have the avirulence activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gilroy et al. 2011</xref>).</p><p>We also could not find any frame shift and nonsense mutations in <italic>AVR1, AVR2, AVR3a</italic>, and <italic>AVR4</italic>. We thus conclude that the HERB-1 genotype was presumably avirulent on the first potato cultivars, before these acquired the corresponding late blight resistance genes. We revised the manuscript and added <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref> showing amino acid differences among <italic>P. infestans</italic> isolates T30-4, HERB-1, DDR7602 (US1-genotype). We also provide a fasta file of HERB-1 effector amino acid sequences to clarify that our conclusion is based on both coverage and amino acid sequences.</p><p>Regarding <italic>AVR3b, R3a</italic> and <italic>R3b</italic> are genetically linked, being 0.4 cM apart in the complex <italic>R3</italic> locus (Li, et al. MPMI Vol. 24, No. 10, 2011, pp. 1132–1142). Based on the absence of an <italic>Avr3b</italic> gene in HERB-1, we conclude that initial introgression of the <italic>R3</italic> locus from <italic>S. demissum</italic> was based on resistance conferred by the <italic>R3a</italic> gene. The <italic>R3</italic> phenotype scored during the initial introgression must have been the recognition of <italic>Avr3a</italic> by <italic>R3a</italic>. What would have truly surprising is if both <italic>Avr3a</italic> and <italic>Avr3b</italic> were missing in HERB‐1. We added a paragraph to discuss <italic>Avr3b</italic>.</p><p><italic>2) The reviewers believe that these concerns can be addressed in a straightforward fashion, if you amplify and directly study AVR3a (done), AVR2/2-like and AVR4 sequences across the samples to add weight to conclusions about HERB-1 being avirulent. You could also include Avrblb1, avrBlb2, and AvrVnt1 in this, as controls. The corresponding</italic> R <italic>genes have not been bred into the cultivated potato, so they represent a contrast in terms of the selection pressures that they refer to in 20th century breeding efforts (i.e., introduction of the demissum</italic> R <italic>genes)</italic>.</p><p>We agree that PCR amplification and direct sequencing of the <italic>Avr</italic> effector genes of 19th century <italic>P. infestans</italic> would be ideal to complement the described methods and confirm our results based on Illumina short reads. Unfortunately, in general, ancient DNA is heavily fragmentized. In fact, the average length of our 19th century <italic>P. infestans</italic> libraries is rather short (∼70 bp). Hundreds of PCR amplifications would be necessary to reconstruct the effector genes consuming far more DNA extract than what was used for all complete genome reconstructions. Such a project would be extremely challenging and would likely result much more molecular biology effort than the genome wide reconstruction. In fact, PCR approaches have been largely abandoned in the ancient DNA field due to the waste of precious material, a high contamination risk, and their low efficiency (Knapp &amp; Hofreiter, Genes 1, 227-43 [2010]; Stoneking &amp; Krause, <italic>Nat. Rev. Genet</italic> 12, 603-14 [2011]). The whole‐genome sequencing using next-generation sequencing methods approach is therefore currently seen as the most reliable and efficient way to reconstruct ancient genomic regions.</p><p>Note also that our analyses were based on both short read alignments and de-novo assembly. These two approaches increase likelihood of accuracy of the deduced sequences of <italic>Avr</italic> genes.</p><p><italic>An expert reviewer on phylogenetic analysis makes the following substantive point</italic>:</p><p><italic>3) Before running the BEAST analysis, the modern sequences alone are clock tested. I doubt whether these data contain enough signal to detect substantial rate variation, but it is important to test whether there is enough temporal signal in the data to trust the dating analyses</italic>.</p><p><italic>To do this, it is common to correlate the sampling date against the root-to-tip distance from the ML tree (or NJ tree). This would give a visual indication of the amount of temporal signal in these data (e.g., Harris et al. Science 2010). Second, (and optionally) it is also common to carry out randomisation tests, rerunning the BEAST dating analyses a few times after randomly permuting the sampling dates (see e.g., Firth et al. MBE 2010)</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it should be shown that there is a temporal relationship between the age of a sample and the branch length when we compare HERB-1 and modern strains before we perform a dating analysis. We have therefore added an analysis where we calculate the nucleotide distance between <italic>P. infestans</italic> mtDNAs of the outgroup P17777 to all strains falling into the HERB-1/haplotype Ia/haplotype Ib clade. We grouped the distances in ancient and modern strains and found them to be significantly different. As the reviewer suggested, we further correlated branch length (in nucleotide distance) to the sampling age for each strain and found a strong correlation (r2=0.8). Both analyses were added to the main text and the Materials and methods, and give the dating analysis additional support.</p><p>As we have already done three independent Beast runs with 150 million generations each, all of which produced very similar results, we think that further Beast runs are not necessary and would not change our results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
