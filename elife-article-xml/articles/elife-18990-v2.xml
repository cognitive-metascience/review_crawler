However, the lineage of these modern organisms co-evolved with our planet. Hence, these organisms carry both ancestral and acquired genes and serve as models to reconstruct early metabolism. Based on comparative genomic and proteomic analyses, we identified two distinct groups of genes in <italic>Thermovibrio ammonificans</italic>: the first codes for enzymes that do not require oxygen and use substrates of geothermal origin; the second appears to be a more recent acquisition, and may reflect adaptations to cope with the rise of oxygen on Earth. We propose that the ancestor of the <italic>Aquificae</italic> was originally a hydrogen oxidizing, sulfur reducing bacterium that used a hybrid pathway for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. With the gradual rise of oxygen in the atmosphere, more efficient terminal electron acceptors became available and this lineage acquired genes that increased its metabolic flexibility while retaining ancestral metabolic traits.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18990.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18990.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18990.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Life may have arisen on our planet as far back as four billion years ago. Unlike today, the Earth’s atmosphere at the time had no oxygen and an abundance of volcanic emissions including hydrogen, carbon dioxide and sulfur gases. These dramatic differences have led scientists to wonder: how did the ancient microorganisms that inhabited our early planet make a living? And how has microbial life co-evolved with the Earth?</p><p>One way to answer these questions is to study bacteria that live today in environments that resemble the early Earth. Deep-sea hydrothermal vents are regions of the deep ocean where active volcanic processes recreate primordial conditions. These habitats support microorganisms that are highly adapted to live off hydrogen, carbon dioxide and sulfur gases, and studying these modern-day microorganisms could give insights into the earliest life on Earth.</p><p><italic>Thermovibrio ammonificans</italic> is a bacterium that was obtained from an underwater volcanic system in the East Pacific. Giovannelli et al. have now asked if <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> might have inherited some of its genetic traits from a long-gone ancestor that also thrived off volcanic gases. The genetic makeup of this microorganism was examined for genes that would help it thrive at a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. Next, Giovannelli et al. compared these genes to related copies in other species of bacteria to reconstruct how the metabolism of <italic>T. ammonifican</italic>s might have changed over time.</p><p>This approach identified a group of likely ancient genesthat allow a microorganism to use chemicals like hydrogen, carbon dioxide and sulfur to fuel its growth and metabolism. These findings support the hypothesis that an ancestor of <italic>T. ammonifican</italic>s could live off volcanic gases and that the core set of genes involved in those activities had been passed on, through the generations, to this modern-day microorganism. Giovannelli et al. also identified a second group of genes in <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> that indicate that this bacterium also co-evolved with Earth’s changing conditions, in particular the rise in the concentration of oxygen.</p><p>The findings of Giovannelli et al. provide insight into how the metabolism of microbes has co-evolved with the Earth’s changing conditions, and will allow others to formulate new hypotheses that can be tested in laboratory experiments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

The emergence of a reductive acetyl-CoA pathway has been associated with the FeS-rich minerals at alkaline hydrothermal vents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martin and Russell, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wächtershäuser, 1988a</xref>) and the presence of homologous core enzymes in both <italic>Bacteria</italic> and <italic>Archaea</italic> potentially support its ancestral nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuchs, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Russell and Martin, 2004</xref>). The rTCA cycle is considered the modern version of a proposed prebiotic autocatalytic cycle fueled by the formation of the highly insoluble mineral pyrite in sulfur-rich hydrothermal environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wächtershäuser, 1988b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">1990</xref>).

A recent phylometabolic reconstruction hypothesized that all extant pathways can be derived from an ancestral carbon fixation network consisting of a hybrid rTCA cycle / reductive acetyl-CoA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braakman and Smith, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used a comparative genomic approach coupled to proteomic analyses to reconstruct the central metabolism of <italic>Thermovibrio ammonificans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giovannelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vetriani et al., 2004</xref>), and provide evidence of ancestral and acquired metabolic traits in the genome of this bacterium. We suggest that the last common ancestor within the <italic>Aquificae</italic> possessed the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway in addition to the previously described rTCA cycle. Furthermore, we show that these two pathways may still coexist within the <italic>Desulfurobacteraceae</italic> lineage. The simultaneous presence of both pathways of carbon fixation may represent a modern analog of the early carbon fixation phenotype, and suggests that the redundancy of central metabolic pathways could have been common in ancestral microorganisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>General genome structure and central metabolism of <italic>T. ammonificans.</italic></title><p>The genome of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> HB-1 consists of one chromosome and one plasmid of 1,682,965 bp and 76,561 bp, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

In the two-step variant – also known as symmetric variant, with respect to the enzymatic reaction catalyzed in the two arcs of the rTCA cycle – citrate cleavage is accomplished by the combined action of the enzymes citryl-CoA synthetase (CCS) and citryl-CoA lyase (CCL) and the carboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate is catalyzed by 2-oxoglutarate carboxylase and oxalosuccinate reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoshima, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoshima and Igarashi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hügler and Sievert, 2011</xref>).

By contrast, in the one-step variant of the rTCA cycle, also known as asymmetric variant and more widely distributed, the cleavage of citrate and the carboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate are performed in a one-step fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braakman and Smith, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hügler et al., 2007</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The key enzyme of this carbon fixation pathway, which is found in acetogens, methanogens, sulfate-reducers and anaerobic ammonium oxidizers (anammox; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berg et al., 2010</xref>), is the bifunctional heterotetramer enzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase (CODH/ACS). The reductive acetyl-CoA pathway is believed to be the most ancient carbon fixation pathway on Earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuchs, 2011</xref>).

However, rather than coding for the classical bifunctional type II CodH, <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> codes for the type V, which is present in numerous deep-branching organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and whose function is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Techtmann et al., 2012</xref>). Sequence analysis of the <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> CodH protein sequence revealed the presence of conserved residues necessary for the interaction with Acs and for the coordination of the NiFeS cluster. We hypothesize that the type V CodH, which, based on structural and size considerations may represent the most ancestral version of this class of enzymes (Frank Robb, personal communication), may catalyze the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to CO. The <italic>codh</italic> gene of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> shared high similarity with that of <italic>D. thermolithotrophum</italic> (87 similarity), while the similarity with the next closest homologous genes dropped below 54%.

The two genomes also share a CodH iron-sulfur accessory protein (Theam_0999 and Dester_0418, 81% similarity).

The first cluster is composed of eight genes encoding for the complete Group 4 Ech hydrogenases (<italic>echABCDEFG,</italic> Theam_0476–0482) and the alpha, beta, gamma and delta subunits of the Group 3b multimeric cytoplasmic Hyd sulfhydrogenase (<italic>hydABCD</italic>, Theam_0484–0487).

We also found other hydrogenase maturation factors (Theam_0922–0924) and the formate dehydrogenase Fdh (<italic>fdhABC</italic>, Theam_1020 and Theam_0966–0967 respectively) scattered in the genome.</p><p>We reconstructed the phylogeny of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> [NiFe]-hydrogenases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and we assigned them to known classes of hydrogenases (Groups 1 through 4) according to their phylogenetic position in the tree and the presence of known conserved amino acid motifs typical of each group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vignais and Billoud, 2007</xref>). Group 1 [NiFe]-hydrogenases are normally coupled to anaerobic respiration through electron transfer to the membrane quinone and menaquinone pool.

Together with Group 3b sulfhydrogenases and Group 4 Ech, F420-reducing hydrogenases are in fact typically found in methanogens in which the F420-cofactor is used as an electron carrier in the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> or other C1 compounds to methane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vignais and Billoud, 2007</xref>). Cultures of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> grown with nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor did not present the typical autofluorescence of methanogens due to F420-cofactor fluorescence when observed under UV in epifluorescence microscopy and the genome lacks the gene involved in the biosynthetic pathway of the F420-coenzyme. Due to these observations, we suggest that these hydrogenases may work in conjunction with ferredoxin in <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>. Group 3b Hyd sulfhydrogenases appear to be of mixed origins despite being present in a single operon. Three of the subunits share similarities with the <italic>Thermococcales</italic> (<italic>Euryarchaeota; hydBCD</italic>) while the catalytic subunit (HydA) appears to be unique to the <italic>Desulfurobacteriacea</italic>, not having any other significant homolog in the database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

S-adenosyl-L-methionine provides activated methyl groups for use in the methylation of proteins, RNA, DNA and certain metabolites central to the core cell machinery. The activated methyl cycle exists in two recognized forms, involving respectively <italic>luxS</italic> or <italic>sahH</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vendeville et al., 2005</xref>).

The methyl group is thus activated and readily available for the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase (<italic>samT</italic>) for methylation of substrate. In <italic>T. ammonificans, samT</italic> is a pseudogene, as it contains two stop codons (Theam_0630).

The pathway is missing reaction 2, the formyl-THF synthesis for which no obvious 10-formyl-THF synthetase was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, the 10-formyl-THF synthetase of the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway may have been replaced by alternative enzymes, such as 5-formyl-THF cycloligase (Theam_1206) or 10-formyl-THF deformylase (Theam_0826) working in reverse (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Assuming low substrate specificity, other candidate enzymes with similar substrate requirements are the phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase (Theam_1211) or phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase (Theam_0328), which could catalyze the synthesis of formyl-THF, albeit with sub-optimal kinetics. While all four enzymes were detected in the proteomic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we think that the possible involvement of a 5-formyl-THF cycloligase in the synthesis of formyl-THF in <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> is particularly appealing, as this would provide an evolutionary link between the N<sup>5</sup>-formate uptake of methanogens and N<sup>10</sup>-formate uptake in acetogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braakman and Smith, 2012</xref>).

The order and position of the hydrogenase and NADP dehydrogenase clusters were highly conserved also in <italic>C. mediatlanticus</italic>, while flagellar genes were scattered throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These results suggest that the genes encoding hydrogen utilization and functions related to energy conversion are among the oldest genomic regions present in those organisms, and overall are conserved across phyla. When we analyzed the central metabolism of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> using comparative genomic approaches, the presence of two distinct groups of genes became evident: the first group was related to early-branching bacterial or archaeal lineages and coded for enzymes involved in several central metabolic pathways, while the second group of genes appeared to have been acquired later. Among the first group of genes, we identified: (I) the cytoplasmic [Ni-Fe]-hydrogenases Group 3 that were related to the enzymes found in methanogens and thermophilic <italic>Euryarchaeota,</italic> in which they are involved in ferredoxin reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>); (II) sulfur-reduction related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>); and (III) the genes coding for the enzymes of the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These pathways are either present in early branching <italic>Archaea</italic>, or are directly involved in metabolic reactions that do not require oxygen (or oxygen by-products) and use substrates of geothermal origin that are likely to have been abundant on Early Earth. Moreover, most key reactions in these pathways are catalyzed by enzymes that are extremely sensitive to oxygen. Our findings are consistent with a recent reconstruction of the ancestral genome of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA), which suggest that LUCA was a hydrogen-dependent autotroph capable of S utilization that could fix CO2 via the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weiss et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that part of the central metabolism of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> is ancestral and emerged prior to oxygenic photosynthesis.</p><p>By contrast, some genes and associated metabolic pathways appear to have been acquired by the <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> lineage at a later time. One example is the ability to conserve energy by nitrate reduction. The hypothesis that nitrate respiration is an acquired trait in <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> is supported by the structure of the <italic>nap</italic> operon. The monomeric <italic>napA</italic> gene of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> is homologous to that of <italic>Desulfovibrio desulfuricans</italic> and other <italic>Deltaproteobacteria</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; online interactive version) and apparently has been acquired laterally. Furthermore, it shares high similarity with assimilatory nitrate reductases (Nas) and it could be an evolutionary intermediate form between assimilatory Nas and the dimeric respiratory Nap. In line with this observation, phylogenetic analyses suggest that the membrane bound [Ni-Fe]-hydrogenases of Group 1 and 4 are of delta/epsilonproteobacterial origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Based on the finding that Group 1 Hyn hydrogenases were expressed when <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> was grown under nitrate-reducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we suggest that these enzymes are linked through the membrane quinone pool to nitrate reduction and may have been acquired simultaneously with the <italic>nap</italic> genes.</p><p>A second example is represented by the oxygen radical detoxification enzymes encoded by the genome of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>. We propose that such genes are not part of the core, or ancestral genome of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>, but that they evolved as a response to exposure to toxic oxygen radicals. In the modern ocean, catalase and peroxidase may provide protection to oxygen-sensitive enzymes during transient exposure to oxygen associated with entrainment of deep seawater in hydrothermal fluids, or when the organism is displaced into the water column. This second scenario may have important implication for the dispersal of vent microorganisms to other vent sites. We hypothesize that <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> is able to deal with oxygen exposures using two different mechanisms: the first response mechanism would be activated following exposure to oxygen at physiological temperatures (60–80°C). In that case, the oxygen-stress related genes are induced, protecting the cell machinery against damages. The second mechanism would be a response to prolonged exposure to oxygen at temperatures below the physiological threshold. Such prolonged exposure would trigger a metabolic shut-down, enabling survival of the organism in cold seawater. The latter hypothesis is supported by experiments where batch cultures of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> were exposed for a prolonged time at 4°C, which revealed the survival of the bacterium despite being exposed to oxygen (data not shown).</p><p>In conclusion, the nitrate reduction pathway, as well as oxygen stress-related genes, may represent adaptations acquired by the <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> lineage to cope with the rise of oxygen on Earth.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Insight into the evolution of carbon fixation</title><p>Six different pathways of carbon fixation are known to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuchs, 2011</xref>). In the modern biosphere, the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle is the dominant mechanism of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. Yet, other anaerobic pathways have been investigated and are proposed to represent the ancestral autotrophic carbon fixation pathway. In particular, the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway is thought to be among the earliest carbon fixation pathways that have emerged on Earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuchs, 2011</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by numerous observations: (I) the presence of this pathway in the early branching methanogenic archaea; (II) its low energy requirements and low need of de novo protein synthesis; (III) its capacity to incorporate different one-carbon compounds and carbon monoxide of geothermal origin, and (IV) the extreme oxygen sensitivity of its key enzymes which have common roots in <italic>Bacteria</italic> and <italic>Archaea</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuchs, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hügler and Sievert, 2011</xref>). Despite differences in their structure, all extant carbon fixation pathways can be theoretically derived from a putative rTCA cycle/reductive acetyl-CoA hybrid pathway, as proposed by a recent phylometabolic reconstruction of the evolution of carbon fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braakman and Smith, 2012</xref>). <italic>According to this study, both Aquificae and acetogenic bacteria represent the closest living example of the archetypal network, and both diverged from the pre-LUCA pathway under the selective pressure of energy-efficiency (acetogens) and oxygen sensitivity (Aquificae</italic>). Further, a recent reconstruction of the genome of LUCA based on gene phyletic pattern reconstruction is consistent with some of these findings and suggests that LUCA’s genomic makeup point to autotrophic acetogenic and methanogenic roots and to the ancestry of the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weiss et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The presence of a CodH type V enzyme in the genome of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> and other members of the <italic>Desulfurobacteriaceae</italic>, and the presence of a type II CodH in <italic>Desulfurobacterium thermolithotrophum</italic> suggest that the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway could be operational in extant members of the <italic>Desulfurobacteriaceae</italic>. Furthermore, this finding supports the scenario proposed by Braakman and Smith that a complete and operational reductive acetyl-CoA pathway was present in the ancestor of the phylum <italic>Aquificae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braakman and Smith, 2012</xref>). Comparative analyses revealed that the CodH enzyme is conserved only within the <italic>Desulfurobacteriaceae</italic>, consistent with the strict anaerobic nature of the members of this family and the extreme oxygen sensitivity of CodH. The rise of oxygen has been interpreted as one of the factors responsible for the diversification of carbon fixation from the ancestral pathway, and could explain the subsequent loss of the CodH in the generally facultative microaerobic <italic>Hydrogenothermaceae</italic> and <italic>Aquificaceae</italic> within the <italic>Aquificae</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Comparative genomic analyses of rTCA cycle genes allow the description of a possible evolutionary scenario for the rTCA cycle in <italic>Aquificae</italic>.

Since citryl-CoA synthetase and 2-oxoglutarate carboxylase likely evolved by duplication of the genes for the succinyl-CoA synthetase and pyruvate carboxylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoshima, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braakman and Smith, 2012</xref>), a complete rTCA cycle could have evolved in the <italic>Aquificaceae</italic> from an ancestral, incomplete version of the cycle.

Phylogenetic analyses of ACL suggests that this gene fusion event did not happen within the <italic>Aquificae,</italic> as <italic>Nitrospira</italic> and <italic>Chlorobia</italic> have an evolutionary older version of ACL than <italic>Hydrogenothermaceae</italic> and <italic>Desulfurobacteriaceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hügler et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, it is likely that these two groups acquired ACL through HGT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hügler et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, our comparative analysis showed that: (I) in the <italic>Hydrogenothermaceae</italic> and in the <italic>Desulfurobacteriaceae</italic>, the enzymes of the first half of the rTCA cycle, as well as aconitase (<italic>acnA</italic>), share a common ancestor with the <italic>Aquificaceae</italic> and can be considered part of the core genome of the phylum <italic>Aquificae</italic>, while the remaining enzymes are either the result of gene duplication or have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hügler et al., 2007</xref>); (II) the two-step citrate cleavage is exclusive to the <italic>Aquificacea</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>); (III) the <italic>ccl</italic> gene is still present in the <italic>Hydrogenothermacea</italic> (in addition to <italic>acl</italic>), and one sequenced strain of the <italic>Hydrogenothermaceae</italic> (<italic>S. azorense</italic>) still uses the two-step carboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate, suggesting that the two-step version of the rTCA cycle was present in the ancestor of both the <italic>Aquificaceae</italic> and the <italic>Hydrogenothermaceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). However, neither of the genes for the two-step citrate cleavage or two-step 2-oxoglutrate carboxylation is present in the <italic>Desulfurobacteriaceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Finally, synteny analyses show that the four enzymes necessary to complement the one-step rTCA cycle variant in the <italic>Desulfurobacteriaceae</italic> from a theoretical ancestral linear rTCA are organized in a single operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Taking into consideration evidence from comparative genomics and phylogenetic analyses, the most parsimonious interpretation of the data suggests that the last common ancestor of the <italic>Aquifica</italic>e had an incomplete form of the rTCA that did not proceed past the synthesis of 2-oxoglutarate, and that later on the cycle was closed following two independent evolutionary trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>): (I) Gene duplication in the lineage that lead to the <italic>Aquificaceae</italic> and <italic>Hydrogenothermaceae</italic>; and (II) gene acquisition by horizontal gene transfer in the <italic>Desulfurobacteriaceae</italic> and <italic>Hydrogenothermaceae</italic> (the latter replaced the two-step version of the rTCA cycle with the one-step version) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). <italic>The reasons behind the presence of two distinct rTCA cycle variants within the extant Aquificae are not known. Braackman and Smith hypothesized that the one-step reactions might have evolved as a way to improve the thermodynamic efficiency of the rTCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braakman and Smith, 2012</xref>). We hypothesize that temperature may also have played a role in preserving the ancient, more symmetric, two-step citrate cleavage rTCA cycle variant in Aquificaceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Members of this group have optimum growth temperatures (75–95°C) higher than those of the two other groups (60–75°C; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), and the ‘ancient’ enzymes might be more stable at these high temperatures. In contrast, the ‘newer’ enzymes that catalyze the one-step citrate cleavage might have evolved to function optimally at lower temperatures.</p><p>Different members of the <italic>Aquificae</italic> use either one of the two versions of the rTCA cycle, and all the extant members of this phylum possess the genes encoding for the enzymes of the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway, with the exception of <italic>codH</italic> (encoding for the CO-dehydrogenase), which is only found in the <italic>Desulfurobacteriaceae</italic>. Therefore, we hypothesize that the last common ancestor of the <italic>Aquificae</italic> possessed the complete reductive acetyl-CoA pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). While members of the <italic>Desulfurobacteriaceae</italic> kept the CodH due to their obligate anaerobic lifestyle, microaerophilic <italic>Aquificae</italic> (<italic>Hydrogenothermaceae</italic> and <italic>Aquificaceae</italic>) lost this extremely oxygen-sensitive enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). The presence of the gene encoding CodH in <italic>P. marina</italic> (<italic>Hydrogenothermaceae</italic>) is the only exception, and suggests that <italic>codH</italic> was lost independently in the two lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><p>Alltogether, our results suggest that the last common ancestor of the <italic>Aquificae</italic> combined the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway with an incomplete form of the rTCA that did not proceed past the synthesis of 2-oxoglutarate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). A similar incomplete version of the rTCA pathway, consisting only of the reactions from acetyl-CoA to 2-oxoglutarate, is present in extant methanogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berg, 2011</xref>). Thus, our phylometabolic reconstruction of the ancestral state of carbon fixation in the <italic>Aquificae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) is conceptually consistent with chemoautotrophic processes of extant <italic>Bacteria</italic> and <italic>Archaea</italic>, and may represent the earliest carbon fixation pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We propose that the ancestor of <italic>Thermovibrio ammonificans</italic> was originally a hydrogen oxidizing, sulfur reducing bacterium that used a hybrid carbon fixation pathway for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation.

The 16S rRNA sequences were aligned with ClustalO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Thompson et al., 1997</xref>) and Gblocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castresana, 2000</xref>) and the alignment was manually refined using SEAVIEW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galtier et al., 1996</xref>). The maximum likelihood phylogeny was inferred from the alignment of 1455 sites using PHYML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guindon and Gascuel, 2003</xref>), the GRT model and 1000 bootstrap replications. The CODH tree presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> was computed using a selected set of amino acid sequences and the neighbor-joining method. Alignments were obtained using Muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edgar, 2004</xref>) and Gblocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castresana, 2000</xref>), manually refined using SEAVIEW, and phylogenetic distances calculated using 255 sites and the Observed Divergence matrix. The neighbor-joining method was used to evaluate tree topologies using Phylo_win (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galtier et al., 1996</xref>) and their robustness was tested by bootstrap analysis with 1000 resamplings. The tree for the catalytic subunit of the [NiFe]-hydrogenases presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> was computed using a selected set of amino acid sequences and the same approach described above for the CODH tree and was based on 539 sites. The accession number for the sequences used in trees presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> are reported within each tree. The ATP citrate lyase phylogenetic tree was reconstructed with Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods. Both subunit of the ATP citrate lyase (AclB and AclA) were aligned individually to retrieved homologs using Muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edgar, 2004</xref>) and SEAVIEW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galtier et al., 1996</xref>). The alignments were concatenated and refined using Gblock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castresana, 2000</xref>). A hypothetical ancestral ATP citrate lyase enzyme was manually constructed by concatenating the citryl-CoA synthetase and citryl-CoA lyase of <italic>H. thermophilus</italic> and <italic>A. aeolicus</italic>, respectively, and used as the outgroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hügler et al., 2007</xref>). The maximum likelihood phylogeny was inferred from the alignment using PHYML with the Wag substitution model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Whelan and Goldman, 2001</xref>) and 1000 bootstrap resamplings. The substitution model was selected based on AIC values using ProTest3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darriba et al., 2011</xref>). Bayesian phylogeny was inferred using MrBayes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003</xref>) performing 500,000 generations with two parallel searches with the Wag amino acid matrix model (selected using forward selection among all possible substitution models) and a burn-in of 125,000 generations. Both tree were computed on 1035 identified sites. Accession numbers for the tree presented are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>. A combination of phylogenetic analysis and comparative genomic analyses were used to identify lateral gene transfer events.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Phylometabolic reconstruction of the carbon fixation pathway within the <italic>aquificae</italic></title><p>Phylometabolic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braakman and Smith, 2012</xref>) was used to investigate the carbon fixation pathway in <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> and its evolutionary relationship to the carbon fixation pathways present in other members of the <italic>Aquificae</italic> phylum. In phylometabolic analyses, the metabolic pathways of the organism under investigation are compared to those found in related organisms both within and across neighboring clades. By focusing on the pathways, the comparison may reveal variations in multi-enzyme functional units, providing context for the completion of the pathway within the networks of individual organism, while also allowing for the identification of ancestral states and horizontal gene transfer events. The resulting phylometabolic tree includes multiple complete pathways to common essential metabolites, and suggests which evolutionary substitutions are allowed (at either organism or ecosystem levels) among these pathways (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braakman and Smith, 2012</xref>] and reference therein for a more extensive description of the principles underlying this approach). We reconstructed the carbon fixation pathways in representative genomes of the <italic>Aquificae</italic>, and compared them. Information regarding the carbon fixation metabolic network was implemented using phylogenetic and comparative genomic information to help reconstruct possible ancestral states of the carbon fixation network based on maximum parsimony principles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Protein extraction, digestion and identification</title><p><italic>T. ammonificans</italic> cell pellets were washed in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0, containing Roche cOmplete protease inhibitor) and soluble proteins were extracted as described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heinz et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, cells were disrupted by sonication (2 × 25 s), cell debris was pelleted and protein concentrations in the supernatant were determined according to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bradford, 1976</xref>). 20 µg of protein extract were loaded onto a precast 10% polyacrylamide mini gel in technical triplicates for 1D PAGE (150 V, 45 min). After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, protein-containing gel lanes were excised and cut into 10 equal subsamples each, which were destained (200 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, 30% acetonitrile) and digested with trypsin solution (1 µg/ml, Promega, Madison WI, USA) at 37°C over night, before peptides were eluted from the gel pieces in an ultrasonic bath (15 min). As described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xing et al., 2015</xref>), peptide mixes were subjected to reversed phase C18 column chromatography on a nano-ACQUITY-UPLC (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). Mass spectrometry (MS) and MS/MS data were recorded with an online-coupled LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). MS data were searched against the forward-decoy <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> protein database using Sequest (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA; version 27, revision 11) and identifications were filtered and validated in Scaffold (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteomesoftware.com">http://www.proteomesoftware.com</ext-link>), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heinz et al., 2012</xref>). Data for all three technical replicates were merged and exclusive unique peptide count values of all proteins were exported for calculation of normalized spectral abundance factors (NSAF), which are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> in %, <italic>i.e.,</italic> as relative abundance of each protein in % of all identified proteins.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Deep Carbon Observatory.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Losick as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Following below please find the assessments of the three external reviews. As you will see, the paper was overall quite positively received by the reviewers, but there is some substantial additional work in the data analyses and presentation of the paper that needs to be done before a substantially revised submission can be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors use a comparative genomic approach associated to a proteomic analysis to reconstruct the metabolism of <italic>Thermovibrio ammonificans</italic> and draw an interesting picture of its possible evolution. Particularly interesting is the observation that the genome of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> codes for enzymes putatively involved in the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway and in the reductive TCA (rTCA) cycle.</p><p><italic>T. ammonificans</italic> encodes an unusual CodH (type V), whose function is still unknown. Based on the assumption that the type V CodH works in the rTCA cycle, the authors suggest that in <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway and the rTCA cycle are both operational and that the bacterium uses one or the other way to fix carbon based on the environmental conditions.</p><p>This is a key point of the manuscript and should have some experimental support.</p><p>The manuscript is well presented although in some parts the reader needs to have high familiarity with microbial evolution and metabolism.</p><p>I have some questions and concerns:</p><p>1) Subsection “Carbon Fixation”, second paragraph: why it is not clearly stated the variant used by <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>?</p><p>2) Figures are not numbered in the order of citation in the text. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> (subsection “Carbon Fixation”, last paragraph and subsection “Hydrogen oxidation”, second paragraph, respectively) appear in the text right after <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is only cited in the third paragraph of the subsection “Insight into the evolution of carbon fixation”. Also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> appears before <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (subsection “Comparative genomic of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>: ancestral and acquired metabolic traits”, second paragraph)</p><p>3) Subsection “Carbon Fixation”, last paragraph: the authors refer to two genes coding for CodH. But Theam_0999 is not listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and it is not clearly explained what it is. Only in the aforementioned paragraph it is stated that it has 81% similarity with a gene of <italic>D. thermolithotrophum</italic>. Theam_0999 is also not listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>, then it is presumably not expressed in the tested growth conditions.</p><p>4) Subsection “Carbon Fixation”, last paragraph: what are the bases for the hypothesis that type V CodH may represent the most ancient version of these enzymes?</p><p>5) Subsection “Sulfur reduction”: if Theam_1321 has no homologs in the database how was its putative function (NAD- or FAD-dependent reductase) assigned?</p><p>6) Subsection “Activated methyl cycle”: I missed what is the evidence to conclude that &quot;In <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>, the activated methyl cycle is of the second type.&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Giovanelli et al. performed comparative genomic, proteomic and phylometabolic analyses, of the anaerobic thermophile, <italic>Thermovibrio ammonificans</italic> and identified two distinct groups of genes. One that codes for enzymes that do not require oxygen and use substrates of geothermal origin and another that may reflect the rise of oxygen on Earth. Based on this they propose the last common ancestor was a hydrogen oxidizing, sulfur reducing bacterium that used a hybrid pathway for CO2 fixation. I find this an interesting manuscript, with potential interest, but have concerns regarding the methods used in the phylogenomic analyses and also the general scope of the paper.</p><p>First, the authors start out in the Abstract writing about early earth and evolution and origins of life, but the paper itself is more of a descriptive narrative of the different pathways encoded and expressed by the organism. The links to evolution and origin of life and this organism are buried in the paper behind long stretches of descriptive text that reads more like a genome announcement paper than a manuscript on the evolution of the group. Second, the authors conclusion that <italic>Thermovibrio ammonificans</italic> encodes ancestral pathways (e.g., hydrogen oxidation) and more recently acquired ones (e.g., nitrate reduction) and a hybrid pathway for CO2 fixation are not novel conclusions as they have already been shown in several of the authors prior works.</p><p>The main part of this manuscript, that has potential as a novel contribution, is the genome evolution aspect. However, the authors do not use a strong phlyogenomic approach to support their claim of the original metabolism of the common ancestor. From what I can tell, they base this conclusion on a comparison of the target organism to only two other related strains (in the Methods section “Comparative genomics”). The proper way to test such a hypothesis would be to take all available genomes from the two clades in question and perform a phylogenomic analysis across all members to identify those genes that have been vertically inherited (e.g., shared protein clusters) as opposed to horizontally inherited (Enright et al., 2002 NAS). This can be done using a Markov Cluster algorithm for example (Nelson-Sathi et al., 2015 Nature). Vertically inherited genes can be defined based on two simple criteria: (1) the protein should be present in at least two higher taxa of the two clades in question and (2) its tree should recover monophyly of the two clades (Weiss et al. 2016 Nature Microbiology). Genes meeting both criteria are unlikely to have undergone LGT, and thus were probably present in the last common ancestor. Unfortunately, such an analysis is missing in the authors study, but is needed to support this main conclusion. I cannot support publication until this major concern is addressed.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Introduction, second paragraph: There is a lot of evidence suggesting that the reductive acetyl CoA was the first carbon fixation pathway, and that the first organism was actually a methanogen, not a bacterium, and that this organism evolved under lower temperature hydrothermal conditions. Please read some of the recent papers from Bill Martins group, for example Weiss et al. 2016 (Nature Microbiology), where they did phylogenomic analyses of all prokaryotic genomes to date.</p><p>Introduction, third paragraph: Regarding the reductive acetyl CoA pathway and the origins of life I suggest you should also read the new review by Sojo et al. in Astrobiology (2016).</p><p>Introduction, third paragraph, last sentence: This is not a universally accepted concept as the authors imply with this sentence. Please see Weiss et al. 2016 (Nature Microbiology), who show that LUCA was likely a methanogen.</p><p>Subsection “Carbon fixation”, last paragraph: If not all the genes in the pathway are encoded, then how do you explain your discovery of all the proteins (stated a few paragraphs above)?</p><p>Subsection “Carbon fixation”, last paragraph: Please provide citations for the presence of this pathway in sulfate reducers and anammox bacteria.</p><p>“We hypothesize that the type V CodH may represent the most ancestral version of this class of enzymes, and may catalyze the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to CO”: Do you base this hypothesis on your own data or someone else?</p><p>Subsection “Hydrogen oxidation”, end of third paragraph: How is this link suggested here? This is not clearly explained.</p><p>Subsection “Comparative genomic of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>: ancestral and acquired metabolic traits”, second paragraph: Why did you choose specifically these organisms to compare?</p><p>Subsection “Comparative genomic of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>: ancestral and acquired metabolic traits”, second paragraph: From what you write here it is not clear how your synteny analysis shows that this horizontal gene transfer occurred.</p><p>Subsection “Comparative genomic of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>: ancestral and acquired metabolic traits”, third paragraph: Can you discuss the connections to the Weiss et al. paper (2016) which has already analyzed this topic in more greater detail?</p><p>Subsection “Comparative genomic of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>: ancestral and acquired metabolic traits”, end of third paragraph: It is already well known that reductive acetyl CoA pathway emerged prior to photosynthesis. What do you mean that the central metabolism of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> is &quot;ancestral&quot;? This is very general, and not a new idea.</p><p>Subsection “Comparative genomic of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>: ancestral and acquired metabolic traits”, last two paragraphs: This is an interesting idea, but where is your data supporting this hypothesis? No figures or tables are cited in the text…</p><p>Subsection “Insight into the evolution of carbon fixation”, first paragraph: The Brakeman and Smith study is outdated, more updated is Weiss et al. 2016 Nature Microbiology.</p><p>Subsection “Insight into the evolution of carbon fixation”, end of first paragraph: I disagree, new analyses of all prokaryotic genomes and biochemical pathways looking at the oldest conserved genes between all organisms suggest LUCA was a methanogen with reductive acetyl CoA pathway (Weiss et al. 2016). Not <italic>Aquificae</italic> as the authors propose here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is a very comprehensive and beautifully written genomic &amp; proteomic analysis of <italic>Thermovibrio ammonificans</italic>, followed by a comparative analysis of its C fixation pathways with those of the <italic>Aquificaceae</italic> and the sulfur/hydrogen-oxidizing <italic>epsilonproteobacteria</italic>. On first reading, I can only find minor details that need attention (see below). After seeing how cursory many genomes are treated, it was a pleasure to read this analysis and its careful exploration of autotrophic pathway evolution.</p><p>The underpinnings of this manuscript – dividing biochemical pathways into ancestral and modern, and then dissecting the genome of a bacterium into ancient and modern layers, like different time horizons in an archaeological excavation – require a short comment. The complexity of even &quot;ancient&quot; pathways, genes and enzymes reflects the fact that every &quot;ancient&quot; gene and enzyme that still exists today has a billion-year history of evolutionary finetuning and, often enough, lateral gene transfer and functional repurposing. Nothing has survived from the dawn of life unchanged. This short preface should explain why I take some introductory statements of this article with a grain of salt, for example the big jump from Wachterhauser to the rTCA cycle (see below).</p><p>Introduction, second paragraph: If this assessment – the <italic>Aquificae</italic> as an early lineage – is based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, you should say this explicitly.</p><p>Introduction, third paragraph: I don't have access to Waechtershauser 1988 right now, but his article is focusing on surface catalysis of CO<sub>2</sub>, CO and small organic molecules being assembled into larger molecules, all on a metal-sulfide or pyrite surface; the theme is prebiotic &quot;autotrophic&quot; syntheses catalyzed by a reactive surface. The fully developed rTCA cycle is far away from that.</p><p>The last sentence of the subsection “Conclusions” – &quot;we argue that proposed model for the evolution of metabolism presented in this paper may represent the blueprint of the chemistry of early life&quot; – goes too far in the same direction. Most problematically in origin of life scenarios, early probiotic reactions, like covalent bond formations at reactive interfaces or charge separation at mineral surfaces, are separated by a huge gulf from fully developed enzymatic systems, encoded by genes, transcribed by mRNA, translated by ribosomes… you get the idea. Even ancestral enzymes and pathways only provide a view on the evolution of fully differentiated, metabolically active and self-sustaining microorganisms that we would recognize today [with proper genomes, not to forget], but they do not allow a view to the really early stages and origin of life; theories on communal genomes before cell differentiation, and early evolution of protein domains and structural subunits try to fill the gap.

Your revised article has been reevaluated by Gisela Storz (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>One of the reviews revealed some considerable major concerns. Normally, this would be reason for rejection of the paper. However, some of the issues may be based on a misunderstanding with the original reviews. Therefore, if you can address the remaining major concerns we would consider a further revised submission. The critical review comments follow below.</p><p>Following are the key issues that need to be addressed:</p><p>Much of the rebuttal consists of straw man arguments regarding the Weiss et al. study and origins of life issue that detract from my main points raised about their analyses. I apologize if the authors got the wrong idea from my original review, which was not to ask them to re-write their manuscript on the origins of life. I was not a co-author on that paper, but it is a good example of extensive taxon sampling and (in principle) a good method for determining vertical inheritance. As the authors note in their rebuttal whether or not Weiss et al. actually followed their method is currently debated in online comment forums, but this is outside the scope of the authors’ manuscript. By focusing on this, I think that the authors may have missed the main point of my review, which was that their methods for phylogenomic analyses were not sufficient (or at least not sufficiently explained in the Methods). It is possible that analyses were done satisfactorily but this is impossible to tell from the information provided. I have re-read the authors Methods carefully a second time in the revised manuscript, yet it is not possible to tell how the authors processed their data in the different analyses.</p><p>My main point is that the authors need to explain in their Methods exactly how they did the different phylogenetic analyses, and provide a satisfactory justification for why they chose to treat their data in the way they did (e.g., why no concatenated gene phylogenies?) instead of following other conventional methods for interpreting bacterial phylogenomics. For example, concatenated gene trees possess more phylogenetic signals, and are less susceptible to the stochastic errors than those built from single genes (Wu and Eisen, 2008; Jeffroy et al. 2006). From what I can tell the authors performed single gene phylogenies of a handful of genes picked from the genomes.</p><p>The authors write in their rebuttal: &quot;That is incorrect, as members of the <italic>Desulfurobacteriaceae, Aquificaceae</italic> and <italic>Epsilonproteobacteria</italic> were included in the analyses and discussed throughout the manuscript. We used all available <italic>Aquificae</italic> genomes (as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), and further focused only on the closest relative and the <italic>Epsilonproteobacteria</italic> as an ecological proxy.&quot;</p><p>A quick search of all available genomes from the <italic>Aquificae</italic> in IMG reveals that there are genomes from 29 representatives available for analysis. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> in the manuscript contains 17 of these, which cover the major clades but does not include all available genomes from each clade. Thus, the statement that the authors make that &quot;Comparative analyses between the genomes of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>, all available <italic>Aquificae</italic> genomes…&quot; is incorrect. Taxon sampling (e.g., n=17 vs. n=29) can have an impact on the results of phylogenetic analyses. Usually the addition of more representatives can provide a better resolution. Please justify why you selected only these 17 for analysis.</p><p>In the Methods section &quot;Comparative genomics&quot;: It is clear from this that you used the genomes in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>. But, it is not clear whether these same genomes were used to create the phylogenetic analyses or not.</p><p>In the Methods section &quot;Phylogenetic Methods&quot;: The authors describe methods for 16S phylogenies and ATP citrate lyase phylogenies. No information is provided regarding the Ni-Fe hydrogenase phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), CO dehydrogenases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), or any other phylogenetic analyses that the authors base their conclusions on. At least, not from what I can tell after reading the section. I do not know whether this is intended or a mistake. Since the authors base their conclusions based on these results it seems like a good idea to explain how these analyses were done. For example, please state number of aligned resides for each tree, whether it is amino acids of DNA data, e.g. the standard information that readers deserve to know so that the authors work can be openly evaluated by the scientific community after publication. Another major question remains, which is why have the authors performed only single gene phylogenies as opposed to concatenated gene phylogenies? Please explain. Concatenated gene phylogenies are less susceptible to stochastic errors than those built from single genes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18990.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors use a comparative genomic approach associated to a proteomic analysis to reconstruct the metabolism of Thermovibrio ammonificans and draw an interesting picture of its possible evolution. Particularly interesting is the observation that the genome of T. ammonificans codes for enzymes putatively involved in the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway and in the reductive TCA (rTCA) cycle.</italic> </p><p><italic>T. ammonificans encodes an unusual CodH (type V), whose function is still unknown. Based on the assumption that the type V CodH works in the rTCA cycle, the authors suggest that in T. ammonificans the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway and the rTCA cycle are both operational and that the bacterium uses one or the other way to fix carbon based on the environmental conditions. This is a key point of the manuscript and should have some experimental support.</italic> </p><p>Comment on the functionality of the reductive Acetyl-CoA pathway. We agree that the role of the reductive Acetyl-CoA pathway and of the CodH in <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> is controversial. To begin to understand the role of the reductive Acetyl-CoA pathway in <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> we carried out experiments aimed to assess the C isotopic fractionation during autotrophic growth of the bacterium under different electron accepting conditions (nitrate and sulfur). Our hypothesis was that under less efficient electron accepting conditions (i.e., sulfur reduction), <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> might preferentially use the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway, which requires ~1 ATP <italic>vs</italic> 2-3 ATP for the rTCA cycle. Briefly, we analyzed the biomass <sup>13</sup>C fractionation with respect to the CO2 used as substrate by the organisms in triplicated independent experiments. <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> biomass δ 13 C isotopic fractionation ranged between -6 ‰ and -8 ‰. The values obtained are in the range of values reported in the literature for the rTCA cycle (Berg et al. 2010), confirming the activity of rTCA as main strategy of carbon fixation under the condition tested. Cells of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> grown on sulfur as terminal electron acceptor consistently had isotopic value more negative than population grown in nitrate reducing condition of about 2 ‰. While this difference is small and does not support the activity of the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway, it raises interesting questions regarding the differential isotopic fractionation of carbon while growing with alternative electron acceptors. Because results were inconclusive we decided against including these new experiments in our manuscript. Further experiments that go beyond the scope of this manuscript, whose original objective was to put forth a number of hypotheses based on genomic reconstruction, will need to be designed to shed light on the function of the reductive Acetyl-CoA pathway in <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>.</p><p><italic>The manuscript is well presented although in some parts the reader needs to have high familiarity with microbial evolution and metabolism.</italic> </p><p><italic>I have some questions and concerns:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Subsection “Carbon Fixation”, second paragraph: why it is not clearly stated the variant used by T. ammonificans?</italic> </p><p>A sentence stating that the asymmetric variant of the rTCA cycle is found in <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> was added (subsection “Carbon Fixation”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) Figures are not numbered in the order of citation in the text.

One that codes for enzymes that do not require oxygen and use substrates of geothermal origin and another that may reflect the rise of oxygen on Earth. Based on this they propose the last common ancestor was a hydrogen oxidizing, sulfur reducing bacterium that used a hybrid pathway for CO2 fixation. I find this an interesting manuscript, with potential interest, but have concerns regarding the methods used in the phylogenomic analyses and also the general scope of the paper.</italic> </p><p><italic>First, the authors start out in the Abstract writing about early earth and evolution and origins of life, but the paper itself is more of a descriptive narrative of the different pathways encoded and expressed by the organism. The links to evolution and origin of life and this organism are buried in the paper behind long stretches of descriptive text that reads more like a genome announcement paper than a manuscript on the evolution of the group.</italic> </p><p>The first general comment was about the evolution of early metabolism, which is the main focus of the manuscript. Reviewer 2 stated that the manuscript was too focused on the central metabolism of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>, and that such focus is a distraction from the evolution theme. Our answer to that comment is that, to draw <italic>any</italic> general conclusion on the evolution of metabolism in the <italic>Desufurobacteraceae</italic>, it was critical to investigate in depth the central metabolic pathways in our model organism. We tried to strike a balance between the two topics by reporting our genome-derived findings on the central metabolic pathways in <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> (i.e., our data) in the Results section, while discussing the evolutionary implications of our findings in the Discussion section. Reviewers 1 and 3 praised the presentation style of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Second, the authors conclusion that Thermovibrio ammonificans encodes ancestral pathways (e.g., hydrogen oxidation) and more recently acquired ones (e.g., nitrate reduction) and a hybrid pathway for CO2 fixation are not novel conclusions as they have already been shown in several of the authors prior works.</italic> </p><p>The second general comment of reviewer 2 stated that our conclusions on the ancestral and acquired genome of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>, including the hybrid carbon fixation pathway, are not novel and that we had shown these data previously. That is absolutely incorrect, as the data presented here, along with our interpretation, is original work never published before. We did not publish other papers linking the evolution and metabolism of the <italic>Desulfurobacteraceae</italic> family and, to our knowledge, neither did others.</p><p><italic>The main part of this manuscript, that has potential as a novel contribution, is the genome evolution aspect. However, the authors do not use a strong phlyogenomic approach to support their claim of the original metabolism of the common ancestor. From what I can tell, they base this conclusion on a comparison of the target organism to only two other related strains (in the Methods section “Comparative genomics”). The proper way to test such a hypothesis would be to take all available genomes from the two clades in question and perform a phylogenomic analysis across all members to identify those genes that have been vertically inherited (e.g., shared protein clusters) as opposed to horizontally inherited (Enright et al., 2002 NAS). This can be done using a Markov Cluster algorithm for example (Nelson-Sathi et al., 2015 Nature). Vertically inherited genes can be defined based on two simple criteria: (1) the protein should be present in at least two higher taxa of the two clades in question and (2) its tree should recover monophyly of the two clades (Weiss et al. 2016 Nature Microbiology). Genes meeting both criteria are unlikely to have undergone LGT, and thus were probably present in the last common ancestor. Unfortunately, such an analysis is missing in the authors study, but is needed to support this main conclusion. I cannot support publication until this major concern is addressed.</italic> </p><p>The third general comment was related to our comparative genomics and phylometabolic analyses. Reviewer 2 states that the genome of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> was compared only to two closely related species. That is incorrect, as members of the <italic>Desulfurobacteriaceae, Aquificaceae</italic> and <italic>Epsilonproteobacteria</italic> were included in the analyses and discussed throughout the manuscript. We used all available <italic>Aquificae</italic> genomes (as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), and further focused only on the closest relative and the <italic>Epsilonproteobacteria</italic> as an ecological proxy.</p><p><italic>Specific comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>Introduction, second paragraph: There is a lot of evidence suggesting that the reductive acetyl CoA was the first carbon fixation pathway, and that the first organism was actually a methanogen, not a bacterium, and that this organism evolved under lower temperature hydrothermal conditions. Please read some of the recent papers from Bill Martins group, for example Weiss et al. 2016 (Nature Microbiology), where they did phylogenomic analyses of all prokaryotic genomes to date.</italic> </p><p>Comments on the “first organism being a methanogen”. Reviewer 2 refers to Weiss et al., 2016 (DOI: 10.1038/NMICROBIOL.2016.116), which was published <italic>after</italic> our manuscript was submitted to <italic>eLife</italic>. The main message of the Weiss et al. paper is that the reconstruction of the most ancestral microbial genome (the authors refer to the genome of LUCA – Last Universal Common Ancestor) suggests that the earliest microorganisms were acetogens (bacteria) and/or methanogens (archaea). Based on their genome reconstruction the authors conclude that LUCA was an anaerobic, thermophilic autotroph that fixed CO2 via the reductive Acetyl-CoA pathway and could live on H2, CO2 and N2 in an environment similar to deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Hence, the statement from reviewer 2 that Weiss et al. concluded that LUCA was a methanogen is incorrect, as it could have been an acetogen as well. That LUCA might have been an acetogen is in agreement with the hypothesis put forward by Braakman and Smith, 2012, who took a completely different approach to reconstruct the origin of microbial metabolism. Having said that, we tend to agree with that scenario proposed by Weiss et al. (and by Braakman and Smith), which, with the exception of nitrogen fixation, fits very nicely with the metabolism of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>. It needs to be noted that the presence of a nitrogenase-encoding gene in the genome of LUCA proposed by Weiss et al. is currently a subject of debate on PubMed Commons(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27562259">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27562259</ext-link>). However, while basically our findings are in agreement with the Weiss et al. paper, we want to stress that our study was not designed to identify the earliest form of microbial metabolism. We demonstrate that <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> is a good model to reconstruct the evolutionary history of early metabolism but we did not suggest that the lineage that led to the present-day <italic>Desulfurobacteriaceae</italic> and to <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> had the same metabolism of LUCA. What happened prior to the emergence of the <italic>Desulfurobacteriaceae</italic> lineage cannot be gleaned by our analyses, and it is not an objective of our study.</p><p><italic>Introduction, third paragraph: Regarding the reductive acetyl CoA pathway and the origins of life I suggest you should also read the new review by Sojo et al. in Astrobiology (2016).</italic> </p><p>Comment on the reductive Acetyl-CoA pathway and the origin of life. Reviewer 2 refers to the recent work by Sojo et al., 2015 (DOI: 10.1089/ast.2015.1406), which proposes three interesting – but so far untested – hypotheses for CO2 reduction in a very specific environment – alkaline vents. The first hypothesis is that the synthesis of Acetyl-CoA was originally driven by the geochemistry of alkaline vents and it was not genetically encoded. The second hypothesis is that the synthesis of Acetyl-CoA as we know it in extant methanogens and acetogens was predated by a “lost” pathway not found in modern cells. The authors themselves refer to this hypothesis as quite “radical” as, among other assumptions, requires that the Haedean oceans were fairly oxidizing. The third hypothesis implies that the redox gradient at alkaline vents was sufficient to reduce CO2. Hypotheses 1 and 3 rely essentially on prebiotic chemistry, while hypothesis 2 assumes a “lost” pathway of which there is no trace in extant microorganisms. We apologize if we conveyed the wrong message, but our manuscript is not about prebiotic chemistry and the origin of life. Our manuscript is about the reconstruction of the central metabolic pathways in an early-branching – but modern – bacterium, <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>. From that reconstruction we made an effort to tease apart “early” and “acquired” traits to reconstruct the evolution of metabolism in this bacterium. But by “early” or “ancestral” we do not imply “at the origin of life”. Again, what happened prior to the emergence of the <italic>Desulfurobacteriaceae</italic> lineage cannot be gleaned by our analyses, and it is not an objective of our study. By stating that, among the six known carbon fixation pathways, the rTCA cycle and the reductive Acetyl-CoA pathway are “good candidates for the ancestral carbon fixation pathway”, we refer to a fairly extensive body of work published by others (including work by Bill Martin’s group, to whom reviewer 2 often refers) and we mean “good candidates” – we do not imply that such pathways <italic>are</italic> the original pathways.</p><p><italic>Introduction, third paragraph, last sentence: This is not a universally accepted concept as the authors imply with this sentence.

However, we agree with reviewer 2 that the synteny diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> does not indicate such HGT event, and we removed the last sentence of the paragraph.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Comparative genomic of T. ammonificans: ancestral and acquired metabolic traits”, third paragraph: Can you discuss the connections to the Weiss et al. paper (2016) which has already analyzed this topic in more greater detail?</italic> </p><p><italic>Subsection “Comparative genomic of T. ammonificans: ancestral and acquired metabolic traits”, end of third paragraph: It is already well known that reductive acetyl CoA pathway emerged prior to photosynthesis.

This is very general, and not a new idea.</italic> </p><p>Comments on relating our analysis of the genome of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> with the work of Weiss et al., 2016, and on the ancestry of the central metabolism of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>. Our genome reconstruction and phylogenetic analyses indicate that the core or ancestral groups of genes involved in the central metabolism of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> include genes coding for Group 3 hydrogenases, genes coding for enzymes of the reductive Acetyl-CoA pathway and genes involved in sulfur reduction. These pathways are catalyzed by enzymes that are extremely sensitive to oxygen which are either present in early branching Archaea, or are directly involved in metabolic reactions that do not require oxygen (or oxygen by-products) and use substrates of geothermal origin. Weiss et al. reconstruction of the LUCA genome is surprisingly consistent with our findings: the authors conclude that “FeS and transition metals are relics of ancient metabolism, that life arose at hydrothermal vents and that sulfur was involved in ancient metabolism”. Similarly to <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>, LUCA was an H2-dependent autotroph capable of S utilization that could fix CO2 via the reductive Acetyl-CoA pathway. What this means is that part of the genome of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>, a modern bacterium that lives today at deep-sea vents, bears some striking similarities to the putative genome of LUCA as reported by Weiss et al. Therefore, part of the central metabolism of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> is ancestral. We added a sentence to the third paragraph of the subsection “Comparative genomic of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>: ancestral and acquired metabolic traits” with a reference to the Weiss et al. paper.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Comparative genomic of T. ammonificans: ancestral and acquired metabolic traits”, last two paragraphs: This is an interesting idea, but where is your data supporting this hypothesis?

This is a hypothesis generated on the widely-accepted assumption that prior to the onset of oxygenic photosynthesis the Earth was anoxic. Hence, it is reasonable to posit that the oxygen radical detoxification machinery is a relatively “late” acquisition in the lineage that led to <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>. We are currently carrying out experiments to test the function of these enzymes in <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>. Such experiments go beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Insight into the evolution of carbon fixation”, first paragraph: The Brakeman and Smith study is outdated, more updated is Weiss et al. 2016 Nature Microbiology.</italic> </p><p>Comment on the Braakman and Smith study being “outdated”, and the underlying suggestion by reviewer 2 to refer exclusively to the Weiss et al. study. We disagree. First, the Weiss et al. paper was published after our manuscript was submitted to <italic>eLife</italic>. Second, the Weiss et al. paper does not refute the Braakman and Smith findings. Rather, despite the radically different approaches used in the two studies – the Braakman and Smith is based on phylometabolic reconstruction while the Weiss et al. is based on gene phyletic pattern reconstruction – both point to the basal lineage being autotrophic and using the reductive Acetyl-CoA pathway. We included a reference to the Weiss paper in the first paragraph of the subsection “Insight into the evolution of carbon fixation”.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Insight into the evolution of carbon fixation”, end of first paragraph: I disagree, new analyses of all prokaryotic genomes and biochemical pathways looking at the oldest conserved genes between all organisms suggest LUCA was a methanogen with reductive acetyl CoA pathway (Weiss et al. 2016). Not Aquificae as the authors propose here.</italic> </p><p>Reviewer 2 disagrees with the conclusion of the Braakman and Smith study, states that Weiss et al. demonstrate that LUCA was a methanogen, and implies that we propose that LUCA was an <italic>Aquificae</italic>. First, Weiss at al. suggest that LUCA’s genomic makeup points to an autotroph that fixed carbon via the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway, and suggest acetogenic and/or methanogenic roots. They do not unequivocally show that LUCA was a methanogen. Second, we are <italic>not</italic> proposing that LUCA was an <italic>Aquificae</italic>. Instead, we are reporting findings from Braakman and Smith, which are partly in agreement with Weiss et al. (please see the paragraph above), and we discuss that our finding of the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway in <italic>T. ammonificans</italic> is in line with the hypothesis that this pathway of autotrophic carbon fixation was present in the basal lineage. Again, this is in agreement with findings from BOTH Braakman and Smith and Weiss et al.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is a very comprehensive and beautifully written genomic &amp; proteomic analysis of Thermovibrio ammonificans, followed by a comparative analysis of its C fixation pathways with those of the Aquificaceae and the sulfur/hydrogen-oxidizing epsilonproteobacteria.

Most problematically in origin of life scenarios, early probiotic reactions, like covalent bond formations at reactive interfaces or charge separation at mineral surfaces, are separated by a huge gulf from fully developed enzymatic systems, encoded by genes, transcribed by mRNA, translated by ribosomes… you get the idea. Even ancestral enzymes and pathways only provide a view on the evolution of fully differentiated, metabolically active and self-sustaining microorganisms that we would recognize today [with proper genomes, not to forget], but they do not allow a view to the really early stages and origin of life; theories on communal genomes before cell differentiation, and early evolution of protein domains and structural subunits try to fill the gap. This difference should be acknowledged. Again, nothing has survived from the dawn of life unchanged.</italic> </p><p>We removed the reference to the chemistry of early life from the concluding sentence and emphasized the importance of using early branching microorganisms to investigate the evolution of metabolism (subsection “Conclusions”).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Following are the key issues that need to be addressed:</italic> </p><p><italic>Much of the rebuttal consists of straw man arguments regarding the Weiss et al. study and origins of life issue that detract from my main points raised about their analyses. I apologize if the authors got the wrong idea from my original review, which was not to ask them to re-write their manuscript on the origins of life. I was not a co-author on that paper, but it is a good example of extensive taxon sampling and (in principle) a good method for determining vertical inheritance. As the authors note in their rebuttal whether or not Weiss et al. actually followed their method is currently debated in online comment forums, but this is outside the scope of the authors’ manuscript. By focusing on this, I think that the authors may have missed the main point of my review, which was that their methods for phylogenomic analyses were not sufficient (or at least not sufficiently explained in the Methods). It is possible that analyses were done satisfactorily but this is impossible to tell from the information provided. I have re-read the authors Methods carefully a second time in the revised manuscript, yet it is not possible to tell how the authors processed their data in the different analyses.</italic> </p><p><italic>My main point is that the authors need to explain in their Methods exactly how they did the different phylogenetic analyses, and provide a satisfactory justification for why they chose to treat their data in the way they did (e.g., why no concatenated gene phylogenies?) instead of following other conventional methods for interpreting bacterial phylogenomics. For example, concatenated gene trees possess more phylogenetic signals, and are less susceptible to the stochastic errors than those built from single genes (Wu and Eisen, 2008; Jeffroy et al. 2006). From what I can tell the authors performed single gene phylogenies of a handful of genes picked from the genomes.</italic> </p><p>In this second revision, we have significantly amended our Methods section (see the Methods section in the revised manuscript) and taken further step to ensure reproducibility of our analyses. We have also expanded the phylogenetic section by adding additional information requested by reviewer 2, including the number of sites used for the reconstruction. We strongly believe that reproducibility in science is a very important issue, and we strive to make our methods and data publicly available. All comparative genomic analysis and alignments carried out were already directly accessible as permanent url in the public genomeevolution.org server.</p><p>In order to identify the ancestral and acquired portion of the central metabolism of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>, we used a phylometabolic – rather than a phylogenomic – approach. In phylometabolic analyses, the metabolic pathways of the organism under investigation are compared to those found in related organisms both within and across neighboring clades. By focusing on the pathways, the comparison may reveal variations in multi-enzyme functional units, providing context for the completion of the pathway within the networks of individual organism, while also allowing for the identification of ancestral states and horizontal gene transfer events. The resulting phylometabolic tree includes multiple complete pathways to common essential metabolites, and suggests which evolutionary substitutions are allowed (at either organism or ecosystem levels) among these pathways (see Braakman and Smith, 2012 and reference therein for a more extensive description of the principles underlying this approach and more recently Braakman et al., 2017 for ecological application of this principles). In this second revision we included a section in the Methods explaining the rationale underlying phylometabolic approaches.</p><p><italic>The authors write in their rebuttal: &quot;That is incorrect, as members of the Desulfurobacteriaceae, Aquificaceae and Epsilonproteobacteria were included in the analyses and discussed throughout the manuscript. We used all available Aquificae genomes (as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), and further focused only on the closest relative and the Epsilonproteobacteria as an ecological proxy.&quot;</italic> </p><p><italic>A quick search of all available genomes from the Aquificae in IMG reveals that there are genomes from 29 representatives available for analysis. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> in the manuscript contains 17 of these, which cover the major clades but does not include all available genomes from each clade. Thus, the statement that the authors make that &quot;Comparative analyses between the genomes of T. ammonificans, all available Aquificae genomes…&quot; is incorrect. Taxon sampling (e.g., n=17 vs. n=29) can have an impact on the results of phylogenetic analyses. Usually the addition of more representatives can provide a better resolution. Please justify why you selected only these 17 for analysis.</italic> </p><p><italic>In the Methods section &quot;Comparative genomics&quot;: It is clear from this that you used the genomes in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>. But, it is not clear whether these same genomes were used to create the phylogenetic analyses or not.</italic> </p><p>At the time of writing, a quick search on the NCBI genome page will confirm the availability of 23 genomes divided in 17 <italic>Aquificae</italic> species. However, the number of available genomes is constantly increasing (the genome of <italic>Thermocrinis minervae</italic> was released in 2016/12/02 while <italic>Desulfurobacterium indicum</italic> was released in 2017/01/23; please see the list at the end of this letter).</p><p>In our analysis we included all the available genomes of validly published <italic>Aquificae</italic> species – that is, species that have been physiologically characterized and are recognized by the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes – and for which the type strain is available from a cell culture collection (e.g., ACCT or DSMZ). This will allow for future studies based on our findings to go beyond comparative genomics and test our hypotheses experimentally, using comparative physiological, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. However, in order to maximize the diversity of our genome dataset, we made two exceptions to this rule. The first exception was to include in the analysis one genome to represent the genus <italic>Hydrogenivirga</italic> and one to represent the genus <italic>Hydrogenobaculum</italic> (for which we selected the current reference genome, see NCBI page), as no genome sequence is available for validly published species of these genera. The second exception was to select two additional genomes belonging to the genera <italic>Desulfurobacterium</italic> (the closest relative to the genus <italic>Thermovibrio</italic>) and <italic>Persephonella,</italic> respectively.</p><p>The genomes excluded from our analysis are:</p><p>Four closely related genomes of the genus <italic>Hydrogenobaculum</italic> (average gapped genome similarity above 94% to the included <italic>Hydrogenobaculum</italic> sp.

No information is provided regarding the Ni-Fe hydrogenase phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), CO dehydrogenases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), or any other phylogenetic analyses that the authors base their conclusions on. At least, not from what I can tell after reading the section. I do not know whether this is intended or a mistake. Since the authors base their conclusions based on these results it seems like a good idea to explain how these analyses were done. For example, please state number of aligned resides for each tree, whether it is amino acids of DNA data, e.g. the standard information that readers deserve to know so that the authors work can be openly evaluated by the scientific community after publication. Another major question remains, which is why have the authors performed only single gene phylogenies as opposed to concatenated gene phylogenies? Please explain. Concatenated gene phylogenies are less susceptible to stochastic errors than those built from single genes.</italic> </p><p>We agree with reviewer 2 about the usefulness of concatenated phylogenies. However, the use of concatenated vs. single protein phylogenies depends on the objective of the study. Concatenated phylogenies are a powerful tool to resolve the phylogenetic relationships among organisms, and undoubtedly are less susceptible to stochastic errors (Wu and Eisen, 2008). Concatenated phylogenies are thus the appropriate mode of analysis when the objective is to resolve organismal relationships. However, concatenated phylogenies cannot be used to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of a gene (unless the concatenated phylogeny is performed <italic>exclusively</italic> on the multiple subunit of the same protein complex, as we have performed in the present study for the ATP-citrate lyase). Phylogenies of single enzyme (that can include multiple subunits) are necessary to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of the metabolic pathways they represent. In this context, the use of concatenated phylogenies, which include different genes or enzymes, can mask lateral gene transfer events, which need to be investigated singularly (Boussau et al., 2008; Philippe and Douady, 2003; Bapteste et al., 2004). Our objective was to identify the ancestral and acquired complement of the genome of <italic>T. ammonificans</italic>, and compare it with the genomes of other members of the <italic>Aquificae</italic>. A revision of the overall phylogenetic relationship among the different species and families of the <italic>Aquificae</italic> was not the object of this study. Rather, we aimed at reconstructing the history of key enzymes diagnostic of specific biochemical pathways, and at comparing the reconstructed histories of such key enzymes among members of <italic>Aquificae</italic>.</p><p>Therefore, we believe that the use of single protein phylogenies is appropriate to the objectives of our study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
