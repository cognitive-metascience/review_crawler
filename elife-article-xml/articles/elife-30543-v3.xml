Morphologically, autophagic cell death is characterized by vacuolization of the cytoplasm but with a lack of chromatin condensation as seen in apoptosis, or with a lack of organelle swelling as observed in necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kroemer et al., 2009</xref>). The existence of an autophagic cell death pathway as a bona fide active mechanism for cellular killing is somewhat controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kroemer and Levine, 2008</xref>). Fundamentally, the autophagic process is meant for cellular survival in times of nutrient deprivation or during other stresses that lead to cellular wasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gozuacik and Kimchi, 2007</xref>). Induction of autophagy results in the selective breakdown of cellular organelles and other proteins to redistribute energy to essential cellular processes as a last line of defense to maintain cellular viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gozuacik and Kimchi, 2007</xref>). However, if the nutrient deprivation persists this adaptive process transitions to a more deadly phase in which there is irreversible degradative consequences and progression to a form of cell death that is morphologically distinct from apoptosis or necrosis.</p><p>A distinct mechanistic feature that separates autophagic cell death from the other forms of cell death is the change in activity and accumulation of lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kroemer et al., 2009</xref>). Lysosomal-dependent cell death was first proposed in 1970’s based on visual rupture of this organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aits and Jäättelä, 2013</xref>). Lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and rupture has also been implicated as a concurrent process during apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Johansson et al., 2010</xref>). During LMP cathepsins are released into the cytosol of the cell where they induce caspase-dependent apoptosis or directly lead to necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boya and Kroemer, 2008</xref>). Depending on the stress and cell type many molecules have been proposed to influence LMP but the exact mechanism is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boya and Kroemer, 2008</xref>). One proposed mechanism is through the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kågedal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Feldstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Oberle et al., 2010</xref>). For example, <italic>Bax</italic> and <italic>Bak1</italic> double-knockout (DKO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) persist in serum-free and nutrient poor media while wild-type (WT) MEFs die (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wei et al., 2001</xref>). However, <italic>Bax/Bak1</italic> DKO MEFs are also resistant to both apoptotic and regulated necrotic cell death so the mechanistic basis for how Bax/Bak might normally permit a regulated form of autophagic cell death is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Karch and Molkentin, 2015</xref>). Here, we determined that autophagic cell death is dependent on Bax or Bak localized to the lysosome in their monomeric states where they permit LMP. In the absence of Bax/Bak, lysosomes are impermeable and have enhanced acidity and fail to rupture during a macro-autophagic event, while restoring LMP in <italic>Bax/Bak1</italic> DKO MEFs rescues serum starvation-induced autophagic cell death.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bax and Bak are required for autophagic cell death</title><p><italic>Bax/Bak1</italic> DKO MEFs are highly resistant to serum starvation-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wei et al., 2001</xref>). We confirmed this previous result and also examined whether reconstitution with either Bax or Bak was sufficient to restore this type of cell death in DKO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We also observed a similar level of protection in DKO MEFs subjected to amino acid-free media when compared to WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Indeed, expressing either Bax or Bak1 in the DKO background was sufficient to restore serum starvation-induced cell death, suggesting a role in autophagic killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We confirmed that serum starvation elicited an autophagic response with an LC3-GFP marker expressed by adenoviral-based transduction into WT and DKO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). LC3-GFP showed a punctate expression pattern after 24 hr serum starvation in both WT and DKO cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> ). Western blot analysis of autophagy related proteins also showed induction over 4 days of serum starvation, such as a shift from LC3-I to LC3-II, greater Lamp1 levels and cleavage of cathepsin D into its active form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy (EM) showed an accumulation of autophagy vacuoles and expanded lysosomes after two days of starvation in WT and DKO MEFs. However vacuoles in the DKO MEFs were smaller and less frequent compared with WT MEFs, andDKO MEFs with starvation uniquely showed dark punctate bodies in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Following four days of starvation WT MEFs broadly displayed loss of plasma membrane integrity whereas the plasma membrane of the DKO MEFs remained intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30543.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The expression of Bax or Bak are required for autophagic cell death.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wild type (WT) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), <italic>Bax/Bak1</italic> double knockout (DKO) MEFs, and DKO MEFs stably expressing Bax or Bak1 were subjected to serum starvation for the indicated time points and cell death was measured by loss of membrane integrity.

However, we previously showed that the monomeric states of Bax or Bak are sufficient to mediate increased permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane to permit MPTP-dependent, regulated necrotic killing of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Karch et al., 2013</xref>). Here we used two different oligomerization-deficient mutant versions of Bax reconstituted at a similar level to the WT control line within the background of DKO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hoppins et al., 2011</xref>). Remarkably, while DKO MEFs were resistant to serum starvation-induced cell death, reconstitution with Bax 63-65A or Bax 92-94A restored autophagic cell death to levels observed with WT Bax reconstitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, using an active-Bax specific antibody showed that this factor was not directly activated in serum-depleted WT MEFs, and Bax translocation was also undetectable in serum-starved DKO MEFs expressing a Bax-GFP fusion protein, although as a control apoptosis induction with staurosporine caused abundant translocation and Bax activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,D</xref>). Finally, Bak oligomerization was not detected in serum starved WT MEFs but it was with staurosporine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results indicate that Bax/Bak activation and oligomerization are not required for serum starvation-induced cell death.</p><p>WT and DKO MEFs were also treated with the BH3-memtic compounds gossypol and ABT-737 to further explore the mechanism of Bax/Bak-dependent cell death with serum starvation. Both of these compounds antagonize and inhibit the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl). However, gossypol is unique in that it elicits a conformational change in Bcl-2 that makes it pro-apoptotic like Bax/Bak, while ABT-737 simply blocks the activity of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">van Delft et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lei et al., 2006</xref>). Here, treatment with either of these agents enhanced the kinetics of cell death in WT MEFs, but only gossypol was able to restore autophagic killing in DKO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The observed effect on WT MEFs simply indicates that augmenting the activity of Bax/Bak, or artificially creating more ‘Bax/Bak-like’ activity can augment autophagic programmed killing. However, because gossypol but not ABT-737 restored autophagic killing in DKO MEFs, it further indicates that this form of cell death requires the expression of Bax/Bak.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>DKO MEFs have increased lysosomal acidity and decreased permeability</title><p>Closer inspection of serum-starved WT and DKO MEFs by transmission EM showed greater intracellular vesicular fragmentation in WTs with 1 and 2 days of starvation along with the appearance of electron dense vesicles in the DKOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To assess the identity of these vesicles live cell imaging was performed with LysoTracker red (lysosomes) and rhodamine-123 to assess mitochondrial membrane potential. We observed little to no difference in the mitochondria membrane potential between starved WT and DKO MEFs (green stain) but there was a dramatic difference in the fluorescence intensity of LysoTracker red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). LysoTracker red partitions to acidic vacuoles and its fluorescent intensity reflects accumulation in such structures, which are typically lysosomes or autolysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wubbolts et al., 1996</xref>). After 2 days of serum starvation DKO MEFs showed 3-fold greater LysoTracker red intensity than comparably starved WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which was also observed in DKO MEFs subjected to amino acid free media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To measure LMP directly we treated starved and LysoTracker red loaded WT and DKO MEFs with bafilomycin A1 to inhibit the vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, which is responsible for the acidification of the lysosome and autolysosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). If there is ongoing LMP, bafilomycin A1 treatment will lead to loss of accumulated LysoTracker red signal, but if LMP is very low, fluorescence will remain high. Indeed, bafilomyocin A1 treatment showed loss of red fluorescence in WT MEFs while DKO MEFs retained fluorescence indicating that loss of Bax/Bak no longer permits LMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>).

Here, we show that autophagic cell death in its terminal phases can be independent of classical apoptosis or mitochondrial-dependent regulated necrosis, with ultrastructural morphological characteristics specific to autophagy. Micro- and macroautophagy are well-known mediators of cellular health that protects from age-dependent disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rubinsztein et al., 2011</xref>), although there are selected acute disease states that require autophagic mediators to induce this unique form or cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Muller et al., 2017</xref>). For example, heart-specific Beclin 1 overexpressing transgenic mice with enhanced autophagy show cardiomyopathy while Beclin 1 heterozygous KOs mice with reduced autophagy are protected from pressure-overload stimulated cardiomyopathy collectively suggesting that augmented autophagy can lead to a degenerative like disorder in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zhu et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, genetic inhibition of the autophagic pathway is protective against neuronal and cardiomyocyte cell death following ischemic injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Koike et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Matsui et al., 2007</xref>). These observations support the hypothesis that autophagic cell death can have a pathologic counterpart in vivo in selected tissues and disease states.</p><p>One unique and defining aspect of regulated autophagic cell death is the absolute requirement for LMP through Bax/Bak. Importantly, this unique mechanism of cell death is separate from micro- and macro-autophagy that are induced early in starvation to maintain cell viability, although the expansion of lysosomes and autolysosomes during these states likely primes the cells for transition to the more active autophagic killing process as these vesicular structures undergo permeabilization, which consequently lowers intracellular pH and/or releases cathepsins.</p><p><italic>Bax</italic> and <italic>Bak1</italic> DKO MEFs are resistant to all three major forms of regulated cell death; apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wei et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Karch et al., 2013</xref>). Similar to their role in regulated necrosis, oligomerization of Bax and Bak are not required during the terminal process of autophagic cell death. Bax and Bak have been shown to lead to 2 states of permeability in membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Karch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dejean et al., 2005</xref>). In their non-oligomeric state they increase the permeability characteristics of the outer mitochondrial membrane and other lipid bilayers, while in their oligomeric state they greatly increase membrane permeability by forming large pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Karch et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we show that during autophagic cell death Bax and Bak are localized to and mediate an increase in lysosomal permeability in their monomeric state, without being overtly activated, similar to how they increase the general permeability characteristics of the mitochondrial outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Karch et al., 2013</xref>). In isolated lipid bilayers Bax alone increases membrane permeability caharacteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Karch et al., 2013</xref>). Also, multiple Bcl-2 family members including Bax and Bak can act on channels to influence membrane permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shimizu et al., 1999</xref>). In regards to LMP, it is unknown whether Bax/Bak act alone or with some other lysosomal membrane protein to increase permeability, although our results with MSDH suggest that it is simply the intrinsic permeability enhancing characteristics of these effectors that likely allows lysosomes to leak and/or rupture during the final phases of autophagic cell death. Indeed, gossypol restores autophagic killing in the absence of Bax/Bak by simply converting the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins into agents that increase membrane permeability like Bax/Bak.</p><p>Our results collectively place Bax and Bak at the nodal intersection between all three major forms of regulated cell death. Further elucidation of the crosstalk that takes place between these pathways through Bcl-2 family members has many diverse implications for medical applications. It will also be important to further characterize how Bax and Bak are selectively localized to the lysosome versus the mitochondria at baseline and with cell death inducing stimuli. It is remarkable that loss of Bax/Bak fully protect cells from serum starvation and terminal autophagy-dependent cell death, suggesting that inhibitors of monomeric Bax/Bak could be selectively used in preventing or reducing pathology and cell loss associated with selective degenerative disease states during aging while not inhibiting the protective effects ascribed to the autophagic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Muller et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>gene (Mus Musculus)</td><td>Bak1</td><td>N/A</td><td>ID: 12018</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>gene (Mus Musculus)</td><td>Bax</td><td>N/A</td><td>ID: 12028</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>cell line (Mus Musculus)</td><td>Wild Type SV40 Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts;

Briefly, WT MEFs were plated on six large bioassay dishes (ThermoFisher Scientific, 166508). Half of the plates were subjected to serum starvation for 24 hr. Cells were then washed, trypsinized and pelleted. Following an additional wash, cells were suspended in extraction buffer and subjected to Dounce homogenization (Pestle B) followed by centrifugation (1000 x g for 10 min). The supernatant was collected and then centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 20 min, which generated a pelleted crude lysosomal fraction, from which an aliquot of both the pellet and supernatant was collected for western blot analysis. The remaining crude lysosomal fraction was placed on an Optiprep step gradient and ultra-centrifuged at 150,000 x g for 4 hr. The lysosomal fractions werecollected and treated with 8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> for 15 min to further purify the lysosomes from the remaining mitochondria or ER. Finally the samples were centrifuged at 5000 x g for 15 min and both the pellet and supernatant (purest lysosomal fraction) were collected for western blot analysis. Protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 88666) was added to all samples. The MEFs and collected lysosomal pellets were homogenized in RadioImmunoPrecipitation Assay (RIPA) buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktails. After protein concentration was determined, SDS sample buffer was added to all samples and western blots were performed. For the Bak oligomerization assay WT MEFs were serum-starved for 48 hr or treated with 200 nM staurosporine and 20 μM zVAD-FMK for 24 hr, or left untreated and then homogenized in tris-buffered saline containing 1% n-Dodecyl-β-D-Maltoside and 1% digitonin. After the protein concentration was assessed NativePAGE sample buffer was added and a Western blot was performed. The following antibodies were used: Bax (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, sc-493, 1:300), Bak (Millipore, Burlington, MA. 06–536, 1:1000), LC3I/II (Abcam, Cambridge, UK. ab58610, 1:500), Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, sc-7382, 1:300), Lamp1 (Abcam, ab24170, 1:500), Lamp-1 (DSHB-University of Iowa, 1D4B, 1:1000), Cathepsin D (Novus, Uppsala, Sweden. AF1029, 1:800), GAPDH (Fitzgerald, Acton, MA. 10R-G109A, 1:25,000), Total OXPHOS Rodent WB Antibody Cocktail (Abcam, ab110413, 1:10,000) αtubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, sc-8035, 1:250).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistics</title><p>All results are presented as the mean ± SEM and all data were normally distributed.

The authors demonstrate that Bax, in its monomeric form and specifically targeted to the lysosome, is sufficient to increase lysosomal membrane permeability and to restore autophagic cell death in the DKO MEFs. In addition, increasing lysosomal permeability using a lysomotropic detergent also rescued autophagic cell death in the DKO MEFs. Taken together, this is an important study that shows that as like in apoptosis and necrosis Bax/Bak play a critical role in autophagic cell death by regulating lysosome membrane permeability.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) &quot;Autophagic cell death&quot; is not a well-defined term. A detailed description of the morphology of dead cells will help the readers understand better. The cell death assay mentioned in the Materials and methods section is the Muse Count &amp; Viability assay, which uses a cell membrane impermeable dye to mark dead cells. Can the authors provide direct evidence that the dead cells have a compromised plasma membrane?</p><p>2) The claim of &quot;autophagic cell death&quot; is not sufficiently demonstrated. There is autophagy in the serum-starved cells and there is cell death. But the authors did not provide sufficient evidence that the cell death induced by serum starvation is driven by autophagy, not just associated with autophagy. It is well known that serum starvation will induce autophagy, apoptosis, and non-apoptotic cell death. To demonstrate the cell death observed in WT MEF cells, the following experiments will be helpful. (A) It will be more convincing if the authors could use a more defined autophagy inducer, such as amino acid deprivation to induce cell death. (B) In the serum-starvation induced cell death system, it will be more convincing if the authors could show inhibition with autophagy inhibitor such as 3-MA, or by loss-of-function of autophagic genes (ATG5/6 etc.) could block cell death.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>: The authors show that oligomerization-deficient mutants of Bax restore autophagic cell death in the DKO MEFs.

The fact that Bax oligomerization does not seem to be important for this form of cell death does not allow the conclusion that Bax does not need to be activated. Does serum-starvation induce the insertion of Bax into the lysosome membrane to become an integral membrane protein? Does Bax go through a conformational change (e.g., N-term exposure)?

But the image could not demonstrate the active cathepsin B is in the lysosomes or cytosol. This could be resolved by GFP-LAMP1 viral transduction. An important point of the manuscript is that LMP by Bax/Bak is required for autophagic cell death. But the evidence for lysosomes content spilling into the cytosol is missing. The lysotracker staining going down could be because the ability to maintain lysosome pH is compromised in serum-starved cells, not LMP.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>: The message in this picture is not clear since miniSOG-Bax seems to be expressed in many regions of the cell (not only in the mitochondria and lysosome as depicted by the arrows).</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>: The authors should show that lysosome-Bax is exclusively targeted to the lysosome.

However, the field has generally usurped this term to refer to the eventual death of starved cells that were in a prolonged period of protection due to &quot;internal combustion&quot;. To provide better clarity on our use of the term “autophagic cell death” we have added a description of how this process is morphologically unique from apoptosis and necrosis to the Introduction of the manuscript. As further definitional support, we also assess plasma membrane rupture by using a membrane impermeable dye and we have used EM pictures to show the ultrastructural hallmarks of this protracted type of cell death. In the revised manuscript we also add EM pictures of 4 day serum starved WT and DKO MEFs to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. Indeed, these pictures display direct plasma membrane rupture in the WT and not in the DKO MEFs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The claim of &quot;autophagic cell death&quot; is not sufficiently demonstrated.

Indeed, in the revised manuscript we show that loss of Bax and Bak rendered MEFs protective from amino acid depravation-induced autophagic cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we also examined the lysosomes of amino acid deprived WT and DKO MEFs using lyso-tracker Red and we observed that the intensity of the stain was enhanced in the deprived DKO MEF vs the WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), very similar to what we report with serum starvation. As stated above, we believe that the autophagic process is at first a protective process rather than maladaptive during “autophagic cell death”, which explains our results in attempting to perform this experiment with 3-MA. Indeed, use of 3-MA is serum-starved WT MEFs enhanced cell death, but extent of death and earlier onset (data not shown). These results are consistent with previous findings in the literature (Shimizu et al., 2004) hence we did not include such a protocol as it would be confusing to the readership.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>: The authors show that oligomerization-deficient mutants of Bax restore autophagic cell death in the DKO MEFs. Based on these findings, they conclude that &quot;These results indicate that Bax/Bak activation and oligomerization are not required for serum starvation-induced cell death&quot;. The fact that Bax oligomerization does not seem to be important for this form of cell death does not allow the conclusion that Bax does not need to be activated. Does serum-starvation induce the insertion of Bax into the lysosome membrane to become an integral membrane protein? Does Bax go through a conformational change (e.g., N-term exposure)? Does it homo-oligomerize in the lysosome membrane? In addition, in order to compare the effect of WT Bax and Bax mutants, expression level of these proteins need to be shown by Western blotting.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct that just because DKO MEFs reconstituted with oligomeric dead mutants of Bax can restore serum-deprived cell death does not mean that endogenous Bax activation, membrane insertion and oligomerization is not happening in starved WT MEFs. In the revised manuscript we address these issues. Using an antibody that specifically recognizes active Bax (N-term exposure) we determined that serum starved MEFs do not have a detectable amount of active Bax, while staurosporine strongly gives reactivity with this antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2— figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, since Bax does not become activated with this stimuli it would be unlikely that a detectable translocation event would occur. Indeed, using DKO MEFs expressing GFP fused to Bax we determined that under serum deprivation no noticeable translocation of Bax occurs and it remains mainly cytosolic, yet staurosporine strongly induces translocation and aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, we measured the oligomeric state of Bak under serum deprivation and did not detect an increase in Bak oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In conclusion, unlike apoptosis, “autophagic cell death&quot; does not require the activation and oligomerization of Bax and Bak but it does require their expression, which is similar to our previous mechanistic findings on regulated necrotic cell death at the level of the mitochondria through monomeric Bax or Bak, exclusively. In addition, we have added the requested Western blots to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and show that the expression levels of WT Bax is nearly identical to the mutant versions (important control).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. The authors imply that lysosomes are permeabilized in WT MEF cells after serum starvation.

How much cytosolic Bax is translocated to the lysosome as compared to the mitochondria following serum-starvation? Do other forms of cell death (apoptosis, necrosis) also induce Bax translocation to the lysosome?</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above we did not detect appreciable Bax translocation to the lysosome during serum starvation by immunofluorescence, as we believe that the monomeric form of Bax already in the lysosome it fully sufficient to mediate permeability. Indeed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows by cellular fractionation and Western blotting that both Bax and Bak are part of the lysosome at baseline, with even a bit more following serum starvation. Currently, we are unsure as to how Bax and Bak get to the lysosome. One idea is that it is through mitochondrial membrane budding as has been previously suggested to aid in lysosomal formation (Soubannier et al., 2012). Another idea supported by the literature is that Bax and possibly Bak can be found in most intracellular membrane systems (endoplasmic reticulum) in the cell at a small but significant level. However, as far as other forms of cell death are concerned, we used staurosporine as an apoptotic control for the previously mentioned Bax translocation immunofluorescent experiments and observed Bax translocation to the mitochondria and not to the lysosome as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, the mitochondria are still the primary mechanistic site for active and oligomerized Bax and Bak with dedicated docking proteins in this organelles outer membrane (VDAC).</p></body></sub-article></article>
