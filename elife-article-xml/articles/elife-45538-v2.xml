double-hexamer, ensuring activated helicases depart the origin bidirectionally. To understand the formation and importance of this double-hexamer, we identified mutations in a conserved and essential Mcm4 motif that permit loading of two Mcm2-7 complexes but are defective for double-hexamer formation. Single-molecule studies show mutant Mcm2-7 forms initial hexamer-hexamer interactions; however, the resulting complex is unstable. Kinetic analyses of wild-type and mutant Mcm2-7 reveal a limited time window for double-hexamer formation following second Mcm2-7 association, suggesting that this process is facilitated. Double-hexamer formation is required for extensive origin DNA unwinding but not initial DNA melting or recruitment of helicase-activation proteins (Cdc45, GINS, Mcm10). Our findings elucidate dynamic mechanisms of origin licensing, and identify the transition between initial DNA melting and extensive unwinding as the first initiation event requiring double-hexamer formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>Mcm2-7</kwd><kwd>origin licensing</kwd><kwd>helicase</kwd><kwd>single-molecule studies</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM52339</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>Stephen P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>Stephen P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011671</institution-id><institution>G.

Each eukaryotic origin is licensed during G1 phase through loading of the replicative helicase. The ring-shaped heterohexameric Mcm2-7 helicase is loaded around origin DNA by three loading proteins - ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>). The resulting licensed origin has two Mcm2-7 complexes encircling the DNA in a head-to-head orientation with their N-terminal domains interacting to form a ‘double hexamer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abid Ali et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Noguchi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Remus et al., 2009</xref>). Because they are poised to leave the origin in opposite directions, the head-to-head orientation of the loaded double hexamer is the first step in the establishment of bidirectional replication initiation. In the subsequent S phase, a subset of these helicases interact with two helicase-activating proteins, Cdc45 and GINS to form the active replicative helicase known as Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS (CMG) complex. This complex is then activated by Mcm10, leading to DNA unwinding, replication fork assembly and the initiation of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lõoke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yeeles et al., 2015</xref>). Separation of helicase loading and activation into distinct cell-cycle stages ensures that no origin can initiate replication more than once per cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Helicase loading requires a series of ordered association and dissociation events. ORC-DNA binding is followed by Cdc6 association and recruitment of a Mcm2-7-Cdt1 complex to form a transient four-protein intermediate called the ORC-Cdc6-Cdt1-Mcm2-7 (OCCM) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Randell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). The ordered release of Cdc6 and Cdt1 along with ATP hydrolysis by the Mcm2-7 complex results in closing of the first Mcm2-7 ring around the origin DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ticau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>). Two models have been proposed to explain the recruitment and loading of the second Mcm2-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yardimci and Walter, 2014</xref>). A two-ORC model suggests that there are two independent rounds of Mcm2-7 loading involving two ORC-Cdc6 complexes. These two loaded Mcm2-7 complexes are proposed to subsequently come together through translocation on the double-stranded origin DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coster and Diffley, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frigola et al., 2013</xref>). This model is supported by the in vivo requirement for two ORC-binding sites at origins of replication and mutations that suggest that both the first and second Mcm2-7 complexes interact with ORC during loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coster and Diffley, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frigola et al., 2013</xref>). A second model proposes a single ORC molecule loads both the first and second Mcm2-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>), with interactions between the first and second Mcm2-7 complex playing an important role during loading of the second Mcm2-7. This model is supported by single-molecule analysis of helicase loading, which observed that one ORC molecule is sufficient for Mcm2-7 double-hexamer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The Mcm2-7 helicase is a two-tiered, ring-shaped complex comprised of six distinct but related subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abid Ali and Costa, 2016</xref>). The C-terminal domain (CTD) of each subunit is composed of AAA+ ATPase and winged-helix domains. The folded N-terminal domain (NTD) of each subunit includes an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding- (OB-) and, in some cases, a Zn-finger fold. In addition, Mcm2, Mcm4 and Mcm6 include extensive unstructured N-terminal extensions (NTEs). Although unrelated to one another, these NTEs are a conserved feature of these Mcm subunits in all eukaryotic species examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miller and Enemark, 2015</xref>). Once loaded, the tight interaction between the two Mcm2-7 complexes in the double hexamer is mediated by the NTDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Noguchi et al., 2017</xref>). It is clear that the Mcm4 and Mcm6 NTEs are critical targets of DDK during helicase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deegan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Randell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sheu and Stillman, 2010</xref>). The NTEs are not observed in structures of the Mcm2-7 double hexamer on or off the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abid Ali et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Noguchi et al., 2017</xref>) suggesting that the NTEs do not form a well-ordered structure at the interface holding the two hexamers together. Despite this, the NTEs are well positioned to facilitate initial interactions between the Mcm2-7 complexes and their role during helicase loading has not been examined in detail.</p><p>Although the formation of the Mcm2-7 double hexamer is critical to ensure bidirectional replication, it is unclear when or whether this form of the helicase is required for initiation. A key tool to address the role of double-hexamer formation would be separation-of-function mutations that allow loading of individual Mcm2-7 helicases but interfere with formation of the double hexamer. Such mutations would allow an investigation of which steps, if any, during replication initiation require the double-hexamer form of Mcm2-7.</p><p>To investigate the formation and function of the Mcm2-7 double hexamer, we initially focused on the function of the MCM NTEs. We made Mcm2-7 complexes lacking individual NTEs and found that constructs with a deletion of the Mcm2 or Mcm4 NTE were defective in helicase loading. During these studies, we identified a highly-conserved and essential motif within the Mcm4 NTD that is required for stable Mcm2-7 double-hexamer formation. Using single-molecule FRET analysis, we showed that mutation of this motif allows Mcm2-7 DNA loading and initial double-hexamer interactions, but the resulting complexes quickly dissociate. Although the separated Mcm2-7 complexes remain on the DNA, they do not form a double hexamer again. For both the wild-type and mutant Mcm2-7 complexes, all double hexamers form in a limited period of time after the DNA association of the second Mcm2-7. Mcm2-7 with a mutation in the Mcm4 motif cannot support replication initiation in vitro. Interestingly, these complexes can associate with helicase-activating proteins and perform initial origin DNA melting but fail to transition to extensive DNA unwinding. Our observations identify a key motif required for stable Mcm2-7-Mcm2-7 interactions and identify the transition to extensive origin DNA unwinding as the first step in replication initiation that requires the double-hexamer form of the helicase.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>N-terminal deletions of Mcm2 and Mcm4 inhibit Mcm2-7 loading</title><p>To study the role of Mcm2, Mcm4 and Mcm6 N-terminal extensions (NTEs) in helicase loading, we created deletion mutations lacking these elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We used Quick2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dosztányi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zimmermann et al., 2018</xref>) and the location of phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Randell et al., 2010</xref>) to identify the N-terminal unstructured regions for each subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on these criteria, we purified Mcm2-7 complexes containing Mcm2<sup>Δ2-177</sup>, Mcm4<sup>Δ2-181</sup>, or Mcm6<sup>Δ2-105</sup>. Subsequent structural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abid Ali et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Noguchi et al., 2017</xref>) suggested that the first structured amino acids of Mcm2, Mcm4, and Mcm6 are amino acids 201, 177, and 103, respectively. Thus, we deleted the unstructured regions of Mcm2 and Mcm6, but included a small structured region in the Mcm4 NTE deletion. In addition, we purified Mcm2-7 containing Mcm4<sup>Δ2-174</sup>, which bypasses the requirement of DDK in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sheu and Stillman, 2010</xref>) but had not been characterized biochemically. Importantly, upon expression with the other five wild-type subunits and Cdt1, each mutant Mcm subunit assembled into a stable Mcm2-7 heterohexamer that bound to Cdt1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In contrast, Mcm2-7<sup>4Δ174</sup> and Mcm2-7<sup>6Δ105</sup> are loaded at similar levels as the wild-type protein. Thus, the Mcm2 and Mcm4 deletions interfere with stable helicase loading. To determine whether these deletions impact MCM function in vivo, we assessed the ability of each of the mutant MCM genes to complement a deletion of the corresponding wild-type gene. Although Mcm2-7<sup>2Δ177</sup> and Mcm2-7<sup>4Δ181</sup> show incomplete helicase-loading defects in vitro, each of these mutants is lethal in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Alternatively, the DoHM could be required to initiate double-hexamer formation. In the experiments described thus far, we used an ensemble assay to monitor double-hexamer formation. This assay requires the two Mcm2-7 complexes to remain associated during size-exclusion chromatography to be detected. Thus, defects either in the rate of stable double-hexamer formation or in the lifetime of the double-hexamer complex would not be distinguished by this assay.</p><p>To monitor double-hexamer interactions in real time, we used a single-molecule FRET assay for double-hexamer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>).

Analysis of wild-type helicase-loading events (N = 89) revealed that immediately after arrival of the second Mcm2-7, the two-Mcm2-7 complexes were primarily in state that exhibited zero or very low FRET (<italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> = 0.029 ± 0.003, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–i and D-ii</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1 - table 1</xref>). However, shortly after the second Mcm2-7 arrived, many (~70%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1 - table 1</xref>) of the DNAs associated with wild-type Mcm2-7 transitioned to a state exhibiting increased FRET (<italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> = 0.606 ± 0.002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–iii and D-iv</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1 - table 1</xref>). Importantly, all the complexes that transitioned to high <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> remained in that state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–i and D-iv</xref>) until the observation was terminated by the end of the recording or by the disappearance of donor and/or acceptor fluorescence (either due to photobleaching or sliding of the double hexamer off the DNA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, black arrow). These observations are consistent with our previous studies showing that wild-type Mcm2-7 rapidly forms stable double hexamers upon recruitment of the second Mcm2-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>). In the data collected shortly (~0–10 s) after arrival of the second Mcm2-7, there is some evidence for the presence of a transient state with <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> intermediate between zero and the high value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–ii</xref>, black bar) but the additional state, if present, was not clearly resolved in the current experiments.</p><p>After arrival of the second Mcm2-7, the DoHM mutant also exhibited an initial state with similarly low FRET followed by a rapid transition on many of the DNA molecules to a state with high FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, like wild-type Mcm2-7, the DoHM mutant can form a structure in which the two hexamers are so closely apposed that the donor and acceptor fluorophores are separated by only a few nanometers. However, there are two noticeable differences in the <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> time courses with the DoHM mutant helicase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). First, the elevated <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> value observed for the DoHM mutant was distinct (0.468 ± 0.010) and significantly lower than that observed for wild-type Mcm2-7 (0.606 ± 0.002, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1 - table 1</xref>). This difference suggests that the high <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> state of the DoHM mutant has a three-dimensional structure and/or dynamics that differ from those of the wild-type double hexamers. Second, the DoHM mutant complexes that transition to the elevated <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> state do not remain there. Instead, the helicases quickly (in ~20 s) transition back to a state in which both hexamers are still bound to the DNA but which display low FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–i and E–iv</xref>). Together, these data indicate that the double-hexamer interactions formed by the DoHM mutant are incomplete and unstable.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mcm2-7-Mcm2-7 interactions occur rapidly or not at all</title><p>To examine the formation and stability of the double-hexamer complexes, we analyzed all DNA molecules associated with one donor- and one acceptor-labeled Mcm2-7 to determine the timing of transitions between the low-<italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> and the high-<italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> states observed in the wild-type and the DoHM mutant FRET records. Both of these data sets contained significant subpopulations of DNA molecules that have bound both donor- and acceptor-labeled Mcm2-7 but which do not exhibit FRET at any point in the recording. This suggests that some complexes exist in a configuration that is refractory to double-hexamer formation, a configuration that we will refer to as non-double hexamer (non-DH). Therefore, a minimal kinetic scheme to explain the wild-type Mcm2-7 data contains at least three molecular states: the high <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> = ~0.45–0.6 state that we interpret as double-hexamer (DH) and two states with indistinguishable <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> = ~0 values, but that can be distinguished by their lifetimes: the long-lived non-DH state and the transient pre-double-hexamer (pre-DH) state that exists in the short time interval between binding of the second Mcm2-7 and the formation of a DH (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Together, these data indicate that once two wild-type Mcm2-7 complexes associate with DNA they either rapidly transition to a double hexamer or remain as a pair of single hexamers.</p><p>We also analyzed the Mcm2-7<sup>4-178A</sup> <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> data by fitting it to a three-state model analogous to that used for the wild-type data. Three characteristics of the resulting analysis are similar between wild-type and the DoHM mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). First, in most cases, the arrival of the second Mcm2-7 was followed by a rapid transition from an initial very low-FRET state (pre-DH) to a higher <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> state (62 of 100) or the high-FRET state was present at the first time point (13 of 100). Second, these transitions occurred rapidly and with a similar rate constant (0.13 ± 0.04 s<sup>−1</sup>) to wild-type (0.15 ± 0.08). Third, the remaining second Mcm2-7 binding events (25 of 100) never exhibited the high-FRET state and were categorized as in the non-DH state. Thus, like the wild-type helicase, the DoHM mutant either rapidly exhibited a high-FRET state or remained in the low-FRET state throughout the observations.</p><p>There were two significant differences in the kinetics of double-hexamer interactions exhibited by the DoHM mutant helicase. As mentioned earlier, the high <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> state of the mutant is different from that of the DH state of the wild type (<italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub><sup>DoHM</sup> = 0.468 ± 0.010; <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub><sup>WT</sup> = 0.606 ± 0.002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, we refer to this state as the pseudo-double hexamer (pseudo-DH). A second distinction is the short-lived nature of this state. The DoHM mutant rapidly (0.052 ± 0.007 s<sup>−1</sup>) transitioned from the pseudo-DH state back to a low-FRET state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, the state that follows the pseudo-DH is a long-lived low-FRET state, which we termed post-double-hexamer (post-DH). This state is kinetically distinct from the short-lived low-FRET pre-DH state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) but is indistinguishable from the non-DH state; both are long-lived and exhibit similar low-FRET values. Thus, these states are grouped together into a single non-DH/post-DH state for the kinetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref>). Although the mutant pre-DH molecules rapidly transitioned to pseudo-DH and then to post-DH, the rates of the reverse reactions (pseudo-DH to pre-DH and post-DH to pseudo-DH) were both calculated to be &gt; 100 times slower and not significantly non-zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings suggest that both of these transitions are essentially irreversible and that once the two mutant Mcm2-7 complexes that form a pseudo-DH separate they will not form subsequent stable interactions. Records that were interpreted as showing a transition from non-DH/post-DH back to the high <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> pseudo-DH state were rare (3 of 100) and sometimes showed only a single time point in the pseudo-DH state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, e.g. trajectory 67), possibly arising from infrequent errors in state assignment. Even though most or all post-DH molecules never returned to a high <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> state, we find that both the DoHM mutant complexes remain associated with the DNA for extended times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with both helicases having successfully encircled the DNA. These findings support a model in which there is a limited window of opportunity to form double-hexamer interactions during helicase loading after which two loaded Mcm2-7 complexes cannot interact.</p><p>We also noted that the lifetime of two single hexamers associated with the DNA is noticeably shorter than that of a double hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>, non-DH and post-DH states, blue lines, note that release of either of the two Mcm2-7 present results in the end of the record as we are looking for double-hexamer formation). Two wild-type Mcm2-7 complexes in the context of a double-hexamer can remain on the DNA for over 600 s, with many lasting to the end of observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, yellow lines). In contrast, the retention of both of two single hexamers with the DNA whether they are wild-type or DoHM mutants is much shorter (~300 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>, blue lines). The average duration of DNA association for two wild-type Mcm2-7 complexes is 288 ± 23 s compared to 140 ± 9 s for the DoHM mutant. This observation suggests that the single Mcm2-7 complexes are less stably associated with the DNA relative to Mcm2-7 complexes in the form of double-hexamers. This difference is consistent with the reduced loading observed in the bulk experiments with the DoHM mutant.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Double-hexamer formation is required for later steps of replication initiation</title><p>Our analysis of the Mcm2-7<sup>4-178A</sup> mutant indicates that the DoHM is important for double-hexamer formation and stability.

We used bead-attached templates to monitor association of Cdc45, GINS, and Mcm10 with origin DNA associated with the indicated Mcm2-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lõoke et al., 2017</xref>). Although there is less association of these proteins with the DoHM mutant, the reduction corresponds with the reduced loading of this version of Mcm2-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7C</xref>). Thus, DDK-dependent association of Cdc45, GINS and Mcm10 with Mcm2-7-associated DNA was not compromised in the context of DoHM Mcm2-7 single hexamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>).</p><p>We also addressed the impact of the DoHM mutant on origin DNA unwinding using an assay that detects the formation of supercoiled DNA as a consequence of the unwinding process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>). We initially used a 3.8 kb circular template that allows detection of extensive DNA unwinding. Consistent with the lack of replication, the DoHM mutant showed no evidence of DNA unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) in this assay, as indicated by the lack of formation of supercoiled DNA. We performed the same assay with a ~ 600 bp circle that allows detection of small topological changes that are formed after CMG formation but do not require Mcm10 action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with productive Cdc45 and GINS association with the DoHM mutant, we observed equivalent amounts of these initial intermediates for wild-type and DoHM proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Both the small topological changes observed with the DoHM mutant and the finding that these intermediates are formed in the presence or absence of Mcm10 indicated that they are the result of initial DNA melting.

Using single-molecule studies, we show that this mutant does not prevent initial interactions between the two Mcm2-7 hexamers but that the resulting interactions are incomplete and unstable. Interestingly, these analyses reveal evidence consistent with a limited window of opportunity for double-hexamer formation after recruitment of the second Mcm2-7. Finally, using a DoHM mutant that prevents stable double-hexamer formation, we demonstrate that the Mcm2-7 double hexamer is required for extensive origin DNA unwinding but not initial recruitment of helicase-activating proteins or origin melting.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Double-hexamer formation is a facilitated event</title><p>There are two general models to explain how two Mcm2-7 complexes form a double hexamer. The first model proposes that the two Mcm2-7 helicases are loaded independently, then slide along DNA, and form a double hexamer through interactions between their N-terminal domains independent of other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coster and Diffley, 2017</xref>). An alternative model is that helicase-loading proteins are required to facilitate both loading of the Mcm2-7 complexes and double-hexamer formation. Consistent with the latter model, kinetic analyses of the single-molecule studies presented here provide evidence that double-hexamer formation is facilitated. For both wild-type and the DoHM mutant, the formation of FRET between Mcm7 subunits after arrival of the second Mcm2-7 is rapid (k<sub>DHex</sub> = 0.13–0.15 s<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D–i, E–i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A and B</xref>). Indeed, all double-hexamer formation observed occurs within 30 s after arrival of the second Mcm2-7. In addition, double hexamer interaction is detected significantly sooner (1/0.15 s<sup>−1</sup> = ~7 s) after second Mcm2-7 arrival than second Mcm2-7 ring closure (~57 s, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ticau et al., 2017</xref>), indicating that interactions between the hexamers anticipates completion of loading of the second Mcm2-7. These comparisons argue against a model in which helicase loading for both hexamers is complete at the time hexamer-hexamer interactions first occur. Instead, our findings strongly suggest that loading of the second hexamer and double-hexamer formation are coordinated.</p><p>We propose that double-hexamer formation requires one or more helicase-loading proteins and that the limited dwell times of these proteins on DNA results in a short window of opportunity for double-hexamer formation. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that, in both wild-type Mcm2-7 and the DoHM mutant cases, two Mcm2-7 complexes either rapidly transition to a high-FRET state after the second Mcm2-7 arrives or do not visit the high-FRET state at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Similarly, neither the rare wild-type nor frequent DoHM mutant instances that show a high-FRET to low-FRET transition ever displayed a second interval of high FRET (0 of 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6C</xref> and 0 of 75, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These observations suggest that the establishment of the hexamer-hexamer interactions resulting in high FRET are associated with an irreversible step that prevents subsequent high-FRET transitions if that initial complex is unstable. If two Mcm2-7 complexes could form a double-hexamer unassisted, we would expect subsequent transitions into the high-FRET state in these cases, as the two non-interacting Mcm2-7 complexes frequently remain on the DNA for &gt;100 s. The long dwell times of the single hexamers also argues against models in which the instability of single Mcm2-7 complexes on DNA prevents a second attempt to form the double hexamer. The hypothesis that helicase-loading proteins facilitate double-hexamer formation is consistent with previous single-molecule studies showing that Cdc6, Cdt1 and ORC are all released from the DNA shortly after arrival of the second Mcm2-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, such a mechanism would have the advantage of only allowing double-hexamer formation during loading and preventing such interactions from occurring at other times of the cell cycle (e.g. as replication forks converge).</p><p>Although release of any of the helicase-loading factors could prevent second attempts to form a double hexamer, the average release time of the second Cdc6 after arrival of the second Mcm2-7 (~23 s) would best fit the window of opportunity that we observe (i.e. DH are not formed longer than 30 s after second Mcm2-7 arrival). Another possibility is that closure of the Mcm2-7 ring terminates the ability of Mcm2-7 to form a double hexamer. However, the average time for this event relative to arrival of the second Mcm2-7 (~57 s) is much longer than the average time for double-hexamer formation after the second Mcm2-7 arrives, making release of Cdc6 a more likely candidate for the process that prevents subsequent double-hexamer formation.</p><p>We did not see a dramatic difference in the number of second Mcm2-7 association events for the DoHM mutant, suggesting that the interactions interrupted by this mutant are not required to recruit the second Mcm2-7 to the DNA. This is consistent with models in which the recruitment of two Mcm2-7 complexes is independent of Mcm-Mcm interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coster and Diffley, 2017</xref>). We note, however, that, under the conditions of our single-molecule reactions, only one ORC molecule is required for these two events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>). It remains possible that the initial recruitment of the second Mcm2-7 involves Mcm-Mcm interactions that are not detected by the FRET probe or inhibited by the DoHM mutant. Development of additional modified Mcm2-7 complexes to detect interactions at other sites will help to address this possibility.</p><p>Although there is no difference in the number of second Mcm2-7 association for the DoHM mutant, we observed a shorter lifetime of the association of two DoHM mutant complexes with DNA (average 140 ± 9 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) compared to wild-type Mcm2-7 (average 288 ± 23 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The most likely explanation of this difference is that Mcm2-7 single hexamers have a reduced stability on DNA relative to a Mcm2-7 double hexamer. Although previous studies showed that single Mcm2-7 hexamers can be loaded onto the DNA in a salt-stable manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>), it is possible that, the single DoHM mutant complexes are more prone to dissociate from the DNA. In support of this hypothesis, we see the same shorter dwell times for pairs of wild-type Mcm2-7 that fail to form a double-hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, blue lines). This is consistent with the decreased helicase loading of the DoHM mutant in the ensemble loading assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Although it is also possible that the decreased loading is due to single hexamers sliding off the of the linear DNA substrate used in the initial bulk assays (e.g <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), this is unlikely because we see the same reduction in DoHM loading when a circular DNA template is used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>).</p><p>We note that in both the wild-type and DoHM mutant experiments there are frequent instances when two Mcm2-7 complexes associate with the DNA for long periods of time but show no transitions to high FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>, non-DH traces). As discussed above, one possibility is that these molecules have lost a helicase-loading protein(s) required for double-hexamer formation before establishing this complex. Alternatively, the lack of double-hexamer formation in these cases could be because the two Mcm2-7 complexes are loaded on the DNA in an incorrect orientation. For example, two sequential ‘first’ loading events on the same DNA would result in two Mcm2-7 complexes in the same orientation. We note that there are many instances (primarily for the DoHM mutant) in which initial hexamer-hexamer interactions are unstable, but the separated hexamers do not make a second attempt to form a stable double hexamer. In these cases, the second hypothesis cannot explain the lack of a second attempt to form the double hexamer as the two Mcm2-7 complexes must have been in the appropriate orientation to form the initial high-FRET (pseudo-DH) interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Structure of double-hexamer and the DoHM interactions</title><p>The lower <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> value of the mutant pseudo-DH state suggests that the DoHM mutation interferes with proper interactions at the double-hexamer interface. This hypothesis is consistent with the cryo-EM structures of the Mcm2-7 double hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abid Ali et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Noguchi et al., 2017</xref>). In each of the structures, the DoHM is part of a key double-hexamer interface. The DoHM forms a loop that interacts with Mcm5 N-terminal domain from the opposite hexamer. In addition, the DoHM interacts with one end of an extended Mcm7 alpha helix from the same hexamer. Importantly, the other end of this Mcm7 helix interacts with Mcm5 of the opposite hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), raising the possibility that the DoHM positions this helix to appropriately interact with the other hexamer. These interactions are present in the Mcm2-7 double-hexamer structures both with and without DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abid Ali et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Noguchi et al., 2017</xref>). There are two sets of these three-subunit interactions (Mcm4-Mcm5-Mcm7) located on opposite sides of the double-hexamer interface (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Thus, although the DoHM is a small region compared to the large double-hexamer interface, disrupting this motif has the potential to interrupt the interactions involving 6 of the 12 subunits participating in the double-hexamer interface.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-45538-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45538.020</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Illustration of the DoHM interactions in the Mcm2-7 double hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abid Ali et al., 2017</xref>).</title><p>The DoHM of Mcm4 (green), the region of Mcm7 that interacts with the DoHM (light blue), and the region of Mcm5 from the opposite hexamer that interacts with the DoHM (yellow) are all shown in space filling representation.

Although it was assumed that double hexamers are an essential part of DNA replication initiation, the replication initiation step that required the double hexamer was unknown. The DoHM mutant allowed us to evaluate the role of the double-hexamer complex. We found that the DoHM mutant can assemble CMG complexes that perform limited initial DNA unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This degree of topological change corresponds to the modest unwinding of less than one turn of DNA per helicase previously observed as a consequence of CMG formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>). The detection of this initial DNA unwinding indicates that the interactions of Cdc45 and GINS with the DoHM mutant are productive. Since the DoHM mutant does not form stable double hexamers, this initial unwinding is likely to arise from independent helicases. We note that based on the measured lifetimes of the DoHM mutant pseudo-double-hexamers, helicase-activation proteins are not in a position to stabilize the pseudo-double hexamers before they dissociate. In these experiments, DDK phosphorylation is performed for 20 min <italic>prior</italic> to addition of the helicase-activation proteins, which is much longer than the ~20 s (1/0.052 s<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) on average that the DoHM mutant is in the pseudo-DH state. We also note that once separated, we observe no evidence of subsequent hexamer-hexamer interactions. Thus, our findings strongly suggest that this initial unwinding occurs by manipulation of the DNA within a single CMG complex rather than through the coordinated action of two opposing helicases.</p><p>In contrast to the ability of the DoHM mutant to catalyze initial DNA unwinding, this form of the helicase cannot perform more extensive DNA unwinding that requires Mcm10. This result strongly suggests that double-hexamer interactions are required to drive this DNA unwinding. If true, this hypothesis would suggest that additional DNA unwinding outside the central channel of the helicase requires a tight interface between the two helicases. One way, this tight interface could be necessary is if opposing action of the two helicases drives DNA unwinding and formation of the replication bubble. A requirement for the double-hexamer could occur before the two hexamers separate or in a second event that involves the two hexamers coming back together after they separate during CMG formation. The latter hypothesis is consistent with recent studies suggesting that CMG formation causes double-hexamer separation followed by an Mcm10-dependent transition involving two CMG complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Langston and O'Donnell, 2019</xref>). Taken together with previous studies, our studies support a model in which DNA unwinding during DNA replication initiation occurs in at least three stages: 1) initial limited DNA melting upon CMG formation, 2) further DNA unwinding that results in ssDNA-strand extrusion that requires double-hexamer interactions and Mcm10, and 3) extensive DNA unwinding that is mediated single CMG complexes translocating on ssDNA at replication forks.</p><p>We also considered whether the DNA unwinding defects observed for the DoHM mutant were due to Mcm10-binding or Mcm2-7-ATPase defects; however, other data argue against these explanations. First, Mcm2-7 ATPase activity is required for DNA unwinding beyond that detectable upon CMG formation, making an Mcm2-7 ATPase defect a plausible explanation for the defect observed. We note, however, that the DoHM mutant is functional for helicase loading, which also requires Mcm2-7 ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Coster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kang et al., 2014</xref>) making an ATPase defect unlikely. Second, although Mcm10 also is required for the transition from initial to more extensive unwinding, multiple findings argue against the DoHM mutant having a defect in Mcm10 binding. Although the N-terminal domain of Mcm4 has been observed to interact with Mcm10 in the absence of the rest of Mcm2-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Quan et al., 2015</xref>), in the context of the full complex, Mcm10’s interactions with Mcm2 and Mcm6 are more important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Douglas and Diffley, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lõoke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mayle et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, crosslinking studies of the CMG-Mcm10 structure showed only three Mcm10 crosslinking sites with Mcm4, all of which are distant from the DoHM mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mayle et al., 2019</xref>). Most importantly, we found that the DoHM mutant maintains the ability to form high-salt-resistant interactions with Mcm10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The identification of mutations that prevent double-hexamer formation provides an important tool to further explore the role of this complex in replication initiation. Although we have provided a first look of the role of the double hexamer in initiation, there is more to be understood about how this intermediate facilitates protein associations and origin unwinding. In addition, although our studies provide strong evidence that the loading of the second Mcm2-7 is coordinated with formation of the double hexamer, the mechanism of this coordination is an important area for future investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Mcm2-7</td><td>Bell Lab</td><td>UM174</td><td>1:10,000 (rabbit polyclonal)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Cdc45</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lõoke et al., 2017</xref></td><td>HM7135</td><td>1:2000 (rabbit polyclonal)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-GINS</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lõoke et al., 2017</xref></td><td>HM7128</td><td>1:2000 (rabbit polyclonal)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Mcm10</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lõoke et al., 2017</xref></td><td>HM7602</td><td>1:2000 (rabbit polyclonal)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-cMyc agarose</td><td>Sigma</td><td>Sigma: A7470</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-V5 agarose</td><td>Sigma</td><td>Sigma: A7345</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>DY549-P1-maleimide</td><td>Dyomics</td><td>Dyomics: 549P1-03</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>DY649-P1-maleimide</td><td>Dyomics</td><td>Dyomics: 649P1-03</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>SYBR Gold nucleic acid stain</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Invitrogen: S11494</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>illustra MicroSpin G-50 columns</td><td>GE Healthcare</td><td>GE Healthcare: 27533001</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>MCM2</italic></td><td><italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database</td><td>SGD: S000000119</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>MCM3</italic></td><td><italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database</td><td>SGD: S000000758</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>MCM4</italic></td><td><italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database</td><td>SGD: S000006223</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>MCM5</italic></td><td><italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database</td><td>SGD: S000004264</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>MCM6</italic></td><td><italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database</td><td>SGD: S000003169</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>MCM7</italic></td><td><italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database</td><td>SGD: S000000406</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>TransFluoSpheres Streptavidin-Labeled Microspheres</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>Thermo Fisher: T10711</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Amersham Hybond-XL</td><td>GE Healthcare</td><td>GE Healthcare: RPN303S</td><td>Membrane for imaging replication assay</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>DNase I</td><td>Worthington</td><td>Worthington: LS006333</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Proteinase K</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>Thermo Fisher: AM2548</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Nb.BsrDI</td><td>New England Biolabs</td><td>New England Biolabs: R0648S</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Peptide for coupling to dyes for Sortase labeling</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ticau et al., 2015</xref></td><td/><td>NH2-CHHHHHHHHHHLPETG</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>oligo for 1.3 kb template</td><td>IDT</td><td/><td>5'-Biotin-GATCGGTGCGGGCCTCTTCGC-3'</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>oligo for 1.3 kb unlabeled template</td><td>IDT</td><td/><td>5'-GGAAAGCGGGCAGTGAGCGC-3'</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>oligo for 1.3 kb fluorescently-labeled template</td><td>IDT</td><td/><td>5'-Alexa488-GGAAAGCGGGCAGTGAGCGC-3'</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Matlab</td><td>Mathworks</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein purifications</title><p>Wild-type Mcm2–7/Cdt1 and ORC complexes were purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kang et al., 2014</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Michael R Botchan as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alessandro Costa (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The summary of the complied reviews are below.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Cells prepare for replication initiation in G1, when they assemble a pre-replication complex (pre-RC) at each origin of replication. The pre-RC is assembled by ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1 and consists of two head-to-head copies of the Mcm2-7 ATPase. Bell and colleagues identify a short, highly conserved Double Hexamer Motif (DoHM) in Mcm4 that is required for the formation of an Mcm2-7 double hexamer at origins of replication. In its absence, stable double hexamers fail to form (as measured by gel filtration after release of proteins from origin DNA). Based on single molecule analysis, the mutant MCM complexes form a pseudo double hexamer on DNA (less tightly interacting based in lower FRET signal) at almost normal rates, but these rapidly dissociate into monomers that remain on DNA but appear rarely transition back to the double hexamer state. Strikingly, the DoHM mutant complex is able to recruit Cdc45, GINS, and Mcm10 yet it is inactive for DNA unwinding, replication, and it does not support cell viability. The Mcm4 (DoHM), is thus dispensable for stable MCM loading onto DNA but essential for double hexamer formation. In particular, single-molecule analysis reveals that the MCM can form an initial interaction between two hexamers, but the complex falls apart. Intriguingly, a short time window is identified for double hexamer formation once the second MCM associates with the origin, suggesting that there is a special interaction between the first and second ring during the recruitment of the second hexamer, which allows head-to-head double hexamer engagement. Intriguingly, double hexamer formation is dispensable for the recruitment of Cdc45, GINS and Mcm10, but essential for DNA unwinding.</p><p>The other aspect of the paper concerns the models over how pre-RC assembly unfolds. Bell and colleagues previously used single molecule imaging to monitor pre-RC assembly and concluded that this process involves a single ORC complex bound to DNA that promotes two rounds of MCM loading without dissociating from DNA (Ticau et al., 2015). This model implies that the same ORC complex loads successive MCMs in opposite orientations (to achieve formation of a head-to-head MCM double hexamer). Subsequently, Coster and Diffley (2017) proposed an alternative model in which a second ORC complex binds to a cryptic ORC binding site in an opposite orientation relative to the first ORC and thereby recruit a second Mcm2-7 complex in the appropriate orientation, whereupon the two MCM complexes slide towards each other, forming the double hexamer. The authors of this paper interpret their data in terms of the Bell model. However, all the arguments are indirect. To better distinguish between the models, they might perform experiments that are explicitly designed for this purpose. For example, the single molecule analysis should be repeated on a model ARS DNA sequence designed to eliminate all possible cryptic ORC binding sites. If the kinetics of MCM loading is unaltered, this would provide powerful evidence against the Diffley model. As it stands, one cannot rule out the possibility that ORC dissociates and reassociates with a cryptic ORC site without leaving the diffraction limited spot. After discussions the readers concluded that this particular experiment was not required, but rather a more explicit and full discussion of the possibilities might be included in the Discussion section.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A very interesting aspect of the paper is discriminating between CMG formation and DNA unwinding. In a recent study, Diffley and colleagues have shown that stable CMG formation leads to DNA untwisting prior to replication-fork establishment. Can the authors comment on any change in DNA topology that occurs upon CMG formation prior to Mcm10 recruitment, using wild type vs. mutant Mcm4? One does realize that this experiment is technically challenging, however, it is feasible within the time possible for a revision. One of the reviewers puts the point this way:</p><p>“This paper is important because it reports the first discrete MCM mutant that disrupts double hexamer formation and therefore provides insight into the function of this structure. However, the analysis is incomplete. Given that the DoHM mutant is able to recruit Cdc45, GINS, and Mcm10, it is very surprising that it is inactive for DNA unwinding. Why is this so? To address this important gap in the data, the authors should use the higher resolution origin unwinding assay (Figure 2 in Douglas et al., 2018) to determine whether the Cdc45/GINS-induced and Mcm10-induced topological changes take place within this mutant. If one of these steps is blocked, the paper will represent a very impactful message about the role of double hexamer formation in replication initiation.”</p><p>2) Single-molecule data suggests that the second MCM hexamer is loaded and shows a long-lived association with DNA that cannot be distinguished from the first hexamer. The biochemical data however consistently show that modifying the DoHM in Mcm4 reduces MCM loading to 50%. Do the authors observe that second MCM recruitment leads to failure to form a long-lived DNA association more frequently in the mutant than in wild type? From the single-molecule data shown, there seems to be no difference in MCM loading, but only a difference in hexamer-hexamer association that leads to double hexamer formation. This does not seem to explain the 50% decrease in helicase loading. It would be good to clarify this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45538.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A very interesting aspect of the paper is discriminating between CMG formation and DNA unwinding.

We have performed the suggested experiment and have obtained a very interesting result. We find that the DoHM mutant can perform initial DNA melting but cannot (as before) perform more extensive DNA unwinding necessary for replication. This result clearly demonstrates that the associations of Cdc45 and GINS with the DoHM mutant are productive and more precisely defines the step during replication initiation that requires the Mcm2-7 double hexamer interactions as the transition between initial DNA melting and extensive origin DNA unwinding. In addition, by demonstrating that single CMG complexes can perform this initial DNA melting, these findings strongly suggest that the mechanism of initial DNA melting is likely to be mediated by interactions of Mcm2-7 with the encircled DNA but that the initiation of extensive unwinding is likely to require coordinated function of two Mcm2-7 complexes. Interestingly, because it has been proposed that the double-hexamer separates upon CMG formation, this finding suggests that either there is a double hexamer-dependent event that is required for extensive unwinding that occurs prior to CMG formation, or that there are important double-hexamer interactions that occur after initial separation. The latter hypothesis is consistent with recent studies from the O’Donnell lab suggesting that two CMG complexes come together to drive DNA unwinding. We have updated the paper throughout (Abstract, Results section and Discussion section) to emphasize this important finding.</p><p>To incorporate these findings we have added data to Figure 7E, added Figure 7—figure supplement 1, revised the Results section and the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Single-molecule data suggests that the second MCM hexamer is loaded and shows a long-lived association with DNA that cannot be distinguished from the first hexamer.

Because the bulk assays are endpoint assays, we believe that the 50% decrease is due to the different stability of single-hexamers versus double-hexamers on the DNA. Although it is possible that a difference caused by the DoHM mutant beyond the defect in double-hexamer formation contributes to this reduction, we note that we see very similar DNA dwell times for two wild-type Mcm2-7 complexes that do not form a double hexamer (see Figure 6C vs. 6D, blue lines). We have added a paragraph in the Results section and the Discussion section addressing this point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
