Some studies link beta oscillations to changes in underlying neural activity, but the specific behavioral manifestations of these reported changes remain elusive. To investigate how changes in population neural activity, beta oscillations, and behavior are linked, we recorded multi-scale neural activity from motor cortex while three macaques performed a novel neurofeedback task. Subjects volitionally brought their beta oscillatory power to an instructed state and subsequently executed an arm reach. Reaches preceded by a reduction in beta power exhibited significantly faster movement onset times than reaches preceded by an increase in beta power. Further, population neural activity was found to shift farther from a movement onset state during beta oscillations that were neurofeedback-induced or naturally occurring during reaching tasks. This finding establishes a population neural basis for slowed movement onset following periods of beta oscillatory activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24573.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24573.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24573.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Behaviors from reading to reaching for objects require large numbers of neurons to fire at the same time. Electrodes on the surface of the scalp, or within the brain itself, can detect this coordinated activity in the form of brain waves, or oscillations. Different regions of the brain produce oscillations with different frequencies. Areas that control movement, known collectively as the motor system, generate oscillations with a frequency of 25 to 40 cycles per second, called beta oscillations. These emerge when individuals are paying attention, processing cues to decide where to move, or waiting to move.</p><p>Patients with Parkinson’s disease – who suffer from tremors, slowed movements, and have trouble initiating movements – show increased beta oscillations when their symptoms are worst compared to when their symptoms are well controlled. Understanding how beta oscillations affect behavior might therefore reveal how exaggerated beta oscillations contribute to symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. However, existing tools for activating or silencing neurons do not allow us to manipulate large groups of neurons with fine enough control to study oscillations precisely.</p><p>Khanna and Carmena have now solved this problem by training rhesus macaque monkeys to mentally control their own brain waves. The monkeys, which had electrodes implanted in their brains, learned to increase or decrease their beta oscillations on demand. After achieving the correct level of beta oscillations, the monkeys had to reach towards a target with their arm in order to obtain a reward. Khanna and Carmena found that the monkeys took longer to initiate arm reaches when they had higher levels of beta oscillations. Further, when the monkeys increased their beta oscillations, populations of neurons exhibited patterns of activity that looked very different to the patterns occurring at the start of movement. This suggests that when neurons generate beta oscillations, the motor system is pausing at the expense of being ready to quickly start moving.</p><p>This finding meshes well with previous evidence since it is sensible to pause the motor system when paying close attention to a task, deciding where to move, and while waiting. Too much pausing may slow down movements and it may become difficult to initiate them, potentially explaining the link between worsened symptoms and higher beta oscillations seen in Parkinson’s disease. Overall, the findings of Khanna and Carmena indicate that beta oscillations reflect brain states in which individuals are pausing, and provide a new tool for studying how oscillations relate to behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24573.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24573.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neuroscience</kwd><kwd>movement</kwd><kwd>beta oscillation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRFP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Khanna</surname><given-names>Preeya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006502</institution-id><institution>Defense Sciences Office, DARPA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W911NF-14- 2-0043</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carmena</surname><given-names>Jose M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Using a sequential neurofeedback-arm reaching task, a new link is established among population neural activity patterns, generation of beta oscillations, and motor behavior changes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Beta band oscillations (typically defined as 13–30 Hz) have been noted to reliably emerge during specific motor actions such as isometric contraction and precision reaching, after movement-related cues, and prior to instructed reaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Canolty et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Engel and Fries, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leventhal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saleh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sanes and Donoghue, 1993</xref>). These findings have prompted hypotheses about what underlying state beta oscillations may be signaling. The most prominent of these hypotheses suggest beta oscillations indicate ongoing sensorimotor integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker, 2007</xref>), coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rubino et al., 2006</xref>), idling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Engel and Fries, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gilbertson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pfurtscheller et al., 1996</xref>), motor preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Donoghue et al., 1998</xref>), or attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fetz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saleh et al., 2010</xref>). These distinct hypotheses are generated by correlating beta power with phases of different motor tasks. Explaining when beta oscillations emerge and how they reflect underlying neural population computations is challenging given their presence during a multitude of behaviors.</p><p>Electrical stimulation is one approach used to experimentally induce oscillations. Slowly oscillating cortical macrostimulation (up to 1.7 Hz) has been shown to entrain single unit neural activity in anesthetized rodents, although this entrainment was overpowered by endogenous rhythms in an awake situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ozen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Venkatraman and Carmena, 2009</xref>). Non-invasive stimulation via transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used to induce changes in cortical oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fröhlich, 2014</xref>), but the frequency of the induced oscillations was not solely dependent on the stimulation frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marshall et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wach et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the reported changes in motor behavior from stimulation at beta frequencies are inconsistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Davis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feurra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pogosyan et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>This study uses neurofeedback to manipulate beta oscillations in subjects' motor cortices with the aim of studying effects on arm reaching. While neurofeedback was pioneered by rewarding changes in firing rates of single motor cortical cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fetz, 1969</xref>), learning to control cortical local field potential (LFP) features has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fetz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moxon and Foffani, 2015</xref>) and subsequently demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Engelhard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">So et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, three macaque monkeys with chronic microwire electrode arrays implanted in their motor cortices were trained in a sequential neurofeedback and arm-reaching task. Sequential neurofeedback-behavior task designs have been used previously with a variety of neural recording modalities, neural signal features, and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gevensleben et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McFarland et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schafer and Moore, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Subramanian et al., 2011</xref>). In this study, a neurofeedback-reaching (NR) task was used in concert with simultaneous, multi-scale, high-count neural recordings to first study how the presence of beta oscillations influences arm-reaching behavior, and second, how underlying neuronal population patterns shift when beta oscillations are generated. It has been suggested that the presence of beta oscillations either locally or distally could influence neuronal computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fries, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reimer and Hatsopoulos, 2010</xref>), as slowly oscillating ephaptic fields have been shown to entrain spiking behavior <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fröhlich and McCormick, 2010</xref>). However, little evidence exists showing that beta oscillations in the local field potential influence spiking activity through ephaptic mechanisms. Thus, in this study we interpret beta oscillations as a statistic of synchronization of the underlying neural signals, not as a signal that can independently and causally influence neural spiking via ephaptic effects. We aim to investigate how the underlying neural signals change their encoding during epochs when beta oscillations are observed and do not make claims about the causality of beta oscillations on spiking activity.</p><p>There are many proposed behavioral correlates of beta oscillations, but to link oscillations to a behavior rigorously it is necessary to understand how oscillations reflect the underlying neural activity that ultimately drives the behavior. Prior studies investigating neural activity changes during beta oscillations used acute, single-electrode recording preparations and showed that single cells are synchronized to ongoing oscillations but that the strength of this synchronization is unrelated to the involvement of the neuron during the motor task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Murthy and Fetz, 1996a</xref>). These studies also show individual cells do not change their mean spike firing rate but do exhibit a reduction in spiking variability during oscillations compared to the variability exhibited before the oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murthy and Fetz, 1996b</xref>). How might these changes in individual units relate to attention, motor preparation, or idling? Modeling groups have aimed to bridge this gap by showing how beta oscillations could be a signal generated by cells conveying top-down information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fries, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2013</xref>), could reflect a pattern of firing activating specific cell assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Canolty et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kopell et al., 2011</xref>), or could reflect specific spatiotemporal recruitment of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Best et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rubino et al., 2006</xref>). However, experimental evidence of spiking patterns that accomplish the proposed functions while generating beta oscillationsis lacking. In contrast, if one were to omit the role that beta oscillations may play in motor behavior, there is substantial work linking spiking patterns to specific aspects of motor behavior such as movement onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kaufman et al., 2014</xref>), reaction time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afshar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Churchland and Shenoy, 2007</xref>), movement angle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Georgopoulos et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lillicrap and Scott, 2013</xref>), and movement speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moran and Schwartz, 1999</xref>), to list just a few.</p><p>Here, we report both changes in motor behavior following performance of neurofeedback during a sequential neurofeedback-reaching task, and a neural population shift that mirrors the observed change in motor behavior. Notably, this shift in neural population was also seen in naturally occurring beta oscillations during reaching tasks, suggesting that beta oscillations reflect a common signature of spiking patterns even in different task contexts. This study ties together existing works on behavioral correlates of beta oscillations with hypotheses of how the motor cortex encodes movement onset through the lens of population-level neural activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Subjects perform a neurofeedback-reaching task above chance level</title><p>To explore how beta oscillations reflect changes in spiking activity and movement parameters, we trained three macaque monkeys to perform a typical center-out arm-reaching task (CO task, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), and a novel sequential beta neurofeedback arm-reaching task (NR task, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Prior to training subjects to perform the NR task, beta frequency band limits used in the neurofeedback portion of the NR task were computed from the CO task. A movement onset-aligned trial-averaged spectrogram from the intracortical recordings in contralateral motor and premotor cortex (e.g. Monkey C in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) showed that the clearest movement-related desynchronization was in the 25–40 Hz band for all monkeys, consistent with early reports of beta oscillations in the macaque motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Murthy and Fetz, 1992</xref>).

Trials were initiated by moving the right arm (co-located with a cursor on a screen) such that the cursor fell within a central target. Holding in the center target initiated the neurofeedback epoch where a beta neurofeedback cursor and one of four possible beta neurofeedback targets appeared on the screen (all blue text in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> falls in the neurofeedback epoch). Subjects modulated endogenous motor cortical local field potential signals to move the vertical position of the beta cursor. Specifically, the cursor was controlled by a spectral estimate of beta band power normalized by a spectral estimate of broadband (1–100 Hz) power (see Materials and methods – Calculation of beta neurofeedback cursor). Indeed, modulation of non-beta frequency bands can influence the position of the beta cursor through the normalization factor, a point discussed in detail later in the experimental findings. When the beta cursor fell in the beta target, subjects were required to hold within the beta target for 450 ms. After successful completion, both the beta cursor and beta target disappeared, cueing that the reaching epoch had begun (all green text in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> falls in the reaching epoch). Subjects then executed a right-arm reach from the central target to a peripheral target to receive a liquid reward.</p><p>When monkeys were first exposed to the task, their time to successfully complete the neurofeedback epoch improved over days. After ~1 week of training per subject, performance plateaued and the beta power to cursor mapping was fixed (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), and subjects completed 3–10 days of executing several 10–40 min sessions of the NR task. Only data from the days with the fixed mapping are presented. During NR task performance from these days, subjects exhibited above chance performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, see Materials and methods - Chance level performance of beta neurofeedback epoch). Monkeys achieved average success rates of 60% and performed on average ~4 successful trials per minute.

Instead of using PSD estimators over a window (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–f</xref>), a time-domain method was used to extract time segments with bursts of beta oscillations. Briefly, instantaneous beta amplitude was measured by bandpass filtering the raw LFP with a fifth order Butterworth filter to isolate 25–40 Hz components, and taking the Hilbert transform. If the amplitude exceeded the 60th percentile of beta amplitude (computed each day) for a period of at least 125 ms (3–5 cycles of beta oscillations), the time points within that period were labeled as ‘on-beta’. The percentage of time points labeled as on-beta was computed in the same time window as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d–f</xref> for all trials. All subjects exhibit increasing percentages of on-beta time points for the low to high beta targets. The mean (s.e.m) of percent of time points labeled as on-beta for low, mid-low, mid-high, high beta targets, respectively, in Monkey S is 9.78 (0.783), 11.2 (0.778), 17.6 (0.913), 39.4 (1.35), in Monkey C is 8.65 (0.523), 17.6 (0.708), 35.9 (0.840), 37.8 (0.868), and in Monkey G is 18.3 (1.04), 16.6 (0.994), 22.5 (1.22), 33.4 (1.43).</p><p>These three metrics (normalized beta power in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>, non-normalized PSDs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d–f</xref>, and percentage of time labeled as on-beta) demonstrate that the neurofeedback epoch served to increase and decrease beta oscillatory power prior to the arm-reaching epoch.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Reduced beta power precedes faster movement onset times</title><p>In the NR task, movement onset times, movement onset speed, peak reach speed, and movement onset acceleration were calculated for the reaching epoch of each successfully completed trial from days with a fixed beta-to-cursor transform.

The resulting movement onset times are plotted by re-labeled group, frequency band, and monkey in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d–f</xref>. Increasing 10-25 Hz power correlates with increasing MOT (two-tailed Cuzick’s test, Monkey S 10–25 Hz: z = −0.6660, p=0.5054, n = 1183, Monkey C 10–25 Hz: z = 5.717, p=1.082e-08, n = 2168, Monkey G 10–25 Hz: z = 5.477, p=4.33e-08, n = 1028, Combined across monkeys 10–25 Hz: z = 2.9728, p=2.951e-03, n = 4379). The consistent ordering in the 10–25 Hz band (increased power correlated with increased MOT) is likely caused by the natural beta band for each animal extending into frequencies below 25 Hz. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d–f</xref> shows that Monkey C and Monkey G exhibit power trends in frequencies lower than 25 Hz that match those in the 25–40 Hz range.

Indeed, beta power and gamma power have been shown to be anti-correlated in motor-related regions during tasks involving movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Courtemanche et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schoffelen et al., 2005</xref>), in prefrontal cortex during working memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lundqvist et al., 2016</xref>), and in parkinsonian subjects at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fogelson et al., 2005</xref>). Increased gamma power could be a physiological pattern that emerges with reduced beta power. It is unlikely that subjects are relying on changes in gamma power, which would change the denominator term in the beta cursor computation, to drive their neurofeedback strategy as gamma power constitutes less than 3% of the total broadband estimate (Table 4).</p><p>The correlation between increased gamma power and reduced MOT was further investigated using model selection analysis. MOTs were linearly estimated using normalized gamma power as a predictor (Model 2, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), or normalized beta power as a predictor (Model 1, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), or both normalized gamma power and normalized beta power as predictors (Model 4, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>) from the last 0.8 s of the neurofeedback epoch. The normalized beta power model explained more MOT variance than the normalized gamma power model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), and the F-test demonstrated that adding normalized beta power as a predictor in a model with normalized gamma power resulted in significant improvement (Model 2 vs. Model 4, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).

In the experimental manipulation, Monkey G performed a NR task variant where beta power continued to move the beta cursor up and down the Y axis, but now instead of having a fixed X axis position, 1–10 Hz power controlled the cursor on the X axis. The targets were in the same positions as in the standard NR task, but now Monkey G had to ensure that his 1–10 Hz power was neither too low nor too high, or else the horizontal position of the cursor would not fall within the fixed width of the beta target.

For the lowest (green) target in the beta task variant, Monkey G managed to increase the power of his beta frequencies to similar levels as the highest beta target (red) but as he concomitantly increased the power of other frequencies, the denominator term in the normalized beta metric increased more, making the cursor move downwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>). To ensure that the PSD plot reflected the presence of beta oscillations, we also calculated the percent of on-beta time points during the neurofeedback epoch of the NR task variant using the previously explained time-domain method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5j</xref>). This metric reflects the same ordering found in the PSD; the lowest beta target had a comparable percentage of on-beta timepoints to the highest beta target.</p><p>This task variant effectively decoupled beta and 1–10 Hz power. In the original task, beta and 1–10 Hz power were inversely correlated (low beta power occurred with high 1–10 Hz power and vice versa) but in this modified task, high 1–10 Hz power and high beta power co-occurred during the low, green target and low 1–10 Hz power and high beta power co-occurred during the high, red target. We analyzed whether movement onset times followed the beta power or the 1–10 Hz power ordering. The movement onset times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>, right) for the green target rose to match the movement onset times of the red target, indicating that the movement onset times followed beta power ordering, not 1–10 Hz power ordering (one-tailed Cuzick’s test for significant ordering of beta targets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>, right assesses increasing movement onset times per the group order 2, 3, 4, 1 instead of group order of 1, 2, 3, 4 used in all other Cuzick’s tests. Monkey G: z = 7.1359, p=4.807e-13, n = 1164). If the 1–10 Hz power target ordering is used, then MOTs show no significant trend (one-tailed Cuzick’s test for MOTs increase with decreasing 1–10 Hz power, group order of 1, 2, 3, 4, Monkey G: z = −2.5713, p=0.9949, n = 1164). Although <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d–f</xref> shows a strong co-modulation of 1–10 Hz frequencies with beta frequencies, the 1–10 Hz band does not explain the observed ordering of movement onset times. In addition to the above experimental manipulation, we also assessed the contribution of the 1–10 Hz band in explaining MOT variance. MOTs were linearly estimated using the normalized 1–10 Hz power as a predictor (Model 4, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), normalized beta power as a predictor (Model 2, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), or both normalized 1–10 Hz power and normalized beta power as predictors (Model 5, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). The normalized beta power model explained more MOT variance than the normalized 1–10 Hz power model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), and the F-test demonstrated that adding normalized beta power as a predictor in a model with normalized 1–10 Hz power resulted in significant improvement (Model 4 vs. Model 5, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Thus, while 1–10 Hz power is negatively correlated with MOT, beta power explains more MOT variance than 1–10 Hz power, and addition of beta power to a model predicting MOT with 1–10 Hz power significantly improves prediction.</p><p>Finally, we investigated which sub-frequency bands within the 1–10 Hz band were most closely correlated with MOT. We divided the low frequencies into the delta band (1–3 Hz), theta band (4–7 Hz), and alpha band (8–12 Hz). By performing the same analysis as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d–f</xref> with the narrower bands, we found that delta and theta bands, but not the alpha band, strongly correlate with MOT in all three animals (Monkey S: 1–3 Hz: z = −3.276, p=1.052e-03, n = 1183, 4–7 Hz: z = −3.245, p=1.174e-03, n = 1183, 8–12 Hz: z = −1.309, p=0.1907, n = 1183, Monkey C: 1–3 Hz: z = −6.986, p=2.821e-12, n = 2168, 4–7 Hz: z = −6.133, p=8.602e-10, n = 2168, 8–12 Hz: z = −1.779, p=0.0753, n = 2168, Monkey G, 1–3 Hz: z = −8.201, p=2.379e-16, n = 1028, 4–7 Hz: z = −6.166, p=7.024e-10, n = 1028, 8–12 Hz: z = 0.0669, p=0.9467, n = 1028, Combined over monkeys: 1–3 Hz: −5.006, p=5.55e-07, n = 4379, 4–7 Hz: z = −4.355, p=1.33e-05, n = 4379, 8–12 Hz: z = −0.9782, p=0.328, n = 4379).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Comparing single- and multi-unit responses to beta oscillations during the CO and NR tasks</title><p>If the neurofeedback-induced beta oscillations are qualitatively the same as naturally occurring beta oscillations during reaching tasks, it might be unsurprising that increasing beta power biases subjects toward slower movement onset based on previous studies.

Only days when the CO task was performed were used for subsequent analysis (Monkey G: 6 days, Monkey C: 4 days). Simultaneous single-unit and multi-unit activity were recorded throughout Monkey G’s task sessions, and channel level activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chestek et al., 2011</xref>) were recorded throughout Monkey C’s task sessions. Both single-unit and multi-unit activity were manually sorted, whereas channel level activity used the auto-thresholding function in Omniplex software (see Materials and methods -- Surgery, electrophysiology, and experimental setup). In subsequent analyses, time bins (100 ms or 25 ms depending on analysis) will be labeled as on-beta or off-beta referring to whether they fall within or outside a beta oscillation (same definition used previously--periods in which beta amplitude is above the 60th percentile for at least 125 ms). Bins will also be referred to as slow or fast referring to whether the mean hand speed within the bin is below or above 3.5 cm/sec. The ‘slow’ versus ‘fast’ bin distinction was made to separate bins before movement onset from those after movement onset (approximate movement onset time occurred when hand velocity crossed 3.5 cm/sec). The point in the trial corresponding to the cue for movement onset is referred to as the go cue in both tasks (corresponding to the end of neurofeedback epoch in the NR task).</p><p>We assessed whether units fire at similar rates during CO task beta oscillations and NR task beta oscillations. Go cue aligned trials were aggregated for each task, with each trial lasting 2.5 s (1.5 s before go cue through 1.0 s after go cue). Unit activity was binned into 100 ms bins, yielding 25 bins per trial. For every trial, bins that were labeled as slow and on-beta were selected. The distribution of spike counts for these slow, on-beta bins from the NR task was compared with the slow, on-beta bins from the CO task. Counts from fast bins were not used in the analysis because there were very few fast bins that were also on-beta.</p><p>Example mean firing rates of four consecutive on-beta time bins in a row, aligned to onset of on-beta, are shown for two example single unit recordings (unit 101a and unit 1a) from Monkey G in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, where red is the mean firing rate for NR slow, on-beta bins, and blue is the mean firing rate for CO slow, on-beta bins. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref> shows the fraction of units exhibiting significantly different mean firing rates between the slow, on-beta bins from the two tasks on each day (Mann–Whitney test, p&lt;0.05, number of units recorded per day displayed above bar).

We used methods adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Canolty et al. (2012)</xref> to fit a beta amplitude-to-spike rate mapping for the NR and CO tasks to determine whether the units’ beta amplitude-to-spike rate correlations are consistent across tasks (see Materials and methods – Beta amplitude-to-spike rate mapping). Briefly, the logarithm of instantaneous beta amplitude was calculated for the entire 2.5 s trial and then correlated against the firing rate of each cell. Three example units are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c–e</xref>, where the red and blue traces are the relationship between cell firing and beta amplitude for the NR and the CO tasks, respectively. Some units exhibit similar mean firing rates but different beta amplitude-to-spike rate slopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), some exhibit different mean firing rates but similar beta amplitude-to-spike rate slopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>), and some exhibit different mean firing rates and different beta amplitude-to-spike rate slopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>).</p><p>To assess whether units exhibit similar beta amplitude-to-spike rate slopes across the tasks, we compared within-task and across-task slope estimates. First, two non-overlapping subsets of the CO (CO<sub>1,</sub> CO<sub>2</sub>) and NR (NR<sub>1,</sub> NR<sub>2</sub>) tasks were used to estimate separate beta amplitude-to-spike rate slopes per unit (CO<sub>1, slope,</sub> CO<sub>2, slope</sub> and NR<sub>1, slope,</sub> NR<sub>2, slope</sub>). Note that slightly overlapping CO sets were used for Monkey C because of limited CO data (see Materials and methods: Beta amplitude-to-spike rate mapping). Then, the two slope estimates for each task were correlated to assess within-task slope estimate stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>: CO<sub>1, slope</sub> vs. CO<sub>2, slope</sub> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>: NR<sub>1, slope,</sub> vs. NR<sub>2, slope</sub>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f–g</xref>, each plotted marker corresponds to a unit and its color corresponds to the day on which it was recorded (Monkey G: main plot, Monkey C: inset, note same colormap as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). The printed correlation coefficients are the mean correlation coefficient across days and describe how well linear regression captures the correlation between slope estimates from subset 1 vs. slope estimates from subset 2. For both tasks, correlation coefficients exceed 0.8. These high correlation coefficients suggest a stable within-task beta-to-rate mapping. Across task slope estimates are visually compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref> (CO<sub>all data</sub> vs NR<sub>all data</sub>). In contrast to the stable within-task slope estimates, across task slope estimates are less correlated across units. To assess whether the within-task and across-tasks slope differences are significant, a paired Student’s t-test was performed to assess the differences between within-task and across-tasks on CO<sub>1 </sub>and CO<sub>2</sub> slopes, NF<sub>1 </sub>and NF<sub>2</sub> slopes, and CO<sub>2</sub> and NF<sub>1</sub> slopes, where units from each day were treated as independent observations (Monkey G: CO<sub>1</sub> vs. CO<sub>2</sub>, t = 1.275, p=0.2032, n = 355 units, NF<sub>1</sub> vs. NF<sub>2, </sub>t = 0.0169, p=0.9866, n = 355 units, CO<sub>2</sub> vs. NF<sub>1, </sub>t = 2.3403, p=0.0198, n = 355, Monkey C: CO<sub>1</sub> vs. CO<sub>2</sub>, t = −1.5075, p=0.1323, n = 513 units, NF<sub>1</sub> vs. NF<sub>2, </sub>t = −1.309, p=0.1910, n = 513 units, CO<sub>2</sub> vs. NF<sub>1, </sub>t = 9.880, p=3.473e-21, n = 513, Combined across monkeys: CO<sub>1</sub> vs. CO<sub>2</sub>, t = 0.6258, p=0.5316, n = 868 units, NF<sub>1</sub> vs. NF<sub>2, </sub>t = −0.5547, p=0.5793, n = 868 units, CO<sub>2</sub> vs. NF<sub>1, </sub>t = 5.1782, p=2.786e-07, n = 868 units). The subset comparison of CO<sub>2</sub> vs. NF<sub>1</sub> was randomly chosen for reporting -- CO<sub>2</sub>-NF<sub>2,</sub> CO<sub>1</sub>-NF<sub>1,</sub> and CO<sub>1</sub>-NF<sub>2</sub> showed similar differences in CO vs. NF slopes.</p><p>Thus, the mean firing rates of units during slow, on-beta timepoints and the continuous beta amplitude-to-spike rate mappings across tasks are different for many units. Given that the behavioral effect from neurofeedback-induced beta oscillations matches well with hypotheses claiming a movement-slowing role of beta oscillations during natural movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gilbertson et al., 2005</xref>), it was surprising that individual unit responses during beta activity were so different across tasks.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Beta oscillations during the NR task and CO task reflect a shift in neural population activity away from a movement onset state</title><p>While many individual units exhibit different spiking patterns during beta oscillations in the CO and NR tasks, population-level activity across the two tasks could still exhibit consistent patterns. Specifically, as increased beta oscillations during the NR task are correlated with slower MOT times, beta oscillations may reflect a shift in neural population patterns in a way that affects movement onset. To assess how similar or different CO and NR population patterns are with respect to movement onset, and how the presence of beta oscillations affects these patterns, we trained a classifier on a single day's CO population spiking activity to discriminate bins occurring pre and post movement onset (PreMO, PostMO). We then tested the classifier's performance on the same day's NR population spiking activity to assess first whether the same CO-trained classifier successfully distinguished PreMO and PostMO in the NR task, and second how the presence of beta oscillations influenced the separation of the two labeled classes.</p><p>The approach used to discriminate PreMO and PostMO neural population activity was to train a logistic regression classifier on the first two-thirds of the CO spike counts. CO spiking activity was binned in 25 ms, each unit was z-scored according to its mean and standard deviation during the CO task, and each 25 ms bin was labeled PreMO or PostMO. A logistic regression classifier was trained on the binned spike counts with an additional two bins of history (number of spike features per observation equal to three times the number of neurons, and each three-bin observation is referred to as a ‘chunk’). The trained classifier yields the probability of each chunk being PreMO and PostMO. By setting a threshold on these probabilities we can assign predicted PreMO or PostMO labels. For example, if the threshold is 0.5 and the probability of an observation being PostMO is greater than 0.5, the chunk would be assigned as PostMO. For Monkeys G and C, the best classifier performance was obtained with thresholds equal to 0.5 and 0.315, respectively, and signed distances to this movement onset threshold (MO threshold) were computed to estimate how far away a chunk’s neural state was from the state of movement onset (see Materials and methods -- Classification of PreMO and PostMO in NR and CO tasks). We found that <italic>actual</italic> PreMO and PostMO chunks exhibited significantly different distances to MO threshold for the held-out third of data from the CO task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, Blue: CO task, two-tailed Student’s t-test on mean within-day predicted probabilities for held-out CO PreMO and PostMO, Monkey G: n = 6, T = −20.899, p=4.65e-06, Monkey C (inset): n = 4, T-4.2711, p=0.0236, Combined across monkeys: n = 10, T = −4.1097, p=2.638e-03). Thus, population spike count chunks reliably encode before and after movement onset in the CO task. Note that Monkey G exhibited about an order of magnitude more reliable separation between PreMO and PostMO than Monkey C (y axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>), and this is likely because of the lower neural signal quality in Monkey C (implanted ~3 years prior to study without resolvable single or multi-units) than Monkey G (implanted only ~1 year prior to study, with resolvable single and multi-units).<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24573.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Population activity shifts away from MO threshold during on-beta timepoints in both the CO and NR tasks.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Distance to MO threshold for the CO (blue) and NR (red) tasks for PreMO and PostMO timepoints from Monkey G and Monkey C (inset).

Note that in the NR task, chunks are labeled as ‘PreMO’ during the neurofeedback epoch of the NR task and before movement onset during the reaching epoch of the NR task, and labeled as ‘PostMO’ after movement onset during the reaching epoch. Given the differences in individual unit firing patterns across the CO and NR tasks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), it is possible that the neural population activity also varies drastically across tasks and that the CO-trained classifier may not perform well when given NR population activity. Instead, we confirm that the same CO-trained classifier does yield significantly different distances to MO threshold for PreMO and PostMO chunks in the NR task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, Red: NR task, paired two-tailed Student’s t-test on mean within-day probabilities for CO PreMO and PostMO chunks, Monkey G: n = 6, T = −7.459, p=6.83e-04, Monkey C (inset): n = 4,T = −13.591, p=8.62e-04, Combined across monkeys: T = −3.6193, p=5.578e-03, n = 10). This finding validates that the population reliably encodes gross kinematics similarly across tasks despite the individual unit activity changes observed across tasks in the previous analysis.</p><p>Given that the CO-trained movement onset classifier maintains its predictability in the NR task, we can now ask how the presence of beta oscillations changes the observed distance to the MO threshold. It is possible in both the CO task and the NR task that the presence of beta oscillations does not change the predicted distance to MO threshold as it is known that cells more involved in movement are no more likely to be entrained to beta oscillations than signals not involved in movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Murthy and Fetz, 1996a</xref>). The classifier thus may have captured reliable movement signals from units that are unchanged when beta oscillations are generated, making the distance to MO threshold unaffected by the presence of the oscillations. A second possibility is that the presence of beta oscillations reflects neural activity that is further away from the MO threshold only during CO trials, but not NR trials. As the classifier weights were trained on the CO task, the classifier weights may reflect beta-related structure in the population that is useful for predicting CO bins to be PreMO. If the neurofeedback beta-related structure in the population is different from that in the CO task, as is suggested on an individual unit basis by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, then the population spiking patterns occurring during beta oscillations in the NR task may not exhibit similarly greater distances from the MO threshold. A final possibility is that despite the differences in individual unit firing patterns during the CO and NR beta oscillations, production of beta oscillations requires a consistent shift in population activity in both tasks, and that shift affects patterns predictive of movement onset.</p><p>By comparing the signed distance to the MO threshold during NR trials and CO trials during on-beta and off-beta timepoints, we can begin to discriminate amongst the three possibilities. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b–c</xref> shows the mean signed distance to MO threshold for NR trials of different beta targets and CO trials from one representative day (Monkey G, session 5). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>, traces are aligned to the go cue, showing that during the neurofeedback epoch prior to the go cue, the high beta target (red) maintains a much greater distance from the MO threshold than the low and mid-low beta targets (green and blue). At the time of the go cue the high beta target is further from the MO threshold than the lower beta targets, suggesting that subjects must traverse a greater neural distance to arrive at the MO threshold, which may take longer resulting in a longer MOT. When aligning the same trials to the MOT, all traces converge around the MO threshold showing that all NR trials must arrive at the same MO threshold as CO trials in order to initiate movement. These examples suggest that the presence of more beta oscillations, as in the high beta target (red) trace, is an indicator of subjects’ neural population being far from movement initiation.</p><p>It is possible, however, that the decoder has identified discriminative firing patterns that are unrelated to the presence of beta oscillations and that the differences observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b–c</xref> could be related to subjects' distinct beta-target strategy rather than the actual presence of beta oscillations. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b–c</xref>, the green line corresponding to the lowest beta target is further from the blue line corresponding to the mid-low beta target, showing that the presence of more beta oscillations in the mid-low beta target is not the only factor in determining distance from the MO threshold.</p><p>To directly test whether the presence of beta oscillations affects distance to the MO threshold, we collapsed all NR data across beta targets, isolated slow chunks that occurred prior to <italic>actual</italic> movement onset, and compared distance to MO threshold for on-beta and off-beta bins in both the CO and NR tasks. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d–e</xref> shows mean on-beta and off-beta distances to MO threshold for individual days in the CO (left) and NR (right) tasks.

The first criterion was that a logistic classifier trained only on CO chunks from the individual unit, not the entire population as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, had to predict significantly lower scores for PreMO than PostMO in held-out data in the CO and NF tasks. The second criterion was that units had to exhibit lower predicted scores for on-beta, slow chunks than off-beta, slow chunks in both tasks. The units that fulfilled both criteria were referred to as ‘chosen’ units, and were compared with all other ‘unchosen’ units (units collapsed across days -- Monkey G: 104 chosen units, 251 unchosen units, Monkey C: 171 chosen units, 342 unchosen units). We analyzed the differences between chosen and unchosen weights using five different metrics—classifier weight, beta amplitude-to-spike rate slope during CO task, mean modulation during the CO task, mean firing rate during the CO task, and beta rhythmicity during the CO task (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> -- Chosen versus Unchosen Unit Analysis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> -- Chosen versus Unchosen Units).</p><p>We found that the weights of chosen units exhibited significantly higher and more positive weights than unchosen units, indicating that most chosen units increased their firing rate during PostMO compared with PreMO. Chosen units also tended to have higher firing rates. Further, chosen units showed significantly lower beta amplitude-to-spike rate slopes during the CO task than unchosen units, consistent with the finding that firing rates increase during movement concomitantly with beta amplitude decreases. Chosen units and unchosen units showed no difference in their mean task modulation, and no difference in their beta rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, to assess any difference between the chosen units with a positive classifier weight and the chosen units with negative classifier weight, the same analyses were performed between these groups (termed ‘Chosen+’ units and ‘Chosen–' units, Monkey G: 85 Chosen+ units, 19 Chosen– units, Monkey C: 170 Chosen+ units, 1 Chosen– unit). The Chosen+ units and Chosen- units, respectively, increase and decrease firing rate during movement. Thus, we also found that the Chosen+ group exhibited significantly lower beta-to-firing rate slopes. The groups did not show any difference in mean task modulation. The positive units exhibited significantly higher firing rate. Finally, the negatively modulated units had a non-significantly higher ‘beta rhythmicity’ than the positive units.</p><p>Overall, units that contributed most to the classification of PreMO versus PostMO tended to be high firing units that were positively modulated with movement onset, yet were not necessaily units that were more modulated during the CO task. Within this group were a few units that fired less with movement, that were generally lower firing rate, and possibly more entrained to ongoing beta oscillations in the local field potential. These Chosen- units may be a distinct subpopulation of single and multi-units that act as pacemaker cells for the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen and Fetz, 2005</xref>), although more data and a more careful characterization of firing properties, ISIs, and waveforms is needed to make this claim.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have provided evidence that volitionally increasing and decreasing beta power in the motor system with neurofeedback achieves neural states that precede slower and faster movement onset times, respectively, in three monkeys. These results support the hypothesis that beta oscillations in the motor system reflect neural patterns that are far from a movement onset neural state. Importantly, we used simultaneously recorded single- and multi-unit activity during the NR and CO tasks to characterize how the presence of beta oscillations reflected changes in underlying neural population activity, which ultimately drives the behavioral changes observed. During the neurofeedback epoch of the NR task, population neural activity exhibited greater distances from the computed MO threshold when beta oscillations were observed, and shorter distances when there were no oscillations. We emphasize that this result is not merely driven by the observation that there are often more beta oscillations at rest than during movement. Rather, when subjects are performing neurofeedback and they are at rest, their underlying neural population is shifting further away from the MO threshold when beta oscillations are observed.</p><p>Next we discuss how our results mesh with other reported behavioral correlates of beta oscillations, putative mechanisms of how beta oscillations are generated and may affect movement generation, and benefits of using neurofeedback as an experimental paradigm.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Beta-generating mechanisms in the motor system resolve conflicting reports of beta-behavioral correlates</title><p>Our result that volitionally increasing and decreasing motor cortical beta power with neurofeedback precedes slower and faster movement onset times supports the hypothesis that beta oscillations are linked to neural patterns that slow onset of new movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gilbertson et al., 2005</xref>). Our results add to previously reported findings of elevated beta power prior to and after well-trained movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Donoghue et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Murthy and Fetz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sanes and Donoghue, 1993</xref>). Although we cannot identify the mechanism that drives the beta oscillations observed, modeling and <italic>in vitro</italic> slice work shed some light. Recent modeling of striatal neural populations showed that increased medium spiny neuron (MSN) excitation can result in beta oscillations within the striatum, which can propagate through output structures of the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCarthy et al., 2011</xref>). MSN excitability is affected by neuromodulators including acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cannon et al., 2014</xref>), which notably drives increased MSN excitability primarily in D2 MSNs, or the MSNs responsible for the indirect pathway activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benarroch, 2012</xref>). The findings from our study show that when cells generate beta oscillations they encode a slower movement state, which could reflect indirect pathway activation. Recent work has also suggested that shifts in attention caused by salient stimuli involve the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smith et al., 2009</xref>), which projects to the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smith et al., 2004</xref>), potentially also resulting in transient increases in beta power in D2 MSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCarthy et al., 2011</xref>). This common striatal beta-generating mechanism could explain how increases in attention have been reported to evoke beta oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fetz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leventhal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saleh et al., 2010</xref>), and could be used to pause current motor programs in response to salient stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benarroch, 2012</xref>). This mechanism is also a plausible explanation for evidence of beta oscillations occurring during untrained, free-reaching movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Donoghue et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murthy and Fetz, 1996b</xref>). These oscillations could be driven by salient stimuli that subjects encounter as they execute and update their internally generated motor plan.</p><p>Our results and proposed mechanism of beta generation do not predict oscillatory events occurring during isometric contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Conway et al., 1995</xref>); however, it is becoming increasingly common to find different mechanisms for generating similar frequency oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cannon et al., 2014</xref>). In vitro slice work has identified that with sufficient excitatory drive to slices of sensorimotor or motor cortex, beta frequency oscillations emerge in deep cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roopun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yamawaki et al., 2008</xref>). It is possible that the strong excitatory drive needed to stiffen muscles during an isometric contraction task, in contrast to reaching movements that require temporal coordination of antagonist muscle groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Georgopoulos, 1992</xref>), is sufficient to generate beta oscillations by the same means described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roopun et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yamawaki et al. (2008)</xref>. Further evidence for this proposed mechanism comes from computational models of driving motoneuron recruitment with pyramidal tract neurons. When pyramidal tract neurons fire at beta band or higher frequencies, motoneurons increase recruitment and hence muscular force production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Watanabe and Kohn, 2015</xref>), as required in an isometric contraction task. Potentially, beta oscillations are observed during isometric contraction tasks because of large muscular force requirements in the task, not because of the same striatal beta-generation pathway previously described.</p><p>Finally, our results and the proposed striatal beta-generating mechanism do not predict the correlation of beta power with other behavioral metrics such as movement onset speed, peak speed, and onset acceleration, which were correlated with beta power in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Joundi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pogosyan et al., 2009</xref>).

The mechanisms of tACS are still unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zaghi et al., 2010</xref>), so it is possible that the reported behavioral effects result from evoked neuronal activity patterns that are specific to tACS stimulation and do not occur endogenously.</p><p>Although identifying mechanisms that generate beta oscillations can shed light on how certain types of behavior such as attention or isometric contraction may be correlated with onset of beta oscillations, they do not provide information on how the dynamics of the underlying neural population generate movement change.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Encoding shifts in population neural activity related to beta oscillations</title><p>When populations of neurons generate beta oscillations, their patterns are further from movement onset threshold than when they do not generate oscillations. In both the CO and NR tasks, on-beta PreMO bins exhibit further distances from the MO threshold than off-beta PreMO bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), emphasizing the common population shift that occurs in the CO and NR tasks during beta oscillatory periods. We propose that neural populations must stop generating beta oscillations before they can initiate specific preparatory and movement generating patterns that may occur closer to the MO threshold. Thus, the generation of beta oscillations favors a low-risk state in which neural populations will not accidentally create patterns that cause movement, and in exchange compromise their readiness for upcoming movements. Generation of these oscillations may possibly be implemented by a distinct subpopulation of ‘pacemaker’ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), although data with more clearly isolatable single units are needed to describe how distinct subpopulations may each contribute to the pacing of beta oscillations versus the encoding of kinematic information.</p><p>The hypothesis that encoding of specific movements is compromised with beta oscillations is further supported by experiments showing that in a delayed reaching task similar to the CO task here, movement cues associated with more uncertainty are correlated with higher beta power during preparatory periods than movement cues associated with certainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tzagarakis et al., 2010</xref>). Uncertain stimuli bias the subject against preparing movements, corroborating that periods of beta oscillations are associated with compromised preparation. Further, during spike-driven cursor brain-machine interface tasks in which subjects are not moving, periods of beta oscillatory activity correspond to inferior neural decoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Milekovic et al., 2013</xref>) and slower cursor movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ranade et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that the population contains less specific directional information that can be used to move the prosthetic cursor.</p><p>How does the hypothesis of beta oscillations reflecting less informative encoding mesh with results showing linearly separable neural activity patterns during preparatory periods, when beta oscillations are prominent, for different upcoming movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hatsopoulos et al., 2004</xref>)? As beta oscillations occur in transient bursts and only show elevated power for trial averages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sherman et al., 2016</xref>), it is possible that movement encoding during bursts is compromised, but outside of bursts is intact. Further, not all cells engage in beta oscillatory events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Murthy and Fetz, 1996a</xref>), making it possible that some cells are still encoding movement information during ongoing oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reimer and Hatsopoulos, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Neural activity in Parkinson’s disease (PD) reflects slowed, non-specific kinematic encoding and elevated beta synchrony</title><p>Individual motor cortical neuron recordings from parkinsonian non-human primates and electrocorticography recordings in humans support the hypothesis that beta oscillations, found to be excessive in PD throughout the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cannon et al., 2014</xref>), compromise the encoding of kinematic information needed for movement generation. Indeed motor cortical cell activity is more correlated in motor disabled non-human primates after systemic treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) than before treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Goldberg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pasquereau and Turner, 2011</xref>). Cells also fire less specifically to passive limb movements after MPTP treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Goldberg et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting a correlation between excessive beta oscillations and reduced specificity for movements. Also, it was found that coupling between low frequency beta phase and high frequency broadband gamma power was elevated in PD patients who had their deep brain stimulation therapy turned off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Hemptinne et al., 2015</xref>) or were in an off-state following an extended period of no levodopa medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Swann et al., 2015</xref>). Both stimulation and levodopa administration therapies improve symptoms of bradykinesia and rigidity for PD patients, suggesting that synchronization of high gamma, a proxy for spiking activity, to beta frequencies may be related to akinesia symptoms. This evidence, although in a disease model, supports the hypothesis that beta oscillations reflect reduced capability of kinematic encoding in population neural activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Advantages of using neurofeedback to study behavioral correlates</title><p>Using a neurofeedback paradigm to investigate behavioral and population neural correlates of oscillations has several advantages. First, as the neurofeedback epoch only requires subjects to modulate beta power and to be seated at rest, they choose their own subject-specific strategy for generating or quenching beta activity. These strategies may include co-modulating other frequency bands, imagining movement, or performing other internal behaviors that generate beta activity. For example, while Monkeys C and G inversely modulated low frequency (1–10 Hz) power with beta frequency power, Monkey S did not modulate 1–10 Hz power as drastically but did exhibit increased 50–60 Hz power with increased beta power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d–f</xref>). Despite the different approaches that were taken to increase and decrease beta power across animals there is still a consistent effect of high versus low beta power on movement onset times, increasing confidence that the oscillation is a reliable marker of the observed behavior. Many motor tasks previously used to study beta oscillations engage motor preparation, increased attention, cue expectation, and possibly muscular stiffening simultaneously within the task. These overlapping behaviors make it challenging to correlate a specific behavior with the presence of beta oscillations. Using a neurofeedback task, in which there will be individual subject-specific neurofeedback strategies, prior to a single task allows for a better test of how tightly linked the conditioned neural feature is to behavior.</p><p>Another advantage of using neurofeedback over other approaches to perturb neural oscillations such as non-invasive transcranial alternating current stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Joundi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pogosyan et al., 2009</xref>) or invasive transcranial electrical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ozen et al., 2010</xref>), is that the recorded neural signal is not tarnished with a stimulation artifact. In this study, simultaneously recorded units were analyzed and shown to exhibit different activity during neurofeedback-induced beta oscillations compared with natural beta oscillations occurring during typical reaching tasks. Despite differences at an individual unit level, population-level analyses show that beta oscillations promote a consistent movement-slowing state during both the CO and NR tasks, matching what is observed behaviorally. This analysis could be compromised if a stimulation artifact prevented recording of local field potentials or single units.</p><p>Another report, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McFarland et al. (2015)</xref>, using a similar but non-invasive beta band neurofeedback method prior to a movement task reports comparable behavioral results. The authors found that three of the eight subjects exhibited significant reductions in movement onset time following reduced beta power, consistent with our findings. It is possible that the movement onset increase was not seen for all subjects because there was substantially more temporal smoothing in the study neurofeedback task setup (neural signals averaged in window of 1 s, compared with our window of 200 ms), and no hold requirement for the neurofeedback cursor (compared with our hold requirement of 450 ms). Thus, their subjects could be in a greater range of neural states prior to the movement task, making the movement onset versus beta target relationship less robust. Finally, the authors do report a group-level significant increase in movement accuracy following beta reduction, a metric that did not change in our experiment likely because of the subjects’ overtraining of arm reaches in our study.</p><p>Finally, neurofeedback is a tool that, if effective at introducing a change in subsequent behaviors, could be a directly translatable therapy for patients. For example, if excessive synchronization of motor neurons is pathological in PD, learning to reduce neural coupling with neurofeedback of beta oscillations may improve bradykinesia symptoms. Evidence suggests that PD patients do indeed exhibit stronger movement-related beta power reduction prior to movement onset than non-PD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rowland et al., 2015</xref>), implying that some patients may already reduce beta power to initiate movement more easily. Thus, neurofeedback could be a tool to teach patients to cognitively modulate their beta power for symptom improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Khanna et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moxon and Foffani, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Alternative explanations</title><p>An alternative explanation to our results is that the monkeys used movement to decrease the beta cursor and/or isometric contraction to increase the beta cursor during the neurofeedback epoch, and it was this movement that drove the MOT differences. First, a previous group has published work with NHPs performing beta-range neurofeedback (30–43 Hz instead of our 25–40 Hz) and reported a lack of overt movement evidenced by video and EMG recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Engelhard et al., 2013</xref>). Second, in our studies, we took video of Monkey C and Monkey G performing the task and found no overt movements when subjects were performing neurofeedback. Third, if the monkeys did make voluntary, overt movements, they would likely be moving their left hand or legs to assist with desynchronization of beta power during the low beta target trials of the neurofeedback epoch. Evidence from human psychophysical studies supports the finding that limb movements contralateral to the hand performing a simple reaction time task actually lengthen subjects’ reaction time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Begeman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buenaventura and Sarkin, 1996</xref>). Thus, measured right hand MOTs in this study would be slower if monkeys were moving their left hand or leg. Finally, subjects could be using isometric contraction to increase beta power to assist in getting to the high beta target, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 1997</xref>. However, a previous study showed that if the hand of interest (here, right hand) is isometrically contracted, there is no significant slowing or quickening in MOT compared with a subject performing a simple reaction time test at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Castellote et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, previously published work and our own video evidence suggests that subjects are not moving. Even if subjects were moving to lower the beta cursor, human psychophysics studies suggest that MOT should be slower than if they were not moving. Thus, moving would make our MOT effect less significant, not more significant, allieviating the concern that monkeys moving is causing our reported MOT trend.</p><p>Another interpretation of our results is that as subjects only perform reaches to well-practiced, predictable targets, the finding that the presence of beta oscillations correlates with slowed MOTs does not apply to the general case where movement intentions are not over-practiced. Unfortunately, two challenges exist to testing the effect of increasing or decreasing beta oscillations on MOTs in unprepared arm-reaches in our task setup. First, unprepared reaches have greater MOTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>) and the beta state reached by the neurofeedback manipulation does not persist for long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>). The longer it takes to process an unprepared reach cue, the further away in time this will make subjects’ MOT from the end of the neurofeedback epoch, making it likely that by the time MO occurs, the effect of the neurofeedback will have washed out. Second, salient cues are known to evoke beta oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saleh et al., 2010</xref>), making any post-neurofeedback cue indicating reach target likely to equalize subjects’ beta states. For both these reasons, we were unable to test the hypothesis that the presence of beta oscillations has a direct effect on unprepared movements. However, previous evidence showing the emergence of beta oscillations with salient and used cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leventhal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saleh et al., 2010</xref>), and the emergence of higher beta power with cues associated with less certainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tzagarakis et al., 2010</xref>), suggest that beta oscillations may also reflect the neural states that subjects are in as they process cues to prepare their next movements.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Summary</title><p>The results from this study show that beta band frequencies are a marker of slowed movement onset. The underlying motor cortical population activity shifts further from a MO threshold when subjects volitionally produce beta oscillations in the NR task or naturally produce them in the CO task. We discussed mechanistic generators of beta oscillations and used these to reconcile discrepancies in previously reported behavioral correlates of beta activity. Finally, we proposed that the shifts observed in activity of motor cortical neurons caused by generation of beta oscillations reduce the probability of accidental movement in exchange for compromised encoding of specific movement plans.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Surgery, electrophysiology, and experimental setup</title><p>Three male rhesus macaques (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/NCBITaxon:9544">NCBITaxon:9544</ext-link>) were chronically implanted with arrays of 128 Teflon-coated tungsten microwire electrodes (35 μm in diameter, 500 μm separation between microwires, 16 × 8 configuration, 6.5 mm length, Innovative Neurophysiology, Durham, NC) in the left upper arm area of primary motor cortex (M1) and posterior dorsal premotor cortex (PMd).

A yellow square beta cursor representing an estimate of the monkey’s motor cortical beta power and one of four beta targets appeared on the left of the screen. As estimates of normalized motor cortical beta power increased or decreased, the beta cursor position increased or decreased on the y axis, updating every 100 ms. Subjects modulated their endogenous neural signals to make the beta cursor hover over the beta target for 450 ms to successfully end the neurofeedback epoch. Subjects had 60 s to reach the beta target with their beta cursor before the trial timed out and the same beta target repeated. Once the neurofeedback epoch was completed the reaching epoch began. The beta cursor and beta target disappeared and a peripheral reach target appeared in a location 6.5 cm away from the center target. The peripheral target was kept in a consistent location from trial to trial and only changed on a day-to-day basis, making its location predictable.

These values were finalized after ~1 week of training the subjects on the beta neurofeedback task. Initial training began with more lenient beta neurofeedback requirements (values to achieve low beta and high beta target were closer to the mean beta cursor value). As subjects improved in performance, the beta targets moved further apart until the top and bottom targets had a mean time to target of 5–10 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>NR task variant using beta band and 1–10 Hz</title><p>Monkey G performed one task variant of the NR task where the neurofeedback cursor in the x-axis was controlled with normalized 1–10 Hz power in addition to it being controlled in the y-axis with normalized beta power, as described above. The four beta targets were in the same locations as in the standard NR task. This variant thus required that the subject produce the correct normalized beta power value without simultaneously producing too high or too low a 1–10 Hz power value, as extreme 1–10 Hz modulations would move the cursor too far to the left or to the right of the beta target. The subject practiced the task with lenient requirements at first which were slowly made harder until performance plateaued and the mean time to LFP target was 5–10 s. The final values that normalized 1–10 Hz power must fall within were 0.74–0.95.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Chance level performance of beta neurofeedback epoch</title><p>For each session (typically lasting 10–40 min), beta cursor position from the session’s online performance was re-run through a target-shuffled task simulation, designed to assess whether the subjects’ performance during the beta neurofeedback epoch of the NR task was resulted merely from chance fluctuations in beta power or was caused by volitional changes in beta power that were specific for the beta target on the screen. In the simulation, after the beta cursor entered the beta target and held for the 450 ms beta target hold time, an average arm-reaching time, the constant reward time, and the constant inter-trial interval time transpired to simulate the natural pacing of the task. At the end of the simulation, a metric of chance performance was the mean number of successful beta targets acquired over the length of the session. For example, if one target-shuffled performance yields 10 successful trials in 10 min, the chance rate for that simulation would be one rewarded target per minute.</p><p>One hundred simulations were run per session (each session ~10–40 min) yielding a distribution of rewarded targets/minute.

Second, it was a long enough window to accurately capture low frequency activity.

To determine when the beta oscillatory events occurred, the following procedure was applied. The local field potential (LFP) signal from one of the electrodes used in the neurofeedback task was selected, and filtered at 25–40 Hz with a fifth order Butterworth filter. The amplitude of the filtered signal was estimated with the Hilbert transform. Each day, a distribution of amplitude values was computed by aggregating all rewarded trials from that day. A threshold was set at the 60th percentile of the resultant distribution. Then, all timepoints surpassing the threshold were labeled with a 1. All other points were labeled with a 0. Then, the length of each block of uninterrupted '1s' was computed, and if the block was longer than 125 ms (so the oscillatory episode lasted at least 3–4 cycles as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Murthy and Fetz (1996a)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sherman et al., 2016</xref>), the block remained as is. If the block was less than 125 ms, all points in the block were changed back to '0s'. All of the above computations were done at the original LFP sampling rate of 1000 Hz.

Monkey S had arrays that had been implanted for &gt;3 years and were no longer usable for recording high frequency activity.

These were concatenated yielding a long (ntrials*2500 x nunits) matrix of spike counts for each task. Continuous beta amplitude was estimated for these time slices using a fifth order Butterworth bandpass filter from 25 to 40 Hz and then applying the Hilbert transform. These vectors were then concatenated yielding a long (ntrials*2500 × 1) vector of beta amplitudes, one for each task. The beta amplitude vectors were both reordered by increasing amplitude, and the spiking data were reordered to keep the corresponding time points aligned. Each reordered beta amplitude vector was then reduced to 10 values, where each value is the mean of 1/10th of the sorted beta amplitude array (mean of first 10th of array is first value, mean of second tenth of array is second value, etc.). Mean spike rate values were estimated in the same way, yielding a 10 × 1 beta amplitude and a 10 x nunits spike rate array for both the CO and NR tasks.

First, trials were extracted from 1.5 s prior to the go cue to 1.0 s after the go cue yielding 2.5-second-long trials. Spiking activity from all CO reaching sessions and all NR task sessions was binned into 25 ms bins yielding an ntrials x 100 bins x nunits sized matrix for each task and each day. Each unit's activity was then z-scored by subtracting by its mean and dividing by its standard deviation over trials and bins. Then, each bin and its previous two bins were concatenated to yield a ntrials x 98 chunks x (nneurons x 3) sized matrix (first two bins discarded as there were not enough lagged bins). Here, a chunk is three bins. Next, each chunk on each trial was labeled as pre-movement onset (PreMO) or post-movement onset (PostMO) if the last of the three bins in the chunk occurred prior to or following movement onset (calculated same way as in Movement onset time calculation).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Van Essen as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Eric Maris (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study investigates the role of β oscillations in motor control using neurofeedback training of β power and decoding of spike rates across multiple simultaneously recorded neurons. Previous studies have shown that spontaneous fluctuations in β power correlate with several parameters of movement initiation, with higher β power generally slowing movement initiation. Previous studies have also used brain stimulation approaches to provide further evidence for this. The current manuscript adds substantial new evidence by using neurofeedback to modulate β power. Neurofeedback is an alternative way to experimentally control β power. It has the disadvantage that β power modulation is not pure, but accompanied by power changes in other frequency bands; yet it has the advantage over conventional brain stimulation techniques of avoiding potentially unphysiological conditions. Using a novel neurofeedback-reaching task, animals first adjust the LFP-β power in a neurofeedback task to four predetermined states, ranging from very low to very high, and then execute a reach task to a visual target. It was found that reaches preceded by low β power had a significantly faster reaction time and the population state of the neural network was significantly closer to a movement onset state than when the β power was high, demonstrating a correlation of neural population activity with longer reaction times during increased β oscillation activity. Employing neurofeedback to voluntarily modulate β LFP power in specific brain areas and then studying behavioral and neural population effects is highly novel and interesting. In summary, the study provides an interesting and substantial scientific advance. There are several points that need to be addressed to further improve the manuscript.</p><p>Results:</p><p>Strategies for variation of β power. The authors argue that subjects may choose their own subject-specific strategy for generating or suppressing β activity, including several possible 'internal behaviors'. However, can the authors sufficiently rule out 'external behavior'? In other words, could β power be modulated by more or less overt motor activity, like below-threshold movements or muscle co-contractions? This would be important to check, e.g., by sampling some EMG activity.</p><p>Why were the reach movements performed only in one direction? This makes the task highly monotonic and predictable. Animals probably have been trained before to perform the CO task in several directions. Why was it not possible to maintain multiple reach directions in the task? On the one hand, the statistics would probably not have been so conclusive with a smaller number of trials per reach condition. On the other hand, showing the effect of β power in behavior and neural network independent from the intended action would have been much more powerful. This should be properly discussed.</p><p>The authors use a complex experimental approach to deal with the fact that non-β frequencies are co-modulated during the β neurofeedback epoch of the task. A much simpler approach (which does not require new data) would be a multiple regression analysis in which one quantifies how much of the variance in the movement onset times can be explained by β power on top of the power in the frequencies below 10 Hz. (Frequencies higher than β may be ignored, because these will only have a small effect on the β power normalization, as a result of the 1/f scaling of the power.)</p><p>Results, paragraph two: This paragraph gives the impression that the β power changes were unrelated to power changes in other frequency bands. This is not convincing, because <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref> shows that monkeys C and G modulate their low-frequency power opposite to the β power. These spectra show z-scored power, in which the power in each frequency bin is normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the SD of that frequency bin across trials. However, the normalization for the feedback training was done differently: it was performed directly on the raw power values. Low-frequencies have the largest power and will therefore have the strongest impact on the normalization during feedback training. It is therefore a powerful strategy for the monkeys to modulate their low frequency power. This is precisely what monkeys C and G seem to have done. The authors should fully acknowledge that β power changes are accompanied by systematic changes in other frequency ranges. Even if they had trained monkeys on the non-normalized β power, the animals would have likely learned to co-modulate other frequency bands. Physiologically, fluctuations in power of different frequency bands are positively or negatively correlated, depending on the respective bands. Nevertheless, monkey S has apparently used a different strategy, because <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> suggests that low-frequency power is not modulated opposite to β power.

This same test is not done for any of the other frequency bands, so we do not know whether it would affect them in the same or a different way. Also, here the individual significance testing per animal is a problem. All three subject show negative z-values, two show individually significant effects, only one misses the significance. Is the effect significant, when the data are combined across subjects?</p><p>Power in the 65-100 Hz band is typically very small in absolute terms, when compared to β power or even lower-frequency power. Thus, it likely did not contribute very much to the monkeys' strategies during feedback training. I suggest the authors quantify the percentage of 65-100 Hz power contribution to the denominator used for normalization during feedback training. I expect that this number is very small, and that the animals modulate γ power opposite to β power, simply because this is the physiological pattern. This should be acknowledged rather than argued away. It would be interesting to see whether β power and 65-100 Hz power is similarly anticorrelated outside the feedback task, e.g. during CO task performance.</p><p>There is the need for further clarification regarding the logistic regression classifier to demonstrate (1) the relation between the population firing rates and movement and (2) how this relation is modulated by β oscillatory power.

This follows from the equation K=2TW-1 (see your multi-taper method tutorial for reference). This means that your power estimate at frequency f is actually represents the smoothed power from the frequency band [f-15, f+15] Hz. However, this does not seem to be the case, when looking a <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. Using fewer tapers would reduce frequency smoothing at the expense of more noise. However, since &quot;β_est&quot; was averaged in the frequency range of 25-40 Hz, more noise might not be so problematic. Please clarify what was actually done.</p><p>Results are only based on p-values and no effect-size measures are reported. These can easily be provided and are useful (see van Ede et al., 2012, JNPhys, for a related study and a motivation). These effect-size measures could be the percentage of explained variance for the movement onset times (for the first observation) and the probability of correctly classifying a spiking pattern as coming from the pre or the post movement period (for the second observation).</p><p>Authors mainly report statistical tests separately for the three monkeys. This should always be accompanied by a test that combines across monkeys. This is particularly relevant, as they also report that some effects are not consistent across subjects. In that case, the decisive test is the one that combines data across subjects.</p><p>On a number of occasions, the authors perform a statistical test on the outcome of a classification in which training and test sample were identical.

The authors argue that subjects may choose their own subject-specific strategy for generating or suppressing β activity, including several possible 'internal behaviors'. However, can the authors sufficiently rule out 'external behavior'? In other words, could β power be modulated by more or less overt motor activity, like below-threshold movements or muscle co-contractions? This would be important to check, e.g., by sampling some EMG activity.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for the comment. First, we did video two NHPs (Monkeys C, G) completing the NR task. In both videos the left hand is visible, and in the second video the left hand, full trunk and both legs of the animal are visible. During the neurofeedback epochs of the task, neither animal is making perceptible movements. Second, a previous study in NHPs investigating neurofeedback of the motor cortical LFP in the 30-43 Hz frequency band, a nearly overlapping frequency range to this study, showed no movements nor EMG activity while monkeys performed neurofeedback (Engelhard et al., 2013). This evidence makes us more confident that monkeys likely did not engage an overt motor strategy while performing neurofeedback.</p><p>Finally, even if the monkeys did make overt movements to assist in performance of the neurofeedback epoch, the movements would be most likely occur during the lowest β target since movement desynchronizes β power. However, previous studies have shown that contralateral limb movements (in this case, left limb movements) lengthen a simple reaction time performed (Begeman et al., 2007; Buenaventura and Sarkin, 1996). This evidence suggests that if the animals are performing some movements to make the β cursor lower, their subsequent right arm reaches likely are slower than they would be without the extraneous movements. Another possibility is that subjects are using isometric contraction to increase β power, as demonstrated in (Baker et al., 1997). However, one study shows that if the hand of interest (here, right hand) is isometrically contracted, there is no significant difference in movement onset time for this condition compared to movement onset for a control condition when the subject is at rest (Castellote et al., 2004). This evidence suggests that if the subject is moving to lower the β cursor, these movements would lengthen their arm-reaching movement onset time, likely making the effect we observe <italic>less</italic> pronounced than it would be without the extra movements.</p><p>This point has been appended to the discussion (‘alternative explanations’).</p><p><italic>Why were the reach movements performed only in one direction? This makes the task highly monotonic and predictable. Animals probably have been trained before to perform the CO task in several directions. Why was it not possible to maintain multiple reach directions in the task? On the one hand, the statistics would probably not have been so conclusive with a smaller number of trials per reach condition. On the other hand, showing the effect of β power in behavior and neural network independent from the intended action would have been much more powerful. This should be properly discussed.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this comment. We did try to train one monkey to perform the NR task where the reach target was not predictable. When doing the NR task with unprepared reaches, there were no significant differences in MOT by β target. Likely, this effect was due to the fact that unprepared reaches have longer MOTs than prepared reaches (sometimes as big a difference as 60 ms found in Monkey G in Churchland et al., 2006) and that differential levels of β power quickly go away after the subjects have held their β cursor in the β target (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref> following the first vertical red line). Thus, the β levels of the NHPs could have been equivalent when they initiated their unprepared reaches since the time to prepare and initiate movement took longer in the case of unprepared reaches. Another challenge with instructing unprepared reaches is that cue presentation has been associated with increases in β power (Leventhal et al., 2012; Saleh et al., 2010). Thus, if the reach is unprepared, providing a cue to the animal after the neurofeedback epoch has been completed may equalize the subjects’ β state. We do expect that our findings would generalize to unprepared movements, though the current paradigm may not be able to test that hypothesis directly.</p><p>This point has been appended to the discussion (‘alternative explanations’).</p><p><italic>The authors use a complex experimental approach to deal with the fact that non-β frequencies are co-modulated during the β neurofeedback epoch of the task. A much simpler approach (which does not require new data) would be a multiple regression analysis in which one quantifies how much of the variance in the movement onset times can be explained by β power on top of the power in the frequencies below 10 Hz. (Frequencies higher than β may be ignored, because these will only have a small effect on the β power normalization, as a result of the 1/f scaling of the power.)</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We performed an analysis of R<sup>2</sup> when fitting linear models predicting MOT with β power, low frequency power, or both variables. We find that β frequency (25-40 Hz) power accounts for more MOT variance than low frequency (1-10 Hz) power. When comparing two models that predict MOT (MOT ~ Low Freq versus MOT ~ Low Freq + Β), the F-test demonstrates adding β power significantly improves model performance for all animals. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>Results, paragraph two: This paragraph gives the impression that the β power changes were unrelated to power changes in other frequency bands. This is not convincing, because <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref> shows that monkeys C and G modulate their low-frequency power opposite to the β power. These spectra show z-scored power, in which the power in each frequency bin is normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the SD of that frequency bin across trials. However, the normalization for the feedback training was done differently: it was performed directly on the raw power values. Low-frequencies have the largest power and will therefore have the strongest impact on the normalization during feedback training.

In some subjects (Monkeys C, G), increases and decreases in β power were accompanied with reliable decreases and increases in low frequencies (1-10 Hz).”</p><p>Also note the section titled “Non-β frequencies are co-modulated during the β neurofeedback epoch of the task” (first line):</p><p>“Since the neurofeedback epoch required control of normalized β power, it is possible for subjects to have neurofeedback strategies that involve modulation of non-β frequency bands, in addition to the β band, to move the cursor.”</p><p>This also explains that non-β band power changes can influence cursor position.</p><p><italic>Even if they had trained monkeys on the non-normalized β power, the animals would have likely learned to co-modulate other frequency bands.

Is the effect significant, when the data are combined across subjects?</italic> </p><p>We decided not to include the results of this test. Instead, we choose to perform a reviewer suggested analysis to show that the percentage of movement onset time variance accounted for by the normalized γ power is much lower than is accounted for by β power. Further, when comparing a model that predicts MOT from γ power versus a model that predicts MOT from γ and β power, for all animals we find that the second model is significantly better, suggesting that knowledge of β power adds predictive power that is not captured in knowledge of γ power. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>Power in the 65-100 Hz band is typically very small in absolute terms, when compared to β power or even lower-frequency power.

Increased γ power may then be a physiological pattern that emerges with reduced β power. It is unlikely that subjects are relying on changes in γ power, which would change the denominator term in the β cursor computation, to drive their neurofeedback strategy since γ power constitutes less than 3% of the total broadband estimate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>).”</p><p><italic>There is the need for further clarification regarding the logistic regression classifier to demonstrate (1) the relation between the population firing rates and movement and (2) how this relation is modulated by β oscillatory power.

This follows from the equation K=2TW-1 (see your multi-taper method tutorial for reference). This means that your power estimate at frequency f is actually represents the smoothed power from the frequency band [f-15, f+15] Hz. However, this does not seem to be the case, when looking a <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. Using fewer tapers would reduce frequency smoothing at the expense of more noise. However, since &quot;β_est&quot; was averaged in the frequency range of 25-40 Hz, more noise might not be so problematic. Please clarify what was actually done.</italic> </p><p>The methods are correct, and 5 tapers were indeed used with a time-bandwidth product of 3. As you point out, this results in substantial smoothing during the online estimate of β power. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> was computed using the multi-taper method, but was also ‘detrended’ to remove the 1/f trend in typical neurological PSDs. This is now noted in the figure legend and Materials and methods section ‘Power spectral densities (PSDs)’. Attached here is a comparison of the non-detrended spectrogram and the detrended spectrogram seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>.</p><p><italic>Results are only based on p-values and no effect-size measures are reported. These can easily be provided and are useful (see van Ede et al., 2012, JNPhys, for a related study and a motivation). These effect-size measures could be the percentage of explained variance for the movement onset times (for the first observation) and the probability of correctly classifying a spiking pattern as coming from the pre or the post movement period (for the second observation).</italic> </p><p>See <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> for amount of variance accounted for. We also report percent of correctly classifying held-out CO and NF spike patterns in the manuscript in Results section “Β oscillations during the NR task and CO task reflect a shift in neural population activity away from a movement onset state”.</p><p><italic>Authors mainly report statistical tests separately for the three monkeys. This should always be accompanied by a test that combines across monkeys. This is particularly relevant, as they also report that some effects are not consistent across subjects. In that case, the decisive test is the one that combines data across subjects.</italic> </p><p>Now all reported statistical tests include tests combined across monkeys.</p><p><italic>On a number of occasions, the authors perform a statistical test on the outcome of a classification in which training and test sample were identical. Such a test is biased. Although biased, this does not invalidate the paper's main results, which were obtained with a different training and test sample. This issue should be explicitly addressed.</italic> </p><p>This is has been corrected. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> only held-out test data is reported. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref> both training data and test data is used to compare the classification scores of spiking patterns from on-β and off-β events. This is done because the classifier has no knowledge of which spiking patterns are on-β and off-β, so it is not explicitly trained.</p><p><italic>Results section, paragraph three: &quot;…3-10 days of executing the NR task.&quot; This suggests, there are only 3-10 sessions of data per animal, but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> indicates a much larger number of sessions per animal. Please clarify! Were there multiple sessions per day?</italic> </p><p>Yes, there were multiple 10-40 minute sessions per day. This has now been clarified in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Subsection “NR task controls”: Trials with MOT smaller than 0 and greater than 0.7 s were removed.

This should be consistent across analyses.</italic> </p><p>Yes, this was also done for all analyses except for those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-F</xref>.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Movement onset trend is specific to β band frequencies”: The analysis should not only be performed on pre-defined bands, but correlations between power and MOT should be calculated for each frequency bin. This is not a must, just a suggestion. In the current frequency-bin definition, the 1-10 Hz bin combines δ, theta and α. The authors should at least make an effort to separate theta and α.</italic> </p><p>Done. Please see end of section “Modified β neurofeedback task shows 1-10 Hz band power does not account for movement onset time increase”.</p><p><italic>The authors should explain how they derive channel level activity, rather than merely pointing to the paper of Chestek et al., 2011.</italic> </p><p>This has been added to Materials and methods section.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Comparing single and multi unit responses to β oscillations during the CO and NR task”: This will likely distort results.</italic> </p><p>We are not sure to what the reviewer is referring too.

You’re correct in noting that 1.5 seconds prior to the go cue is too long and would capture more time than just the hold period, but only the non-movement part of the 1.5 seconds is used, which just captures the hold period. Prior to the hold period the hand was being brought to the center target so these time points would not satisfy the ‘non-movement’ requirement to be included in the analysis. This method was used to account for the variable hold times in the CO task. Note that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F-H</xref> used the full 2.5 second trial, which included activity before the hold period, the hold period, the reach, and any activity after the reach.</p><p><italic>Materials and methods section: Please also specify the length of the electrodes.</italic> </p><p>6.5 mm.

That is a crucial difference to previous studies, which related behavioral performance to spontaneously occurring β levels.

However, it is conceptually important that the authors intervene with the system through neurofeedback by setting β targets.
