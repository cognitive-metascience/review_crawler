neurokinin B (NKB) neurocircuits are essential for pubertal development and fertility. Kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) co-express Kiss1, NKB, dynorphin and glutamate and are postulated to provide an episodic, excitatory drive to gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GnRH) neurons, the synaptic mechanisms of which are unknown. We characterized the cellular basis for synchronized Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neuronal activity using optogenetics, whole-cell electrophysiology, molecular pharmacology and single cell RT-PCR in mice. High-frequency photostimulation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons evoked local release of excitatory (NKB) and inhibitory (dynorphin) neuropeptides, which were found to synchronize the Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neuronal firing. The light-evoked synchronous activity caused robust excitation of GnRH neurons by a synaptic mechanism that also involved glutamatergic input to preoptic Kiss1 neurons from Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. We propose that Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons play a dual role of driving episodic secretion of GnRH through the differential release of peptide and amino acid neurotransmitters to coordinate reproductive function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16246.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16246.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16246.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Puberty and fertility are necessary for survival of the species. An evolutionarily ancient region of the brain called the hypothalamus regulates these processes. The hypothalamus releases a chemical messenger called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (or GnRH for short), which is then transported from the brain to the pituitary gland. GnRH activates the pituitary gland, which in turn releases reproductive hormones that control ovulation in females and sperm production in males.</p><p>For this process to work correctly in females, the hypothalamus must release GnRH in appropriately timed pulses and produce one massive release, or “surge”, of GnRH to trigger ovulation. Two populations of neurons within the hypothalamus produce a peptide molecule called Kisspeptin and drive the activity and subsequent release of GnRH. One population resides in an area called the arcuate nucleus and the other in the preoptic nucleus. Recent findings suggest that the arcuate nucleus is the “pulse generator” responsible for triggering the rhythmic release of GnRH by the hypothalamus, whereas the preoptic nucleus induces the surge of GnRH. However, how these brain regions do this remains unclear.</p><p>Using a technique called optogenetics, Qiu, Nestor et al. explored whether kisspeptin-producing neurons in the arcuate nucleus are able to communicate with each other to drive pulses of GnRH release. The idea was to selectively activate a subset of kisspeptin neurons in mice and determine whether this would activate the remaining neurons at the same time. Qiu, Nestor et al. introduced a light-sensitive protein into the kisspeptin-producing neurons on one side of the arcuate nucleus, and then used light to activate those neurons. As predicted, this caused kisspeptin neurons throughout the arcuate nucleus to coordinate their activity.</p><p>In addition to their namesake peptide, kisspeptin-producing neurons also make the neurotransmitter glutamate, the excitatory peptide neurokinin B, and the inhibitory peptide dynorphin. Light-induced stimulation of the arcuate nucleus caused its kisspeptin neurons to also release neurokinin B and dynorphin, which synchronized the firing of the kisspeptin neurons. The hypothalamus then translates this coordinated activity into pulses of GnRH release. The light-induced stimulation also triggered the release of glutamate, which caused kisspeptin neurons within the preoptic nucleus to fire in bursts. This in turn robustly excited the GnRH neurons, giving rise to the surge of GnRH.</p><p>These findings show that peptide and classical neurotransmitters collaborate to control GnRH neuron activity and, consequently, fertility. The results obtained by Qiu, Nestor et al. can be used to further explore kisspeptin-GnRH neuronal circuits, and to obtain insights into the role of neuronal peptide signaling in healthy as well as diseased states.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16246.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16246.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neuropeptide</kwd><kwd>slow EPSP</kwd><kwd>synchronization</kwd><kwd>neurokinin B</kwd><kwd>dynorphin</kwd><kwd>GnRH</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS38809</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>Martin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS43330</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rønnekleiv</surname><given-names>Oline K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DK68098</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>Martin J</given-names></name><name><surname>Rønnekleiv</surname><given-names>Oline K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 DK104366</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nestor</surname><given-names>Casey C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamus release peptide and amino acid neurotransmitters that work together to coordinate the activity of gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons and subsequent release of reproductive hormones.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GnRH), and consequently pulsatile release of pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH), is required for normal reproductive function, and there is increasing evidence that kisspeptin (Kiss1) neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARH) are a component of the “GnRH pulse generator” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Navarro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Navarro et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lehman et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Okamura et al., 2013</xref>). The “GnRH pulse generator” consists of bursts of multiunit activity (MUA) in the arcuate nucleus that are timed with pulses of LH secretion, and this phenomenon has been demonstrated in the monkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knobil, 1989</xref>), goat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wakabayashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Okamura et al., 2013</xref>), and rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kimura et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kinsey-Jones et al., 2008</xref>). In mammals, two major populations of kisspeptin-synthesizing neurons exist - one in the anterior preoptic area and the other in the ARH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lehman et al., 2010b</xref>). In rodents, the anterior preoptic cell group is a periventricular continuum within the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and the periventricular preoptic nucleus (PeN) and is responsible for the GnRH/LH surge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clarkson and Herbison, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Both the AVPV/PeN and ARH Kiss1 neurons (Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup>; Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) co-express other peptide and amino acid neurotransmitters, and the Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons co-synthesize and potentially co-release neurokinin B (NKB) and dynorphin (Dyn) in most mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goodman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Navarro et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartzen-Sprauer et al., 2014</xref>), forming the basis for the “KNDy neuron” terminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lehman et al., 2010a</xref>). Importantly, Kiss1, NKB and their respective receptors are absolutely essential for pubertal development and the control of reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seminara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">d'Anglemont de Tassigny et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Topaloglu et al., 2009</xref>). Morphological studies have provided evidence that Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons can communicate with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lehman et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rance et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Navarro et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Navarro et al., 2011b</xref>), and NKB/tachykinin receptor 3 (Tacr3) and Dyn/κ-opioid receptor (KOR) signaling have been proposed to play a critical role in the generation of episodic GnRH/LH pulses via direct and synchronized action on GnRH nerve terminals in the median eminence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Navarro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ohkura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wakabayashi et al., 2010</xref>). Anatomical tract-tracing studies have shown that Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons are bilaterally interconnected within the ARH and project to GnRH terminals in the median eminence and to Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rance et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yip et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons could coordinate (synchronize) their activity to drive GnRH secretion via these contralateral projections. Recent findings also indicate that Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons co-express the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGluT2) and release the neurotransmitter glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cravo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nestor et al., 2016</xref>), which could also provide an excitatory drive to hypothalamic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Van den Pol et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>Currently, we explored the synaptic mechanisms by which Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons synchronize their burst firing activity and how their unified activity was conveyed to the rostral Kiss 1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons and hence excitation of GnRH neurons. We used a combination of whole-cell patch recording, optogenetics, molecular pharmacology and single cell RT-PCR to elucidate the underlying synaptic mechanisms at multiple sites. We discovered that high-frequency photoactivation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons induced a NKB-mediated slow excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), which was modulated by co-released dynorphin, and caused synchronization of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. Interestingly, activation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons co-released glutamate that excited the rostral Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons. The combination of synchronization and unified excitation of Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons resulted in robust excitation of GnRH neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Frequency and duration-dependent activation of a slow EPSP in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons</title><p>To investigate the firing properties of Kiss1 neurons necessary for peptide release, we did whole-cell recordings of photostimulated ARH and AVPV/PeN Kiss1 neurons expressing ChR2:YFP in slices obtained from OVX females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A–D</xref>). These neurons were confirmed to express Kiss1 mRNA based on scRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). High fidelity responses to light (470 nm) were measured as evoked inward currents in voltage clamp (V<sub>hold</sub> = -60 mV) or depolarizations in current clamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). A 10-s photostimulation at 1 or 5 Hz had no lasting effect on Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neuron activity; however, with 10 Hz stimulation there was a prominent depolarization of ~10 mV that peaked about a minute later, and it was accompanied by a train of action potentials during that time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We also varied the duration of photostimulation at 20 Hz, which revealed that 1 s was ineffective but with 5 or 10 s of stimulation there was again a prominent depolarization accompanied by a barrage of action potentials that continued for about a minute after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).The results from varying frequency and/or duration of photostimulation revealed that a maximum depolarization of 22 ± 1.4 mV was obtained with a 10 s stimulation at 20 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). We refer to this depolarization as a slow excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). To determine whether the slow EPSP is a unique property of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, we also tested the AVPV/PeN population of Kiss1 neurons with 10-s stimulation at 20 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>); these neurons had a transient hyperpolarization after stimulation and a return to continuous firing ~30 s after the stimulation. The depolarization of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons was also distinct from POMC and AgRP/NPY neurons in the ARH, even though they are probably all derived from a common precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sanz et al., 2015</xref>). The relatively quiescent POMC neurons fired action potentials during the 10-s, 20-Hz stimulation and exhibited a prolonged hyperpolarization afterwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>); whereas the spontaneously active AgRP neurons exhibited a brief pause in firing in conjunction with a slight hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Thus, Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons are unique among the neurons tested in the generation of the slow EPSP. Given that the expression of Kiss1, dynorphin, NKB and Tacr3 are all down-regulated in kisspeptin neurons by E2-treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gottsch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Navarro et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ruiz-Pino et al., 2012</xref>), we asked the question whether the slow EPSP would also be reduced by E2 or even vary during the ovulatory cycle. The slow EPSP was induced in slices obtained from diestrous or proestrous animals or OVX females treated with either oil vehicle or E2. The slow EPSP was the most robust in OVX females (13.8 ± 1.6 mV, n= 17), which was to be expected if this current was peptidergic in nature—i.e., correlates with the up-regulation of NKB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Moreover, in vivo E2 treatment resulted in a significant reduction of the slow EPSP amplitude (4.8 ± 1.1 mV, n = 9, p&lt;0.001). Importantly, the slow EPSP was also of greater magnitude in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>neurons from diestrous animals (9.2 ± 1.1 mV, n=14) and significantly reduced in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons from proestrous animals (3.3 ± 0.8 mV, n=15, p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16246.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>High fidelity response to light (470 nm) stimulation of ARH Kiss1 ChR2-expressing neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>B</bold>) Examples of evoked inward currents in voltage-clamp (<bold>A</bold>) and depolarization in current-clamp (<bold>B</bold>) with varied light intensity (33–330 µW).

The slow EPSP was abolished with Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocker TTX treatment but rescued by the addition of K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers, which is physiological evidence for Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> synaptic contacts on Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. Furthermore, the slow EPSP was attenuated by the Tacr3 antagonist SB222,200 and occluded by the Tacr3 agonist senktide pretreatment, demonstrating that the slow EPSP was mediated by the Gq-coupled Tacr3. In addition, the κ-opioid receptor agonist U69,593 markedly attenuated the slow EPSP, whereas the selective κ-antagonist nor-BNI enhanced the ChR2-evoked slow EPSP, indicative of κ-opioid receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition of NKB release. As demonstrated with dual whole-cell recordings, there was a simultaneous activation and recruitment of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons bilaterally to provide a synchronous drive to GnRH neurons. Finally, in horizontal but not the coronal hypothalamic slices, the Tacr3 agonist senktide indirectly excited GnRH neurons, and high-frequency photoactivation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons depolarized/excited GnRH neurons via a multisynaptic pathway that involved glutamatergic excitation of Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons, which excited GnRH neurons via kisspeptin release.</p><p>High-frequency stimulation is required to evoke peptide release as originally demonstrated in the frog ganglion by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jan et al. (1979)</xref> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrigoni and Saper (2014)</xref> for review). Indeed, high-frequency photostimulation of ChR2-expressing Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons elicited postsynaptic responses in neighboring Kiss1 neurons that entrained to stimulation frequencies up to 20 Hz. We observed a slowly developing depolarization over tens of seconds that was unaffected by ionotropic glutamate receptor blockade, but was antagonized by a Tacr3 antagonist. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schöne et al. (2014)</xref> evoked a slow EPSC in tuberomammillary histamine neurons following high-frequency (≥20 Hz) photostimulation of ChR2-expressing orexin neurons that was abrogated by a selective orexin receptor two antagonist. Therefore, in both kisspeptin and histamine neurons there is glutamate-dependent (low-frequency) and peptide-dependent (high-frequency) release that transmit distinct postsynaptic excitatory effects; but in the case of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, it is a recurrent auto-excitation that allows recruitment of neighboring Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons for synchronizing firing.</p><p>Also unique to Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons is that high-frequency stimulation co-released dynorphin, which modulated the NKB-Tacr3 response. Dynorphin is co-localized in the vast majority of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Navarro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lehman et al., 2010a</xref>), and loose-cell attached recordings have shown that dynorphin and κ-opioid receptor agonist U69,593 inhibit the activity of spontaneously firing Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, although it has not been established whether this was a postsynaptic or presynaptic action on excitatory input to Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Croft et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ruka et al., 2013</xref>). In our studies, dynorphin appeared to be co-released with high-frequency stimulation based on the fact that the slow EPSP evoked by high-frequency photostimulation was augmented with κ-opioid receptor antagonism (nor-BNI treatment), and abrogated by the κ-agonist U69,593. Moreover, although the κ-opioid receptor agonist U69,593 directly inhibits Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons via activating G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), we did not see a similar direct response in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. However, the κ-agonist U69,593 did reduce the frequency of miniature EPSCs in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. Therefore, co-released dynorphin most likely acts presynaptically to modulate NKB release. This is analogous to the co-release of dynorphin from vasopressin neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iremonger and Bains, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iremonger et al., 2011</xref>) in which it is co-packaged in the same dense core vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shuster et al., 2000</xref>). However, kisspeptin, NKB and dynorphin are packaged in separate vesicles as documented by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murakawa et al., 2015</xref>) so there must be a coordinated co-release of the segregated peptide neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vaaga et al., 2014</xref>) from Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. Once released, dynorphin can inhibit synaptic vesicle mobilization/release via inhibiting presynaptic calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rusin et al., 1997</xref>), activating K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simmons and Chavkin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vaughan and Christie, 1997</xref>) or directly inhibiting the presynaptic release machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iremonger and Bains, 2009</xref>). Presently, we do not know which one of the three mechanisms mediates the κ-opioid receptor-mediated actions on the presynaptic Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> terminals, but it is clear that co-released dynorphin feeds back to modulate NKB release.</p><p>It is known that nerve fibers expressing kisspeptin or co-expressing kisspeptin and NKB are localized in the internal zone of the median eminence in mice and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clarkson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">True et al., 2010</xref>), and a recent report has shown that simultaneous activation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons with optogenetic stimulation generates LH release in vivo, which is thought to be via kisspeptin-mediated depolarization of GnRH nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, morphological tract-tracing studies have shown that ARH NKB neurons, some of which are presumed to be Kiss1 neurons, are bilaterally interconnected, and NKB axons cross in the internal zone of the median eminence and project to the contralateral ARH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krajewski et al., 2010</xref>). However, a direct synaptic connection between Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons has not been demonstrated. Herein, we show that ChR2:mCherry-labeled fibers cross over to the opposite side, and both a fast EPSC and a slow synaptic response (slow EPSP) were evoked with low- and high-frequency photostimulation, respectively, in the contralateral Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. In fact, dual patch recording revealed simultaneous activation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. Importantly, the contralateral Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons did not exhibit a direct ChR2 response thus confirming the confocal analysis that only ChR2 expressing fibers (axons) and control YFP expressing cell bodies were detected on the contralateral side of the ARH. Moreover, the slow EPSP was blocked by Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocker TTX and rescued with the addition of K<sup>+</sup> blockers, which allowed robust depolarization of nerve terminals with photoactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cousin and Robinson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>), and in our studies release of NKB. Therefore, it appears that Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons are contacted by other Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> nerve terminals, and the activation of the Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>  network is dependent on action potential-driven synaptic release of NKB. Moreover, Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> fibers crossing within the median eminence allow for synaptic communication between the arcuate nuclei for recruiting bilaterally additional Kiss1 neurons to generate a robust excitatory drive to GnRH neurons.</p><p>We used a horizontal slice preparation from Kiss1-Cre-ChR2::GnRH-EGFP mice, which contains both the ARH and AVPV/PeN Kiss1 neurons and preoptic GnRH neurons, to determine if an NKB agonist could excite GnRH neurons via a multi-synaptic pathway. Given that essentially all Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, but not Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> or GnRH neurons, express Tacr3 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Navarro et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Navarro et al., 2015</xref>) and Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons do not respond directly to kisspeptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ducret et al., 2010</xref>), we applied senktide to activate Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and record changes in GnRH cell activity. Senktide induced robust firing in GnRH neurons in horizontal slices that included the Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, but not in coronal slices excluding these neurons. These physiological findings support previous neuroanatomical tract tracing/immunocytochemical studies in mice showing that Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons project to AVPV/PeN (Kiss1) neurons but not to GnRH somata in the preoptic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yip et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, photoactivation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons excited Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons via glutamate, which we have shown generates burst firing in these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), and transsynaptically depolarized and excited GnRH neurons via kisspeptin activation of GPR54 and the opening of TRPC channels in a horizontal slice preparation that preserved all of the interconnections. These results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>. Therefore, our findings provide the first evidence that Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons can synchronize via NKB/Dyn auto-excitation/inhibition to provide an excitatory drive (via Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons) to GnRH neurons for stimulating GnRH neuronal activity and subsequent GnRH release. This does not preclude the fact that Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons also project to the median eminence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">True et al., 2010</xref>) and may stimulate pulsatile release of GnRH in the ovariectomized state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yip et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons probably play a dual role of driving pulsatile (episodic) secretion of GnRH through kisspeptin release into the external zone of the median eminence, but also excite Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons via glutamate release to help generate the preovulatory surge of GnRH through a robust di-synaptic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). What is intriguing is the possibility that the differential release of amino acid and peptide neurotransmitters (segregated co-transmission) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vaaga et al., 2014</xref>) occurs at these different release sites (ARH, median eminence, and AVPV/PeN) to coordinate reproductive function.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16246.014</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Proposed model by which activation of Kiss1 neurons governs GnRH neuronal excitability.</title><p>High-frequency photostimulation of Kiss1 neurons in the ARH releases NKB that depolarizes and recruits other Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. Dynorphin is co-released and acts presynaptically to modulate (inhibit) the release of NKB. Together the two peptides govern the synchronous activity of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and promote kisspeptin release that stimulates GnRH release in the median eminence (ME). Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons also communicate with the Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons via the fast neurotransmitter glutamate, which stimulates burst-firing of Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons. Activation of these rostral Kiss1 neurons releases kisspeptin to robustly excite GnRH neurons via activation of the GPR54 signaling cascade, thereby stimulating the release of GnRH at the time of the preovulatory surge.

ARH injection coordinates were anteroposterior (AP): −1.20 mm, mediolateral (ML): ± 0.30 mm, dorsoventral (DL): −5.80 mm (surface of brain z = 0.0 mm); AVPV injection coordinates were AP: 0.53 mm, ML: ± 0.30 mm, DL: −4.70 and −5.10 mm (surface of brain z = 0.0 mm); 500 nl of the AAV (2.0 x 10<sup>12</sup> particles/ml) was injected (100 nl/min) into each position, left in place for 10 min post-injection, then the pipette was slowly removed from the brain. The skin incision was closed using skin adhesive, and each mouse received analgesia (Rimadyl; 4 mg/kg) for two days post-operation.</p><p>It should be noted that the fluorescence intensity of YFP in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons following viral injections or as a result of Kiss1-CreGFP::Ai32 cross masked the weaker GFP signal in Kiss1-CreGFP neurons, i.e. no weak GFP cells were observed but only intensely labeled YFP cells. Therefore, in initial experiments these ARH YFP cells were dispersed and harvested, or harvested in the slice following whole cell recording and subsequently subjected to single cell (sc)RT-PCR (see below). In all instances, the ARH YFP cells were found to express Kiss1 mRNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Experimental design</title><p>Females were used with gonads intact or were subjected to ovariectomy (OVX). It is well known that OVX animals exhibit increased GnRH and LH pulsatile secretion that coincide with increased expression of neuropeptides (including kisspeptin, neurokinin B and dynorphin) in ARH Kiss1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caraty et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dellovade and Merchenthaler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gottsch et al., 2009</xref>). Since we were interested in determining the cellular mechanism by which ARH Kiss1 neurons synchronize to induce pulsatile GnRH and LH secretion, as well as determining the stimulus needed for peptide release, we primarily used OVX females for these experiments. However, we also used intact females at different stages of the estrous cycle in order to compare the magnitude of the high-frequency response from these animals to the response in OVX females (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). For studies involving AVPV/PeN Kiss1 neurons and GnRH neurons, we used OVX females treated with E2 as a model for the proestrous stage of the cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rønnekleiv et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Gonadectomy</title><p>Seven days prior to each experiment, ovariectomies were performed on female mice under inhalant isofluorane anesthesia. Carprofen (Rimadyl; Pfizer) was given immediately after a surgery at a dose of 4 mg/kg for relief of postoperative pain. Two to three days prior to electrophysiological experiments, OVX females were given oil-vehicle injections or low dose followed by a high dose one day later of 17β-estradiol (s.c.), which produces an LH surge on the experimental day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bosch et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>Female mice were prepared for immunocytochemistry as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roepke et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, two mm coronal hypothalamic blocks were fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected in 20% sucrose solution, frozen at −55ºC, sectioned coronally on a cryostat at 20 μm, and thaw-mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sections were rinsed in PB (0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4; all rinses were in PB for at least 30 min), and then incubated for 24 hr at 4°C in rabbit polyclonal antiserum against mCherry (1:5000–1:10,000; ab167453 Abcam Inc, Cambridge MA). Some sections were also reacted with goat polyclonal antiserum against GFP conjugated to FITC (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_305635">AB_305635</ext-link>) (1:1000; ab6662 Abcam). After rinsing, sections stained for mCherry were incubated in donkey-antirabbit IgG antibody conjugated to Cy3 (1:300; Jackson Immunoresearch). Following a final rinse, slides were coverslipped using vectashield (Vector Laboratories).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Imaging</title><p>Immunocytochemical-stained sections and slices used for recording were acquired and analyzed using confocal microscopy.

Confocal photomicrographs were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 and a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscopes with Zen software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_013672">SCR_013672</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Coronal brain slices (250 µm) containing the ARH or AVPV/PeN from gonadectomized or intact mice were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qiu et al., 2003</xref>). Also in some experiments, angled parahorizontal brain slices were cut as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2011</xref>), and the vibratome blade was positioned to just touch the optic chiasm and a single 400 µm-thick horizontal slice prepared. Whole-cell, patch recordings were performed in voltage clamp and current clamp using an Olympus BX51W1 upright microscope equipped with video-enhanced, infrared-differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) and an Exfo X-Cite 120 Series fluorescence light source. Electrodes were fabricated from borosilicate glass (1.5 mm outer diameter; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) and filled with a normal internal solution (in mM): 128 potassium gluconate, 10 NaCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 11 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 ATP, and 0.25 GTP (pH was adjusted to 7.3–7.4 with 1N KOH, 290–300 mOsm). Pipette resistances ranged from 3–5 MΩ. In whole cell configuration, access resistance was less than 20 MΩ; access resistance was 80% compensated. For optogenetic stimulation, a light-induced response was evoked using a light-emitting diode (LED) 470 nm blue light source controlled by a variable 2A driver (ThorLabs, Newton, NJ) with the light path delivered directly through an Olympus 40 × water-immersion lens. High fidelity response to light (470 nm) stimulation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> ChR2-expressing neurons was observed, and both evoked inward currents (in voltage clamp, V<sub>hold</sub> = −60 mV) or depolarization (in current clamp) were measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Electrophysiological signals were amplified with an Axopatch 200A and digitized with Digidata 1322A (Molecular Devices, Foster City, CA), and the data were analyzed using p-Clamp software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011323">SCR_011323</ext-link>, version 9.2, Molecular Devices). A MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Foster City, CA) was used for the dual patch recording, and the signals were similarly digitized and analyzed. The amplitude of the slow EPSP was measured after low pass filtering in order to eliminate the barrage of action potentials riding on the depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The liquid junction potential was corrected for all data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Single cell RT-PCR</title><p>After electrophysiological recording, the cytosol of recorded arcuate YFP-expressing cells from Kiss1-Cre::Ai32 mice was harvested and used for post-hoc identification of <italic>Kiss1</italic> mRNA.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Since the report by Belchetz et al. (1978), it has been known that the delivery of GnRH1 to the pituitary must be pulsatile to be effective. In the intervening 38 years, there has been no clear answer about how this is generated. The discovery of kisspeptin peptide (Kiss1) led to the hypothesis that these neurons might be a clue to the pulsatile production of GnRH1. The authors provide a clear and balanced view of the progress in understanding (or lack thereof) and used a collection of techniques to suggest a putative microcircuitry underlying the Kiss1/GnRH regulation. In rodents, Kiss 1 neurons are interconnected in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARH) and project GnRH1 terminals in the median eminence. The essential finding is that high frequency photoactivation of Kiss1 neurons in the ARH induced a NKB-mediated slow excitatory postsynaptic potential, causing synchronization of Kiss1 neurons that in turn excites GnRH neurons. The results are interesting and significant because the many optogenetic experiments carried out in peptidergic neurons have not generally revealed peptide release.</p><p>This paper also provides evidence of a possible peptidergic circuit linking the arc KINDY neurons to those in the AVPV. One open question is whether there is evidence here for axonal release as opposed possible somatodendritic release activating autoreceptors to cause release of other additional retrograde messengers. Overall, the reviewers agree that this is a technical tour de force, providing a significant step forwards in understanding the very important reproductive circuit.</p><p>A number of questions need to be addressed in the revision process.

Thus you could have back propagating spikes activating the contralateral neurons and thus release local tachykines to cause the slow EPSP by depolarizing axons of neurons from the other side that express ChR2 and back-propagating spikes cause release of NKB from the dendrites of Kiss-1 cells. This must at least be acknowledged (or alternately, a clear statement made here that there was no mcherry detected in any of the YFP expressing neurons – I am aware that you partially address this in the Methods but it is critical that it be stated here).

The authors state that their results suggest that desensitization was caused by NKB-mediated downregulation of Tacr3 expression. Why not its internalization, its desensitization, etc.?
