Protein disaggregation involves polypeptide extraction from aggregates and its translocation through the central channel of the Hsp104 hexamer. This process relies on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis. Considering that Hsp104 is characterized by low affinity towards ATP and is strongly inhibited by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), we asked how Hsp104 functions at the physiological levels of adenine nucleotides. We demonstrate that physiological levels of ADP highly limit Hsp104 activity. This inhibition, however, is moderated by the Hsp70 chaperone, which allows efficient disaggregation by supporting Hsp104 binding to aggregates but not to non-aggregated, disordered protein substrates. Our results point to an additional level of Hsp104 regulation by Hsp70, which restricts the potentially toxic protein unfolding activity of Hsp104 to the disaggregation process, providing the yeast protein-recovery system with substrate specificity and efficiency in ATP consumption.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15159.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15159.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15159.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Under stressful conditions, such as high temperatures, many proteins lose their proper structure and clump together to form large irregular aggregates. To combat this effect, living organisms exposed to stress produce specialized proteins called chaperones, which can rescue the damaged proteins from aggregates.</p><p>Studies into this “disaggregation” process often use budding yeast as a model organism. The protein-recovery machinery in this yeast is composed of a ring-shaped enzyme called Hsp104, together with a chaperone called Hsp70 and its partner Hsp40. The Hsp104 enzyme converts molecules of ATP into ADP and uses the energy released from the reaction to move, or “translocate”, damaged proteins through its central channel and release them from the aggregates.</p><p>Previous studies had reported that ADP negatively affects Hsp104. Now, Kłosowska et al show that Hsp104 is almost inactive in a test-tube if the concentration of ADP is as high as that found inside a cell. This raises a question: how can Hsp104 efficiently remove proteins from aggregates in cells if the conditions are so unfavorable?</p><p>Using purified proteins, Kłosowska et al. go on to show that Hsp104 is able to tolerate the level of ADP found inside cells thanks to the Hsp70 chaperone. The experiments show that ADP weakens Hsp104’s ability to bind proteins while Hsp70 supports this ability and counteracts the negative effect of ADP. Further experiments demonstrate that Hsp104 is less affected by ADP, and binds more readily to ATP, when it is translocating proteins. These findings explain how the yeast disaggregating machinery can work even at relatively high concentrations of ADP, and reveal a new control mechanism in the disaggregation process.</p><p>Many important proteins have poorly organized fragments that can be recognized by Hsp104, and if Hsp104 was to bind to and translocate these proteins it could harm the cell. The findings of Kłosowska et al. suggest that Hsp70 helps Hsp104 to specifically bind to and act upon proteins in aggregates, while binding to partly unstructured proteins is limited by the high ADP concentration. Further studies are now needed to understand how the protein-recovery machinery can discriminate between aggregated and non-aggregated proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15159.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15159.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>protein disaggregation</kwd><kwd>Hsp104</kwd><kwd>thermotolerance</kwd><kwd>Hsp70</kwd><kwd>protein folding</kwd><kwd>chaperones</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004281</institution-id><institution>Narodowe Centrum Nauki</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013/08/A/NZ1/00683</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liberek</surname><given-names>Krzysztof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0214/DIA/2012/41</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kłosowska</surname><given-names>Agnieszka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hsp70 chaperone provides Hsp104 with high efficiency in disaggregation and specificity towards aggregated substrates at the, otherwise limiting, cellular concentrations of adenine nucleotides.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Molecular chaperones maintain protein homeostasis by supporting protein folding and preventing aggregation. However, during severe stress the capacity of this protective system becomes exhausted due to appearance of excess amounts of misfolded proteins and their aggregation. Once physiological conditions are restored, the aggregation process is reversed by specialized chaperones, disaggregases, capable of reactivation of proteins trapped in aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguado et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doyle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mogk et al., 2015</xref>). In yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> this role is played by the Hsp104 chaperone, essential for development of tolerance to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sanchez and Lindquist, 1990</xref>) and for propagation of prions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chernoff et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Hsp104 is an AAA+ superfamily member (ATPase Associated with various cellular Activities) and its homologs, Hsp104/ClpB proteins, are present in fungi, protozoans, plants and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ammelburg and Frickey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Malinovska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mishra and Grover, 2015</xref>). Hsp104 consists of four domains: the N-terminal domain, two Nucleotide Binding Domains (NBD1 and NBD2) and a coiled coil region protruding from the NBD1, called the M-domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2003</xref>). Hsp104 functions as a hexamer in which the Nucleotide Binding Domains form a double ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carroni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parsell et al., 1994</xref>). Disaggregation is powered by ATP hydrolysis in NBD1 and NBD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schaupp et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wendler et al., 2009</xref>). During disaggregation a polypeptide is disentangled from the aggregate, translocated through the central channel, and enabled to fold into the native structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lum et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tessarz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weibezahn et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Hsp104 alone is insufficient for protein recovery from aggregates. A functional disaggregation machinery is composed of Hsp104 cooperating with the Hsp70 chaperone (Ssa1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) and its cochaperone Hsp40 (Ydj1 and Sis1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glover and Lindquist, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krzewska et al., 2001</xref>). Hsp70 interacts with the M-domain of Hsp104 and facilitates Hsp104-mediated protein renaturation at several stages of the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rosenzweig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schlee et al., 2004</xref>). Firstly, Hsp70 targets Hsp104 to aggregates and stabilizes the Hsp104-aggregate complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acebrón et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Okuda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Winkler et al., 2012</xref>). Secondly, Hsp70 activates Hsp104 by affecting the position of the M-domain against the surface of NBD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haslberger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lipińska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oguchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seyffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sielaff and Tsai, 2010</xref>). Finally, Hsp70 might participate in folding events downstream of Hsp104.</p><p>The M-domain regulates the activity of the disaggregase. M-domains are assembled around the NBD1 ring in the hexamer. Each M-domain interacts with respective NBD1 via a network of ionic bonds and keeps Hsp104/ClpB proteins in a repressed, disaggregation-compromised state. Hsp70 binding to the M-domain causes its reposition, which transits Hsp104/ClpB into a derepressed state, manifested by highly stimulated ATPase and disaggregation activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oguchi et al., 2012</xref>). The latter state is permanent in the so-called derepressed mutants, which are partially independent from Hsp70 in protein disaggregation and display highly elevated ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carroni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jackrel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lipińska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oguchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seyffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sielaff and Tsai, 2010</xref>). The M-domain mediated control of Hsp104 protein is critical for the cell, as the derepressed mutants are toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lipińska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schirmer et al., 2004</xref>). The mechanism coupling the M-domain with the increased Hsp104 activity remains not fully understood.</p><p>Both Nucleotide Binding Domains of Hsp104 possess typical motifs for an AAA+ protein: Walker A, responsible for ATP binding, Walker B, essential for ATP hydrolysis and arginine fingers, necessary for the intersubunit communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schaupp et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schirmer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zeymer et al., 2014</xref>). ATP hydrolysis and translocation of protein substrates through the central channel are in a strict allosteric interdependence: polypeptide processing stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsp104 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tessarz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Woo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamasaki et al., 2015</xref>), while the efficiency of polypeptide binding to Hsp104 is determined by the presence of ATP in NBD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franzmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schaupp et al., 2007</xref>). Changes of the nucleotide states of NBDs are associated with domain rearrangements and movements of peptide binding loops located in the central channel. These conformational changes couple the energy generated during ATP hydrolysis with the protein-threading force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lum et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wendler et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, Hsp104 has low affinity towards ATP and relatively high towards ADP, therefore ADP strongly inhibits ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franzmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glover and Lindquist, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grimminger et al., 2004</xref>). For this reason, studies of Hsp104 activity are usually performed under the conditions optimal for its ATPase activity, including saturating (5–10 mM) concentration of ATP and an ATP regeneration system to avoid ADP accumulation. Under such experimental conditions Hsp104 is a potent ATP-hydrolyzing and protein unfolding machine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desantis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franzmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tessarz et al., 2008</xref>). Yet, these nucleotide concentrations are very different from those observed in the cytosol, with ATP at 2.1–3.4 mM concentration and ADP at 0.5–1.5 mM, depending on the growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canelas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Teusink et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2006</xref>). So far, little has been known about how Hsp104 disaggregase functions under conditions similar to the ones observed in the living cell, where ADP constitutes a significant proportion of adenine nucleotides. Therefore, we addressed the question: how does ADP affect Hsp104 activity?</p><p>Here, we report that ADP compromises ATP hydrolysis, substrate binding and translocation by Hsp104 in the absence of the Hsp70 chaperone. We also demonstrate that protein disaggregation at physiological concentrations of ATP and ADP is only effective due to the Hsp70 assistance. Hsp70 promotes Hsp104 binding to the aggregated protein substrate but does not support processing of non-aggregated proteins. Furthermore, we show that the process of polypeptide threading by Hsp104 facilitates binding of ATP, strongly stimulating the ATPase activity of the disaggregase in the presence of ADP. Based on these findings we propose a new level of regulation of the disaggregase by its chaperone partner Hsp70.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ADP inhibits the ATPase activity and polypeptide processing by Hsp104</title><p>All known Hsp104 activities depend on ATP hydrolysis.

Recent measurements in intact yeast cells show that ATP concentration oscillates around 2.6 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ozalp et al., 2010</xref>), which is an intermediate value of the previously reported ATP levels measured in cell extracts (2.1–3.4 mM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canelas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Teusink et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2006</xref>).

The degree of inhibition showed similar dependence on ATP:ADP ratio for both ATP levels: 2.6 and 10 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). All the above results show that ADP level is a significant factor determining the ATPase activity of Hsp104.</p><p>Considering the strong effect of ADP on Hsp104 ATPase activity we asked how ATP and ADP at the physiological concentrations affect its protein translocation activity. Hsp104 in the absence of the cooperating Hsp70 chaperone is able to bind and translocate proteins which adopt disordered conformation but are not aggregated, such as reduced carboxymethylated lactalbumine (RCMLa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bösl et al., 2005</xref>). We labeled RCMLa with fluorescein (fRCMLa) and employed it to monitor its translocation by Hsp104 in real time. We used Hsp104 variant termed HAP which was modified to interact with the bacterial protease ClpP so that every polypeptide that has been translocated through the central channel of HAP undergoes proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tessarz et al., 2008</xref>). When fRCMLa was incubated with HAP and ClpP at 2.6 mM ATP, we observed a decrease in fluorescence anisotropy, corresponding to fRCMLa degradation and release of short fluorescein-labeled peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We plotted the fRCMLa proteolysis rate against ADP concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). With increasing level of ADP fRCMLa proteolysis by HAP-ClpP slowed down, with a 10-fold reduction of the activity at 1 mM ADP. Thus, under the physiological proportions of adenine nucleotides not only ATP hydrolysis but also translocation of disordered proteins by Hsp104 is impaired. The effect of ADP was similar in an analogous experiments carried out at 10 mM ATP and at different fRCMLa concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), showing that the degree of inhibition depends predominantly on ATP:ADP ratio.</p><p>Next, we asked whether the strong inhibition of substrate processing by Hsp104 was associated with a defect in protein binding. We used an Hsp104 E285Q variant in the binding experiments because a complex between this mutant and the substrate is much more stable compared to the WT Hsp104 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franzmann et al., 2011</xref>). The E285Q mutation in the Walker B motif affects NBD1 in such way that this domain binds ATP but is not able to hydrolyze it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schaupp et al., 2007</xref>). As a result, NBD2 remains the only hydrolytically active domain of Hsp104. We chose Hsp104 E285Q because its ATPase activity was inhibited by ADP to the same degree as of the WT protein, while Hsp104 with an analogous Walker B substitution in NBD2 (E687Q) showed much lower degree of inhibition under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We used fluorescence anisotropy to monitor Hsp104 E285Q interaction with fRCMLa. We added Hsp104 E285Q to fRCMLa at constant 2.6 mM ATP and changing ADP concentrations and recorded an increase in the anisotropy signal over time, reflecting binding of Hsp104 to fRCMLa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We plotted the binding rate against ADP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). At 2.6 mM ATP we observed fast binding of fRCMLa but with increasing ADP the rate of fRCMLa binding decreased, reaching 3% at 1 mM ADP. Addition of an excess of unlabeled RCMLa to the Hsp104 E285Q-fRCMLa complex caused a drop in fluorescence anisotropy, as the fluorescently labeled substrate was released from Hsp104 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>All the above results show that at the physiological concentrations of adenine nucleotides the biochemical activities of Hsp104 such as ATP hydrolysis, substrate binding and translocation through the central channel are very strongly inhibited.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Hsp70 allows Hsp104 to overcome ADP inhibition</title><p>Hsp104 provides thermotolerance in vivo at the physiological concentrations of ATP and ADP, which implies that Hsp104 is active in disaggregation regardless of the disadvantageous nucleotide ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sanchez and Lindquist, 1990</xref>). The recovery of aggregated proteins, however, contrary to the processing of disordered proteins, requires collaboration with the Hsp70-Hsp40 machinery. Therefore, we asked how the physiological concentrations of adenine nucleotides affect protein disaggregation performed by Hsp104 in cooperation with the Hsp70 chaperone. As a substrate we used heat-aggregated GFP, which does not require Hsp70 for folding downstream of Hsp104. We incubated aggregated GFP with Hsp104 in the presence of Hsp70 (Ssa1) and its co-chaperone Hsp40 (Sis1) at constant 2.6 mM ATP and changing ADP concentrations and monitored the recovery of GFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We plotted the initial GFP folding rate against ADP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Strikingly, at 1 mM ADP the rate of disaggregation and refolding of GFP was reduced only by 50%. The inhibitory effect of ADP on protein disaggregation by the Hsp104-Hsp70 bi-chaperone system was therefore much milder than the 90% decrease in the protein translocation activity and the 97% reduction in the substrate binding rate observed for Hsp104 alone under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F</xref>). This shows that Hsp104 response to ADP is different in the processes dependent on and independent from the Hsp70 chaperone.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15159.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Hsp70 allows Hsp104 to overcome ADP inhibition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ADP impact on GFP disaggregation by Hsp104 and the Hsp70 system. Heat-aggregated GFP (0.04 mg ml<sup>-1</sup>) was incubated with Hsp104 (1 μM), Ssa1 (2 μM) and Sis1 (0.4 μM) at 2.6 mM ATP and at the indicated concentrations of ADP.

To verify this, we measured the rate of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of the Hsp70-Hsp40 system (Ssa1, Sis1) and aggregated GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We halved the concentration of Hsp70, an ATP consuming protein, to minimize its contribution to ADP production. Under these conditions the ATPase activity of Hsp104 was less sensitive to ADP, similarly as observed in the GFP disaggregation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). For example, at the ATP:ADP ratio 2.6:1 the rate of ATP hydrolysis was reduced by 50%, whereas for Hsp104 alone the ATPase activity was inhibited by 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Together, these results show that Hsp70 moderates Hsp104 response to ADP.</p><p>One possible explanation is that Hsp70 releases Hsp104 from ADP inhibition because it interacts with and repositions the M-domain, which abrogates Hsp104 repression and results in the elevated ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oguchi et al., 2012</xref>). To test this hypothesis we used a derepressed variant of Hsp104, D484K, in which an ionic interaction between NBD1 and the M-domain is disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lipińska et al., 2013</xref>).

At 2 mM ADP a 5-fold inhibition of HAP D484K activity was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). It is worth noticing, that although the proteolysis rate was much higher for the derepressed D484K variant than for HAP lacking the D484K substitution (HAP WT), a similar degree of inhibition by ADP was observed for both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Our results suggest that the reposition of the M-domain, even though stimulating, does not overcome the ADP-dependent inhibition of the ATPase activity and the protein processing activity of Hsp104.</p><p>Using Hsp104 D484K variant allowed us to analyze reactivation of aggregated proteins independently of Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lipińska et al., 2013</xref>).

Disaggregation of GFP by Hsp104 D484K proceeded efficiently for only approximately 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The analysis of ADP concentration in the disaggregation reaction mixture showed that GFP reactivation stopped when ADP exceeded 2 mM concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Accordingly, addition of 2 mM ADP after the first minute of the reaction stopped GFP reactivation almost immediately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These results show that ADP strongly inhibits disaggregation performed by the derepressed Hsp104 variant in the absence of Hsp70. In agreement with this, when the accumulated ADP was removed from the reaction by an ATP regeneration system, GFP reactivation resumed and proceeded at high rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This shows that the derepressed Hsp104 variant efficiently disaggregate proteins from aggregates on its own, as long as it is not inhibited by ADP.</p><p>Knowing that Hsp70 enables protein reactivation by the WT Hsp104 in the presence of ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we analyzed the influence of Hsp70 on GFP disaggregation by the Hsp104 D484K variant. In the absence of Hsp70, the recovery of GFP fluorescence stopped almost completely after approximately 5 min of disaggregation. When Hsp70-Hsp40 chaperones were added at this time, GFP reactivation resumed and proceeded efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In a similar experiment we monitored ADP concentration during GFP reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Hsp70-Hsp40 chaperones allowed Hsp104 to disaggregate GFP in spite of the accumulation of ADP. The reaction proceeded efficiently even at ADP concentration above 2 mM. These results indicate that the Hsp70 chaperone system makes the disaggregation activity of the derepressed Hsp104 D484K variant substantially less sensitive to ADP.</p><p>Further, we asked if the disaggregation activity of the derepressed Hsp104 D484K variant is additionally stimulated by Hsp70 if the inhibitor, ADP, is removed from the reaction. To address this, we compared renaturation of GFP by Hsp104 D484K performed with and without the Hsp70 system and an ATP regeneration system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). When ADP accumulated, Hsp104 D484K was an efficient disaggregase only when its Hsp70 partner was present. However, when ADP was being removed, Hsp104 D484K alone was highly effective in disaggregation and addition of Hsp70 barely stimulated its activity. This indicates that Hsp104 D484K is susceptible to strong inhibition by ADP and only in this context the derepressed disaggregase is Hsp70-dependent.</p><p>Our results show that the release of the M-domain mediated Hsp104 repression is insufficient for Hsp104 to tolerate ADP.

Under the physiological ATP and ADP concentrations, the excess of RCMLa stimulated Hsp104 ATPase activity three times more efficiently as compared to the reaction where no ADP was added. This difference was over two times more pronounced for the derepressed Hsp104 D484K variant. Since ADP competes with ATP for binding to Hsp104, the observed effects suggest that protein translocation could affect Hsp104 affinity towards nucleotides. To verify it, we measured the ATPase activity of Hsp104 at varying ATP concentrations either at the saturating concentration of RCMLa or in the absence of RCMLa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This experimental setup allowed us to compare Hsp104 affinities towards ATP in the presence and absence of the translocated substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In the presence of RCMLa, the <italic>apparent K<sub>M</sub></italic> decreased five times, implying that polypeptide translocation highly increases Hsp104 affinity towards ATP. Together, these results show that translocation of the polypeptides through the Hsp104 central channel facilitates ATP binding to Hsp104 and allows to overcome the ADP-dependent inhibition of its ATPase activity.</p><p>Summarized, our results show that Hsp70 allows Hsp104 to overcome the strong inhibitory effect of ADP on Hsp104 disaggregation activity. While ADP negatively affects binding of the protein substrates, Hsp70 substantially increases Hsp104 affinity towards aggregated proteins. At the same time, Hsp70 does not promote processing of disordered, non-aggregated proteins. As a consequence, at the physiological concentrations of adenine nucleotides and in the presence of the Hsp70 chaperone renaturation of aggregated proteins by Hsp104 is efficient but binding and translocation of non-aggregated proteins is strongly inhibited by ADP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work we investigated in vitro Hsp104 functioning at physiological ATP and ADP concentrations. Under such conditions the activities displayed by Hsp104 alone, including ATP hydrolysis as well as binding and translocation of substrate proteins, are highly limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Protein translocation through the central channel is initiated only when Hsp70 specifically recruits Hsp104 for disaggregation by facilitating its interaction with the aggregate. Translocation of the polypeptide substrate leads to the release of ADP inhibition. The release is due to a several-fold increase in Hsp104 affinity towards ATP. Consequently, the process of polypeptide threading highly stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsp104 at non-saturating concentration of ATP and in the presence of the competitive inhibitor, ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

According to the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canelas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Teusink et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2006</xref>), the cellular level of ATP (2.1–3.4 mM) is below saturation for Hsp104 (~10 mM). Furthermore, depending on growth conditions, residual ADP can constitute a significant fraction of adenine nucleotides in the cytosol (up to 1.5 mM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canelas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Larsson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Osorio et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ozalp et al., 2010</xref>). The conditions in yeast cytoplasm are therefore far from optimal for the biochemical activity of the disaggregase. In this work we measured the ATPase and the protein-processing activity of Hsp104 under a broad range ADP concentrations, establishing the relation between the degree of inhibition and ATP:ADP ratio. The highest ATP:ADP ratio reported for yeast cells is 7:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Theobald et al., 1997</xref>). Even at slightly higher ATP:ADP ratio 10:1 the activity displayed by Hsp104 alone was highly reduced (by over 50%) and under the intermediate physiological ATP:ADP ratio 2.6:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canelas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ozalp et al., 2010</xref>) it was almost completely abolished (inhibited by 90% or more). In contrast, the disaggregation activity of Hsp104 in the presence of Hsp70 at the ATP:ADP ratio 10:1 was reduced by less than 10% and at 2.6:1 - to 50%. 90% degree of inhibition occured below the ATP:ADP ratio 1.3:1, while the lowest proportion of ATP to ADP reported in yeast is 1.4:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hynne et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, inhibition by ADP and the counteracting effect of Hsp70 regulate Hsp104 activity across a whole range of physiological proportions between ATP and ADP.</p><p>The mechanism of ADP inhibition of Hsp104 can be explained in the light of the previous studies, which show that ADP predominantly occupies the NBD2 domain. It was proposed that ADP release from NBD2 could be a rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franzmann et al., 2011</xref>). Agreeably, we observed that ADP strongly inhibits the ATPase activity in NBD2 in the Hsp104 E285Q variant and exerts much milder effect on ATP hydrolysis by Hsp104 E687Q variant, in which NBD1 is the only active ATPase domain. This shows that ADP inhibits Hsp104 by affecting its NBD2.</p><p>Interestingly, WT Hsp104, in which both NBDs are functional, responds to ADP similarly as the Hsp104 E285Q variant, in which only the NBD2 domain is hydrolytically active. This suggests that in the WT protein the difficulties in ADP release from NBD2 prevent ATP hydrolysis also in NBD1. It has been established before that when ADP occupies NBD2, NBD1 is mostly in the nucleotide-free state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franzmann et al., 2011</xref>). It has also been reported that the absence of nucleotide in NBD1 affects the ATPase activity of the neighbouring NBDs and interrupts protein binding to Hsp104 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schaupp et al., 2007</xref>). This could explain how the inhibitory effect of ADP on NBD2 is allosterically transmitted between all the ATPase domains within the hexamer.</p><p>Results presented in this work imply an existence of two Hsp104 functional modes, depending on substrate translocation through the central channel: ADP-inhibited and active. In the ADP-inhibited mode both the ATPase activity and polypeptide binding are severely impaired and the protein substrate cannot undergo translocation through Hsp104. In the active mode the presence of the polypeptide in the central channel facilitates ATP binding, and most likely accelerates the rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle: ADP release. These findings shed new light on how unfolded substrates stimulate ATP hydrolysis by Hsp104, however to fully understand the underlying mechanism detailed structural data collected in the presence of a substrate would be required.</p><p>Our data suggest that transition from ADP-inhibited into the active mode occurs upon a successful interaction with a substrate. Although substrate binding is allowed in the presence of ADP, the probability of this event decreases with the increasing proportion of ADP to ATP. It requires high level of protein substrate to compensate for this effect. This underlines the importance of the upstream role of Hsp70 in disaggregation, which involves initial aggregate remodeling and promoting of interaction between Hsp104 and the aggregate. Due to these activities of Hsp70, Hsp104 can bind aggregated substrates, which are at low concentration.</p><p>Curiously, the upstream role of Hsp70 is limited to aggregates. Hsp70 does not support binding of non-aggregated protein substrates, allowing Hsp104 activation only at the face of an aggregate. Thus, by specifically targeting Hsp104 towards aggregates, Hsp70 provides another level of control of the disaggregase.</p><p>The proposed regulatory mechanism works in addition to the activation of Hsp104 associated with Hsp70-dependent reposition of the M-domain, since the latter effect is not enough to overcome ADP inhibition. This is suggested by the observations that both the wild type Hsp104 and the derepressed D484K mutant of the M-domain are strongly affected by ADP and, in both cases, Hsp70 enables the Hsp104 variants to efficiently disaggregate proteins in the presence of the inhibitor. It needs to be kept in mind, however, that the two roles of Hsp70 are probably interdependent, as stimulation of the ATPase activity via the M-domain might favor formation of the complex between Hsp104 and an aggregate.</p><p>Interestingly, in the absence of Hsp70 addition of an efficient ATP regeneration system is enough to unleash the disaggregating potential of the derepressed Hsp104 D484K. Thus, when Hsp104 is not subjected to the repression by the M-domain, it depends on the Hsp70 chaperone partner exclusively in the context of the release of ADP inhibition.</p><p>The restrictive effect of ADP may play an important role in proper and efficient Hsp104 functioning in the cell. Firstly, inhibition of ATP hydrolysis decreases energy dispersing by Hsp104. Secondly, Hsp104 inhibition by ADP prevents a potentially harmful activity of the disaggregase. Such is manifested upon expression of derepressed Hsp104 variants in yeast, which causes disruption of cytoskeleton and inhibits cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lipińska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schirmer et al., 2004</xref>). This shows that the protein unfolding activity of Hsp104, although highly advantageous under stress conditions, needs to be under strict control, as instead of aggregates it can turn against other protein targets.</p><p>Notably, in our in vitro experiments, Hsp70 chaperone supports Hsp104 in processing of aggregates, but not of the model disordered protein substrates. The observation that Hsp70 inhibits both fRCMLa and α-casein proteolysis by the HAP variant of Hsp104 (and ClpP), implies that competition between the chaperones for their binding sites on the unfolded substrates may occur. This points to a plausible shielding role of Hsp70, protecting non-aggregated, intrinsically disordered proteins against the protein-threading activity of Hsp104.</p><p>Translocation of the disordered substrates by HAP WT was at very low level at the physiological concentrations of adenine nucleotides in the presence of Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In comparison, the derepressed HAP D484K variant was still highly active under the same conditions, even upon inhibition by ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). The high disaggregation activity of the derepressed Hsp104 comes at the price of high and unspecific protein unfolding activity, which might be responsible for the toxic effects of Hsp104 D484K in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lipińska et al., 2013</xref>). Meanwhile, the M-domain mediated repression, inhibition by ADP and, supposedly, competition by Hsp70 for binding sites on the partially disordered proteins ensures that the Hsp104 WT is tuned down to the level that is safe for the cell.</p><p>Due to its remarkable ability to dissolve protein aggregates related to stress, aging, as well as to neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Erjavec et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jackrel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Torrente et al., 2016</xref>), Hsp104 and especially its derepressed variants have been the subject of intense search for their potential therapeutic application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castellano et al., 2015</xref>). Our studies show that any plans for application of these protein remodeling machines in the novel environment should involve evaluation of ATP and ADP concentrations, which determine Hsp104 activity.</p><p>The knowledge of ADP influence on Hsp104 is also important for interpretation of in vitro experiments. As observed during fRCMLa proteolysis by HAP or GFP disaggregation by Hsp104 D484K, accumulating ADP inhibited the reaction before the total pool of the protein substrate has been processed. This affected the renaturation yield, a parameter that should not therefore be used to evaluate Hsp104 activity. Furthermore, the kinetics of the reaction is strongly influenced by the efficiency of different ATP regeneration systems.</p><p>In the light of Hsp104 dependence on adenine nucleotides, we integrate the established facts and reveal novel aspects of the complex interplay between the processes driving Hsp104-dependent disaggregation: the ATPase cycle, protein translocation trough the central channel, Hsp104 derepression trough the M-domain and the upstream action of Hsp70. The mechanism which emerges from our work implies that, in combination with the restrictive cellular ATP and ADP concentrations, Hsp70 provides an additional level of Hsp104 control, effectively limiting the toxic unspecific protein unfolding activity of Hsp104, at the same time supporting efficient recovery of aggregated proteins, the process crucial for cell survival after stress.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Proteins</title><p>Mutations in <italic>HSP104</italic> gene were introduced using QuickChange Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, USA).

Sis1 was used instead of Ydj1 for reactions requiring longer incubation times, due to observed low stability of Ydj1. GFP fluorescence was detected in JASCO FP-8000 Fluorescence Spectrometer or a Beckman Coulter DTX880 microplate reader.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by a grant of the Polish National Science Centre (2013/08/A/NZ1/00683).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed your paper and considered each other's comments and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All three reviewers recognized the significance of your findings and the elegance of the model you propose.</p><p>The main critiques to emerge from the review process concern the strength of the correlation you have established between (A) The ability of substrate – introduced by the Hsp70/40 pair – to stimulate ATP binding (and the associated allosteric changes and ATPase activity) and (B) the observed rate of substrate translocation through Hsp104. And the robustness of this correlation across a range of ATP/ADP concentrations. This point is crucial especially given the comments of reviewer three on the two papers cited in reference for the choice of the canonical concentration of ATP and ADP in the yeast cytosol: As the concern regarding the validity of the choice of nucleotide concentration would be mitigated if the aforementioned correlations were documented over a broad range of ATP/ADP concentrations.</p><p>A specific weakness were the differences in conditions under which the ATPase assays and substrate translocation assays were performed</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Expanding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to contain both ATPase rate determinations and disaggregation assays under identical buffer conditions (including the GFP aggregates) and the same range of ADP concentrations would be a valuable element in the study. (Or put differently, redoing the ATPase rate determinations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> under conditions identical to the conditions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.) This would, for example, allow the authors to plot the ATPase rates against the disaggregation rates over a range of ADP concentrations to visualize the interaction of Hsp70/40 with the ADP-inhibition.</p><p>If possible these ADP titrations could be carried out at different ATP concentrations (e.g. 2.6 mM and 10 mM) but we leave this last point to the author's discretion.</p><p>2) HAP-D484K seems less sensitive to ATP/ADP mixtures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) as compared to HAP-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) (compare decrease of fRCLMa anisotropy curves). HAP-D484K in presence of ADP seems as active as HAP-WT in absence of ADP. This conflicts with the statement that hyperactive HAP-D484K is as sensitive as HAP-WT towards ADP inhibition. Processing of fRCLMa by HAP-D484K is almost complete after 5 min incubation; might this be the reason that no inhibition was observed. The authors should clarify this point and revise their Discussion accordingly.</p><p>Discretional points to take account of:</p><p>1) Please provide further information validating your choice of ATP/ADP concentrations in the yeast cytosol addressing the concerns of reviewer 3 in regards to Ytting et al. 2012 and Özalp et al. 2010 as well as the potential role of adenylated kinase in converting ADP to AMP and ATP, as articulated by the comments of reviewer 1.</p><p>2) Binding of RCLMa to Hsp104 is suggested to increase affinity for ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 D/E</xref>), thereby overcoming ADP inhibition in the end (explaining ADP-resistance of Hsp104 in presence of Hsp70, which targets Hsp104 to aggregates). However, ADP is strongly inhibiting RCLMa processing by the HAP variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) at the same time. Since HAP binds and degrades RCLMa (together with ClpP) one would expect resistance towards ADP, which is however not the case. Could the RCLMa concentration used here be too low to affect the affinity of HAP for ATP (as ATPase assays were done under much higher, saturating RCLMa concentrations). Please discuss these issues in an effort to reconcile the divergent findings.</p><p>3) Please review the figure legends with an eye to rendering them interpretable independently of the text. The sophisticated reader should be able to grasp the essence of the paper simply by visiting the figures and figure legends.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper is concerned with the mechanism of protein de-aggregation by the yeast chaperone Hsp104. It sheds light on the dependence of de-aggregation by Hsp104 on the collaboration of an Hsp70-Hsp40 pair. The key findings concern a feature of Hsp104, namely its low affinity for ATP and its susceptibility to inhibition by ADP.</p><p>In what appear to be a series of well done in vitro experiments, the authors confirm the relative inactivity of Hsp104 at (what they claim are) physiological ADP/ATP concentrations and the marked stimulatory activity of the Hsp70-Hsp40 pair at these physiological circumstances. Using a mutant Hsp104 that is frozen in the active allosteric state (normally induced by Hsp70) they go on to show that this stimulatory effect is <italic>not</italic> due to allosteric activation of Hsp104 by Hsp70-Hsp40 but rather by their ability to &quot;feed&quot; substrate proteins to the Hsp104 machine. These last observations are rendered interpretable by the finding that substrate proteins stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp104 and overcome the inhibitory effect of ADP. A final physiological touch is added by the observation that the stimulatory effect of Hsp70-Hsp40 of the reluctant (ADP-inhibited) Hsp104 is limited to aggregated proteins and does not extend to natively disordered protein. The story hangs together well.</p><p>I am not in a position to judge the level of novelty and there is a concern that the central conclusion – that these mechanistic features evolved to entrain Hsp104 to selectively de-aggregate and not to interfere with natively-disordered proteins – rests on too narrow a comparison of model substrates (GFP, fRCMLA). A mutant Hsp104 that is not inhibited by ADP would be extremely useful to test the authors' hypothesis, but I assume one does not exist.</p><p>Finally, despite references to the contrary (duly provided) I am not sure about the relevance of millimolar concentrations of ADP in yeast: I thought ADP gets quickly converted to ATP and AMP by adenylate kinase, an enzyme that is also present in yeast, with the effect that ADP concentration are kept very low.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Hsp104 cooperates with the Hsp70 chaperone system in the reactivation of aggregated proteins. Hsp70 recruits Hsp104 to protein aggregates by interacting with Hsp104 M-domains, thereby liberating Hsp104 ATPase activity from M-domain repression. Derepressed Hsp104 M-domain mutant variants exhibit unleashed ATPase activity and become partially independent from Hsp70. Here, the authors show that physiological ATP/ADP ratios fine-tune Hsp70-Hsp104 cooperation by making Hsp104 activity more dependent on the Hsp70 partner. It is demonstrated that accumulation of ADP strongly poisons Hsp104 ATPase and threading activity in absence of Hsp70. This can be explained by previous findings showing higher affinity of Hsp104 for ADP as compared to ATP. Remarkably, the inhibitory effect of ADP is overcome in presence of Hsp70, ensuring that Hsp104 activity is restricted to Hsp70-coated protein aggregates. The authors provide evidence that substrate binding and translocation increases Hsp104 affinity for ATP, overruling ADP inhibition. The substrate targeting function of Hsp70 is in line with the presented model.</p><p>The presented findings are novel and interesting and provide valuable detailed insights into Hsp104 regulation and the mechanism of protein disaggregation. How exactly ADP inhibition is overcome upon substrate binding remains speculative. The authors suggest that ADP release from Hsp104 NBD2 is triggered upon substrate interaction. Direct evidence for this scenario is missing but is also not considered to be mandatory for acceptance of the manuscript. The following aspects should be addressed in a revised manuscript:</p><p>1) The authors frequently use varying nucleotide concentrations and ATP/ADP ratios. It is advised to perform all analysis (e.g. entire <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) at the physiological ATP/ADP ratio (2,6 mM ATP / 1 mM ADP) allowing for better comparison and strengthening the physiological relevance of the acquired data.</p><p>2) The authors show that the apparent affinity for ATP is reduced in presence of substrate fRCLMa(Figure X). On the other hand, the processing of exactly the same substrate is strongly inhibited by ADP. Can the authors provide a rationale for these seemingly conflicting data? Is the fRCLMa concentration used in the degradation assays simply too low?</p><p>3) A derepressed Hsp104 variant seems less sensitive to ADP inhibition (e.g. efficient processing of fRCLMa in presence of ATP/ADP mixtures: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Is it possible that the conformational state of M-domains (repressed or derepressed) additionally controls nucleotide affinities? The observation is also not in line with the statement that derepressed Hsp104 variants are as sensitive as Hsp104 wild type towards ADP inhibition.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Klosowska, Chamera and Liberek describes a mechanism that restricts the yeast Hsp104 protein unfolding activity and provides substrate specificity by employing the chaperones Hsp70-Hsp40.</p><p>In summary, the authors build on the earlier findings that tight ADP binding inhibits Hsp104 ATPase activity and that ADP levels in the yeast cytoplasm reaches levels as high as 1 mM. Using a reconstituted system the authors show that Hsp104 ATPase and unfolded-protein translocation activities are limited by near physiological levels of ADP (94% and 95% inhibition at 1 mM ADP, respectively). In contrast ADP only inhibits 50% of the Hsp104-mediated disaggregation activity in the presence of Hsp70-Hsp40 at 1 mM ADP. The relative insensitivity of the disaggregation activity to ADP inhibition is explained by increased affinity for ATP during substrate translocation. The authors propose that ADP inhibits Hsp104 in the cell, and that Hsp70-Hsp40 promotes binding of Hsp104 to aggregates resulting in translocation that activates the ATPase activity.</p><p>This manuscript provides a series of elegant in vitro experiments and a simple attractive model that explains how Hsp104 activity is regulated in the cell. The manuscript is well written, easy to understand and addresses an important biological mechanism. A complementary set of in vivo experiments to test the proposed model would make the study more conclusive.</p><p>1) Relevance of Hsp104-regulation by ADP inhibition depends on a specific in vitro 'physiological condition'</p><p>A concern that has to be raised is that the observed regulation of Hsp104 activity does not reflect in vivo behavior of the protein. This concern becomes important in context of this study since the experimental setup contrasts the traditional biochemical approach when studying enzymes by not employing conditions under which Hsp104 displays optimal activity (For Hsp104: high ATP and low ADP). It is under such non-optimal buffer conditions ('physiological condition'; 1 mM ADP and 2.6 mM ATP) that Hsp104 displays the potentially physiologically relevant behavior of activity-assay specific ADP inhibition; lower ADP inhibition of the Hsp70-Hsp40-dependent disaggregation activity than of the substrate-free ATPase and translocation activities. Thus, a concern is that the in vitro assay conditions are not a good proxy for the in vivo conditions and suffer from problems with biological relevance.</p><p>1.1) Literature problem</p><p>The authors refer to Ytting et al. 2012 and Özalp et al. 2010 to argue that the ADP concentration in yeast cells oscillates around 1 mM (row 95). However, Ytting et al. 2012 does not report on ADP levels and Özalp et al. 2010 reports on ATP measurements and calculated ADP levels _assuming_ a total adenine nucleotide pool of 3.6 mM. Thus, the notion that the used nucleotide levels mimic physiological conditions is not well supported by the cited papers.</p><p>1.2) Robustness of the model</p><p>A key question is whether the ADP inhibition of Hsp104 is apparent under various buffer conditions (ADP-ATP ratios and total nucleotide concentration). If the Hsp104 behavior is robust under many different buffer conditions, it is likely to represent a mechanism of physiological importance. If the window of function for their proposed mechanism is narrow, it is likely not of physiological importance. Can the authors experimentally define the window of ADP-ATP ratios and total nucleotide concentrations where their proposed ADP-inhibition mechanism would be functional?</p><p>2) Targeting Hsp104 to aggregated substrates by Hsp70</p><p>The authors propose that Hsp70 not only activates Hsp104 by repositioning the M-domain but also relieves ADP-inhibition by physically linking Hsp104 to translocation competent substrates (for example see paragraph starting at row 364). This important part of their model is readily testable by linking Hsp104 or its M-domain repositioned variant D484K to the aggregates using fusions to dimerization domains (e.g. leucine zippers, interacting charged α-helices, etc.). Their model predicts that merely bringing Hsp104 to the vicinity of aggregates should result in acceleration of disaggregation and ATPase activity in the presence of ADP. Such as direct test of the proposition that Hsp70-independent physical targeting regulates the ADP-inhibited ATPase rates potentially strengthens their model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15159.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Expanding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to contain both ATPase rate determinations and disaggregation assays under identical buffer conditions (including the GFP aggregates) and the same range of ADP concentrations would be a valuable element in the study.

Our results show that during disaggregation performed in the presence of Hsp70 the ATPase activity of Hsp104 was much less sensitive to ADP comparing to the control, where the ATPase activity of Hsp104 alone was assessed in the same buffer and nucleotide concentrations. Additionally, we measured the ATPase activity of Hsp70 (with Hsp40 and GFP aggregates), which allows to estimate the ATPase activity attributed to Hsp104 in the mixture of Hsp104 and Hsp70 proteins.</p><p>The degree of inhibition of the ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and of the disaggregation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) are in good agreement, showing only 40-50% reduction at 2.6 mM ATP and 1 mM ADP, supporting our observation that Hsp70 allows Hsp104 to overcome inhibition by ADP.</p><p><italic>2) HAP-D484K seems less sensitive to ATP/ADP mixtures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) as compared to HAP-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) (compare decrease of fRCLMa anisotropy curves).

Data directly show that addition of ADP substantially inhibits the ability of HAP D484K to translocate fRCMla. The degree of inhibition by ADP is comparable for the derepressed HAP D484K and the repressed HAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). At the same time, the absolute activity is much higher for HAP D484K. This is why upon ADP inhibition the activity of this variant is similar to the non-inhibited HAP.</p><p>These results are consistent with the observed effects of ADP on ATP hydrolysis and on the disaggregation activity displayed by Hsp104 D484K alone. Hsp104 D484K did not show higher affinity towards ATP (in the third paragraph of the aforementioned subsection), its relative inhibition by ADP was similar to the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and Hsp104 D484K was almost inactive in GFP disaggregation without Hsp70 at the ATP:ADP ratio below 5:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3 —figure supplement 3</xref>).

As summarized in the report by Canelas et al., 2008, Biotechnol. Bioeng. 100, 734; added to reference list), the range of the cellular concentrations of ATP is approximately 2.1-3.4 mM and of ADP: 0.5 mM -1.5 mM. We noted that ATP and ADP concentrations assessed in intact cells (Ozalp et al. 2010) (2.6 mM of ATP and 1 mM of ADP) are average values of the range of concentrations presented in the previous reports (Canelas et al., 2008).

In the revised version we included more comprehensive justification (Introduction, sixth paragraph; subsection “ADP inhibits the ATPase activity and polypeptide processing by Hsp104”, second paragraph; Discussion, second paragraph). We also stressed that the actual “physiological ATP/ADP concentrations” vary depending on cell metabolism (subsection “ADP inhibits the ATPase activity and polypeptide processing by Hsp104”). For that reason and according to the reviewers’ and editors’ suggestions, we assessed the degree of Hsp104 inhibition at a broad range of ADP concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, essential revision comment 1). Furthermore, our experiments at different ATP levels (10 mM and 2.6 mM) show similar degree of inhibition for similar ATP:ADP ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, we believe that our experimental conditions allow to estimate the degree of Hsp104 inhibition under the range of ATP/ADP concentrations that occur in yeast cells.</p><p>From the analyses of ADP level in yeast cells we conclude that the rate of ADP conversion to AMP or ATP (by Adenylate Kinase) is low enough to allow for residual ADP level to be at the millimolar range.</p><p><italic>2) Binding of RCLMa to Hsp104 is suggested to increase affinity for ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 D/E</xref>), thereby overcoming ADP inhibition in the end (explaining ADP-resistance of Hsp104 in presence of Hsp70, which targets Hsp104 to aggregates). However, ADP is strongly inhibiting RCLMa processing by the HAP variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) at the same time. Since HAP binds and degrades RCLMa (together with ClpP) one would expect resistance towards ADP, which is however not the case. Could the RCLMa concentration used here be too low to affect the affinity of HAP for ATP (as ATPase assays were done under much higher, saturating RCLMa concentrations). Please discuss these issues in an effort to reconcile the divergent findings.</italic></p><p>In the response to the reviewers’ and editors’ comments we assessed the degree of ADP inhibition of fRCMLa proteolysis by HAP-ClpP at various concentrations of fRCMLa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The results show that the absolute rate of substrate degradation increases with the substrate level, however the relative inhibition by ADP is similar for all the analyzed fRCMLa concentrations.</p><p>This observation be explained by dividing fRCMLa processing by Hsp104 into two phases: protein binding and translocation. Protein binding is highly affected by ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>) and protein translocation is associated with increased affinity to ATP and partial resistance to ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref>). Our result suggests that translocation of one protein substrate has to be finished before another substrate is able to bind to HAP, therefore the ATPase stimulation associated with protein translocation does not promote substrate binding.</p><p>We speculated that with decreasing ATP:ADP ratio the frequency of occurrence of Hsp104 conformations allowing for substrate binding decreases. When binding to Hsp104 is available, increasing fRCMLa concentration increases the probability of its successful binding to Hsp104 (or HAP), resulting in higher observed rate of fRCMLa proteolysis. However, substrate concentration does not seem to affect, how often Hsp104 is in a binding-competent state, the latter being determined by ATP:ADP ratio. This could explain, why the relative effect of ADP is similar regardless of fRCMLa concentration. We have revised our Discussion in this context (sixth paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) Please review the figure legends with an eye to rendering them interpretable independently of the text. The sophisticated reader should be able to grasp the essence of the paper simply by visiting the figures and figure legends.</italic></p><p>To improve the clarity of the presentation of our results, we added experimental scheme in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Also, we changed design of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C, D</xref> to show results obtained under analogous conditions, excluding order of addition experiments. Several corrections were also introduced into Figure legends.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>This paper is concerned with the mechanism of protein de-aggregation by the yeast chaperone Hsp104. It sheds light on the dependence of de-aggregation by Hsp104 on the collaboration of an Hsp70-Hsp40 pair. The key findings concern a feature of Hsp104, namely its low affinity for ATP and its susceptibility to inhibition by ADP.</italic> </p><p> <italic>In what appear to be a series of well done</italic> in vitro <italic>experiments, the authors confirm the relative inactivity of Hsp104 at (what they claim are) physiological ADP/ATP concentrations and the marked stimulatory activity of the Hsp70-Hsp40 pair at these physiological circumstances. Using a mutant Hsp104 that is frozen in the active allosteric state (normally induced by Hsp70) they go on to show that this stimulatory effect is not due to allosteric activation of Hsp104 by Hsp70-Hsp40 but rather by their ability to &quot;feed&quot; substrate proteins to the Hsp104 machine. These last observations are rendered interpretable by the finding that substrate proteins stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp104 and overcome the inhibitory effect of ADP. A final physiological touch is added by the observation that the stimulatory effect of Hsp70-Hsp40 of the reluctant (ADP-inhibited) Hsp104 is limited to aggregated proteins and does not extend to natively disordered protein. The story hangs together well.</italic> </p><p><italic>I am not in a position to judge the level of novelty and there is a concern that the central conclusion – that these mechanistic features evolved to entrain Hsp104 to selectively de-aggregate and not to interfere with natively-disordered proteins – rests on too narrow a comparison of model substrates (GFP, fRCMLA). A mutant Hsp104 that is not inhibited by ADP would be extremely useful to test the authors' hypothesis, but I assume one does not exist.</italic></p><p><italic>Finally, despite references to the contrary (duly provided) I am not sure about the relevance of millimolar concentrations of ADP in yeast: I thought ADP gets quickly converted to ATP and AMP by adenylate kinase, an enzyme that is also present in yeast, with the effect that ADP concentration are kept very low.</italic></p><p>Please see our response to the editors’ discretional point 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Author response table 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>The presented findings are novel and interesting and provide valuable detailed insights into Hsp104 regulation and the mechanism of protein disaggregation. How exactly ADP inhibition is overcome upon substrate binding remains speculative. The authors suggest that ADP release from Hsp104 NBD2 is triggered upon substrate interaction. Direct evidence for this scenario is missing but is also not considered to be mandatory for acceptance of the manuscript. The following aspects should be addressed in a revised manuscript:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors frequently use varying nucleotide concentrations and ATP/ADP ratios. It is advised to perform all analysis (e.g. entire <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) at the physiological ATP/ADP ratio (2,6 mM ATP / 1 mM ADP) allowing for better comparison and strengthening the physiological relevance of the acquired data.</italic></p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we performed analysis of Hsp104 D484K ATPase activity at the physiological ATP (2.6 mM) and ADP (1 mM) concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The degree of inhibition is similar as observed for the WT Hsp104, although the absolute activity was much higher for Hsp104 D484K, which is in agreement with the elevated protein translocation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We also measured ATP hydrolysis by Hsp104 D484K at 10 mM ATP and at increasing concentrations of ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), analogously as for the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We believe that now the results provide good comparison between the activity of Hsp104 WT and its derepressed variant D484K.</p><p>The disaggregation activity of Hsp104 D484K in the absence of Hsp70 was at a very low level and the use of 10 mM concentration of ATP in the reaction mixtures allowed for higher rate of GFP renaturation. The resulting better signal to noise ratio enabled us to detect linear increase in GFP fluorescence even at very low GFP concentrations and assess precisely the <italic>apparent K<sub>M</sub></italic> values shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. At the same time, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B, C, D</xref> were designed to show only qualitative assessment of Hsp104 D484K susceptibility to ADP and the counteracting effect of Hsp70. To make the experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B, C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> comparable, we used 10 mM ATP in all of them.</p><p><italic>2) The authors show that the apparent affinity for ATP is reduced in presence of substrate fRCLMa(Figure X). On the other hand, the processing of exactly the same substrate is strongly inhibited by ADP. Can the authors provide a rationale for these seemingly conflicting data? Is the fRCLMa concentration used in the degradation assays simply too low?</italic></p><p>Please see our response to the editors’ discretional revision point 2.</p><p><italic>3) A derepressed Hsp104 variant seems less sensitive to ADP inhibition (e.g. efficient processing of fRCLMa in presence of ATP/ADP mixtures: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Is it possible that the conformational state of M-domains (repressed or derepressed) additionally controls nucleotide affinities? The observation is also not in line with the statement that derepressed Hsp104 variants are as sensitive as Hsp104 wild type towards ADP inhibition.</italic></p><p>Please see our response to the editors’ essential revision comment 2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>This manuscript provides a series of elegant in vitro experiments and a simple attractive model that explains how Hsp104 activity is regulated in the cell. The manuscript is well written, easy to understand and addresses an important biological mechanism. A complementary set of in vivo experiments to test the proposed model would make the study more conclusive.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Relevance of Hsp104-regulation by ADP inhibition depends on a specific in vitro 'physiological condition'</italic></p><p><italic>A concern that has to be raised is that the observed regulation of Hsp104 activity does not reflect in vivo behavior of the protein. This concern becomes important in context of this study since the experimental setup contrasts the traditional biochemical approach when studying enzymes by not employing conditions under which Hsp104 displays optimal activity (For Hsp104: high ATP and low ADP). It is under such non-optimal buffer conditions ('physiological condition'; 1 mM ADP and 2.6 mM ATP) that Hsp104 displays the potentially physiologically relevant behavior of activity-assay specific ADP inhibition; lower ADP inhibition of the Hsp70-Hsp40-dependent disaggregation activity than of the substrate-free ATPase and translocation activities. Thus, a concern is that the in vitro assay conditions are not a good proxy for the in vivo conditions and suffer from problems with biological relevance.</italic></p><p><italic>1.1) Literature problem</italic></p><p><italic>The authors refer to Ytting et al. 2012 and Özalp et al. 2010 to argue that the ADP concentration in yeast cells oscillates around 1 mM (row 95). However, Ytting et al. 2012 does not report on ADP levels and Özalp et al. 2010 reports on ATP measurements and calculated ADP levels _assuming_ a total adenine nucleotide pool of 3.6 mM. Thus, the notion that the used nucleotide levels mimic physiological conditions is not well supported by the cited papers.</italic></p><p>Please see our response to the editors’ discretional point 1. Reference Ytting et al. (2012) was removed from the manuscript in response to reviewer’s comment.</p><p><italic>1.2) Robustness of the model</italic></p><p><italic>A key question is whether the ADP inhibition of Hsp104 is apparent under various buffer conditions (ADP-ATP ratios and total nucleotide concentration). If the Hsp104 behavior is robust under many different buffer conditions, it is likely to represent a mechanism of physiological importance. If the window of function for their proposed mechanism is narrow, it is likely not of physiological importance. Can the authors experimentally define the window of ADP-ATP ratios and total nucleotide concentrations where their proposed ADP-inhibition mechanism would be functional?</italic></p><p>The revised figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C, D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> allow to compare Hsp104 activities under a broad range of ATP:ADP ratios. If we define a substantial inhibition as a 50% reduction of both the ATPase activity and the protein processing activity, then for Hsp104 alone the ATP:ADP ratio at which substantial inhibition occurs is 10:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B, C, D</xref>). For Hsp104 in the presence of the full disaggregation system (Hsp104-Hsp70-Hsp40) substantial inhibition is observed below ATP:ADP ratio 2.6:1 for the disaggregation activity or at 3.5:1 for the ATPase activity. If we take into consideration a 90% reduction in activity as a very strong inhibition, such effect for Hsp104 alone was observed below ATP:ADP ratio 2.6:1 and for Hsp104 assisted by Hsp70 in disaggregation – below 1.3:1. Thus, the relative Hsp104 activity is maintained above 50% only by the assistance of Hsp70 across ATP:ADP ratios 10:1-2.6:1 and above 10% – across ATP:ADP ratios from 2.6:1 to 1.3:1.</p><p>For comparison, ATP:ADP ratios reported in previous studies and in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>) are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Author response table 1</xref>. Since the reported ATP:ADP ratios in yeast cells range from 1.4:1 to 7.1:1, we conclude that the proposed model is valid across physiological conditions. We have revised our Discussion accordingly (second paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) Targeting Hsp104 to aggregated substrates by Hsp70</italic></p><p><italic>The authors propose that Hsp70 not only activates Hsp104 by repositioning the M-domain but also relieves ADP-inhibition by physically linking Hsp104 to translocation competent substrates (for example see paragraph starting at row 364). This important part of their model is readily testable by linking Hsp104 or its M-domain repositioned variant D484K to the aggregates using fusions to dimerization domains (e.g. leucine zippers, interacting charged α-helices, etc.). Their model predicts that merely bringing Hsp104 to the vicinity of aggregates should result in acceleration of disaggregation and ATPase activity in the presence of ADP. Such as direct test of the proposition that Hsp70-independent physical targeting regulates the ADP-inhibited ATPase rates potentially strengthens their model.</italic></p><p>We agree that it would support our project if a proposed experiment turned out to be successful. However, the approach suggested by reviewer 3 poses some serious technical problems. Firstly, to introduce a dimerization domain in a vicinity of the entrance to the central channel, N-terminal fusion (or close to the N-terminus) would be required. From our experience, fusion tags introduced close to the N-terminus of Hsp104 strongly impair the protein activity and instead C-terminal tags are used (for example: Erjavec, 2007, Coelho 2014). Secondly,if a dimerization domain was fused to a substrate protein prior to aggregation, its structure would be lost under the brutal aggregation conditions. One solution would be to carry out fusion with an unstable protein, which aggregates under conditions at which the dimerization domain is stable. Since the only labile model protein for studying disaggregation is Luciferase (standard aggregation temperature is 48°C), which requires Hsp70 for proper refolding, therefore a new assay system with other model substrate would have to be developed. Other solution would be to crosslink a dimerization domain to a pre-formed aggregate. Unfortunately, the latter approach would result in the dimerization domain placed only at the surface of an aggregate and after disaggregation of the outer layer by Hsp104 the interaction site would be lost. Due to the emerging challenges, testing our model by tethering Hsp104 to aggregates is a substantial project on its own.</p></body></sub-article></article>
