assembly in a living brain are largely unknown. To address this issue, we have developed long-term, continuous, fast and high-resolution imaging of growth cone dynamics from axon growth to synapse formation in cultured Drosophila brains. Using R7 photoreceptor neurons as a model we show that &gt;90% of the growth cone filopodia exhibit fast, stochastic dynamics that persist despite ongoing stepwise layer formation. Correspondingly, R7 growth cones stabilize early and change their final position by passive dislocation. N-Cadherin controls both fast filopodial dynamics and growth cone stabilization. Surprisingly, loss of N-Cadherin causes no primary targeting defects, but destabilizes R7 growth cones to jump between correct and incorrect layers. Hence, growth cone dynamics can influence wiring specificity without a direct role in target recognition and implement simple rules during circuit assembly.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10721.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10721.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10721.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes encode complicated developmental processes, but it is clear that genetic information cannot encode each and every individual connection that forms between the nerve cells in a brain. Instead, the individual cells and nerve endings must make decisions during brain development. Up until now, few examples were known for how these nerve endings move and choose their paths and partners in a living, developing brain.</p><p>The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> provides a useful model to explore the ‘wiring’ of nerve cells in the brain, partly because a fruit fly’s brain develops within a few days. However, most previous studies have relied on identifying mutant flies with disrupted brain wiring and studying them using still images. Now, Özel et al. have developed a new imaging method that has enough resolution and speed over sufficiently long periods to track the growing nerve endings in a developing fly brain. The method was applied to a model nerve cell in the fly’s visual system. This revealed that most of this nerve’s dynamic changes are short-lived and random, and appear to help to stabilize the developing nerve ending, rather than guide it to a target. Özel et al. also found that a protein called N-Cadherin, previously thought to be required for the targeting of developing nerve endings, actually plays a role in their stabilization.</p><p>These findings uncover the roles of changes in nerve endings during long-term brain development; this was previously largely unknown for any organism. The next stage in this research will involve further analyses of both wild type and mutant flies to try and work out general principles about how the brain develops via the decoding of genetic information.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10721.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10721.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>live Imaging</kwd><kwd>growth cone</kwd><kwd>filopodial dynamics</kwd><kwd>synapse formation</kwd><kwd>brain development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY018884</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hiesinger</surname><given-names>P Robin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Freie Universität Berlin</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hiesinger</surname><given-names>P Robin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Leuven</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hassan</surname><given-names>Bassem A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004727</institution-id><institution>Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hassan</surname><given-names>Bassem A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hassan</surname><given-names>Bassem A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Marie Curie program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hassan</surname><given-names>Bassem A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Long-term live imaging in intact developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> brains reveals a role for N-Cadherin-mediated fast filopodial dynamics and growth cone stabilization during neural circuit assembly.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Live dynamics data in intact nervous systems are critical to understand developmental processes and mutant phenotypes during the establishment of synaptic connectivity. However, most analyses of molecular perturbation experiments are based on fixed tissue and most live data are obtained in cell culture. Dynamics measurements have been difficult to obtain in intact developing brains at the resolution of growth cone filopodia, especially over long developmental time periods, in any organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mason and Erskine, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Langen, et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Growth cone filopodia have been shown to follow guidance cue gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gallo and Letourneau, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zheng, et al., 1996</xref>) and provide physical support for growth cone migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heidemann, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chan and Odde, 2008</xref>). They have also been associated with dendritic spine formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sekino et al., 2007</xref>). However, filopodia may exhibit very different and changing roles during the lifetime of a growth cone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mason and Erskine, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mason and Wang, 1997</xref>). The types and roles of filopodial dynamics that control specific growth cone behaviors during neural circuit assembly in developing brains are largely unknown.</p><p>Amongst genetic model organisms with a complex brain, <italic>Drosophila</italic> provides a unique combination of small size, rapid development and the ability to culture developing eye-brain complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gibbs and Truman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ayaz, et al., 2008</xref>). The fly visual system provides a well-studied model for axon outgrowth, targeting, layer formation, and quantitative synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hadjieconomou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clandinin and Feldheim, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Feller and Sun, 2011)</xref>. The fly’s compound eye is an assembly of ~750 ommatidia. Each ommatidium contains six outer photoreceptors (R1–R6) that terminate in the first optic neuropil, the lamina; the axons of the central photoreceptors R7 and R8 establish a retinotopic array of terminals in two separate layers of the second optic neuropil, the medulla. In particular, the development of the deepest projecting photoreceptor neuron, subtype R7, has been analyzed in great detail from axon outgrowth to layer-specific targeting and synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hadjieconomou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Feller and Sun, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ting, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ting, 2005</xref>). However, to our knowledge, these steps have not yet been shown in the living, developing brain and the underlying types and roles of growth cone dynamics are unknown.</p><p>We have recently performed a slow time-lapse intravital imaging study of photoreceptor R1-R6 growth cone dynamics in intact pupae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Langen et al., 2015</xref>). However, intravital imaging has reduced resolution in deeper brain regions and is limited to early pupal stages. Previous imaging in cultured brains established high-resolution imaging in short developmental time windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Medioni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zschätzsch, et al., 2014)</xref>and over long periods at low resolution and with slow time lapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rabinovich et al., 2015</xref>), thus preventing in depth analysis of the role of filopodial dynamics during an entire neural circuit assembly process. Here we present the development of an ex vivo imaging method for <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye-brain development using 2-photon microscopy that allows widely applicable continuous, fast, high-resolution 4D live imaging anywhere in the fly brain throughout pupal development.</p><p>We present R7 growth cone imaging at single filopodium resolution for both long periods (up to 24 hr per session) and at high temporal resolution (&lt;1 min), without deleterious effects on normal development. Our measurements show that R7 growth cones do not actively extend after initial target recognition. Concurrently, the vast majority of R7 filopodia are motile and function in growth cone stabilization during layer formation. Loss of the cell adhesion molecule N-Cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ting, 2005</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee, et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nern, et al., 2008</xref>) reduces filopodial dynamics and causes destabilization of R7 growth cones, resulting in active growth cone ‘jumping’ between layers even days after targeting has been concluded in wild type. These findings reveal an unexpected role for growth cone filopodia during layer formation and highlight the importance of assessing subcellular dynamics in relation to long-term neuronal development during brain wiring.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development of ex vivo brain culture in an imaging chamber</title><p>In preparation for fast and high-resolution imaging of growth cone dynamics through different phases of brain development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) we systematically tested and adapted culture methods of developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gibbs and Truman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ayaz, et al., 2008</xref>) in an imaging chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; detailed description in Online Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Prior to P + 50%, we observed that each R7 growth cone had numerous filopodia that invaded several neighboring columns. During this period R7 growth cones slowly became restricted to their individual columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, lower panel; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Around P + 40% R7 growth cones underwent extensive loss of filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d–e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Initial high filopodial activity coincides with the beginning of layer separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, upper panel) as lamina neuron axons intercalate between R7 and R8 terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ting, 2005</xref>). Afterwards, R7 terminals have significantly fewer and shorter filopodia during the remainder of R7/R8 layer selection (P + 45–55%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, longer filopodia reemerge after P + 55% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c, e</xref>). These are fewer in number per growth cone compared to the early-stage filopodia. In addition, these late-stage filopodia often develop bulbous-like tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, arrows) unlike any of the earlier filopodia. These observations suggest previously undescribed filopodial dynamics that start after P + 55%. During and after this time the R7 terminal undergoes a transition from a morphologically distinct growth cone to an elongated structure with a branched axon shaft, reminiscent of previously observed axonal filopodia in spinal cord culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gallo and Baas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Spillane, et al., 2012</xref>) .However, we only observed filopodia within the medulla neuropil where active layer formation and synapse formation occurs, and not on the main axon leading to the medulla neuropil ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In summary, distinct growth cone structures accompany separate developmental events and suggest different roles of filopodia during columnar restriction, layer separation and synaptogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Imaging at high speed: Most R7 filopodial dynamics are fast, transient and continuous throughout layer formation</title><p>To correlate fast filopodial dynamics with developmental events that are hours apart, we applied an imaging protocol that alternated between slow time-lapse imaging of the overall structure and high-resolution fast time-lapse imaging (every 1 min) for 1 hr periods. We focused on critical periods of three major developmental events: the first stage of layer separation until P + 40%, the separation or R7/R8 terminals in what will become the M3 and M6 medulla layers in the adult, and the onset of synaptogenesis.</p><p>We found distinct signatures of filopodial dynamics for each of these three processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Specifically, at P + 28% (during the first stage of layer separation), many transient filopodia (&lt;8 min lifetime) as well as stable filopodia (lifetime &gt;60 min) are apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b, c</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>).

Transient filopodia constitute more than 90% of all filopodia at P + 28% and more than 70% of all filopodia at P + 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Remarkably, these filopodia exhibit indistinguishable dynamics throughout pupation. We measured no significant changes in their mean lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>), average speed of extension and retraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>), levels of inactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>) and the variance of these measurements (blue traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d–f</xref>). Hence, these dynamics do not correlate with any particular developmental time period or event. Instead, the transient filopodial extensions suggest a continuous function for the even spatial distribution of the columnar and layer structure throughout early developmental stages. The number of transient filopodia reduces increasingly with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) while more cellular processes solidify the adult anatomy.</p><p>In contrast to transient filopodia, stable filopodia exhibit a bimodal distribution. A first type of stable filopodia exists up to P + 35% and then rapidly vanishes before P + 50%. These filopodia are significantly longer than transient filopodia, with some exploring up to two columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b, d</xref>). Surprisingly, their average speed and inactivity (i.e. intervals with no significant extension or retraction) are not significantly different from transient filopodia at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e, f</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This indicates that at early stages some filopodia appear stable only because they are longer. Unlike the earlier stable filopodia, those that emerge after P + 55% exhibit a significantly greater inactivity compared to both the transient filopodia at this stage as well as the filopodia in earlier stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Combined with their peculiar bulbous tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), they define a distinct class of filopodia in both structure and dynamics. The two types of stable filopodia correlate with different developmental subprograms: The first type accompanies columnar stabilization and restriction of the growth cone, while more layers are being formed. In contrast, the second type of stable filopodia emerges after layers are defined and interactions with presumptive synaptic partners commence. The time period around P + 50% where stable filopodia are absent matches precisely the moment when the final R7 and R8 layers are defined.</p><p>In summary, measurements of fast filopodial dynamics reveal that the majority of R7 filopodia are transient and may function during continuous column and layer stabilization; in contrast, distinct classes of stable filopodia may be substrates for the specific types of neurite interactions underlying the developmental events they accompany.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Single growth cone tracking reveals continuous R7 growth cone stabilization during layer formation</title><p>The temporary absence of stable filopodia around P + 50% marks a critical developmental period when the final R7 and R8 layers are determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ting, 2005</xref>).

We used this system to investigate the role of R7 growth cone dynamics during layer formation throughout a 3-day developmental period. Our findings provide new insights into a major role of filopodia during column- and layer-specific growth cone stabilization. In addition, these observations indicate that growth cone dynamics can influence axon terminal targeting without a direct role in specifying the target and more generally may implement simple rules during brain wiring.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ex vivo live imaging of <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain development at the resolution of filopodial dynamics</title><p>Our ex vivo brain development system in a closed imaging chamber allows continuous laser scanning during development for at least 20 hr per session. For longer imaging periods, the system can be modified to a semi-open state with perfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Williamson and Hiesinger, 2010</xref>). However, the ease of the closed chamber outweighed the advantage of longer imaging periods in our hands. Our key goal was to follow subcellular dynamics at the resolution limit of conventional light microscopy with fast enough time-lapse to quantitatively describe subcellular dynamic properties in developing brains over many hr. Important advances in Drosophila ex vivo brain imaging have recently established high-resolution imaging in short developmental time windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Medioni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zschätzsch, et al., 2014)</xref> and over long periods at low resolution and with slow time lapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rabinovich et al., 2015</xref>). We identify phototoxicity and drift as key problems to obtain high spatial and temporal resolution 3D dynamics data over long developmental time periods, for which the imaging system presented here provides a successful approach.</p><p>We have tested our system for developmental processes ranging from L3 brain development (cell migration, data not shown) and throughout pupal development (growth cone dynamics). We further provide the calibration of developmental progress in this culture system under imaging conditions. For example, morphological changes of the eye and ‘lamina rotation’ occur only incompletely outside of the fly’s head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, early layer formation of photoreceptor axonal projections are accelerated with normal outcome; development after P + 40% occurs with identical speed in our ex vivo system and in vivo. These findings indicate that layer and synapse formation are not directly dependent on distal tissue morphogenesis. However, different developmental processes must be calibrated for their ex vivo progress compared to in vivo development in the fly. Based on our quantitative analyses of layer formation in the distal medulla, we anticipate that the developmental progress of more proximal brain regions will be similar to the calibrated optic lobe development.</p><p>We show that conventional 2-photon microscopy can safely be used over long periods with virtually no drift and at high resolution in our imaging chamber when following a simple ‘no bleaching’ rule. In some cases we even observed mild photobleaching (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) without adverse effects on developmental progress.

Understanding the role of growth cone dynamics as part of a longer developmental process requires observation in their normal environment. Growth cone filopodia have traditionally been interpreted as probes that detect guidance cue gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gallo and Letourneau, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zheng, et al., 1996</xref>) or as ‘sticky fingers’ that provide the traction required for growth cone migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heidemann, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chan and Odde, 2008</xref>). Our characterization of the R7 growth cones revealed a different role for the vast majority of its filopodia during layer formation in the distal medulla: Surprisingly, more than 90% of R7 filopodia exhibit apparently stochastic extension/retraction dynamics that do not correlate with any major structural change during layer formation in the distal medulla. Instead, these movements are fast, transient and only slowly reduce over the period of days during brain development, while new neurons innervate and new layers form.</p><p>What is the role of these filopodia? Our imaging data revealed that R7 growth cones do not actively extend after their initial target recognition, in contrast to some of the earlier models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hadjieconomou, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clandinin and Feldheim, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ting and Lee, 2007</xref>). Instead, other axons and dendrites intercalate while R7 growth cones define the most proximal boundary of the distal medulla. Hence, R7 must stably maintain their position while active intercalation of other neurons, e.g. R8 extension, pushes the R7 layer proximally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). This stabilization is consistent with continued filopodial extension/retraction dynamics that are decreasingly required as the final adult column and layer organization solidifies. However, we note that our imaging data do not establish a causal relationship between the observed dynamic behaviors.</p><p>The stabilizing function is reminiscent of zebrafish retinotectal axons which display a broadened structure while resting but are more streamlined during extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaethner and Stuermer, 1992)</xref> . Stabilization through filopodial dynamics is further supported by the observation of ‘jumping’ growth cones in CadN mutants, as discussed below. Finally, we also observed a previously undescribed kind of filopodia that emerge at later stages. These are more stable, appear to coincide with the timing of synaptogenesis and are reminiscent of densities observed in hippocampal cultures using VAMP-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2000</xref>). However, adult R7 synapses are restricted to the main axonal trunk of the R7 terminal and the precise roles of these late, stable filopodia away from the main axonal trunk remain to be investigated.</p><p>Our observation of growth cones from initial arrival through layer formation and finally synaptogenesis reveals a remarkable transitioning of the R7 terminal shape from a more classical growth cone to an elongated structure with branched axon shaft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Filopodia on this extended R7 axon are reminiscent of axonal filopodia observed in spinal cord culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gallo and Baas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Spillane, et al., 2012</xref>), but restricted to the axon shaft inside the medulla neuropil where layer formation and synaptogenesis occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b, c</xref>). Before P + 40%, we only observe filopodia at the axon tips as in classical growth cones. Therefore, we suggest these structures are still growth cones although they appear to use filopodia as a means to stabilize rather than as a substrate for migration. We think that the subsequent transition morphologies could reasonably be interpreted as an extended growth cone or a distinct and short part of the proximal axon that got recruited to new active functions during layer formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The role of N-Cadherin: Stabilizing the targeting decision, rather than making it</title><p>Our findings support a model in which continuous stabilization of R7 growth cones in a column/layer grid depends on the levels of N-Cadherin (CadN). The observation of mistargeted photoreceptor axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2001)</xref> as well as its classical role in axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Matsunaga et al., 1988)</xref> have previously led to the interpretation of CadN as a guidance cue. The interpretation as a part of a specificity code is complicated by the observation that CadN is expressed in all presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons during distal medulla development; however, temporal regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Petrovic and Hummel, 2008</xref>) as well fine-tuning of expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schwabe et al., 2014</xref>) have been proposed as solutions.</p><p>Our live imaging data reveal that CadN-deficient R7 axons have no initial targeting defects and CadN does not function as a target layer-specific cue. Instead, growth cones fail to stabilize and engage in an aberrant process of ‘jumping’ between incorrect and correct layers. Remarkably, CadN-deficient R7 growth cones retain the ability to jump between distal medulla layers for days after their normal targeting should have been concluded and stabilized, presumably through the filopodial dynamics described here. CadN has been shown to localize to the filopodia of R1-6 photoreceptor axons in the lamina neurpil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schwabe et al., 2013</xref>); we speculate that R7 growth cones could use the surface area of their filopodia to form stabilizing adhesions through CadN. Consistent with this interpretation, loss of CadN reduces filopodial extension/retraction dynamics and ‘jumps’ between medulla layers are preceded by a slow, several hours-long filopodial retraction process.</p><p>CadN mediated adhesive interactions were shown to be essential for growth cone migration in primary neuronal cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bard et al., 2008</xref>). We observed decreased filopodial lengths in CadN growth cones, consistent with the longer neurite lengths observed with increased CadN mediated adhesions. While such interactions were previously correlated with growth cone velocity, our observations provide a link to their stability in a different context.</p><p>CadN-mediated adhesion with other medulla cells is required for R7 terminals to end up in the correct layer independent of its signaling function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yonekura et al., 2007</xref>). This finding is consistent with a growth cone stabilization function via interactions with many different medulla cells, independent of the correct synaptic partners. This idea is further consistent with the widespread expression of CadN in many cell types. In sum, our data together with previous observations support a ‘non-guidance cue’ function for CadN in stabilizing the positions and contacts of neurites once the targeting is complete. Indeed, several cell adhesion molecules previously thought to function as guidance cues have recently been shown to exert ‘non-cue’ functions cell-autonomously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Petrovic and Schmucker, 2015)</xref> and through implementing simple developmental rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hassan and Hiesinger, 2015</xref>). Initial R7 targeting to the correct layer could be achieved by other molecules or by a developmental rule such as <italic>'stop at the first target layer encountered past the pioneer R8 axon, and then stabilize'</italic>. It is possible that such a rule could result in the correct initial targeting of R7 and L-cell axons simply by their arrival order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), requiring no layer-specific molecular code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hassan and Hiesinger, 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Genetics</title><p>Pan-photoreceptor labeling was done by GMR-Gal4 expressing the membrane tethered CD4-tdGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Han et al., 2011</xref>).

Even at moderately deep tissue, the laser power required on the confocal system to acquire images with comparable quality to the two-photon system is too high to take advantage of the higher scan speeds for extended periods (data not shown).

We exported the 'length over time data for all of the filopodia of a growth cone to an Excel sheet and performed further analysis with MATLAB.</p><p>We used a custom MATLAB code to calculate the number of extension and retraction events, mean extraction and retraction speeds, mean lengths and lifetimes for each TrackID. Heat maps of lengths versus time for all filopodia in a growth cone were also generated. In those, filopodia were sorted by the angle of their orientation at the time of their initial formation. We did not find any overall, significant difference between the average speeds of extension and retraction on any growth cone; so they were combined to calculate a single average speed for all further analysis. We considered any changes in length less than 0.3 μm between consecutive time points as zero movement or 'static' periods because manual segmentation cannot be precise enough to reliably account for such a small retraction or extension. Average speeds were therefore calculated only from the points that had a change in length greater than 0.3 μm. We used the ratio of static time points to the lifetime of a filopodium to calculate 'inactivity' <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Source code 1</xref>.</p><p>Further analysis, i.e. classification into transient and stable filopodia, statistical analysis, and the generation of graphs were done with GraphPad Prism.

Filopodia number percentages over time in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> were fitted with second order polynomials to generate curves. For inactivity measurements, we generated two different graphs. Due to their short lifetimes, many transient filopodia have zero inactivity by definition; resulting in drastically lower average inactivity for transient filopodia compared to other filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2g–i</xref>). This may unfairly imply an intrinsic difference of dynamics between transient and stable filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2j</xref>). Indeed, when the filopodia with ‘zero inactivity’ are excluded, their average inactivity is statistically identical with the early-stage stable filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2k</xref>).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor), Christine Holt (Reviewing Editor), and three reviewers, one of whom, Carol Mason, has agreed to reveal her identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The three reviewers find that the manuscript describes a very interesting set of data on the development and use of a new method of ex vivo culture and 2-photon confocal imaging for pupal CNS that enables a detailed analysis of neuronal development at subcellular resolution. It has long been known that insect head and compound eye development can proceed in culture and some acute imaging of the windowed or dissected brain has been performed previously (e.g. Medioni et al., 2015; Rabinovich et al., 2015) but the current study takes this simple system to a new and exciting level. The authors use this system in combination with MARCM clones to define the temporal periods and spatial properties of R-cell filopodial dynamics during target acquisition and stabilization in the optic lobes. Through careful comparison between fixed tissue and live imaging, they argue that many, if not most, features of R-cell connectivity are recapitulated in culture. This analysis of wild type genotypes reveals different phases of filopodial exploratory behavior in R cell growth cones. Moreover, analysis of <italic>CadN</italic> mutants also illustrates the value of live imaging, as some aspects of CadN function that have been speculated based on end-point or static analysis can be demonstrated. This is a very clear and well-documented methods paper with significant potential for future applications and for use of molecular markers and antibodies to define cell biological mechanisms underlying these dynamic processes. The reviewers agree that the work is of high quality (the movies are remarkable) and appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there are a few issues that authors should address, most of which are textual.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major question raised by the reviewers was whether the filopodia described as 'growth cone filopodia' are, indeed, growth cone filopodia or whether they are axonal filopodia that emerge from the axon shaft during the phase of synapse formation during target recognition. The authors showed that <italic>CadN</italic> mutant R7 axons lack fast filopodial dynamics to conclude that fast filopodia dynamics are important for stabilization of axons. The conclusion seems to be well supported by the data presented. However, it is not clear whether the authors' claim that they have uncovered an unexpected role of filopodial dynamics in growth cone behavior is completely correct. Growth cone filopodia are thought to mediate axonal growth and guidance. By contrast, dendritic filopodia and axonal (those emanating from the axon shaft, not the terminal growth cone) filopodia seem to play a role in synaptogenesis and branch formation (e.g. work by Gallo and colleagues). A key question to be addressed here then is – are the axonal compartments analyzed in this paper during the target recognition phase of growth truly growth cones? This is of particular concern since the authors precisely showed that at the analyzed stages, R7 axonal terminals do not actively extend. Therefore, these axonal terminals might rather represent the transition from growth cone to an axonal compartment with filopodia involved in the establishment of adhesive-contacts (via CadN) between R7 and its target cells, which eventually will become nascent synapses.</p><p>2) On a related point, the authors do not discuss the possibility that rapid, transient filopodial dynamics reflect a signaling state that is required for synapse stabilization. Could this process provide or reflect the general signaling conditions needed for stability, or does this simply reflect a persistent state of plasticity/receptivity? The authors cannot conclude that the filopodia that they observe are functioning in the stabilization, but can claim a correlation with temporal periods and genotypes.</p><p>3) The last sentence of the Abstract is confusing: &quot;Growth cone dynamics thereby underlie defects previously ascribed to incorrect target recognition&quot;. Do the authors mean that the defects in target recognition previously ascribed to mutations in molecules such as <italic>CadN</italic> or defects in entry/stabilization in the correct target zone can now be explained by defects in the dynamic behaviors of growth cones? Please clarify.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10721.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) A major question raised by the reviewers was whether the filopodia described as 'growth cone filopodia' are, indeed, growth cone filopodia or whether they are axonal filopodia that emerge from the axon shaft during the phase of synapse formation during target recognition.

To clarify our findings on filopodial dynamics during this transition, we now provide an extended analysis of the nature of filopodia observed in our study in comparison to axonal filopodia known from other systems in the Results section 3, including new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>, as well as new corresponding Discussion sections, as outlined below.</p><p>A key advance and core idea of our study is the long-term imaging throughout the developmental phases from layer-specific targeting to synapse formation. As new layers form, the R7 growth cone undergoes shape changes that include a more typical growth cone morphology early on (see P+20-P+30% in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1A</xref>), a bipolar structure with an added density in a newly forming layer (P+50%; red arrow in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1A</xref>), thickening of the axon shaft and formation of extensions in layers where synapse formation occurs (P+60%-80% in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1A</xref>). Before P+40%, we only observe filopodia at the axon tips as in classical growth cones. Therefore, we suggest these structures are still growth cones although they appear to use filopodia as a means to stabilize rather than as a substrate for migration. We think that the subsequent transition morphologies could reasonably be interpreted as an extended growth cone or a distinct and short part of the proximal axon that got recruited to new active functions during layer formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>As rightly suggested in the reviewers’ comment, we find different types of filopodia at the terminal ending and axon shaft, including transiently on the axon in the first medulla layer (red arrow at P+40% in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1A</xref>) and later throughout the medulla neuropil, but not on the axon leading to the medulla (P+60-80%, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). We find these late filopodia more comparable to the axonal filopodia described by the Gallo group (e.g. Spillane et al., 2011 and 2012). However, the axonal filopodia observed in their ex vivo culture of the spinal cord appear to us more regularly spaced along long stretches of axon. In contrast, the filopodia we observed are extending only from specific regions of the axon-growth cone structure within the medulla neuropil, and never on the main axon leading to the neuropil. These filopodia are characteristic for the corresponding developmental processes in these layers, both spatially and temporally, as described in detail throughout the revised manuscript. We now provide a more detailed description of growth cone and filopodial dynamics and the Spillane et al. citations in the Results section 3 and in a separate paragraph in the Discussion section entitled ‘The role of filopodia’.</p><p>Finally, our data are consistent with the idea that CadN-mediated filopodia adhesion with target and other medulla cells is required for development; however, adhesion does not appear to specify contacts of R7 selectively with its target cells that might become nascent synapses, as suggested in the reviewers’ comment. First, CadN is present on numerous non-target cells throughout layer formation (e.g. Nern et al. 2008) and the R7 <italic>CadN</italic> mutant phenotype does not exhibit a selective reduction of specific filopodial contacts that could become nascent synapses, but really only a general slowdown of <italic>all</italic> filopodia throughout the entire layer formation process. The idea that CadN exerts a ‘non guidance cue’ function independent of its actual target is described in more detail in a revised final section of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) On a related point, the authors do not discuss the possibility that rapid, transient filopodial dynamics reflect a signaling state that is required for synapse stabilization. Could this process provide or reflect the general signaling conditions needed for stability, or does this simply reflect a persistent state of plasticity/receptivity? The authors cannot conclude that the filopodia that they observe are functioning in the stabilization, but can claim a correlation with temporal periods and genotypes.</italic> </p><p>The idea that the &gt;90% majority of filopodia that we describe as random and transient extension might implement a certain type of ‘signaling state’ is intriguing. In fact, in a recent paper by our groups on EGF receptor localization and signaling, we have described just such a mechanism for stochastic filopodial dynamics in EGF signaling (Zschaetzsch et al., 2014, <italic>eLife</italic>). However, at this point we cannot distinguish between an active signaling role and a ‘persistent state of plasticity/receptivity’, partly because we have not yet localized specific signaling receptors into the dynamic map. We further think we can rule out that especially the early transient filopodial dynamics play a role in synapse formation as they occur long before layer formation is concluded and synapse formation starts.</p><p>We further fully agree with the reviewers that our evidence for the role of these transient, random filopodial dynamics in stabilization is indeed based on correlation. However, we think the temporal sequence and nature of the live imaging data and collective evidence in wild type and CadN mutants provide a solid basis for our interpretation of the data and for further investigation of the precise implementation of stabilization, incl. possible functions through random filopodial dynamics, e.g. signaling. We now clearly state that‘our imaging data do not reveal a causal relationship between the observed dynamic behaviors’ in the Discussion section ‘The role of filopodia’.</p><p><italic>3) The last sentence of the Abstract is confusing: &quot;Growth cone dynamics thereby underlie defects previously ascribed to incorrect target recognition&quot;. Do the authors mean that the defects in target recognition previously ascribed to mutations in molecules such as</italic> CadN <italic>or defects in entry/stabilization in the correct target zone can now be explained by defects in the dynamic behaviors of growth cones? Please clarify.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity – but yes, this is exactly what we were trying to say. The <italic>CadN</italic> mutant phenotype was previously described as a ‘targeting defect’ based on mistargeted axon termini in fixed preparations. Only live imaging of the dynamics could reveal that the mutant termini did not have a primary targeting defect, but are in fact destabilized after reaching to the correct target. This observation changes the interpretation of the function of CadN: it is clearly not required for targeting per se, but stabilizing what would otherwise be aberrant dynamic movements of the growth cone. In the revised manuscript we have changed the last sentence in the Abstract to: <italic>‘</italic>Hence, growth cone dynamics can influence wiring specificity without a direct role in target recognition and implement simple rules during circuit assembly.’</p></body></sub-article></article>
