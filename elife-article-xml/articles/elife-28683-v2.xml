pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28683.001</object-id><p>Mutualism is of fundamental importance in ecosystems. Which factors help to keep the relationship mutually beneficial and evolutionarily successful is a central question. We addressed this issue for one of the most significant mutualistic interactions on Earth, which associates plants of the leguminosae family and hundreds of nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>)-fixing bacterial species. Here we analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of fixers and non-fixers along the symbiotic process in the <italic>Cupriavidus taiwanensis–Mimosa pudica</italic> system. N<sub>2</sub>-fixing symbionts progressively outcompete isogenic non-fixers within root nodules, where N<sub>2</sub>-fixation occurs, even when they share the same nodule. Numerical simulations, supported by experimental validation, predict that rare fixers will invade a population dominated by non-fixing bacteria during serial nodulation cycles with a probability that is function of initial inoculum, plant population size and nodulation cycle length. Our findings provide insights into the selective forces and ecological factors that may have driven the spread of the N<sub>2</sub>-fixation mutualistic trait.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28683.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Rhizobia are soil bacteria that are able to form a symbiotic relationship with legumes – plants that include peas, beans and lentils. The bacteria move into cells in the roots of the plant and cause new organs called nodules to form. Inside the nodules the bacteria multiply before being released to the soil again. Also while in the nodules, the bacteria receive carbon-containing compounds from the plant. In return many of the bacteria convert (or “fix”) nitrogen from the air into compounds that the plant can use to build molecules such as DNA and proteins. Yet, some of the bacteria are “non-fixers” that provide little or no benefit to the host plant.</p><p>Evidence suggests that legumes select against non-fixer bacteria, though it was not clear when or how this selection process occurs. Daubech, Remigi et al. have now followed the number and viability of two variants of a bacteria species called <italic>Cupriavidus taiwanensis</italic> as they form a symbiotic interaction with <italic>Mimosa pudica</italic>, a member of the pea family. The two types of bacteria differed only by whether or not they were able to fix nitrogen. At first fixers and non-fixers entered nodules and multiplied at equal rates. Later, the fixers progressively outcompeted the non-fixers. Then, around 20 days after the bacteria entered the plant, nodule cells that contained non-fixers degenerated. This indicates that the nodule cells help to control bacterial proliferation based on the benefits they receive in return.</p><p>Further experiments and mathematical modeling also showed that over repeated cycles of root nodule formation, nitrogen fixers can invade a bacterial population dominated by non-fixer bacteria. The likelihood that this invasion will be successful increases as three other factors increase: the proportion of fixer bacteria in the initial population, the number of available plants, and the length of time the bacteria spend in the nodules. This mechanism ensures the maintenance and spread of nitrogen-fixing traits in the bacterial population.</p><p>Improving the processes of biological nitrogen fixation could help to reduce the amount of fertilizers required to grow crops. This in the future could help make agricultural ecosystems more sustainable. The results presented by Daubech, Remigi et al. provide guidelines that could be used to select nitrogen-fixing bacteria on legume crops or on nitrogen-fixing cereals that may be engineered in the future. Further work is now needed to understand in more detail the molecular mechanisms that lead to the death of non-fixer bacteria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>rhizobium</kwd><kwd>symbiosis</kwd><kwd>nitrogen fixation</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-12-ADAP-0014-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marchetti</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name><name><surname>Masson-Boivin</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name><name><surname>Capela</surname><given-names>Delphine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006488</institution-id><institution>Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Daubech</surname><given-names>Benoit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gokhale</surname><given-names>Chaitanya S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-CE20-0011-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marchetti</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name><name><surname>Masson-Boivin</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name><name><surname>Capela</surname><given-names>Delphine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-41</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Daubech</surname><given-names>Benoit</given-names></name><name><surname>Marchetti</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name><name><surname>Pouzet</surname><given-names>Cécile</given-names></name><name><surname>Auriac</surname><given-names>Marie-Christine</given-names></name><name><surname>Masson-Boivin</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name><name><surname>Capela</surname><given-names>Delphine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-IDEX-0002-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Daubech</surname><given-names>Benoit</given-names></name><name><surname>Marchetti</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name><name><surname>Pouzet</surname><given-names>Cécile</given-names></name><name><surname>Auriac</surname><given-names>Marie-Christine</given-names></name><name><surname>Masson-Boivin</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name><name><surname>Capela</surname><given-names>Delphine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experiments and mathematical modelling show that rare nitrogen fixing symbionts invade a population dominated by non-fixing bacteria across plant generations, above a threshold of a combination of ecological factors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The evolutionary dynamics of mutualistic interactions between higher organisms and microbes depends to a large extent on the transmission mode of microbial symbionts. Vertical transmission is expected to promote fitness alignment of obligate symbionts and their partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herre et al., 1999</xref>). In contrast, horizontal transmission generates more complex ecological cycles for facultative symbionts. When going through these cycles, microbes are subjected to several trade-offs regarding host range (specialist vs. generalist) and investment in the mutualism (good or bad cooperator, life in the host vs. outside the host). The large number of possible strategies to maximize fitness, and the ability to segregate in a population of genetically variable partners, often entails conflicts of interests between symbionts and their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bever et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sachs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Porter and Simms, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones et al., 2015</xref>) that may result in the classic Tragedy of the Commons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hardin, 1968</xref>). The emergence and stability of mutualism thus requires that proliferation of symbionts is allowed but restricted to appropriate spaces and times and that beneficial partners are ultimately favored over uncooperative ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vigneron et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Visick and McFall-Ngai, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koch et al., 2014</xref>). The theoretical aspects of the evolution and maintenance of mutualistic interactions have been extensively discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Archetti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akcay, 2015</xref>). Yet experimental assessment is scarce and the impact of ecological factors, such as population size of hosts and symbionts or the duration of the interaction, has been under-explored, although they are an essential component of the evolutionary potential of symbiotic systems.</p><p>Rhizobia, the N<sub>2</sub>-fixing symbionts of legumes, induce the formation of and massively colonize nodules, where intracellular bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen for the benefit of the plant in exchange for photosynthates. When the nodule senesces, nodule bacteria are released to the soil where they can return to free-living lifestyle and/or colonize a new host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thies et al., 1995</xref>). During evolution, symbiosis modules carrying genes essential for the symbiotic process have spread to many different taxa so that extant rhizobia are distributed in hundreds of species in 14 genera of α- and β-proteobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Remigi et al., 2016</xref>). Acquisition of symbiotic genes may not be sufficient to create an effective symbiont and may lead to bacteria exhibiting various levels of symbiotic capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nandasena et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nandasena et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marchetti et al., 2010</xref>) that can be further optimized and maintained under legume selection pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marchetti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marchetti et al., 2014</xref>). It has been established that bacteria better able to form and infect nodules are selected by a partner choice mechanism involving the specific recognition of bacterial molecular signals by plant receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kawaharada et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Radutoiu et al., 2003</xref>). Bacterial features that are recognized by the plant include Nod factors that initiate rhizobial entry and nodule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Perret et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broghammer et al., 2012</xref>), and lipo/exopolysaccharides critical for root infection and bacterial release inside the plant cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kawaharada et al., 2015</xref>), as well as an array of bacterial effectors that refine host specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deakin and Broughton, 2009</xref>). Nitrogen fixation however is uncoupled from nodulation and infection, and legumes can be nodulated and infected by ineffective symbiotic partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gehlot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gourion et al., 2015</xref>). The emergence of mutualism in populations resulting from the transfer of symbiosis modules, and its maintenance over evolutionary timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Werner et al., 2014</xref>) indicates that the cooperative behaviour of the bacterial symbionts is controlled at the infection and/or post-infection levels by one or a combination of mechanisms. Partner choice is the selection of appropriate symbionts at the (pre-) infection stage based on signal recognition while post-infection sanctions rely on the ability to discriminate between low- and high-quality cooperators during an established interaction and to punish or reward them accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kiers and Denison, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frederickson, 2013</xref>). Partner-fidelity feedback (PFF) ensures positive assortment of symbionts during long lasting or repeated interactions in spatially structured environments independently from any recognition process or conditional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sachs et al., 2004</xref>). These different control mechanisms have been proposed to affect the dynamics of mutualistic traits, particularly in the context of the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kiers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oono et al., 2009</xref>). Here we evaluate how selective forces and ecological factors act on the dissemination of the nitrogen fixation mutualistic trait on the <italic>Cupriavidus taiwanensis-Mimosa pudica</italic> mutualistic interaction. Specifically we evaluated the spatio-temporal dynamics of N<sub>2</sub>-fixing and non-fixing bacterial subpopulations to model the spread of the N<sub>2</sub>-fixation trait across plant generations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Evidence for a spatial and temporal control of mutualism in <italic>Mimosa</italic> nodules</title><p>During the symbiotic process, most rhizobia enter the legume root via infection threads that ensure colonization of the forming nodule and ultimately release bacteria into nodule cells where differentiated forms called bacteroids fix nitrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batut et al., 2004</xref>). Although they induce the formation of indeterminate nodules, it is noteworthy that <italic>Cupriavidus taiwanensis</italic> symbionts of <italic>Mimosa</italic> spp. are not terminally differentiated and ca. 20% of bacteroids recovered from nodules, together with bacteria present in infection threads, can resume growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marchetti et al., 2011</xref>). To evaluate the specific fates of mutualists and non mutualists in plants infected by a mixed population, we monitored the fitness of total nodule bacteria over time following co-inoculation of <italic>Mimosa pudica</italic> seedlings with a mixture (1/1 ratio, 10<sup>6</sup> total bacteria/plant) of isogenic N<sub>2</sub>-fixing and non-fixing strains of <italic>C. taiwanensis</italic>. Fix<sup>+</sup> and Fix<sup>-</sup> strains only differed by the presence of the <italic>nifH</italic> gene, encoding the nitrogenase reductase subunit of the nitrogenase enzyme, and of constitutively expressed GFP or mCherry fluorescent genes. For technical reasons (see Materials and methods), nodules were only collected from 14 dpi. Importantly, each nodule was individually analyzed for bacterial fitness by plating, allowing analysis at the nodule and plant individual levels. In these experimental conditions 97% of the nodules were infected by either Fix<sup>+</sup> or Fix<sup>-</sup> bacteria.</p><p>We observed a marked difference in the reproductive fitness of Fix<sup>+</sup> and Fix<sup>-</sup> bacteria from the same plant over time, which significantly differed from 21 days post-infection (dpi) and up to 28 fold on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), perhaps because of plant control mechanisms, including sanctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kiers et al., 2003</xref>) and possibly PFF. A significant difference was also obtained from 28 dpi when analyzing control plants singly-infected with either Fix<sup>+</sup> or Fix<sup>-</sup> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Non-fixers did not proliferate better than fixers even at 14 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) possibly because the metabolic cost paid by bacteria to fix nitrogen in terms of ATP and reducing power is too low to be detected in our experimental conditions, or because plant sanctions/PFF and the metabolic cost of nitrogen fixation equilibrate until sanctions become prominent. The resulting net fitness cost of cooperation, which is the weighted metabolic cost of nitrogen fixation by any form of plant control, thus appeared to be zero or negative, enabling mutualism to spread.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28683.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Kinetics of reproductive fitness of Fix<sup>+</sup> and Fix<sup>-</sup> bacteria in nodules following co-inoculation of <italic>M. pudica</italic>.</title><p><italic>M. pudica</italic> plants were co-inoculated with a mixture of Fix<sup>+</sup> and Fix<sup>-</sup> strains at a 1/1 ratio, using 10<sup>6</sup> (<bold>A</bold>) or 10<sup>10</sup> bacteria/plant (<bold>B</bold>).

Starting with a fixed proportion of Fix<sup>+</sup> bacteria (1% or 0.1%) in the inoculum, we varied the number of inoculated plants from 1 to 100 (or 1 to 1000) and the length of nodulation cycles (time from plant inoculation to nodule bacteria harvesting) from 14 to 49 days, which is shorter than the lifespan of a nodule in nature. We found that larger plant pools and longer cycles progressively reduced extinction probabilities and increased the proportion of Fix<sup>+</sup> in the nodule bacterial population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). For example, the model predicted that using an initial inoculum of 1% Fix<sup>+</sup>, 4 cycles of 42 days with pools of 20 plants were sufficient to yield more than 85% of Fix<sup>+</sup> bacteria in all replicates where Fix<sup>+</sup> populations avoided extinction (89 times out of 100 replicates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Smaller plant pools or shorter cycles all yielded higher probabilities of extinction and decreased proportions of Fix<sup>+</sup> bacteria. An initially lower Fix<sup>+</sup> proportion (0.1%) could be compensated for by a higher plant population size and/or a longer cycle length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). We analyzed in detail the dynamics of Fix<sup>+</sup> subpopulations over 10 cycles in a situation where the cycle length had a major impact on the evolutionary outcome (20 plants) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) and plotted the proportion of Fix<sup>+</sup> bacteria recovered after each cycle, for cycles ranging from 14 to 49 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). We observed that, in the vast majority of cases, the fate of Fix<sup>+</sup> populations is already determined after the first cycle: these populations are either bound to extinction (with a probability indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) or to a gradual increase in frequency that ultimately leads to fixation. This result holds true for all cycle lengths except 14 days, where population dynamics is dominated by drift due to the equivalent fitness of Fix<sup>-</sup> and Fix<sup>+</sup> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A key factor controlling the early bifurcation between extinction and fixation of Fix<sup>+</sup> population is the probability that a Fix<sup>+</sup> bacterium forms a nodule during the first cycle, which depends on both the size of plant pools and the length of nodulation cycles.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28683.022</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Effect of cycle length and plant numbers on the predicted distributions of Fix<sup>+</sup>population sizes.</title><p>Model simulations were performed with an initial proportion of 1% Fix<sup>+</sup> in the bacterial population inoculated to a pool of plants.

Very few nodules are produced on each plant, creating a bottleneck in bacterial population size at each nodulation cycle. Whatever the cycle length, larger numbers of plants per pool increase the likelihood that at least one Fix<sup>+</sup> clone is sampled from the rhizospheric population, giving Fix<sup>+</sup> subpopulations an opportunity to increase in frequency and avoid extinction in the next cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Here we provide conclusive evidence that nitrogen fixation per se, the ultimate trait that turns a parasitic rhizobium-legume association into a mutualistic one, determines the <italic>in planta</italic> spatio-temporal fate of endosymbiotic bacteria. Non-N<sub>2</sub>-fixing symbionts do not persist within cells of indeterminate nodules even when they share a nodule with N<sub>2</sub>-fixing symbionts, indicative of a cell autonomous senescence program as recently shown for determinate nodules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Regus et al., 2017</xref>). This results in the progressive and selective <italic>in planta</italic> expansion of fixers during the symbiotic process.</p><p>The most likely explanation is that the plant exerts a post-infection control of N<sub>2</sub>-fixation that overcomes the metabolic cost of nitrogen fixation paid by mutualistic bacteria. Sanctions could occur as defense responses and/or by decreasing nutrient supply to non-fixing bacteroids. Given that Fix<sup>-</sup> and Fix<sup>+</sup> bacteria are spatially segregated within nodules, the latter case could also result from the local degeneration of nodule cells, and be interpreted as an example of Partner Fidelity-Feedback mechanism occurring at the level of individual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shou, 2015</xref>). Since control mechanisms prevent social dilemma –<italic>i.e.</italic> the possibility that one partner increases its own fitness by decreasing its investment in mutualism- and help cooperation persist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kiers and Denison, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frederickson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sachs et al., 2004</xref>), non-fixers do not threaten mutualism in our system. Yet the fate of strains able to fix intermediate levels of nitrogen fixation may be different. Monitoring the fitness of strains varying in their nitrogen fixation capacity would provide a more complete picture of mutualism control. Nevertheless, our results provide an additional example supporting the emerging idea that low quality rhizobial partners rarely benefit from low investment in mutualism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friesen, 2012</xref>). Plant sanctions resulting in bacterial fitness reduction were demonstrated in some rhizobium-legume systems by simulating N<sub>2</sub> deficiency via gas manipulation around nodules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kiers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oono et al., 2011</xref>), although not seen in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ling et al., 2013</xref>). That different plants may rely on different control mechanisms would not be surprising given the variety of mechanisms that lead to symbiosis with legumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Masson-Boivin et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Experimental investigations can fuel a theoretical framework able to reframe general evolutionary questions in an ecological context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoek et al., 2016</xref>). Our qualitative model of the eco-evolutionary dynamics of mutualistic and non-mutualistic populations includes serial inoculation-nodulation cycles. This regime mimics an experimental set up of horizontal transmission of rhizobia across plant generations albeit on an accelerated basis. A general outcome of the model is that rare fixers will invade a population dominated by non-fixing bacteria, above a threshold combination of plant and bacterial population sizes and cycle lengths. The model helps explore further combinations of number of cycles, cycle lengths and plant pool sizes to hypothesize the evolutionary trajectory of the Fix<sup>+</sup> genotype. While the selective advantage of the Fix<sup>+</sup> phenotype is expected to ensure its fixation in a deterministic manner, strong population bottlenecks occurring at the nodulation step introduce a source of stochasticity in these dynamics and may thus prevent the action of directional selection. The effect of stochasticity has been shown to be of immense evolutionary consequence in related models of host parasite coevolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Papkou et al., 2016</xref>). Another characteristic of our system is that, when the Fix<sup>+</sup> populations increase in abundance then so does their proliferation, leading to a quick increase of Fix<sup>+</sup> over successive nodulation cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). This interaction between the demographic composition of the population and the evolutionary success of one of the traits is an example of the eco-evolutionary feedback present in this system.</p><p>Although the selective and ecological forces at play in the lab and in field conditions may differ significantly, our results predict that both forces have played a major role in the evolution of the rhizobium-legume mutualism by favoring the fixation of emerging N<sub>2</sub>-fixing sub-populations among uncooperative symbiotic populations as well as their evolutionary maintenance. Yet the uncooperative population does not become extinct within nodules, likely because sanctions mainly target bacteroids of the nitrogen fixation zone. Releasing non-fixing bacteria may allow progenitors to meet appropriate hosts or to evolve new symbiotic traits. This loose selection process helps maintain genetically diverse rhizobial communities in the soil and shape the ecology and evolution of rhizobia. More generally, acknowledging the existence of non-cooperators as an integral component of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of mutualistic interactions may provide a better understanding of the long-term persistence of bacterial lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heath and Tiffin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heath and Stinchcombe, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tarnita, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fiegna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammerschmidt et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>An emerging trend in fundamental and applied plant microbiology is to select upon microbes indirectly through the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mueller and Sachs, 2015</xref>).

The model ran on a pool of plants (of given, variable size) from which nodules were collected and mixed together after each inoculation cycle.

Lastly, to allow for some ‘aging’ process that would decrease the rate of nodulation with time (even for plants inoculated only with Fix<sup>-</sup> bacteria), we incorporated a time-decay coefficient: a<sub>2</sub> × (t- a<sub>3</sub>), meaning that a reduction in the rate of nodulation occurred at a rate a<sub>2</sub> when <italic>t</italic> &gt; a<sub>3</sub>. This time-decay factor was set to 0 when t &lt; a<sub>3</sub>. Therefore, the parameter of the Poisson distribution controlling the rate at which new nodules are formed was given by: λ(t, nod<sup>+</sup><sub>t</sub>) = λ<sub>max</sub> - a<sub>1</sub> × nod<sup>+</sup><sub>t</sub> for t &lt; a<sub>3</sub> and by: λ(t, nod<sup>+</sup><sub>t</sub>) = λ<sub>max</sub> - a<sub>1</sub> × nod<sup>+</sup><sub>t</sub> - a<sub>2</sub> × (t- a<sub>3</sub>) for t &gt; a<sub>3</sub>. Since nodules are persistent once formed, we further set: λ(t, nod<sup>+</sup><sub>t</sub>)≥0. Experimental evidence indicated that the number of inoculated bacteria did not affect nodulation kinetics as long as the total inoculum remains above 10<sup>3</sup> bacteria per plant. These conditions were met in all experiments described in this work. Therefore, we did not explicitly take inoculum size into consideration in the simulations, and restricted the applicability of our model to cases where inoculum was above this threshold value.</p><p>The second module of the model dealt with bacterial multiplication within plant nodules. Within each nodule we assumed a logistic growth model for the bacteria given by: X(t + 1) = (r-c –su<sub>ds</sub>(t))×X(t) × (1-X(t)/K), where <italic>r</italic> was the growth rate, <italic>c</italic> the net fitness cost of nitrogen fixation in Fix<sup>+</sup> bacteria, su<sub>ds</sub>(t) the additional plant sanctions against Fix<sup>-</sup> bacteria occurring in the later phase of the interaction, X(t) the bacterial population at time <italic>t</italic> and K the nodule carrying capacity. In our simulations, we set <italic>c</italic> = 0 since we experimentally did not detect any difference in the populations of Fix<sup>-</sup> or Fix<sup>+</sup> nodule bacteria at 14 dpi. We emphasize that a net fitness cost of 0 does not necessarily imply that nitrogen fixation does not impose a metabolic burden on the bacteria (referred to as ‘metabolic cost’ in the results section). Instead, this burden, if significant during the early steps of the interaction, may be compensated for by plant control mechanisms acting at a basal level. Beyond this time point, additional plant sanctions (possibly including partner fidelity-feedback) were given by su<sub>ds</sub>(t), taking the value <italic>s</italic> of plant sanctions indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> as long as the age of the nodule was higher than <italic>ds</italic> days (denoted by the step function u<sub>ds</sub>(t)=0 if t &lt; <italic>ds</italic> or u<sub>ds</sub>(t)=1 if t &gt; <italic>ds</italic>).</p><p>Parameters values were estimated by computing the minimal root mean square error (RMSE) of experimental data (nodulation kinetics and bacterial multiplication within nodules) versus model outputs calculated for a range of parameter values. Parameter values selected to minimize RMSE are indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. Simulations were implemented in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">R Core Team, 2014</xref>) and code is available in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code file 1</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Jacques Batut, Peter Young and Erik Hom for helpful comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Wenying Shou, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. Ian Baldwin oversaw the process as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Maren Friesen (Reviewer #2) and R. Ford Denison (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Baubech et al. examined how legumes deal with rhizobium that does not fix nitrogen. We find parts of the paper very interesting. However, we have problems with your data interpretation, especially when you regard nitrogen fixation as cost-free in your model and in your text. Seems that your results are consistent with partner-fidelity feedback control of non-fixing bacteria (i.e. host cells with fix<sup>-</sup> mutants don't do well, and thus fix<sup>-</sup> mutant do not do well). We encourage you to rethink and rewrite.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>My feelings for this paper are mixed. I like how the authors showed that nitrogen-starved plants had increased nodules over time (presumably until plant's nitrogen need is met). In a single nodule, fix<sup>+</sup> and fix<sup>-</sup> nodule cells are spatially partitioned, and fix<sup>+</sup> increases its frequency over fix<sup>-</sup>. Fix<sup>+</sup> can increase in frequency during several rounds of inoculation/growth, and this increase is faster in longer cycle (as predicted by theoretical work decades ago). However, the paper made quite problematic assertions, which rendered the model and the entire paper problematic.</p><p>Subsection “Evidence for a spatial and temporal control of mutualism in Mimosa nodules”: &quot;Since non-fixers do not proliferate better than fixers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), they are not cheaters in our system following a fitness-based definition of the term &quot;cheater&quot;. This statement (and the thinking behind it, including assuming that nitrogen-fixation has zero cost in modeling) is problematic. You are dealing with a spatially-structured environment. Given the spatial segregation of fix<sup>+</sup> and fix<sup>-</sup> cells to different nodule cells, partner fidelity feedback (see Bull and other's work, which is further extended in https://elifesciences.org/articles/10106) cannot be ruled out. In fact, partner fidelity feedback is likely to operate. In other words, plant cells near fix<sup>-</sup> bacteria do poorly, and thus fix<sup>-</sup> bacteria do poorly as well. If you stand behind your claim that N2-fixation is cost free, then you must back up this extraordinary claim with exceptionally careful experiments. That is, if you were to mix the two types together so that they are well-mixed in a plant-like environment (which is probably difficult to do and not done here), fix<sup>-</sup> cells are more fit or less fit than fix<sup>+</sup> cells?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3: I</xref> understand fix<sup>+</sup> and fix<sup>-</sup> bacteria, but I am confused about fix<sup>+</sup> and fix<sup>-</sup> nodule. What is the definition?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>/C: I am not convinced: there are no data points before dpi 14, and so growth rate cannot be credibly estimated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a significant contribution to the field of rhizobia-legume symbiosis, demonstrating nicely that non-fixing rhizobia are penalized both at the whole nodule level as well as within nodules – a matter of much debate! – and going farther to considering the time-course of this process. The modeling is a nice addition, though not necessarily required for this to be a strong paper. The multigenerational experiments seal the deal, demonstrating that the phenomenon measured within a generation translates to the expected shifts in allele frequencies over time.</p><p>I have only two concerns:</p><p>First, as this is something I worry about a lot in my own work, to what extent does the surface sterilization process penetrate and kill rhizobia within Mimosa nodules? This could have dramatic effects on the rhizobial populations observed in single-strain nodules that vary in size, which typically correlates with fixation status.</p><p>Second, the authors claim in the text that the model fits their experimental data very well, but do not justify this statistically. In fact, looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, the model doesn't appear to fit all that well for particular timepoints and there doesn't seem to be all that much power in rejecting the model, if this was in fact the intent. Some consideration of what the purpose of the model is would be warranted – I think it is a nice conceptual addition that shows qualitatively that cycle length and plant population size impact the evolution of fix<sup>+</sup> from low frequency, but that the quantitative fit is being overstated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper presents some important data, although some of the interpretation is questionable. The important results are:</p><p>1) Host sanctions against a nonfixing rhizobial strain were much more severe than previously reported for other host species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the real world, however, nonfixing nodulating strains like that used in the experiments are rare, relative to less-beneficial strains that fix some nitrogen. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the resources the nifH strain spared by not fixing nitrogen are automatically invested in rhizobial fitness. Therefore, we cannot conclude (subsection “Evidence for a spatial and temporal control of mutualism in Mimosa nodules”) that &quot;low quality rhizobial partners rarely benefit from low investment in mutualism.&quot; (If there were a consensus on this, as claimed, this paper would merit publication only if it challenged that consensus.) To test that hypothesis would require comparing two nitrogen-fixing strains, with one of them providing less benefit via a mechanism that would plausibly enhance its own fitness. Examples include strains that (once inside nodules) block nodulation by other rhizobia (Tatsukami, 2016) or strains that divert more resources from N2 fixation to their own reproduction. Nonfixing mutants would not qualify.</p><p>2) Sanctions were apparently imposed on a nonfixing strain within mixed nodules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This is arguably the most-important result, so should be featured in the Abstract, along with the &quot;clear sectoring&quot; (subsection “Evidence for a spatial and temporal control of mutualism in Mimosa nodules&quot;) that is presumably key to within-nodule discrimination by the host.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows no partner choice (host-imposed discrimination during the infection process). This is consistent with past work comparing isogenic strains, but the authors should recognize the possibility of adaptive partner choice by some host plants among some real-world strains whose signals are correlated with their relative benefits.</p><p>Given these empirical results, it's obvious that fix<sup>+</sup> rhizobia could invade a fix<sup>-</sup> population under real-world conditions. I don't really see the point to modeling cases with only 20 plants or where plants only live 14 days after rhizobial infection, as either of those would lead to extinction of the host. If the authors want to explore &quot;ecological factors&quot;, as claimed, they should explore some more-realistic factors like temperature or soil nitrogen. What about competition between a strain that fixes half as much nitrogen as another, diverting the resources saved to its own reproduction? That's more realistic than a nonfixing strain. Their relative fitness would depend on how the host's threshold for imposing sanctions and on the extent to which resources diverted from nitrogen fixation actually enhance rhizobial fitness. Until we have those data, modeling is almost pointless. If space in the journal is not an issue, they could keep the modeling work, but the Abstract should be rewritten to be less vague and to highlight the empirical results. One sentence in the Abstract on modeling would be plenty.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your revised article &quot;Spatio-temporal control of mutualism in legumes helps spread symbiotic nitrogen fixation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revision has been evaluated by Ian Baldwin in consultation with a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>Thank you for your revision, but we are returning the revision without further review, because we don't think that you have adequately addressed the concerns about the &quot;costs&quot; that play a central role in your modeling effort (or we were not sufficiently clear in our previous decision letter). In your model, the &quot;cost of nitrogen fixation&quot; being zero strains credulity unless you are very specific about what that these costs mean.</p><p>Hence, we think that you need to be very specific about how these costs are described; otherwise the modelling effort could be criticized as being a tautology. If we understand your arguments correctly, the &quot;post-PFF/post-sanctioning costs&quot; need to be very small or even negative (benefit of cooperation) for cooperation to persist. Hence the text should be revised to say something like &quot;the cost of cooperation is difficult to determine because such determination requires a well-mixed environment to be free of PFF. Regardless, this cost must have been overcome by PFF and/or sanctioning mechanisms. The cost we refer to is post-PFF/post-sanctioning cost of cooperation, which should be zero or negative, otherwise the mutualisms would have failed&quot;.</p><p>We hope that you can address this concern in short order and we look forward to subjecting your revision to a full re-review.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Spatio-temporal control of mutualism in legumes helps spread symbiotic nitrogen fixation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Maren Friesen (Reviewer #2); R. Ford Denison (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Reviewers feel that you have made improvements to the manuscript. There are points that still need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Since their most interesting result was apparent sanctions within mixed nodules, they should cite this just-published paper: http://www.amjbot.org/citmgr?gca=amjbot;ajb.1700165v1</p><p>2) You will need to explain/contrast sanctions and PFF clearly in Intro to give readers sufficient background.</p><p>3) A clarification of &quot;cost&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic></p><p>Cost definitions are key. In the model, the cost is necessarily a fitness cost because it is translating fixation rate into population growth rate (i.e., per capita fitness). This is, as articulated in the response to reviewers’ letter, completely distinct from the actual metabolic cost of nitrogen fixation in terms of ATP and reducing power. I don't see the point is having separate terms for fitness cost of fixation (c) and then the fitness effect of sanctions (s1) since these are tied together in this system anyways. It would be clearer to just have a &quot;net fitness effect&quot; of fixation ability that could just be zero, because the growth rate of the fix<sup>+</sup> and fix<sup>-</sup> is the same early in the interaction. The distinction between early phase vs late-phase seems arbitrary.</p><p>Related to this, when do Mimosa nodules really start fixing nitrogen? Prior to this point one wouldn't expect there to be a difference between fix<sup>+</sup> and fix<sup>-</sup> since the trait isn't expressed. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, it isn't clear whether the first time-point (7d) is significantly different from zero – this would be worth presenting.</p><p>Subsection “Evidence for a spatial and temporal control of mutualism in Mimosa nodules”: Should specify here that you mean the fitness cost; also, the double negative &quot;preventing mutualism to fail&quot;, is confusing and should be revised to &quot;enabling mutualism to spread&quot;.</p><p>It should be clarified which cells are contributing to the population when nodules are crushed and plated – are these a mix of former bacteroids (the ~20% that are supposedly culturable–so what is happening to the other 80%) and cells from the infection threads?

We find parts of the paper very interesting. However, we have problems with your data interpretation, especially when you regard nitrogen fixation as cost-free in your model and in your text. Seems that your results are consistent with partner-fidelity feedback control of non-fixing bacteria (i.e. host cells with fix<sup>-</sup> mutants don't do well, and thus fix<sup>-</sup> mutant do not do well). We encourage you to rethink and rewrite.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>My feelings for this paper are mixed. I like how the authors showed that nitrogen-starved plants had increased nodules over time (presumably until plant's nitrogen need is met). In a single nodule, fix<sup>+</sup> and fix<sup>-</sup> nodule cells are spatially partitioned, and fix<sup>+</sup> increases its frequency over fix<sup>-</sup>. Fix<sup>+</sup> can increase in frequency during several rounds of inoculation/growth, and this increase is faster in longer cycle (as predicted by theoretical work decades ago). However, the paper made quite problematic assertions, which rendered the model and the entire paper problematic.</p><p>Subsection “Evidence for a spatial and temporal control of mutualism in Mimosa nodules”: &quot;Since non-fixers do not proliferate better than fixers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), they are not cheaters in our system following a fitness-based definition of the term &quot;cheater&quot;. This statement (and the thinking behind it, including assuming that nitrogen-fixation has zero cost in modeling) is problematic. You are dealing with a spatially-structured environment. Given the spatial segregation of fix<sup>+</sup> and fix<sup>-</sup> cells to different nodule cells, partner fidelity feedback (see Bull and other's work, which is further extended in https://elifesciences.org/articles/10106) cannot be ruled out. In fact, partner fidelity feedback is likely to operate. In other words, plant cells near fix<sup>-</sup> bacteria do poorly, and thus fix<sup>-</sup> bacteria do poorly as well. If you stand behind your claim that N2-fixation is cost free, then you must back up this extraordinary claim with exceptionally careful experiments. That is, if you were to mix the two types together so that they are well-mixed in a plant-like environment (which is probably difficult to do and not done here), fix<sup>-</sup> cells are more fit or less fit than fix<sup>+</sup> cells?</p></disp-quote><p>First, we need to clarify our use of the terms ‘cheater’ and ‘cost of nitrogen fixation’.</p><p>We employed the term ‘cheater’ in the sense defined by Jones et al., 2015, as we believe that this definition is helpful to think about the evolutionary dynamics of rhizobial populations. This definition states that “cheating must <italic>increase the fitness of the actor above average fitness in the population</italic> and <italic>decrease the fitness of the partner below average fitness in the partner population” (Jones, 2015).</italic> This definition therefore considers ‘cheating outcome’ rather than ‘cheating actions’. <italic>Although we did not measure plant fitness –our analysis is therefore partial in that respect, w</italic>e did not observe a better proliferation of non-fixers over fixers at analyzed time points, and thus non-fixers do not “behave” as “cheaters”. Nevertheless, we acknowledge our sentence could lead to confusion and have modified the sentence (see below).</p><p>In relation to the above definition, we used the term ‘cost of nitrogen fixation’ to quantify the net cost/benefit ratio of mutualism; once more we employed a fitness-based definition instead of focusing on the actual metabolic cost of nitrogen fixation. Because the Fix<sup>+</sup>/Fix<sup>-</sup> fitness ratio is never in favor of the non-fixing strain, we set the cost of nitrogen fixation to 0 in the model (and used another parameter (‘sanctions’) to describe the observed fitness cost of non-fixing strains in older nodules). Several reasons could be invoked to explain the fact that we did not detect any fitness advantage for non-fixing strains: 1) there could be really no metabolic cost; this is however unlikely because 16 molecules of ATP are required to reduce 1 molecule of N2, 2) the metabolic cost could be too small or transient to be detected in our measures or 3) the metabolic cost could be compensated for by stabilizing mechanisms even during the early phases of the interaction. We have thus introduced these possibilities by changing the sentence “Since non-fixers do not proliferate better than fixers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), they are not cheaters in our system” into “Surprisingly, non-fixers did not proliferate better than fixers even at 14 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) possibly because the metabolic cost of nitrogen fixation is too low to be detected in our experimental conditions, or because plant sanctions and the cost of nitrogen fixation equilibrate until sanctions become prominent” (subsection “Evidence for a spatial and temporal control of mutualism in Mimosa nodules”).</p><p>We have also included a more precise definition of ‘cost of nitrogen fixation’ in the description of the model: “We emphasize that our definition of ‘cost of nitrogen fixation’ therefore does not refer to the actual metabolic cost of this process. It rather refers to the net fitness effect acting on nitrogen-fixing strains, which may integrate the actual metabolic cost and potential plant sanction mechanisms that could be at work in the early phases of the interaction and thus compensate for the metabolic cost” (subsection “Mathematical model and simulations”).</p><p>In addition, we would like to note that <italic>Cupriavidus taiwanensis</italic>, like most rhizobia, fix nitrogen only in plant nodule cells that provide the appropriate environment for this: (i) a large bulk of plant photosynthetates is diverted to bacteroids solving the high ATP demand of the nitrogenase enzyme, (ii) the paradox between the extreme sensitivity of nitrogenase to oxygen and the strict (micro) aerobic status of rhizobia is solved in two ways: nodules exhibit an extremely low free oxygen atmosphere and nodule leghemoglobin – a form of the plant ubiquitous hemoglobin- facilitates O<sub>2</sub> diffusion to bacteroids. Furthermore, gene expression in bacteroids is completely modified so that their metabolism is entirely dedicated to nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation only occurs after bacteria have entered the root and massively invaded the nodule cells, i.e. in the fixation zone of the nodule but not in infection threads or in the infection zone (process both spatially and temporally regulated). It is thus impossible to evaluate the metabolic cost of nitrogen fixation in a plant-like environment. In free-living conditions, our isogenic Fix<sup>+</sup> and Fix<sup>-</sup> strains are equally fit (but they do not fix in these conditions).</p><p>Second, the concept of partner fidelity feedback was indeed not considered in our current manuscript. We thank the reviewer for the input as this prompted us to think in the direction of the exact ongoing mechanisms.</p><p>We do not know the mechanisms that drive the death of non-fixers and host cells in the fixation zone. PFF is an attractive model because it has the potential to stabilize mutualistic interactions without having to invoke additional, unknown mechanisms. The analogy with the yucca-pollinator detailed in Shou, 2015 is particularly interesting for us, since we scrutinized the legume-rhizobia interaction at the cellular level: PC at the nodule level could actually result from PFF at the cellular level.</p><p>However, several specificities of the legume-rhizobia interaction deserve further attention. Nodule cell and bacterial degeneration in Fix<sup>–</sup> occupied nodules could result from a defense response from the plant side in response to a bacterial signal (or an absence of signal). A scenario of active plant defense response was recently discovered in Medicago truncatula (Wang et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017) (plant peptides killing specific bacterial genotypes at the intracellular level) and seems to be consistent with PC through conditional response. Moreover, PFF assumes that plant cells (entities) are metabolically insulated. That is, a plant cell has a limited amount of resources, and it will die if bacteria use up all its nutrients, which we believe is unlikely. Nodules are carbon-sink organs, meaning that the plant devotes significant amounts of carbohydrates to the nodules, and nutrients are exchanged between infected and non-infected plant cells either through transporters and/or by diffusing in the apoplast (White et al., 2007). Non-infected cells play a key role in nutrient exchange between the nodule and the root (Godiard et al., 2011). Therefore, the relevance of the cellular entities for mutualism in the legume nodules is debatable.</p><p>Given the arguments explained in the above paragraph and the impossibility to test the spatial equivalence of the focal entities, we feel that we cannot decisively assess which mechanism operates in our system and that our results could be interpreted as either PC through conditional response or PFF. Moreover, another potential mechanism could be that the bacteroid status (complete modification of gene expression in the plant environmental conditions) is lethal to bacteria that do not produce a functional nitrogenase system or do not export nitrogen. Such mechanism could possibly be interpreted as PFF at the cellular level.</p><p>Since we do not know the molecular mechanisms responsible for the death of non-fixers, we prefer to be cautious and keep the expression “post-infection sanctions against non fixers” in the text (Discussion section), as commonly employed in the legume-rhizobia literature.</p><p>Yet, we have now clarified our definition of the term ‘sanction’, in a way that we believe is compatible with both models, and have mentioned the PFF possibility: “These sanctions could occur as defense responses and/or by decreasing nutrient supply to non-fixing bacteroids. Given that Fix<sup>-</sup> and Fix<sup>+</sup> bacteria are spatially segregated within nodules, the latter case could also result from the local degenerescence of nodule cells, and be interpreted as an example of Partner Fidelity-Feeback mechanism occurring at the level of individual cells <sup>41</sup>” (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: I understand fix<sup>+</sup> and fix<sup>-</sup> bacteria, but I am confused about fix+ and fix<sup>-</sup> nodule.

We agree that this prevents us from obtaining a precise estimation of growth rate and from detecting any potential cost for nitrogen fixation (see discussion above). Nevertheless, we think that a precise estimation of growth rate is not critical for the purpose of our model, since we don’t use parameter values to extrapolate on potential mechanisms responsible for the observed dynamics. We are essentially interested in the population sizes of the different bacteria, and in their capacity to re-infect host plants (on a fine time-step, allowing to take into consideration stochastic events) over multiple inoculation cycles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is a significant contribution to the field of rhizobia-legume symbiosis, demonstrating nicely that non-fixing rhizobia are penalized both at the whole nodule level as well as within nodules – a matter of much debate! – and going farther to considering the time-course of this process. The modeling is a nice addition, though not necessarily required for this to be a strong paper. The multigenerational experiments seal the deal, demonstrating that the phenomenon measured within a generation translates to the expected shifts in allele frequencies over time.</p><p>I have only two concerns:</p><p>First, as this is something I worry about a lot in my own work, to what extent does the surface sterilization process penetrate and kill rhizobia within Mimosa nodules? This could have dramatic effects on the rhizobial populations observed in single-strain nodules that vary in size, which typically correlates with fixation status.</p></disp-quote><p>There is indeed a risk that the sterilization agents penetrate Mimosa nodules especially when the nodules are very small. That is why we did not collect very small nodules and sectioned the root far (ca 2mm) from the basis of each nodule (this last information is now added in Materials and methods section).</p><p>Although Fix<sup>+</sup>-containing nodules and Fix<sup>–</sup>containing nodules grow differently (Mimosa indeed form indeterminate nodules), both have a thick cortex as observed by cytology and may not be differently impacted by the sterilization. In co-infected nodules, only Fix<sup>-</sup> strains are sanctioned and the relative Fix<sup>+</sup>/Fix<sup>-</sup> fitness is even higher than when comparing single-occupied nodules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the authors claim in the text that the model fits their experimental data very well, but do not justify this statistically. In fact, looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, the model doesn't appear to fit all that well for particular timepoints and there doesn't seem to be all that much power in rejecting the model, if this was in fact the intent. Some consideration of what the purpose of the model is would be warranted–I think it is a nice conceptual addition that shows qualitatively that cycle length and plant population size impact the evolution of fix<sup>+</sup> from low frequency, but that the quantitative fit is being overstated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. We agree with this comment and certainly need to reword our arguments here. The model was developed as a means to extend the analysis and provides a qualitative estimation regarding the outcome of longer and increased number of cycles, and using plant populations of different sizes. We have incorporated a “nodulation” mechanism within the model to bring it closer to this particular system. However, at its heart the model remains a stochastic dynamical system with inherent variability that has been reduced by parameterizing it on experimental data. We have rephrased our claims as to the use of the model in the manuscript as following:</p><p>Subsection “Eco-evolutionary dynamics of N2-fixers and non-fixers through serial nodulation cycles”: We have added ‘While the model is developed as a proof-of-concept, instead of a simple deterministic model we chose to include stochasticity in the nodulation process in order to reflect the variability observed in the experimental data’.</p><p>Subsection “Eco-evolutionary dynamics of N2-fixers and non-fixers through serial nodulation cycles”: ‘Simulation outcomes qualitatively matched the dynamics’.</p><p>Subsection “Eco-evolutionary dynamics of N2-fixers and non-fixers through serial nodulation cycles”: ‘accuracy’ replaced by ‘predictions’.</p><p>Subsection “Eco-evolutionary dynamics of N2-fixers and non-fixers through serial nodulation cycles”: ‘as predicted by the model’ replaced by ‘similar to what observed with the model.’</p><p>Subsection “Eco-evolutionary dynamics of N2-fixers and non-fixers through serial nodulation cycles”: ‘Data from 21 day-cycle experiment also matched the model prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>)’ replaced by ‘Under 21 day-cycles, both simulations and experiments lead to a slower progression of Fix<sup>+</sup> subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>)’.</p><p>Discussion section: “Modelling” was replaced by “Our qualitative model”.</p><p>Discussion section: “predicted” was replaced by “A general outcome of the model”.</p><p>Discussion section: We added: “The model helps explore further combinations of number of cycles, cycle lengths and plant pool sizes to hypothesize the expected time when Fix<sup>+</sup> phenotypes arise.”</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This paper presents some important data, although some of the interpretation is questionable. The important results are:</p><p>1) Host sanctions against a nonfixing rhizobial strain were much more severe than previously reported for other host species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the real world, however, nonfixing nodulating strains like that used in the experiments are rare, relative to less-beneficial strains that fix some nitrogen.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that in nature the capacity to fix nitrogen with a legume partner can vary from no N2 fixation to levels equivalent to nitrogen-fed controls. This can result from deficiency in nitrogen fixation per se or deficiency in a previous stage, such as bacteroid differentiation or persistence, which involve different plant responses (Berrabah et al., 2015). For example, different <italic>S. meliloti</italic> mutants of bacA, involved in terminal differentiation, are differently impaired in N2 fixation (LeVier and Walker, 2001). Some strains of <italic>S. meliloti</italic> produce peptidases (HrrPs) degrading plant peptides (NCRs) involved in bacteroid differentiation (Price et al., 2015). The bactericidal activity of other plant peptides (NFS1 NFS2) affects the intracellular survival of specific bacterial genotypes, and thus nitrogen fixation (Wang et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017). Here we were interested in the impact of nitrogen fixation per se, and thus constructed strain specifically impaired in the nitrogenase system as a first step. Construction of strains producing nitrogenase systems with gradual levels of functionality is challenging. Moreover, we can imagine that, following natural HGT of nod-nif genes in a soil bacterium, a few mutations can shift the recipient genome from Fix<sup>-</sup> to full Fix<sup>+</sup> by integrating nif genes in N2 and O2 regulatory circuitries (and here we show that such mutations will increase in frequency in appropriate conditions). In an experimental evolution approach using a plant pathogen having acquired a rhizobial plasmid as ancestor, one mutation was enough to convert the Nod<sup>-</sup> ancestor into a Nod<sup>+</sup> strain (Marchetti et al., 2010), and two mutations were enough to convert the Nod<sup>+</sup> clone into a strain able to nicely intracellularly infect nodules (Capela et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, there was no evidence that the resources the nifH strain spared by not fixing nitrogen are automatically invested in rhizobial fitness.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Therefore, we cannot conclude (subsection “Evidence for a spatial and temporal control of mutualism in Mimosa nodules”) that &quot;low quality rhizobial partners rarely benefit from low investment in mutualism.&quot; (If there were a consensus on this, as claimed, this paper would merit publication only if it challenged that consensus.) To test that hypothesis would require comparing two nitrogen-fixing strains, with one of them providing less benefit via a mechanism that would plausibly enhance its own fitness. Examples include strains that (once inside nodules) block nodulation by other rhizobia (Tatsukami, 2016) or strains that divert more resources from N2 fixation to their own reproduction. Nonfixing mutants would not qualify.</p></disp-quote><p>A recent meta-analysis (Friesen, 2012) showed that there is no unequivocal example where rhizobial strains increase their own fitness (again, here we are talking about in planta fitness, i.e. ‘cheating outcome’ – see above answer to reviewer 1) while providing less nitrogen to the host, and thus concluded that “low quality partners rarely benefit from low investment in mutualism”. We acknowledge that this idea is debated. We thus modified the sentence into “The absence of a social dilemma provides support for the emerging idea that low quality rhizobial partners rarely benefit from low investment in mutualism” and moved this sentence to the Discussion section. Moreover, we think that our paper brings an additional level of understanding in this process by providing a detailed spatio-temporal analysis of rhizobial fitness.</p><p>We do agree that, in our case, we have no evidence that nifH mutants can invest more resources in their own fitness (see discussion on the cost of nitrogen fixation above) and that the suggestion of the reviewer is an attractive experiment. It would indeed help tease out the threshold in nitrogen fixation below which bacterial fitness declines and identify potential fitness gain of lower-quality partners. Theoretically this could be implemented by assuming a better reproductive success for partial fixers than total fixers. Unfortunately, we do not have such isogenic strains to conduct any confirmatory experiments. As far as we understand, the Gib- mutant strain described by Tatsukami, 2016, although fixing less nitrogen, is seemingly not fitter than the WT strain (again from a ‘cheating outcome’ perspective; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and therefore would not qualify for such an experiment.</p><p>In summary, we acknowledge that interactions occurring in natural ecosystems, between genetically diverse rhizobia and host plants, can encompass a wide range of subtle variations with regards to bacterial nitrogen-fixation output and cost/benefit ratio. However, our aim here was to use a reductionist approach to dissect the response of a legume plant to strains deficient in nitrogen fixation per se and not in previous symbiotic stages. Our hope is that the knowledge gained here can be then be used to interpret results from more complex (possibly ‘realistic’) interactions, in order to contribute to a broader and deeper understanding of the legume-rhizobia mutualism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Sanctions were apparently imposed on a nonfixing strain within mixed nodules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This is arguably the most-important result, so should be featured in the Abstract, along with the &quot;clear sectoring&quot; (subsection “Evidence for a spatial and temporal control of mutualism in Mimosa nodules&quot;) that is presumably key to within-nodule discrimination by the host.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now mentioned in the Abstract that sanctions are imposed only on non-fixers in mixed nodules. This result has also now been highlighted in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows no partner choice (host-imposed discrimination during the infection process). This is consistent with past work comparing isogenic strains, but the authors should recognize the possibility of adaptive partner choice by some host plants among some real-world strains whose signals are correlated with their relative benefits.</p></disp-quote><p>We mentioned in the Introduction the existence of partner choice mechanisms in the rhizobium-legume symbiosis. However, to our knowledge there is no study demonstrating that nitrogen fixation per se is controlled via a partner choice mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given these empirical results, it's obvious that fix<sup>+</sup> rhizobia could invade a fix<sup>-</sup> population under real-world conditions. I don't really see the point to modeling cases with only 20 plants or where plants only live 14 days after rhizobial infection, as either of those would lead to extinction of the host. If the authors want to explore &quot;ecological factors&quot;, as claimed, they should explore some more-realistic factors like temperature or soil nitrogen. What about competition between a strain that fixes half as much nitrogen as another, diverting the resources saved to its own reproduction? That's more realistic than a nonfixing strain. Their relative fitness would depend on how the host's threshold for imposing sanctions and on the extent to which resources diverted from nitrogen fixation actually enhance rhizobial fitness. Until we have those data, modeling is almost pointless. If space in the journal is not an issue, they could keep the modeling work, but the Abstract should be rewritten to be less vague and to highlight the empirical results. One sentence in the Abstract on modeling would be plenty.</p></disp-quote><p>The model is useful to build hypotheses regarding the effect of parameter values that are currently beyond the reach of the experiment. Furthermore, it is a stochastic model, bringing the inherent variability of the nodulation process into consideration. Although simple, we see that the model performs well qualitatively, suggesting that it encapsulates the major factors affecting bacterial population dynamics during serial inoculation cycles.</p><p>Modeling the expansion/extinction of fixers/non-fixers in “low” conditions such as a plant population size of 20 plants is interesting for experimental evolution approaches, as mentioned in the Discussion section. In our lab we are currently evolving 18 parallel lines of bacterial populations on 20 plants each (which means 320 plants in each cycles). It is thus interesting to know when we have to collect the nodules (length of the nodulation cycle) to get better chance to select Fix<sup>+</sup> mutants if they happen to arise.</p><p>In this paper we are interested in the impact of nitrogen fixation per se. We agree that it would be interesting to compare strains with different N2-fixing abilities, which would result from different capacities of the nitrogenase system and not from other traits (such as infection or persistence that of course affect the ultimate nitrogen fixation trait; see also discussion above). This imposes to construct such strains, which is challenging.</p><p>We have modified the abstract according to reviewer’s comments.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thank you for your revision, but we are returning the revision without further review, because we don't think that you have adequately addressed the concerns about the &quot;costs&quot; that play a central role in your modeling effort (or we were not sufficiently clear in our previous decision letter). In your model, the &quot;cost of nitrogen fixation&quot; being zero strains credulity unless you are very specific about what that these costs mean.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we used the term &quot;cost&quot; on two occasions:</p><p>– In the Results section where we spoke of the &quot;metabolic cost of nitrogen fixation&quot; referring to the energetic cost paid by bacteria to fix nitrogen, independently from any kind of sanction exerted by the plant. We have now specified this in the text by writing “the metabolic cost paid by bacteria to fix nitrogen.”.</p><p>– In the Materials and methods section, where we defined the parameter &quot;c&quot; as being the cost of nitrogen fixation in our model. We wrote &quot; In our simulations, the cost of nitrogen fixation c was set to 0 since we did not detect any difference in the populations of Fix<sup>-</sup> or Fix<sup>+</sup> nodule bacteria at 14 dpi&quot; and “We emphasize that our definition of ‘cost of nitrogen fixation’ therefore does not refer to the actual metabolic cost of this process&quot;.</p><p>We acknowledge that this second and different definition of the &quot;cost of nitrogen fixation&quot; (c) in the Materials and methods is not the same as the one in the main text and agree that it is not satisfactory. We have now requalified &quot;c&quot; as being the actual &quot;cost of metabolic nitrogen fixation” (same definition than in the results) and splitted the plant sanctions in two terms: <italic>s<sub>1</sub></italic> that describes basal plant sanctions that compensate for the cost of nitrogen fixation (the only form of sanction during the initial phase of the interaction), and s<sub>2</sub>u<sub>ds</sub>(t) as an additional form of sanctions that occurs in the later phase of the interaction (Materials and methods section). We specified that “In our simulations, we set c = s<sub>1</sub> since we experimentally did not detect any difference in the populations of Fix<sup>-</sup> or Fix<sup>+</sup> nodule bacteria at 14 dpi”. Beyond this time point, additional plant sanctions (possibly including partner fidelity-feedback) against the Fix<sup>-</sup> bacteria were given by s<sub>2</sub>u<sub>ds</sub>(t)” (Materials and methods section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Hence, we think that you need to be very specific about how these costs are described; otherwise the modelling effort could be criticized as being a tautology. If we understand your arguments correctly, the &quot;post-PFF/post-sanctioning costs&quot; need to be very small or even negative (benefit of cooperation) for cooperation to persist. Hence the text should be revised to say something like &quot;the cost of cooperation is difficult to determine because such determination requires a well-mixed environment to be free of PFF. Regardless, this cost must have been overcome by PFF and/or sanctioning mechanisms.

The idea “The cost we refer to is post-PFF/post-sanctioning cost of cooperation, which should be zero or negative, otherwise the mutualisms would have failed” is once more given by the sentence: “Since control mechanisms prevent social dilemma – i.e. the possibility that one partner increases its own fitness by decreasing its investment in mutualism – and help cooperation persist, non-fixers do not threaten mutualism in our system”.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Since their most interesting result was apparent sanctions within mixed nodules, they should cite this just-published paper: http://www.amjbot.org/citmgr?gca=amjbot;ajb.1700165v1</p></disp-quote><p>Done (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) You will need to explain/contrast sanctions and PFF clearly in Intro to give readers sufficient background.</p></disp-quote><p>A description of partner choice, post-infection sanctions and PFF is now given in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A clarification of &quot;cost&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>A description of partner choice, post-infection sanctions and PFF is now given in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Cost definitions are key. In the model, the cost is necessarily a fitness cost because it is translating fixation rate into population growth rate (i.e., per capita fitness). This is, as articulated in the response to reviewers’ letter, completely distinct from the actual metabolic cost of nitrogen fixation in terms of ATP and reducing power. I don't see the point is having separate terms for fitness cost of fixation (c) and then the fitness effect of sanctions (s1) since these are tied together in this system anyways. It would be clearer to just have a &quot;net fitness effect&quot; of fixation ability that could just be zero, because the growth rate of the fix<sup>+</sup> and fix<sup>-</sup>, is the same early in the interaction. The distinction between early phase vs late-phase seems arbitrary.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the remaining confusion regarding the definition of the term “cost”.

Therefore, we no longer have a parameter specifically referring to the ‘metabolic cost’ in our model. However, we think it is useful to maintain the two definitions in the main text, in order to justify the value of net fitness cost c=0 (subsection “Mathematical model and simulations”). This is intended to address the comment from reviewer #1 during the first revision, who pointed out that setting a cost to 0 for nitrogen fixation was confusing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this, when do Mimosa nodules really start fixing nitrogen?

For the Abstract to accurately describe their results, it would have to read something like &quot;rare fixers will invade a population of nonfixing bacteria that lack mechanisms to divert resources from nitrogen fixation to their own fitness…&quot; There's plenty of fluff in the Abstract that could be cut to include this key qualification.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not have any experimental evidence that nifH mutants divert resources from nitrogen fixation to their own fitness, even if it is likely.
