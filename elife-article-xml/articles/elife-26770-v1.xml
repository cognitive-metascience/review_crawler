ATP acts as universal cellular energy cofactor fuelling all life processes, including gene expression, metabolism, and transport. Despite a mechanistic understanding of ATP biochemistry, ATP dynamics in the living plant have been largely elusive. Here, we establish MgATP<sup>2-</sup> measurement in living plants using the fluorescent protein biosensor ATeam1.03-nD/nA. We generate Arabidopsis sensor lines and investigate the sensor in vitro under conditions appropriate for the plant cytosol. We establish an assay for ATP fluxes in isolated mitochondria, and demonstrate that the sensor responds rapidly and reliably to MgATP<sup>2-</sup> changes in planta. A MgATP<sup>2-</sup> map of the Arabidopsis seedling highlights different MgATP<sup>2-</sup> concentrations between tissues and within individual cell types, such as root hairs. Progression of hypoxia reveals substantial plasticity of ATP homeostasis in seedlings, demonstrating that ATP dynamics can be monitored in the living plant.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

It is used as a metabolic building block and as a cofactor to couple exergonic and endergonic reactions, making ATP as fundamental to life as proton gradients and the genetic code. An additional function as a biological hydrotrope to keep proteins soluble was further suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mandl et al., 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Patel et al., 2017</xref>). De-phosphorylation to ADP and AMP, and re-phosphorylation to ATP allow high energy fluxes based on relatively small pool sizes in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rich, 2003</xref>). The major sites of ATP synthesis are ATP synthases driven by the proton motive force established across the inner membrane of the mitochondria, and the plastid thylakoids in plants. The ATP produced typically fuels the wide range of energy-demanding processes, such as motility, transport, and gene expression, in other parts of the cell, although plastids also consume substantial amounts of ATP in the Calvin-Benson cycle, to an extent that varies substantially with the light/dark cycle. Coupling of these interactions requires ATP/ADP exchange between the organelles and cytosol. Thus, regulation of cytosolic and organelle ATP levels, and ATP/ADP transport across the mitochondrial and plastid envelope, give rise to particularly complex ATP dynamics in plant cells, that is critically dependent on the tissue type and external conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Neuhaus et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Flügge, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reiser et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haferkamp et al., 2011</xref>). The exact nature of the interplay between mitochondria and chloroplasts in maintaining cytosolic and nuclear ATP homeostasis, especially under changeable conditions, such as light–dark cycles or varying O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> status, has been investigated for decades, predominantly using biochemical techniques or in vivo NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailleul et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gardeström and Igamberdiev, 2016</xref>). For example, insight into subcellular adenine nucleotide pools have been possible through rapid membrane filter-based fractionation of leaf protoplasts, revealing a complex and dynamic interplay between the three cell compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lilley et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stitt et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gardeström and Wigge, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krömer and Heldt, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Krömer et al., 1993</xref>). The current consensus is that cytosolic ATP is mainly provided by the mitochondria, both in the dark, but also in the light, when photorespiration can be the main driver of ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Igamberdiev et al., 2001</xref>). Little is known, however, about differences between organs, tissues and cells and about the characteristics of their specific responses over time.</p><p>Similar challenges apply to other physiological and metabolic parameters, such as pH, free Ca<sup>2+</sup>, potentials of thiol redox couples, and concentrations of small molecules including plant growth regulators. However, development of in situ reporters has provided increasingly sophisticated understanding of their in vivo behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De Michele et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Uslu and Grossmann, 2016</xref>). For example, detailed insights into subcellular pH gradients and their dynamics have turned out to play a critical role in membrane transport, protein degradation, and energy and ion homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schwarzländer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Luo et al., 2015</xref>).

The ability to separately monitor redox potentials of the subcellular glutathione pools has revealed a far more reducing cytosolic redox landscape than previously anticipated, and has led to novel concepts of redox regulation and signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Morgan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schwarzländer et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Recently, several different fluorescent sensor proteins for ATP have been engineered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kotera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nakano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tantama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yoshida et al., 2016</xref>). ‘Perceval’ is based on a single circularly permuted mVenus protein fused to the bacterial regulatory protein GlnK1 from <italic>Methanococcus jannaschii</italic>. Competitive binding of ATP and ADP to GlnK1 result in inverse changes of two excitation maxima to provide a ratiometric readout of ATP:ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berg et al., 2009</xref>). The ‘PercevalHR’ variant was obtained by mutagenesis, and has an improved dynamic range of about 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tantama et al., 2013</xref>). However, both variants are strongly pH-sensitive, requiring pH measurement and correction for meaningful in vivo measurements. By contrast, the ratiometric ATeam sensor family was introduced as far less pH-sensitive. ATeam sensors share their overall design with the widely used Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) sensors of the Cameleon family, making use of the ε-subunit fragment of ATP synthase from <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. PS3 for reversible ATP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kotera et al., 2010</xref>). ATP binding to the ε-subunit induces a conformational change in the sensor structure modifying the relative orientation of the N- and C-terminal donor and acceptor fluorophores (monomeric super-enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (mseCFP); circularly permuted monomeric Venus (cp173-mVenus), a variant of yellow fluorescent protein), increasing FRET efficiency. Both sensor classes have provided insights into subcellular ATP dynamics in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tarasov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Merrins et al., 2016</xref>). However, to date, there is only one report on their use in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hatsugai et al., 2012</xref>), and establishment of reliable fluorescence-based ATP monitoring in plants has been lacking. This is despite the prominent role of ATP in the physiological network of plants, including two ATP-producing organelles and frequently fluctuating environmental conditions that determine the development of their flexible body plan.</p><p>In this work, we set out to establish protocols for ATP sensing in plants. First, we generate Arabidopsis lines expressing the biosensor ATeam1.03-nD/nA in the cytosol, mitochondrial matrix or the plastid stroma, and demonstrate that plants harbouring the probe in the cytosol or plastids are stable and show no phenotypic change. By contrast, lines expressing mitochondrial sensors are dwarfed, but still viable. Second, we validate the biochemical characteristics of the ATeam 1.03-nD/nA sensor in vitro under conditions typically encountered in plant systems. Third, we develop an ex situ assay for isolated mitochondria to probe ATP transport and synthesis. Fourth, we map tissue differences and gradients of cytosolic MgATP<sup>2-</sup> concentrations in living seedlings, including cell-to-cell variation in root hairs that inversely correlates with the rate of growth. Finally, we demonstrate how progressive hypoxia leads to characteristic time-dependent changes in MgATP<sup>2-</sup> dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of Arabidopsis lines for ATP sensing in the cytosol, chloroplasts and mitochondria</title><p>To establish ATP measurements in living plants, we generated Arabidopsis lines expressing ATeam1.03-nD/nA in the cytosol, the chloroplast stroma, and the mitochondrial matrix.

The K<sub>d</sub>(ATP), nucleotide specificity and pH sensitivity of the original ATeam family variants were characterised for use in animal cells at 37°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>). While the newer ATeam1.03-nD/nA variant shows an improved dynamic range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kotera et al., 2010</xref>), its other properties have not been characterised in detail, particularly at the pH and temperature conditions likely to be experienced in the plant cytosol, mitochondrial matrix or plastid stroma. We therefore characterised purified ATeam1.03-nD/nA protein in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The sensor emission spectrum showed a well-defined ratiometric shift in response to ATP. The mseCFP peak (475 nm) decreased and the cp173-mVenus peak (527 nm) increased, with increasing ATP concentrations in the high micromolar/low millimolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The isosbestic point was at 512 nm. Purified protein was stable at −86°C and retained the same dynamic range of the freshly purified sensor. However, non-frozen storage caused a decline of sensor responsiveness over time, arising from sensor degradation, probably by proteolysis, explaining the diminished dynamic range by separation of the two chromophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Hence, aliquots of purified protein were frozen immediately after purification and stored at −86°C. The ATP response of the sensor, determined at 25°C, was sigmoidal with a spectroscopic dynamic range of 4.0, higher than previously reported at 3.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kotera et al., 2010</xref>). The K<sub>d</sub>(ATP) was 0.74 mM with a Hill coefficient of 1.02, compatible with a single ATP binding site in the ATP synthase ε-subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yagi et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The sensor showed no response to ADP and AMP, in agreement with previous reports using other nucleotides, including GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>), and confirms the selectivity for ATP. Mg<sup>2+</sup> titration under saturating ATP showed a strong Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependence, indicating that the sensor responds selectively to MgATP<sup>2-</sup>, and not to ATP<sup>4-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). In the absence of ATP, the sensor signals were pH-stable from pH 6.5 to 8.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), consistent with the absence of direct pH effects on the fluorophores. Insensitivity to pH was also observed at partially saturating and saturating ATP from pH 7.5 to 8.5, although the spectroscopic sensor response range was diminished below pH 7.0. This decrease in ratio was due to a bona fide FRET response (mseCFP donor signal increasing, cp173-mVenus acceptor signal decreasing; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and correlated with the decrease in the MgATP<sup>2-</sup> species as the pH was lowered. We infer that the sensor response reports the MgATP<sup>2-</sup> concentration, which itself depends on ambient Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration and pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">O'Sullivan and Perrin, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Storer and Cornish-Bowden, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adolfsen and Moudrianakis, 1978</xref>). Since MgATP<sup>2-</sup> is the species that acts as the cofactor for the large majority of ATP-dependent proteins, the sensor provides a readout of the physiologically significant proportion of the ATP pool that is visible for those proteins.

The exact concentration of the sensor is not critical, because the ratiometric FRET readout is self-normalising, although very low or very high sensor concentrations were avoided, to prevent low signal-to-noise, or ATP-buffering by the sensor itself when close to its K<sub>d</sub>(ATP).</p><p>The FRET ratio did not change on addition of succinate as respiratory substrate in the absence of ADP, but subsequent addition of ADP led to an increase in FRET that plateaued at a steady state value depending on the ADP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Polarographic oxygen consumption assays performed in parallel confirmed respiratory activity responses and coupling of the mitochondria with a respiratory control coefficient of around 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and confirmed that the sensor responded rapidly to ATP generated by respiring mitochondria and exchanged by the AAC. Nevertheless, addition of ADP before succinate revealed that ADP alone was sufficient to cause the sensor to respond in a dose-dependent manner, although with smaller FRET increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Considering the sensor does not respond to ADP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), the response is indicative of ATP production in the absence of active respiration. FRET ratios increased further after subsequent addition of succinate, reaching a similar plateau value to before. Production of ATP from ADP alone in the absence of a respiratory substrate ruled out ATP synthase activity, but would be consistent with AK activity leading to conversion of ADP to ATP and AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch and Ninnemann, 1996</xref>). This implies that the assay provides an integrated readout of the combined activities of ATP synthase, AK and the AAC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Dissection of mitochondrial ATP production, ATP/ADP exchange, and adenylate kinase activity</title><p>The mitochondrial assay allows investigation of the role of AK and AAC in controlling mitochondrial ATP dynamics.

Consistent with this view, addition of AMP following the increase in FRET ratio triggered by ADP, led to a gradual, dose-dependent decrease of FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Addition of 4 mM ADP in the absence of respiratory activity resulted in a similar FRET increase in both control and cAT-treated mitochondria, suggesting that AK-derived ATP did not rely on AAC-mediated ADP or ATP transport. Subsequent energization by succinate lead to a slight but reproducible further increase in the control, which was absent for the cAT-treated mitochondria. This difference shows that matrix-exposed ATP synthase cannot contribute in the presence of cAT and validates effective AAC inhibition. At lower concentrations of ADP (0.5 mM), when ATP production by AK is close to the detection limit (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), succinate gave an increase in detectable MgATP<sup>2-</sup> in the absence of cAT, but this was almost completely abolished in the presence of cAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

ATP synthesis then strictly depends on ADP import, ATP synthase functionality, the proton motive force and functional electron transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

CCCP dissipates proton gradients over cell membranes, inhibiting ATP production and increasing ATP consumption; antimycin A inhibits mitochondrial electron transport at complex III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>); while adenine feeding has been demonstrated to lead to an increase of the cellular MgATP<sup>2-</sup> concentration by acting as a substrate for ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Loef et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gout et al., 2014</xref>).

Varying the medium pH between 6.0 and 8.5 showed that the decrease in FRET after antimycin A treatment was independent of pH.

The maximal spectroscopic response range was about 3, slightly lower than the range in vitro, which is partially accounted for by the excitation wavelength and emission bandwidth used. We infer that the sensor was intact and functional in vivo. High, but not fully saturated FRET, at steady state allowed an estimate of cytosolic MgATP<sup>2-</sup> concentrations in the range of about 2 mM, averaged over seedling tissues.

On the one hand, high respiration rates may give rise to high ATP levels; on the other, high demand during rapid growth may nevertheless cause ATP depletion. Addressing the question of the relationship between ATP levels and growth of single cells has previously been technically impossible. We employed light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) for 4D imaging of the growing Arabidopsis root to quantify growth rates and FRET of the individual root hairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

Hypoxia has a direct impact on mitochondrial ATP production, since lack of oxygen as final electron acceptor inhibits the respiratory chain. However, flexible metabolic responses have been described in response to hypoxia to prolong maintenance of cellular energy supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Geigenberger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Geigenberger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">van Dongen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zabalza et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">van Dongen and Licausi, 2015</xref>). To monitor MgATP<sup>2-</sup> dynamics during the progression of hypoxia, we used oxygen-proof, transparent tape to seal medium-filled wells containing individual seedlings grown on agar plates and in liquid culture, leaving no residual air space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). The experiments were carried out in the dark (except for excitation flashes for fluorimetric readings) to avoid oxygen evolution by photosynthesis. Seedlings in non-sealed wells served as controls. All FRET ratios showed an initial decrease immediately after immersion. This was followed by a phase of steady decrease for sealed seedlings, while unsealed seedlings retained FRET ratios around the starting values. Re-oxygenation by removal of the seal allowed full recovery to control values, while maintaining the seal led to a phase of sharp decrease and plateauing of FRET ratios at low values, similar to those seen for CCCP treatment. While the response characteristics were reproducible, the onset and rates of the different phases varied between individual seedlings, probably as a result of differences in biomass, respiration rate and the rate of oxygen decrease in turn. The hypoxia model demonstrates the possibility to reliably monitor subcellular MgATP<sup>2-</sup> dynamics live during stress insult, and may be flexibly adjusted to other external conditions, tissues and genetic backgrounds.<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26770.021</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Arabidopsis MgATP<sup>2-</sup> dynamics under low oxygen.</title><p>Ten-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings, grown vertically on plates, were submerged in imaging medium on 96-well microtiter plates.

With the exception of one report on cell death induced by hypersensitive response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hatsugai et al., 2012</xref>), fluorescence ATP measurements have been lacking in plant research. Live-cell fluorescent monitoring complements widespread standard approaches, such as luminescent or HPLC-based ATP determinations in biological extracts, or radioisotope-based techniques for membrane transport assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Manfredi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Khlyntseva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lorenz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Monné et al., 2015</xref>). While those techniques offer high sensitivity and accuracy in quantifying ATP, and other nucleotides, in extracts, they provide endpoint measurements after removal from the functional biological system and have limited use for resolving the ATP concentration over time at the (sub)cellular and tissue level. Yet, high flux rates, rapid fluctuations and (sub)cellular gradients are fundamental characteristics of cellular energy physiology. Non-destructive live measurement of ATP has been available by <sup>31</sup>P-NMR spectroscopy, which offers the additional benefit of also measuring ADP and other di- and tri-nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gout et al., 2014</xref>). However, <sup>31</sup>P-NMR is limited in spatial resolution and sensitivity. The superior sensitivity of fluorescence-based MgATP<sup>2-</sup> monitoring is demonstrated in the experiments with isolated Arabidopsis mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), where changes in the MgATP<sup>2-</sup> concentration were monitored with time resolution in the order of seconds on only 20 µg of mitochondrial protein. The spatial resolution of fluorescent ATP sensing is highlighted by its ability to detect MgATP<sup>2-</sup> levels in individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and single chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), making ATP-binding probes a particularly versatile technique in tissue and cell physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Arabidopsis lines for monitoring MgATP<sup>2-</sup> in the cytosol, chloroplasts and mitochondria</title><p>Governance of cytosolic ATP levels by two bioenergetic organelles in green plant cells raises important questions about the regulatory basis of subcellular ATP control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gardeström and Igamberdiev, 2016</xref>). The cytosolic sensor lines indicated no differences in ratio between cytosol and nucleoplasm, indicative of rapid diffusion between the two locations and in line with previous observations for free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and glutathione redox potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Loro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schwarzländer et al., 2016</xref>). The chloroplast sensor lines provide a good FRET signal, even in the presence of chlorophyll (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). These lines will be a valuable tool to dissect the impact of photosynthesis on subcellular ATP, and investigations are currently underway in our labs. While no developmental phenotype was observed for the cytosolic and plastidic sensor lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>), the strong phenotype that systematically resulted from sensor targeted to the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) requires caution. It cannot be ruled out that ATP homeostasis is generally perturbed in those sensor lines, although sensor-based measurements in mammalian cells have also indicated lowered ATP in the matrix, which can be accounted for by membrane potential-driven AAC-mediated ATP export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>). The reason for the stunted phenotype is currently unclear. Interference with matrix ATP homeostasis by ATP buffering appears unlikely, especially since similar phenotypes of variable severity can also be observed for other mitochondrially targeted sensors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>); similar issues were also noted in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schwarzländer et al., 2016</xref>).

The sensor does not report on energy charge set by the ATP:ADP ratio directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pradet and Raymond, 1983</xref>), without an additional assumption that the total adenosine pool is constant. In vivo, de novo synthesis and degradation are unlikely to change the total adenosine pool as rapidly as ATP/ADP/AMP-cycling by (de-)phosphorylation. Hence, the MgATP<sup>2-</sup> changes induced by inhibitor treatments and during hypoxia are likely to also reflect decreased energy charge. By contrast, differences in steady-state ATP levels between cells and tissues and organs may reflect constitutive differences in total adenylate pool sizes. Combinatorial analyses with sensors that directly respond to energy charge, such as variants of Perceval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tantama et al., 2013</xref>), will be desirable in the future. However, the currently available ATP:ADP sensors suffer from serious pH sensitivity, which adds a level of complexity to the meaningful interpretation in planta, where pronounced pH fluctuations can occur.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A dynamic assay to dissect ATP fluxes of isolated mitochondria</title><p>A key innovation from fluorescent protein-based sensing has been the ability to monitor biochemistry as it occurs in the intact biological system. Nevertheless, mechanistic conclusions have often been problematic based on attempts to link in vitro reductionism with in vivo complexity, and the challenges in bringing intact systems under experimental control. The ATP assays that we establish for isolated mitochondria introduce a useful intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Despite the use of whole organelles as complex multi-functional units, the different steps of ATP dynamics can be monitored and interpreted mechanistically. Substrate feeding and inhibitor treatments allow for tight control over the functional state of the organelle, and controlled manipulation of ATP physiology. For example, we were able to distinguish the phosphorylation activities of ATP synthase and AK, and monitor either activity by exploiting their differential characteristics, including their sub-mitochondrial exposure to the matrix and the intermembrane space, respectively. Perturbation of mitochondrial function was observed with high sensitivity and kinetically resolved following inhibition of defined players in mitochondrial ATP production. Substrates and inhibitors are well suited to modulate respiratory activity, capacity and efficiency, and to induce transitions in ATP dynamics. They may be applied to dissect bioenergetic rearrangements in respiratory mutants in the future.</p><p>The current understanding of cellular bioenergetics has been driven by dynamic measurements in isolated mitochondria and chloroplasts, e.g. of oxygen consumption or Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport. Yet, monitoring ATP dynamics, as the central product, has typically relied on indirect inference, or reconstruction of time-resolved data from individual samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attucci et al., 1991</xref>). The fluorescent biosensor-based ATP assay concept introduces a complementary method to continuously and dynamically monitor ATP transport fluxes from and into cells and isolated organelles, as demonstrated using plant mitochondria. Since the sensor protein is added externally to the samples, and does not require transgenic sensor expression by the samples, cell components from any species can be studied for ATP generation, consumption and membrane transport. The assays may be further expanded to study membrane transport dynamics. For instance, the response of ATP transport across the chloroplast envelope to changes in photosynthetic activity should be readily detectable making it possible to address as yet unresolved questions about transport efficiency, directionality and routes, under controlled external conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haferkamp et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gardeström and Igamberdiev, 2016</xref>). The assay principle is adaptable to other subcellular structures, and potentially even liposome, cell, and tissue systems. It may also facilitate the improvement of ATP-coupled enzyme assays. Monitoring ATP export and uptake by cells may be of specific interest to address current questions about intercellular ATP fluxes and the signalling function of extracellular ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choi et al., 2014a</xref>). ATeam variants with higher affinities to match lower ATP concentration ranges have been engineered, and are also likely to be specific for MgATP<sup>2-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Monitoring ATP in planta by three sensor detection approaches</title><p>We have performed live sensing of ATP in planta by three distinct in vivo techniques.

While CLSM has been extensively used in combination with other fluorescent protein sensors in plants, LSFM has only recently been adjusted to enable FRET-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements in Arabidopsis roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Costa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Candeo et al., 2017</xref>). Microtiter plate-based fluorimetry has been widely used for cultured animal cells and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Morgan et al., 2016</xref>), but rarely in plant tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rosenwasser et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">2011</xref>), and a rigorous technical validation was missing. Our analysis shows that careful adjustment of fluorimetric settings, with the sensor properties and the characteristics of the tissue can make plate reader-based measurements a robust approach for continuous monitoring of fluorescent protein sensors over extended time periods. While heterogeneity between cells and tissues is averaged, large sample numbers can be assessed in parallel enabling robust controls and accounting for biological variability. Genetic targeting of the sensor to a specific subcellular location where it responds to the local ATP levels means that the resolution of subcellular physiology is maintained. Further, side-by-side measurements of different sensors in different tissues or cell compartments may allow monitoring and dissecting the interplay of different physiological responses to the same stimulus. For instance, the impact of hypoxia on cyto-nuclear ATP, pH and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, or the impact of illumination on the ATP concentration in the cytosol and the chloroplast stroma may be assessed. Parallel side-by-side monitoring provides an alternative to multiplexing of several sensors co-expressed in the same plant. The robustness of the assay may even be suitable for genetic or chemical biological screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dejonghe and Russinova, 2017</xref>) based on fluorescent sensors in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Sensing and manipulating MgATP<sup>2- </sup>in vivo</title><p>Decreasing and increasing the cytosolic MgATP<sup>2-</sup> levels in vivo by chemical treatments resulted in a reliable response that covered nearly the full theoretical dynamic range of the sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We infer that the sensor is functional in vivo, and not affected by proteolytic cleavage. The effective decrease of MgATP<sup>2-</sup> after inhibition with antimycin A validated the role of mitochondria as major suppliers of cytosolic ATP, as the loss of respiration-derived ATP could not be replaced. Nevertheless, the response kinetics to the chemical treatments appeared to be dominated by tissue uptake rate. Monitoring the treatments by CLSM indicated varying response rates depending on tissue type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Yet, all tissues gradually adopted a similarly low FRET ratio of the MgATP<sup>2-</sup>-free sensor. The ability to drive the sensor to its extremes in vivo allows the conversion of in vivo FRET ratios to absolute MgATP<sup>2-</sup> concentrations, as routinely done in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Palmer and Tsien, 2006</xref>), and thiol redox sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schwarzländer et al., 2008</xref>). Since the conversion requires additional assumptions, and becomes inaccurate towards the non-linear response range of the sensor, a fully quantitative approach has been criticised. In this work we use the FRET values as direct representation of the in vivo dynamics and relative differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wagner et al., 2015b</xref>). When conversion to absolute concentrations is desired, they should be regarded as an estimate. Here about 2 mM MgATP<sup>2-</sup> can be estimated for the cytosol at steady state in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>).

For central metabolites high-resolution transcriptional analysis has aimed to generate tissue maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chaudhuri et al., 2008</xref>), but direct in vivo mapping across tissues and organs has not been undertaken. Differences in the MgATP<sup>2-</sup> concentration between tissues and cells have not previously been distinguishable with any reasonable resolution, and the MgATP<sup>2-</sup> map therefore unveils a surprisingly heterogeneous and dynamic picture. Green tissues showed overall high MgATP<sup>2-</sup> concentration, which are unlikely due to photosynthetic activity because the seedlings were dark-adapted. Etiolation not only decreased MgATP<sup>2-</sup> in the green tissues, but also increased levels in the roots. The biological significance of tissue-specific MgATP<sup>2-</sup> heterogeneity deserves in-depth dissection in the context of metabolism and development in the future. Since the map represents MgATP<sup>2-</sup>, as the main bioavailable form of ATP, differences may, in principle, be due to ATP pool size, pH and/or Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Many proteins bind MgATP<sup>2-</sup>, but the extent to which this affects the buffering of the pool and the free concentration, which is available for binding by the sensor, is currently unknown.</p><p>With the appropriate caution, the map provides insight into MgATP<sup>2-</sup> distribution at system level and the concept sets a reference point for expansion into several dimensions, including time, subcellular compartment, and other genetic, biochemical or physiological parameters. Time-lapse imaging can resolve the dynamic changes in a tissue, both during developmental processes and in response to external stimuli. Our observation that the MgATP<sup>2-</sup> concentration increases with decreasing root hair growth exemplifies the occurrence of such dynamics and provides evidence for the complex relationship between cellular energy status and growth. Analogous maps can be generated for other subcellular compartments, such as the plastids, to obtain a tissue-resolved map of subcellular MgATP<sup>2-</sup> heterogeneity. Other sensors, e.g. for pH, Ca<sup>2+</sup> or glutathione redox potential, may be used and superimposed to gradually build up a comprehensive representation of the cell physiological status of the whole plant. Superimposition with transcriptomic and proteomic maps (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chaudhuri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2016</xref>) may even allow correlation across the organisational levels of the cell.

The decrease occurred in four phases and was fully reversible by re-oxygenation. FRET ratios initially declined slowly, however, after extended block of oxygen supply, a sharp decrease in the MgATP<sup>2-</sup> concentration occurred to a new plateau level, which may represent the lower sensitivity limit of the probe. The exact kinetics depended on the experimental setup and the type of tissue, yet the overall response was reproducible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). The rapid response and the gradual decrease together support the rationales that the cytosolic MgATP<sup>2-</sup> pool strictly depends on oxidative phosphorylation, that AK-based buffering may at most delay MgATP<sup>2-</sup> depletion, but that a sharp MgATP<sup>2-</sup> depletion can be avoided, probably by restructuring of metabolic fluxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Geigenberger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zabalza et al., 2009</xref>). The experimental setup did not generate a sudden decrease in oxygen availability, but relied on dark respiration for gradual oxygen depletion. The observed responses therefore represent the integrated effects of dynamic progression of hypoxia and the compensating metabolic changes; as they may occur in a situation of sudden (deep) water logging. Hypoxia-associated intracellular acidification may also impact on the sensor response by influencing MgATP<sup>2-</sup> dissociation. Yet, these pH-induced changes are not artefacts and carry physiological meaning, since a decrease in the concentration of MgATP<sup>2-</sup> does not only affect the sensor, but also endogenous MgATP<sup>2-</sup>-dependent proteins. Furthermore, the pH controlled MgATP<sup>2-</sup> depletion treatments indicate only a minor contribution of pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) and prior work has suggested that cytosolic pH hardly decreases below 7, even under anoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gout et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schulte et al., 2006</xref>). As such, the hypoxia assays demonstrate that ATeam1.03-nD/nA allows continuous monitoring of subcellular MgATP<sup>2-</sup> pools in response to stress. Since the exact ATP kinetics are shaped by the cellular stress response machinery, they will provide a sensitive and integrated readout for defects or modifications in mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Conclusions and outlook</title><p>We have investigated mitochondrial bioenergetics, plant hypoxia responses and MgATP<sup>2-</sup> content in plant tissues depending on growth conditions and development. These studies exemplify the versatility of fluorescent ATP sensing to open new doors in plant biology. Their systematic follow up and extrapolation will be required for a systems view of ATP in the future. Although ATP biochemistry has been extensively studied in the last century, surprisingly large gaps remain in our understanding of its dynamics within cells and whole plants. Sensing MgATP<sup>2-</sup> dynamically and with (sub)cellular resolution adds novel depth to the study of plant metabolism, development, signalling and stress responses. Our understanding of plant microbe interactions, where the biochemistry underpinning the localised and dynamic responses have been notoriously hard to capture, may benefit in particular. Other potential applications include the identification and in vivo validation of ATP transport systems, a better understanding of the coordination between plastids and mitochondria in ATP production, an appraisal of the impact of uncoupling systems, the visualisation of energy parasitism in diatoms, the extension of in situ enzyme assays and the mapping of MgATP<sup>2-</sup> to other sensor outputs and oxygen gradients in tissues. Optimisation of high affinity ATP sensors for the apoplast could support investigations on extracellular ATP signalling. Additional sensors for AMP, ADP and ATP:ADP ratio can be integrated into the methodological framework introduced here. Each time that a biosensor for a new facet of cell physiology, e.g. for free Ca<sup>2+</sup> or glutathione redox potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pei et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Meyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schwarzländer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Krebs et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Loro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wagner et al., 2015b</xref>), has been introduced into plant research, this has yielded a burst of discovery.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Hardtke as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Teva Vernoux (Reviewer #1) and Alisdair Fernie (Reviewer #2).</p><p>In your revision, please pay particular attention to complete documentation of the phenotypes and adequate, more complete control panels. Specifically, please provide more comprehensive evidence that there is no phenotype in the cytosolic/chloroplastic lines. Also, please carefully review a potential effect of the liquid culture, which might by itself create normoxic conditions. Finally, we would like to ask you to address the reviewers' comments, which you find below, point by point.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes the transfer and characterisation in plants (<italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) of a FRET sensor for ATP (more precisely ATP-Mg2-). The sensor is further used to analyse mitochondrial ATP production and to map ATP in plantelets. The authors also use it to analyse changes in ATP levels during anoxia, showing that it can be used to follow the energetic response during stresses.</p><p>The work reported is of high quality and the data presented are very convincing. This ATP FRET sensor will surely be widely used to understand ATP biochemistry at high spatio-temporal definition and how it is integrated in planta.</p><p>I have only relatively minor comments (below, starting with the most important ones) that I think the authors should be able to address easily and that will strengthen the manuscript:</p><p>– One (real) concern with the manuscript is the fact that the number of transgenics is very low (3 / sub cellular localisation). Considering this, the authors need more than just an image of a single rosette (with no control shown!) to say that the development is not affected in the cytosolic and chloroplastic lines. This is all the more important that there is a very strong phenotype for the mitochondrial lines. I suggest the authors to quantify for all the lines they have various parameters of root development in vitro and of shoot development for plants on soil (size of rosettes, height of inflorescence, number of siliques). If they can add extra transgenic lines it would obviously strengthen the data.</p><p>– The authors should make clear already in the Abstract that it is a sensor for ATP-Mg2- rather to highlight its specificity and indicate why being able to detect ATP-Mg2- is pertinent. They should also recall this point in the discussion a bit more thoroughly.</p><p>– For the analysis of the effects of hypoxia, I am a bit concerned by the fact that the assay uses plants that are grown in liquid. This is in itself should induce hypoxia if I am not mistaken. Then the results observed would correspond to increasing the level of stress rather than no stress/stress comparison. Could the authors compare the distribution of the sensor for plants grown on plates to the one in liquid to estimate the effect of the liquid culture? Minimally (and if I am not wrong) they should point out this limit of their analysis.</p><p>– The authors claim an inverse correlation between ATP and growth in root hair with a support from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>. The R square on the figure is 0.13. Nothing can be concluded form such a low R square that suggests that the correlation is not better than what would be obtained in a random situation. Is there a mistake with this value? If it is the right one the authors should probably be more careful and conclude that what they say is true for the highest and lowest growth values.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by De Col et al., presents a validated plant ATP sensor. It additionally maps ATP tissue gradients and subcellular distribution using cytosolic, mitochondrial and chloroplastic ATP sensors providing perspective of their use within the text. The mitochondrial plants are dwarven which may confound their utility in some applications, to get around this they demonstrate an ex situ assay for isolated mitochondria. These studies thus all demonstrate the fact that these sensors can be used within live plants. In addition the authors also follow the kinetics of variation in ATP levels following the progression of hypoxia. In short this paper is a real tour-de-force not only does it demonstrate the usefulness of this technology but it already put is to work to address some of the most important questions around concerning ATP. The sheer amount of work included here is laudable as are the number of careful controls I went through the fine details of each experiment but have no disagreements or uncertainties with them as presented. I also have no request for further experimentation but do list a few of the additional areas into which this technology could be developed, applied and contrasted below should the authors feel that they are worth adding to their perspective section. That said I enthusiastically echo their suggestion that this technology will likely assist in our understanding of what is unarguably one of the most important cellular metabolites of plants and indeed all living systems.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26770.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p> <italic>This manuscript describes the transfer and characterisation in plants (Arabidopsis) of a FRET sensor for ATP (more precisely ATP-Mg2-).

If they can add extra transgenic lines it would obviously strengthen the data.</italic> </p><p>We are grateful for this suggestion and have performed detailed phenotypic characterisation of the homozygous sensor lines presented in the first submission (i.e., cytosolic lines #1.1 and #3.6, plastidic lines #1.1 and #2.1 and mitochondrial lines #1.1 and #4.8) covering all suggested parameters. We determined root length of vertically grown plants side-by-side with wild type controls, and quantified rosette sizes of the plants after transfer to soil until the majority of individuals showed open flowers. In the reproductive phase, we determined the inflorescence height and number of siliques at individual time points. We additionally included a comparison of these parameters between fluorescent (+/+ and +/-) and non-fluorescent (-/-) individuals from two heterozygous lines expressing ATeam in the cytosol and one heterozygous line expressing ATeam in the plastid. As mitochondrial localisation of the sensor consistently confirmed the strong developmental phenotype, we decided against the characterisation of an additional line and do not generally recommend these plants for physiological measurements. We have added the phenotyping data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> as Figure supplements 2 and 3, and cover them in the Results and Materials and methods section</p><p> <italic>– The authors should make clear already in the Abstract that it is a sensor for ATP-Mg2- rather to highlight its specificity and indicate why being able to detect ATP-Mg2- is pertinent. They should also recall this point in the discussion a bit more thoroughly.</italic> </p><p>We have adjusted the text accordingly and now refer more consistently and specifically to MgATP<sup>2-</sup> throughout the text, to emphasise the chemical specificity of the sensor as well as the physiological significance of MgATP<sup>2-</sup>.</p><p> <italic>– For the analysis of the effects of hypoxia, I am a bit concerned by the fact that the assay uses plants that are grown in liquid. This is in itself should induce hypoxia if I am not mistaken. Then the results observed would correspond to increasing the level of stress rather than no stress/stress comparison. Could the authors compare the distribution of the sensor for plants grown on plates to the one in liquid to estimate the effect of the liquid culture? Minimally (and if I am not wrong) they should point out this limit of their analysis.</italic> </p><p>We have repeated the experiment with seedlings grown vertically on half-strength MS medium solidified with agar. The ATP dynamics under oxygen shortage appeared generally conserved. The exact timing of events differed slightly between experiments with oxygen-limited seedlings reaching minimal ATP levels more slowly when grown on plate than in hydroponic culture. This might indeed indicate that hydroponically grown plants are affected by mild hypoxia already before the experiment. Differences could additionally result from more general effects of the growth method such as individual biomass or the shoot-to-root ratio. A related and more general weakness of the technical setup is that the plants are submerged during the experiment. Hence, each experiment includes a control population of submerged plants that were still supplied with oxygen (not sealed). We have replaced the data from the hydroponically grown seedlings with the new data from plate-grown seedlings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, but still show the other experiment as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref> to highlight the robustness of the assay and the response pattern.</p><p> <italic>– The authors claim an inverse correlation between ATP and growth in root hair with a support from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>. The R square on the figure is 0.13. Nothing can be concluded form such a low R square that suggests that the correlation is not better than what would be obtained in a random situation. Is there a mistake with this value? If it is the right one the authors should probably be more careful and conclude that what they say is true for the highest and lowest growth values.</italic> </p><p>We are grateful for the remark and agree that the low coefficient of determination (R²) carries insufficient meaning. We have therefore included an F-test as appropriate statistical assessment of the linear regression, which suggest that the general correlation between root hair growth rate and the ATeam Venus/CFP ratio was significant at the 0.05 level (p-value of 0.011). Together this suggests that the variance in root hair growth cannot largely be explained by the ATP levels and likely depends on a number of variables, but the correlation between growth and ATP levels is statistically valid, not only for the hair cells showing fastest and slowest growth, but also for the full dataset. We have revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref> and checked the relevant text passages to make sure that our interpretation is sufficiently cautious.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2 (Major comments (Required)):</italic> </p><p> <italic>The manuscript by De Col et al., presents a validated plant ATP sensor.
