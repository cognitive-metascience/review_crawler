Through the use of an intersectional genetic viral vector approach in mice, we report novel hippocampal neurons which we refer to as LINCs, as they are long-range inhibitory neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-expressing cells. LINCs project to several extrahippocampal regions including the tenia tecta, diagonal band, and retromammillary nucleus, but also broadly target local CA1 cells. LINCs are thus both interneurons and projection neurons. LINCs display regular spiking non-pyramidal firing patterns, are primarily located in the stratum oriens or pyramidale, have sparsely spiny dendrites, and do not typically express somatostatin, VIP, or the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2. We further demonstrate that LINCs can strongly influence hippocampal function and oscillations, including interregional coherence. The identification and characterization of these novel cells advances our basic understanding of both hippocampal circuitry and neuronal diversity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nNOS</kwd><kwd>INTRSECT</kwd><kwd>oscillation</kwd><kwd>coherence</kwd><kwd>frontal cortex</kwd><kwd>tenia tecta</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS104071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krook-Magnuson</surname><given-names>Esther</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31-NS105457</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Christenson Wick</surname><given-names>Zoé</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007249</institution-id><institution>University of Minnesota</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MnDRIVE (Minnesota's Discovery Research and Innovation Economy) initiative</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Christenson Wick</surname><given-names>Zoé</given-names></name><name><surname>Krook-Magnuson</surname><given-names>Esther</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007249</institution-id><institution>University of Minnesota</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>McKnight Land-Grant Professorship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krook-Magnuson</surname><given-names>Esther</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An intersectional genetic vector approach allows the identification and characterization of novel hippocampal inhibitory neurons with both broad local connectivity within CA1 and long-range projections to several extrahippocampal areas.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The hippocampus is one of the most extensively studied brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2007</xref>), and in CA1 alone, more than 20 types of inhibitory neurons have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Freund and Buzsáki, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>).

The hippocampus does not work in isolation and has extensive connections with other brain regions. Oscillations, and their synchrony or coherence, are believed to play an important role in coordinating the activity between the hippocampus and downstream regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buzsáki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Colgin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sirota et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Despite extensive prior investigation of the neuronal populations in CA1 (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Freund and Buzsáki, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>), recent work highlights that some cell types still lack proper characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Harris et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we report a novel population of cells which 1) are GABAergic, 2) express neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and 3) have both local and long-range axonal projections. Therefore, on the basis of these unifying features, we refer to these cells as LINCs: long-range inhibitory nNOS-expressing cells. Although LINCs express nNOS and possess long-range axons, they do not appear to be simply hippocampal versions of cortical NOS-type I cells, nor do they closely match any other previously characterized hippocampal cell population, as detailed in depth below. In all, despite being relatively few in number, the properties of LINCs suggest that they can have a surprisingly robust impact on hippocampal network function, oscillatory dynamics, and inter-regional coherence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Intersectional vector approach labels LINCs</title><p>The ability to identify, characterize, and manipulate LINCs rests on the use of a recently developed Cre- and Flp-dependent virus for the expression of eYFP-tagged ChR2 (AAV-DJ-hSyn-Con/Fon-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP-WPRE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fenno et al., 2014</xref>) and on mice that express Cre in their nNOS+ neurons and Flpe in their Dlx5/6+ GABAergic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>).

However, we were still surprised that our intersectional approach labeled LINCs, and not other, better characterized, populations of nNOS-expressing neurons (including neurogliaform cells). We reasoned that the selective labeling could be due to (1) the transgenic lines used, (2) the serotype of the vector used, and/or (3) the location of the injections (especially as neurogliaform cells have dense, but radially very restricted, processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armstrong et al., 2012</xref>). Crossing the nNOS-Cre and Dlx5/6-Flpe lines with a DUAL reporter mouse (RCE:dual) resulted in an expression pattern that was consistent with the expression of nNOS in known interneuron populations (n = 1 Cre+/Flpe+/eGFP+ animal; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that neither the Cre nor the Flpe line was responsible for the selective expression of ChR2-eYFP in LINCs. We next tested whether the DJ serotype used was critical. Injection of an AAV5 serotype of the Con/Fon-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP vector also resulted in the labeling of LINCs (n = 4 Cre+/Flpe+ animals; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), arguing against a strict requirement for the DJ serotype. Finally, we tested whether the location of the viral vector was critical. For labeling of LINCs, virus was targeted to the stratum oriens. If we instead injected AAV-DJ-hSyn-Con/Fon-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP-WPRE in the stratum lacunosum moleculare, cells with morphologies consistent with neurogliaform cells were indeed labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This illustrates that the intersectional approach taken is capable of labeling well-characterized populations of nNOS-expressing cells, but preferentially targets LINCs when injected into the stratum oriens.</p><p>Together, these findings suggested that this vector-based transgenic approach was not producing inappropriate ‘leaky’ labeling, but was labeling a unique and unexpected population of nNOS+ neurons.

Therefore, to determine LINCs’ local connectivity, we recorded from both deep and superficial pyramidal cells, as well as from inhibitory neurons across all layers of CA1, while optogenetically activating LINCs. We found that LINCs broadly targeted both deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal cells (dPC and sPC, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and to a roughly equivalent degree: GABA<sub>A</sub> responses (subsequently blocked by 5 µM gabazine) were recorded in approximately 80% of dPCs and sPCs (13/16 dPCs; 16/20 sPCs; p=0.93, χ<sup>2</sup> test; n = 16 dPCs from 16 sections, 12 animals, n = 20 sPCs from 19 sections, 11 animals; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,d</xref>), and were of similar amplitude in both dPCs and sPCs ([i] GABA<sub>A</sub> amplitude median dPC: −106 pA; sPC: −83 pA; dPCs vs sPCs, p=0.97, M-W; n = 13 dPCs from 13 sections, 10 animals, and n = 16 sPCs from 16 sections, nine animals; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>; [ii] including non-responders, dPC: −87 pA; sPC: −66 pA, dPCs vs sPCs, p=0.29, M-W, n = 16 dPCs from 16 sections, 12 animals, and n = 20 sPCs from 19 sections, 11 animals). The rise time of the GABA<sub>A</sub> response (time between 0% and 63% of peak response) was also similar in both dPCs and sPCs (rise time dPC: 3.26 ± 1.00 ms; sPC: 3.64 ± 0.77 ms; dPCs vs sPCs, p=0.78, M-W; n = 13 dPCs from 13 sections, 10 animals, and n = 16 sPCs from 16 sections, nine animals).

These findings illustrate that despite being relatively few in number, LINCs are able to impact hippocampal function, and that artificially manipulating LINC activity can have a detrimental impact on spatial/location memory.</p><p>To further examine this effect, we recorded hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs) while optogenetically stimulating LINCs with the same pulsed light frequency used during the OLM and ORM tasks (~7 Hz stimulation, 33% duty cycle, delivered for 3 s every 30 s). First, we examined all traces and found an increase in power at the stimulation frequency in the hippocampal LFP in opsin expressing animals (62.3 ± 17.9% [mean ± SEM] [n = 12] for opsin+ animals vs. −11.9 ± 10.3% [n = 6] for opsin– animals; p=0.006, M-W; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Given that the animal would already be in a theta state during most of the OLM or ORM task, we next specifically looked at traces recorded when the animal was in a theta state at the time of light delivery. Under these circumstances, we found an increase in overall theta power during light stimulation in opsin-positive animals compared to opsin-negatives (43.6 ± 28.7% increase [n = 12] for opsin+ animals vs. −11.0 ± 7.2% [n = 6]for opsin– animals; p=0.006, M-W). Moreover, we found that the theta oscillations had reset to align to the light delivery in opsin-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8g</xref>) but not opsin-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8h</xref>) animals. This entrainment to the light also resulted in a shift in the dominant frequency within theta towards the ~7 Hz light-delivery frequency in opsin-positive animals (7.6 ± 0.2 Hz prior to light stimulation vs. 6.9 ± 0.1 Hz during stimulation; p=0.002, M-W; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). To further examine the impact of this light delivery scheme on both LINCs and their downstream targets, we returned to slice electrophysiology. Light delivery at ~7 Hz with 50 ms pulse width for 3 s produced action potentials in LINCs with each light pulse, and corresponding IPSCs in postsynaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).

LINCs, having connectivity both within the hippocampus and to extrahippocampal regions, are in a prime position to increase interregional coherence (i.e., to ‘link’ these regions up). Supporting this, we measured significant increases in coherence between the hippocampus and TT when optogenetically activating LINCs, across a range of stimulation frequencies (mixed-design ANOVA with Greenhouse-Geisser correction: genotype p=0.04, F = 4.7, DF = 1; stimulation frequency*genotype p=0.40, F = 1.0, DF = 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9e</xref>). Together, these data suggest that LINCs can impact hippocampal function, strongly entrain hippocampal oscillations, and increase coherence between the hippocampus and downstream regions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have taken advantage of recent advances in viral vector specificity (i.e. the INTRSECT approach; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fenno et al., 2014</xref>) to selectively label and manipulate a population of CA1 cells that previously lacked any detailed description: LINCs. In addition to this being the first time that LINCs have been described in any detail, this work revealed that LINCs have several properties that make them especially unique and exciting. (1) LINCs have widespread postsynaptic connections within the hippocampus, allowing them to provide both fast and long-lasting GABAergic inhibition to almost any cell in CA1. (2) LINCs have long-range projections to many distinct regions of the brain. (3) Manipulating LINCs can cause spatial memory deficits, indicating that LINCs can have a significant impact on hippocampal function. And (4) LINCs can drive oscillatory activity in the hippocampus and increase interregional coherence between the hippocampus and projection targets. In summary, LINCs are poised to have a significant impact on the network, and a detailed understanding of LINCs is therefore important for a proper understanding of the hippocampal formation, and its downstream connections, more broadly.</p><p>We found that LINCs are distinct from previously characterized GABAergic hippocampal nNOS cells, and are a somewhat heterogeneous population of cells. LINCs reside primarily in stratum oriens and stratum pyramidale, and have horizontally or vertically oriented, sparsely spiny, dendritic arbors. They display a regular spiking non-pyramidal firing pattern and rarely express somatostatin (SOM), parvalbumin (PV), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), calretinin (CR), or the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 (M2R). LINCs provide widespread, powerful, inhibition within the hippocampus, and, when optogenetically stimulated, are able to alter hippocampal function and oscillations. LINCs project to several areas outside of the hippocampus, including, but not limited to, the medial septum, diagonal band, tenia tecta, olfactory tubercle, and retromammillary nucleus. Activation of LINCs is able to alter oscillatory activity in downstream regions, and increases interregional coherence. Altogether, LINCs, though somewhat heterogeneous, are unified in that they are GABAergic, have long-range projections, and express nNOS.</p><p>LINCs are not the only GABAergic cell population in the hippocampus that express nNOS, but can be distinguished from these other neuronal populations in a variety of ways. A subpopulation of neurogliaform cells express nNOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Krook-Magnuson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tricoire et al., 2010</xref>), but neurogliaform cells have a tight, dense, axonal plexus, and short and radially oriented thin dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Price et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tricoire et al., 2010</xref>). Neurogliaform cells also display a late-spiking firing pattern with a high rate of persistent, or axonal-barrage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sheffield et al., 2013</xref>), firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armstrong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Krook-Magnuson et al., 2011</xref>). By contrast, LINCs have broad dendrites and far-reaching axons, show a regular spiking non-pyramidal firing pattern, and do not have a high rate of axonal-barrage firing. Although LINCs are therefore distinct from nNOS-expressing neurogliaform cells, we were also able to label neurogliaform cells with our intersectional approach when the viral vector was injected instead near the stratum lacunosum moleculare/stratum radiatum area, where neurogliaform cells are especially dense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Price et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tricoire et al., 2010</xref>). It is likely that the small radius of neurogliaform cells’ axonal and dendritic arbors limits uptake of the virus unless the injection is made in close proximity to the location of their cell bodies, and this in turn contributes to the labeling of LINCs (rather than neurogliaform cells) with our specific experimental approaches.</p><p>Another population of neurons that are reported to express nNOS are a subtype of interneuron selective interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acsády et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gulyás et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tricoire et al., 2010</xref>) that display complex or ‘hooked’ after-hyperpolarizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tricoire et al., 2010</xref>), and, importantly, express both VIP and CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tricoire et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tricoire et al., 2011</xref>). As very few eYFP-labeled cells in this study expressed either VIP or CR (and even fewer both; 8.8% were VIP+, 4.0% were CR+, and 3.3% were both VIP+ and CR+), it appears that our intersectional approach did not target nNOS+/VIP+/CR+ interneuron selective interneurons. Although the dendritic and axonal arbor of interneuron-selective interneurons is not as tight as that of neurogliaform cells, it is possible that the relative sparsity of the nNOS+ subtype of interneuron-selective interneurons prevented their noticeable labeling in our study; it has been reported that only 7% of all nNOS-positive CA1 interneurons are also VIP+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tricoire et al., 2010</xref>). It is also worth noting that the relative lack of VIP co-expression in LINCs additionally distinguishes LINCs from recently identified VIP+ CA1 inhibitory projection cells (which project to the subiculum; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Francavilla et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Neocortical NOS-type I cells, like LINCs, have long-range projections and express nNOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tomioka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tricoire and Vitalis, 2012</xref>), but the existence of hippocampal Type I-like cells has been somewhat controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fuentealba et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Quattrocolo et al., 2017</xref>). However, using gene expression profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Harris et al., 2018</xref>), a population of CA1 cells believed to correspond to ‘back-projection’ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Klausberger, 2009</xref>) have been identified as being similar to neocortical NOS-type I cells, because of their shared and consistently high levels of both SOM and NPY expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sik et al., 1994</xref>). Back-projecting cells target other hippocampal subfields including CA3 and the dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Klausberger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sik et al., 1994</xref>). Although a small subset of LINCs may match back-projecting, NOS-type I-like cells, this would be a very small subset. Although 46.9% of CA1 eYFP+ cells expressed NPY, only 4.9% expressed SOM, and only 1.8% were immunopositive for both NPY and SOM. Similarly, we noted no axonal drumstick-like appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gulyás et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sik et al., 1994</xref>) on LINCs. Therefore, few, if any, LINCs have characteristics reminiscent of back-projecting or NOS-type I-like cells. It is also worth noting that there may be differences in both expression profiles based on gene expression in dissociated cells and expression profiles based on immunohistochemistry in fixed tissue. These differences can stem from changes in expression during the dissociation process as well as from differing levels of sensitivity. Even within immunohistochemical profiles, sizeable differences in labeling can result from differing protocols, different activity levels, and dendritic versus somatic expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the use of immunohistochemical profiles best allowed us to compare LINCs to other hippocampal populations, as the vast majority of previous literature describing hippocampal populations has used immunohistochemistry-based approaches to label neurons.</p><p>An additional previously identified population of GABAergic CA1 cells with extrahippocampal projections are hippocampal-septal (or double-projection; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jinno et al., 2007</xref>) cells. Like LINCs, these cells reside in the stratum oriens of CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso and Köhler, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deller and Leranth, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Freund and Buzsáki, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gulyás et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jinno et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mattis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Villette et al., 2016</xref>), and, as the name suggests, they project to the medial septum/diagonal band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso and Köhler, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Toth et al., 1993</xref>). The vast majority (in our hands, ≥80% [data not shown]) of hippocampal-septal cells express SOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jinno et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Villette et al., 2016</xref>). As LINCs project to the medial septum, and some eYFP+ cells that were co-labeled with Fluorogold after injection into the medial septum were also SOM+, it is likely that there is some overlap between LINCs and previously identified hippocampal-septal cells. However, as LINCs robustly project to areas that SOM+ hippocampal-septal cells do not (e.g. the tenia tecta; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), and as the vast majority of LINCs do not express SOM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), the overlap between LINCs and SOM+ hippocampal-septal cells is limited (~5% of LINCs are SOM+).</p><p>Other described hippocampal GABAergic projection neurons include trilaminar cells (which reside in the oriens of CA1, locally have axons that target stratum oriens, pyramidale, and radiatum, and have long-range projections to the subiculum and possibly other cortical areas) and oriens-retrohippocampal cells (which also reside in the oriens of CA1 and project to ‘retrohippocampal’ areas, which in this context include the subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum, entorhinal cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and/or indusium griseum) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jinno et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Klausberger, 2009</xref>). Any overlap between these cells and LINCs appears to be minimal, as these cells typically strongly express the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 (M2R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jinno et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Klausberger, 2009</xref>), and very few LINCs are M2R immunopositive.</p><p>Previously, hippocampal non-pyramidal neurons, including in CA1, with projections to the supramammillary region were noted in cat tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ino et al., 1988</xref>), but their identity was otherwise entirely unknown. Our data suggest that at least some of these observed non-pyramidal projection neurons may have been LINCs.</p><p>We and others have reported that a percentage of hippocampal PV+ cells can also have long-range projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Christenson Wick et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eyre and Bartos, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Goodman and Sloviter, 1992</xref>). Specifically, sparse PV commissural connections to the contralateral hippocampal formation have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Christenson Wick et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eyre and Bartos, 2019</xref>). LINCs, too, appear to have sparse commissural connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the majority of LINCs were PV-immunonegative, again arguing for limited overlap with this previously described cell group. LINCs are further distinguishable from PV cells in a number of ways. (1) LINCs display a regular spiking non-pyramidal firing pattern, whereas PV cells are fast spiking with tight action potential widths. (2) Optogenetic activation of LINCs can produce a postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> response, whereas optogenetic activation of PV cells with similar experimental conditions produces a pure GABA<sub>A</sub> response (data not shown). Note that while this distinguishes LINCs from PV cells, a postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> response following the optogenetic activation of other cell types has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nichol et al., 2018</xref>), and neurogliaform cells are able to produce a postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> response following a single action potential in a single neurogliaform cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Oláh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Price et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tamás, 2003</xref>). (3) PV cells preferentially target dPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Valero et al., 2015</xref>), whereas LINCs appear to target both dPCs and sPCs equally. This would place LINCs in a position where they are potentially able to coordinate activity between these two information streams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Krook-Magnuson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Valero and de la Prida, 2018</xref>) in a way that PV cells could not. It is important to note, however, that the apparent equal targeting of dPCs and sPCs by LINCs was observed with optogenetic manipulation while recording from PCs at varying anterior-posterior and proximal-distal positions. The increased variability introduced by this diverse sampling may have masked subtle differences in targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cembrowski and Spruston, 2019</xref>). Similarly, optogenetically activating LINCs (as a population) may have masked potential LINC-subpopulation target selectivity. However, optogenetic activation of PV cells was reported to allow detection of the selective targeting of dPCs by PV cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it appears that LINCs provide broader inhibition within CA1 than PV cells.</p><p>The broad local targeting by LINCs additionally highlights potential differences between LINCs and some other long-range inhibitory projection neurons. Specifically, CA1 VIP+ neurons that project to the subiculum locally target interneurons selectively in CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Francavilla et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, interneurons, rather than pyramidal cells, were reported to be the hippocampal targets of hippocampal-septal cells on the basis of electron microscopy analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gulyás et al., 2003</xref>). However, other reports suggest that hippocampal-septal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Takács et al., 2008</xref>), double-projection cells (which are hippocampal-septal cells with additional projections to the subiculum) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jinno et al., 2007</xref>), and oriens-retrohippocampal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jinno et al., 2007</xref>) predominantly target pyramidal cells locally instead. Trilaminar cells are reported to preferentially innervate interneurons in CA1, but also to target pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ferraguti et al., 2005</xref>). Our results suggest that, collectively, LINCs broadly target CA1 pyramidal cells <italic>and</italic> CA1 inhibitory neurons alike. As LINCs target CA1 pyramidal cells and inhibitory neurons, they are in a position to both inhibit pyramidal cells directly and potentially to disinhibit pyramidal cells (via inhibition of inhibition).</p><p>High postsynaptic connectivity and long-range projections are reminiscent of early-generated (EG), GABAergic hub cells, which are capable of orchestrating network-wide synchronous activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonifazi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Picardo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Villette et al., 2016</xref>). Similar to LINCs, hub cells are unified by their widespread axonal arborization, but they display some morphological heterogeneity in both axonal structure (i.e., some hub cells are perisomatic targeting [compare to LINC in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>] whereas others have dendritically targeting axons [compare to LINC in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonifazi et al., 2009</xref>) and dendritic morphology (including cells with largely horizontal or largely vertical dendrites) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Picardo et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, both EG GABAergic hub cells and LINCs have broad hippocampal and extrahippocampal targets. However, LINCs also have notable differences when compared to EG hub cells, including electrophysiological properties (recorded EG cells had irregular/stuttering or burst adapting firing patterns) and expression levels of SOM (prevalent in EG hub cells) and nNOS (uncommon in EG hub cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Picardo et al., 2011</xref>).In addition, EG GABAergic hub cells are reported to be generated before E10.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Picardo et al., 2011</xref>), whereas BrdU labeling of LINCs peaked around E11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In summary, while LINCs have features that are reminiscent of other hippocampal GABAergic cells, no previously described cell population adequately captures their collective identity.</p><p>Given the extensive prior examination of inhibitory neurons in CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Freund and Buzsáki, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>), it seems surprising that any cell population, especially one with such widespread connections as LINCs, would have evaded prior characterization. In this regard, it is important to consider that nNOS-expressing cells in the SO and SP with dendrites suggestive of LINCs have indeed been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Freund and Buzsáki, 1996</xref>), but that further investigation was hampered. Many different factors have probably contributed to the prior difficulty in studying these cells. First, nNOS immunohistochemistry is notoriously challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burette et al., 2002</xref>), and LINCs can express relatively low levels of nNOS, as well as dendritically concentrated nNOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burette et al., 2002</xref>), which further complicates easy detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, we found that other common long-range projection molecular markers are insufficient for labeling LINCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Similarly, although NADPH-d staining was previously able to identify axon fragments in the fimbria, the reaction was unable to label axons fully, and therefore their sources and trajectories could not be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Higo et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, as nNOS is expressed in other CA1 populations, identifying LINCs on the basis of immunohistochemistry alone becomes extremely difficult, as the morphology may not be sufficiently visible. Indeed, as even pyramidal cells express nNOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burette et al., 2002</xref>), taking a simple nNOS-Cre based approach to target LINCs transgenically or virally would be insufficient. Consequently, the recently developed intersectional approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fenno et al., 2014</xref>) was key. Our selective labeling of LINCs was also due to a degree of serendipity, as other interneuron populations that also express nNOS have more restricted processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armstrong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Freund and Buzsáki, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tricoire and Vitalis, 2012</xref>). Similarly, retrograde-based labeling or expression systems suffer from the relative rarity of LINCs and the fact that many of the areas targeted by LINCs are also targeted by other cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arszovszki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cenquizca and Swanson, 2007</xref>), which may have overwhelmed the ability to identify LINCs previously, especially those residing in the stratum pyramidale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gulyás et al., 2003</xref>). Although significant trouble shooting may be required, the labeling of LINCs in non-transgenic animals (including wildtype mice, rats, or other species) may be possible in future work, for example through a combination of the recently developed vectors that use the Dlx enhancer to limit expression to inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dimidschstein et al., 2016</xref>) and an additional approach to limit expression to, for example, cells that project to the tenia tecta. In light of the numerous complications in selectively labeling and identifying LINCs, it is not entirely surprisingly that LINCs have largely evaded previous consideration.</p><p>To begin to explore whether LINCs could have a functional impact on hippocampal function, we optogenetically activated LINCs, including during the ORM and OLM tasks. Disrupting the native activity patterns of LINCs in this way (via synchronous activation at ~7 Hz) altered on-going theta oscillations in the hippocampus and impaired performance on the spatial OLM task. Notably, we manipulated LINCs during both encoding and retrieval portions of the OLM, and therefore we are unable to discern whether these effects were due to impairments in encoding and/or to impairments in retrieval specifically. However, our data do illustrate that the impairment in the OLM task was not due to general indifference to the objects or, for example, to motor deficits, because a similar amount of time was spent exploring the objects in total (there was no preferential investigation of the object in the novel location). Development of novel tools (e.g., an intersectional version of an inhibitory opsin) will allow us in the future to examine the impact of the selective silencing (rather than activation) of LINCs on hippocampal oscillations and performance of spatial tasks. Future work will also answer important additional questions, including which cells are targeted by LINCs in downstream areas, what excitatory, inhibitory, and modulatory input do LINCs receive, and when are LINCs natively active.</p><p>To further explore the ability of LINCs to alter hippocampal oscillations, we stimulated LINCs at a range of frequencies. We found that optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal LINCs not only altered hippocampal oscillatory activity across a wide range of frequencies, but also altered oscillatory activity in the tenia tecta, a forebrain region receiving input from LINCs. Moreover, we found an increase in coherence between the tenia tecta and the hippocampus during optogenetic activation of LINCs. Increased synchrony or coherence between brain regions can be task-induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hoffmann and Berry, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wikgren et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yu and Krook-Magnuson, 2015</xref>), is believed to allow coordinated activity and efficient information transfer between regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buzsáki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Colgin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fries, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Singer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sirota et al., 2008</xref>), including between the dorsal hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hyman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jones and Wilson, 2005</xref>), and can correlate with memory and task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hyman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jones and Wilson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Spellman et al., 2015</xref>).

LINCs have a broad impact on the hippocampus, and appear to play a role in coordinating hippocampal and extrahippocampal activity.

On the following (training/encoding) day, two identical objects (or two cotton swabs scented with the same odorant) were introduced to the arena and mice were allowed to explore for 10 min. On the third (testing/retrieval) day, two objects (or cotton swabs) were again placed in the arenas and mice were allowed to explore for 5 min. For the OLM, the objects remained the same on the testing/retrieval day, and one of the objects was moved to a new location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). For the ORM/OdorRM tests, the location of objects/odors was constant, but one of the objects/odors was replaced with a new object/odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>A train of blue light (5.0 ± 2.8 mW, Plexon PlexBright blue LED #94002–002 and driver #51382) pulses at approximately 7 Hz frequency (50 ms on, 100 ms off; as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Krook-Magnuson et al., 2013</xref>) was delivered for 3 s through the optical patch cable to the dorsal hippocampus once every 30 s during the training and testing periods. Training and testing sessions were video-recorded and manually analyzed for time spent exploring each of the two objects/cotton swabs by an experimenter blinded to mouse genotype. Object/odor investigation time was defined in the videos as the period when the mouse’s nose was within 1 cm of the object/cotton swab’s edge and oriented towards the object/cotton swab, excluding the time when the mouse was engaged in non-investigative behaviors (e.g. grooming or digging). A discrimination index (DI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Vogel-Ciernia and Wood, 2014</xref>) was calculated for the testing day by subtracting the time spent investigating the familiar object/odor from the time spent investigating the novel object/odor and dividing the result by the total time investigating both objects/odors, and multiplying this number by 100. Animals with a DI of greater than ± 20 on the encoding day were excluded (n = 6 animals), as were animals that investigated the objects for less than 3 s (ORM/OLM, n = 1 animal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Vogel-Ciernia and Wood, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zeidler et al., 2018</xref>) or 2 s (OdorRM, n = 5 animals) during either training or testing. Note that animals displayed relatively low investigation times during the OdorRM task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), and the exclusion criteria for that task was adjusted to 2 s accordingly. In addition, two positive animals were excluded for a lack of expression of the virus and a further two animals were excluded for viral expression mis-targeted to the dentate gyrus rather than CA1. These same four animals excluded for lack of expression or viral mis-targeting were also excluded from in vivo electrophysiology experiments (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>In vivo electrophysiology recordings</title><p>After behavioral testing, electrical patch cables were connected to the hippocampal and tenia tecta electrode pedestals. The electrical LFP signal (the local differential between the tips of the twisted wires of the electrode) was amplified 5,000–10,000 times (Brownlee Precision 410, Neurophase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armstrong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Krook-Magnuson et al., 2013</xref>). A series of blue light stimulations was delivered to the dorsal hippocampus. These stimulations included the stimulation parameters used during behavioral training/testing as well as frequencies ranging from 2 Hz to 100 Hz (delivered in randomly assigned order, 30 s intertrial interval, light pulse width 5 ms, except for 7 Hz stimulation which matched the light stimulation protocol from behavioral testing [50 ms pulse width]).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed in Matlab R2014b and 2018a (including the Matlab Statistical Toolbox), and OriginPro 2016. A <italic>p</italic> value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are shown as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) unless otherwise specified. Median is shown for postsynaptic responses, as the data were strongly not normally distributed. For statistical analyses, planned group sizes were based on a priori power analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Faul et al., 2007</xref>) using preliminary data, the literature, and previous experience for estimates of variability and effect sizes. Actual group sizes are a combination of these planned group sizes and exclusions, as outlined above. In some cases, extra data were available (e.g. LFP traces of responses to light at a given frequency) and were included (i.e. data were not excluded if our final sample size after exclusions exceeded our a priori planned sample size). To ensure robust data sets when no statistical comparisons were made (e.g. immunohistochemistry), we collected data from three animals, counting cells in every other or every fourth section across the entire anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axis of the hippocampus.</p><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Ex vivo electrophysiological recordings</title><p>The electrophysiological properties of LINCs were post-hoc compared across section orientation (n = 5 coronal, 18 sagittal), animal sex (n = 15 female, 8 male), virus injection location (n = 13 dorsal, 10 ventral/posterior), morphology of dendrites (n = 11 horizontal, 10 vertical; 2 cells’ dendrites were not recovered and were excluded from this analysis), and cell body location (n = 16 in the stratum oriens/alveus, 7 in the stratum pyramidale) using Mann-Whitney tests. There were no significant differences between section orientation, sex, or virus injection location, and these variables were collapsed in further analyses. Potential differences between LINCs with different dendritic morphologies were noted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> provides Bonferroni corrected alpha).</p><p>Postsynaptic response amplitudes were compared across cell types using a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA (K-W) and post hoc two-tailed Mann-Whitney (M-W) tests when appropriate.

For each animal and each light-delivery frequency, traces (sampled at 1000 Hz) for both the hippocampal and the tenia tecta locations were aligned to onset of light delivery. The first step in analysis was to then remove traces that were likely to contain movement artifact: traces with a range (defined as the maximum recorded voltage value in the trace minus the minimum value) greater than two times the average range of all traces for that animal at that light-delivery frequency and electrode location were removed prior to further analysis, leaving on average approximately 110 traces for each animal at each of 26 different light-delivery frequencies.</p><p>In a subset of analyses, in order to evaluate how optogenetic ~7 Hz stimulation of LINCs impacted theta oscillations specifically during theta states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), traces with a theta-to-delta ratio greater than 4.5 in the 3 s prior to light delivery were selected, with theta and delta ranges defined as 5–12 Hz and 1–3 Hz, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buzsáki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Düzel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gereke et al., 2018</xref>). For visualization, these traces were bandpass filtered to the theta range (5–12 Hz) using Matlab’s bandpass function.</p><p>To calculate the percent change in power at the stimulation frequency for each stimulation frequency for each animal, first the bandpower at the stimulation frequency (using a one hertz band centered around the stimulation frequency) was calculated for both the 3 s prior to light-delivery (i.e. baseline) and the 3 s during light delivery for each trial. These values were then averaged across trials, and the power during light was expressed as a percent increase over baseline for each mouse at each stimulation frequency by recording location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The Chronux library was similarly used to calculate the trial averaged coherence between the two locations (hippocampus and tenia tecta), both for the 3 s prior to light delivery (baseline) and for the 3 s during light delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mitra and Bokil, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mitra et al., 2018</xref>). Increase in mean coherence at the stimulation frequency (±0.5 Hz) was then expressed as a percent increase from baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To visualize the percent change in power across frequencies during light delivery per location, genotype, and stimulation frequency, differential (i.e., percent increase) spectrograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s4">4</xref>) were created as follows. For this analysis, stimulation frequencies plotted were limited to up to 40 Hz. Using Chronux, a trial averaged moving time spectogram was created for each animal/light-delivery combination for the 3 s prior to light delivery (baseline), using a moving window size of 1 s and a step size of 0.1 s. The calculated power per frequency bin was then averaged across the 3 s baseline time period. These averaged baseline values were then used to calculate the percent increase for the 3 s of light stimulation (again, using a 1 s window and 0.1 s step size). The resulting spectrograms were then averaged across animals according to genotype, by recording location (displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s4">4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Custom software availability</title><p>Custom MATLAB code is available through GitHub at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/KM-Lab/SpectrumAndCoherence">https://github.com/KM-Lab/SpectrumAndCoherence</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Krook-Magnuson, 2019</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/eLifeProduction/SpectrumAndCoherence">https://github.com/eLifeProduction/SpectrumAndCoherence</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Gord Fishell and his lab, including Robert Machold, Goichi Miyoshi, and Rowena Turnbull, for providing the Dlx5/6-Flpe and RCE:dual reporter mouse lines, and Karl Deisseroth and Charu Ramakrishnan for the intersectional virus.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A novel population of long-range inhibitory neurons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper describes a subpopulation of hippocampal GABAergic neurons which have an axon that targets extrahippocampal areas, a so-called long-range GABAergic neuron. These cells were discovered using intersectional approaches by injecting a Cre- and Flp- dependent virus carrying ChR2 expression in nNos-Cre x DLX-Flp mice. The authors note that their discovery was serendipitous, possibly related to the viral serotype and site of injection. They name these cells LINCs (long-range inhibitory nNOS-expressing cells) and study them morphologically, neurochemically and electrophysiologically (in vitro). By exploiting optogenetic approaches in vivo, they also characterize the behavioral and network effect of activating these cells with object recognition tasks and hippocampal/frontal lobe (tenia tecta) LFP recordings, respectively.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) It is not clear LINCs are a subtype of GABAergic neuron or a subtype of a subtype that is already known.</p><p>LINCS do not appear to fit a single category neither in morphological (vertical dendrites, horizontal, intermixed), neurochemical (N2R+, SOM+, PV+) and electrophysiologically. They seem to be a kind of hippocampo-septal cell but not only that, because they also project to the tenia tecta etc. According to single-cell transcriptomic data in Harris et al. PLoS Biol, Nos1+ cells are quite diverse. If authors feel this is a novel population, they should try to evaluate some of the novel classes identified by Harris et al., or maybe a combination of markers whenever possible.</p><p>Quantification of the population and innervation of regions such as the tenia tecta will help address the importance and definition of the LINCs.</p><p>Comparison of the measured endpoints to other GABAergic cell types would also be useful.</p><p>2) What is the explanation of the serendipity?</p><p>– Serendipity should be debugged to facilitate investigation by different labs in the future. For example, if serotype is the issue, what serotypes were tested. If site of injection is important, what coordinates? Is expression resulting from the interaction between the double transgenic animal (nNos-Cre x DLX-Flp) and the serotype or the promoter or the combination of both?</p><p>– Given that the expression of nNOS and SOM may be weak in the rodent hippocampus, one can imagine that mild transcriptional regulation by the intersectional approach may cause variable expression levels. The authors need to somehow test for this factor in their analysis. For instance, the relatively low expression levels of SOM, M2R and PV in LINCS (Figure 2B) suggests there should be a proportion of nNOS+ GABAergic negative for all these markers. Can the authors estimate similar numbers in WT mice with multiplexed immunostaining?</p><p>3) Numerous problems detract related to the presentation should be corrected. They relate to the order of presentation, the methods, or conceptual content.</p><p>4) Title: If proof that LINCs are a singular type of GABAergic neuron is not possible, the conclusions in the Title and elsewhere should be softened.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Novel long-range inhibitory nNOS-expressing hippocampal cells&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Laura Colgin (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and one reviewer.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are three remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Given morphological and neurochemical heterogeneity of LINCs, could the authors further clarify if they think LINCs are a new, separate type of nNOS+ GABAergic neuron or are a subtype?</p><p>2) Regarding the potential causes of the 'serendipitous&quot; identification of LINCs, illustrated in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, the effect of the line (the DUAL reporter line) and AAV injections are not shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2. These data should be added to Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><p>3) Regarding the idea to describe LINCs in wild type mice, can the authors either attempt it or could they discuss the issue and its associated difficulties in the text (i.e. difficulties of confirming LINC cell-types in WT mice)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Authors have addressed all my concerns. I would like to thank them for a thorough revision. The new narrative facilitates understanding and new data/analysis address my major points. In particular, authors provide additional immunostaining and birthdating data to support that LINCs may be a separate type of nNOS+ GABAergic cells. Whether they are a single population is still not clear (they are intrinsically heterogenous) but authors have softened the claim in title and text.</p><p>Another major point was overcoming serendipity of the discovery. The revised version directly address this point by evaluating the impact of the transgenic lines, viral serotype and injections. Authors argue that the intersectional approach is robust for simple AAV construct (Con/Fon) without the DJ serotype provided injection site is localized at the stratum oriens in their Cre/Flpe animals. Thus, the viral injection location appear a critical factor and it is illustrated in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, but neither the effect of the line (DUAL reporter line) nor AAV injections are shown. I would ask authors to add these data to Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><p>The only critical experiment they did not attempt was checking for putative LINCs in wild-type mice. Authors argue they will hardly separate them from neurogliaform cells based on multiplexed IH. However, they seem convinced about such a segregation in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 (blue are LINC, pink dots are neurogliaform) in terms of location, somatic size, etc.., which could inform debugging WT data. For instance, establishing similarities between somatic size, dendritic orientation and some markes can be helpful (based in Freund and Buzsaki description), even if not 100% confirmed. This is possibly the weakest part of the paper, as one can be left with the impression that LINC are just some by-product of the intersectional approach. Having said that, I still feel this paper is an important addition to the field even if those concerns remain. My only point is to highlight the issue in the text (i.e. difficulties of confirming LINC cell-types in WT mice).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46816.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) It is not clear LINCs are a subtype of GABAergic neuron or a subtype of a subtype that is already known.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added new data, additional analysis, and have rearranged the text and expanded the Discussion section to clarify and better address how LINCs compare to previously described hippocampal cell populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>LINCS do not appear to fit a single category neither in morphological (vertical dendrites, horizontal, intermixed), neurochemical (N2R+, SOM+, PV+) and electrophysiologically.

The authors need to somehow test for this factor in their analysis. For instance, the relatively low expression levels of SOM, M2R and PV in LINCS (Figure 2B) suggests there should be a proportion of nNOS+ GABAergic negative for all these markers. Can the authors estimate similar numbers in WT mice with multiplexed immunostaining?</p></disp-quote><p>We have additionally tested for co-labeling of LINCs with other molecular markers including NPY, VIP, and CR and have added immunohistochemical multiplexing data (Figure 5). While nNOS cells with similar morphological properties to LINCs were previously described in wild type animals in Freund and Buzsaki’s <italic>Interneurons of the Hippocampus</italic> (see page 400 of that publication), it is not straight forward to estimate their numbers using multiplexing, as neurogliaform cells can also express both nNOS and NPY (and do not express e.g. SOM, PV, etc). As such, estimating LINC numbers based on immuno-multiplexing in wild type mice was not attempted. Instead, eYFP cell counts in cNOS-fDLX mice are provided in subsection “LINCs impact hippocampal function”.</p><p>To further explore the conditions required for labeling of LINCs vs neurogliaform cells with our intersectional genetic viral vector approach, we have explored 1) expression in our Cre and Flp lines, by crossing with a DUAL reporter line, 2) expression following AAV5 injection, rather than the DJ serotype we standardly used in our experiments, and 3) expression following injections in/near the stratum lacunosum moleculare, instead of the location we standardly used in our experiments (stratum oriens). Based on these, we find that 1) Cre and Flp expression matches what would be expected (as previously reported), 2) the DJ serotype is not a strict requirement (as AAV5 is able to label LINCs as well), and 3) neurogliaform cells are also able to be labeled (but appear to require that the viral vector be injected near their soma/processes). This information has been added to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Numerous problems detract related to the presentation should be corrected.

I would like to thank them for a thorough revision. The new narrative facilitates understanding and new data/analysis address my major points. In particular, authors provide additional immunostaining and birthdating data to support that LINCs may be a separate type of nNOS+ GABAergic cells. Whether they are a single population is still not clear (they are intrinsically heterogenous) but authors have softened the claim in title and text.</p><p>Another major point was overcoming serendipity of the discovery. The revised version directly address this point by evaluating the impact of the transgenic lines, viral serotype and injections. Authors argue that the intersctional approach is robust for simple AAV construct (Con/Fon) without the DJ serotype provided injection site is localized at the stratum oriens in their Cre/Flpe animals. Thus, the viral injection location appear a critical factor and it is illustrated in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, but neither the effect of the line (DUAL reporter line) nor AAV injections are shown. I would ask authors to add these data to Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p></disp-quote><p>These images have been added to Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The only critical experiment they did not attempt was checking for putative LINCs in wild-type mice. Authors argue they will hardly separate them from neurogliaform cells based on multiplexed IH. However, they seem convinced about such a segregation in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 (blue are LINC, pink dots are neurogliaform) in terms of location, somatic size, etc.., which could inform debugging WT data. For instance, establishing similarities between somatic size, dendritic orientation and some markes can be helpful (based in Freund and Buzsaki description), even if not 100% confirmed. This is possibly the weakest part of the paper, as one can be left with the impression that LINC are just some by-product of the intersectional approach. Having said that, I still feel this paper is an important addition to the field even if those concerns remain. My only point is to highlight the issue in the text (i.e. difficulties of confirming LINC cell-types in WT mice).</p></disp-quote><p>Identifying putative neurogliaform cells versus LINCs based on morphology is possible in virally labeled cells in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 because the morphology is generally appropriately visible. Unfortunately, immunohistochemistry with relevant markers does not allow sufficient visualization of the morphology necessary to distinguish between these neuronal populations. Selective labeling of LINCs in WT animals will require a combinatorial viral approach. The Discussion section has been expanded to further discuss this issue.</p></body></sub-article></article>
