Memory B-cells can also re-instigate affinity maturation, but how this happens against antigenic variants is poorly understood despite its potential impact on driving broadly protective immunity against pathogens such as Influenza and Dengue. We immunised mice sequentially with identical or variant Dengue-virus envelope proteins and analysed antibody and germinal-centre (GC) responses. Variant protein boosts induced GCs with a higher proportion of IgM+ B cells. The most variant protein re-stimulated GCs with the highest proportion of IgM+ cells with the most diverse, least mutated V-genes and with a slower but efficient serum antibody response. Recombinant antibodies from GC B-cells showed a higher affinity for the variant antigen than antibodies from a primary response, confirming a memory origin. This reveals a new process of antibody memory, that IgM memory cells with fewer mutations participate in secondary responses to variant antigens, demonstrating how the hierarchical structure of B-cell memory is used and indicating the potential and limits of cross-reactive antibody based immunity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26832.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many devastating infectious diseases are caused by viruses that change over time. When a vaccine exists, it usually protects against a particular strain of virus, but often fails to defend against new versions of the microbe. This is why the flu vaccine has to be ‘updated’ every year, for example.</p><p>Vaccines rely on the memory of our immune system. When a virus enters the body, a group of immune cells known as B cells gets activated. Certain B cells can recognise the invader and produce specific proteins, the antibodies, which can target and kill the invader. During the infection some of these B cells become ‘memory B cells’, having gone through a maturation process that hones their ability to specifically recognize this particular microbe. If the same virus enters the organism again, the memory B cells rapidly identify it and produce a quicker and more efficient immune response than during the first attack. This is how vaccines work. However memory B cells may not be able to recognize a previous intruder if it has changed too much.</p><p>The memory B cell population is diverse. Some cells are fully mature and can quickly recognize the original virus. But others have not finished their maturation process: these cells are less focussed, and cannot target the original microbe with the same exact precision shown by mature memory cells. For almost forty years it was thought that this reduced focus might make the immature cells better at identifying new versions of the original attacker, but up until now, it was not clear what these memory cells could do.</p><p>Here Burton, Tennant et al. injected a group of mice with proteins from the Dengue virus, which prompted an immune reaction. After several weeks, the animals received either the same proteins again, or proteins that were different. Compared to the fully mature cells, the immature memory B cells were much better at recognizing the variants of the proteins, and these cells then multiplied and mounted an immune response. Without the original protein injection, the response without the immature memory B cells was not as efficient. The body therefore has a pool of memory B cells that can recognise a wider range of virus protein variants than the ones that caused the first immune reaction.</p><p>Understanding the role of immature memory B cells in immunity could help design vaccines that protect against several strains or fast-evolving viruses. This could have the potential to reduce the severity of diseases that affect hundreds of millions of people every year.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>antibody memory</kwd><kwd>Dengue virus</kwd><kwd>B-cell</kwd><kwd>antibody cross-reaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100115/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Harry N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Investigation of antibody responses to variant Dengue virus proteins demonstrate new mechanisms that could increase the potential for vaccines to protect against mutable pathogens such as Flu, Dengue and HIV.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antibody-based immunity is underpinned by memory B-cells that have undergone antibody somatic hyper-mutation (SHM) and selection for improved antigen binding in germinal centres (GCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">MacLennan et al., 1997</xref>).

This might be expected of antibodies from a day 7 primary response GC, and indicated they were overall of lower affinity. Other rAbs from this group showed evidence of weak binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">supplementary file 2</xref>), indicating that the rAb cloning efficiency for this group was not reduced and only the two strongest binders were above the ELISA titration threshold. All but one of the positive binding rAbs were IgM. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> shows the ELISA titration and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> the derived endpoint titres, which we are using as a proxy of affinity. A more strongly binding IgM rAb from E4 boost day 7, B5, and the only positive binding IgG1 rAb, G6, are indicated on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>. The positive-binding rAbs from E4 prime day 17 show a higher affinity than those from prime day 7, consistent with affinity maturation. Six of the seven positive-binding IgM rAbs from E4 boost day 7 show a higher affinity than the two strongest binding IgM rAbs from E4 prime day 7. This is consistent with pre-selection by the E3 prime immunization, and also considering the higher proportion of rAbs with an anti-E4 O.D. &gt; 0.1, implies the GC B-cells expressing these antibodies are memory derived. rAb affinities were generally low, which might be expected of IgMs particularly in early GCs. We estimated the Kd of rAbs B5 and G6 (an IgG1) as around 150 nm and 1 μm respectively (see Materials and methods). Other rAbs would be in the super-micromolar range. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref> shows the cross reactivity of rAbs with E3. Binding to E3 correlates with binding to E4, but because of the generally low rAb affinities we suggest that the antibodies cannot discriminate between similar epitopes. The higher affinity of E4 boost rAbs B5 and G6, and binding to E3, suggest they may have genuine specificity for E3, thus consistent with their derivation from anti-E3 memory. That rAb B5 is an IgM with only one VH (and one Vkappa) mutation, provides further support for the proposal of this study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The most variant protein we boosted with, E4, stimulated GCs with the highest proportion of IgM+ cells and with the lowest levels of VH gene mutation, greater VH-gene diversity, and a slower, more specific, serum IgG response that resulted in equivalent if not higher affinity, compared to the heterotypic E2 boost. This response was higher than the primary response to E4. IgM rAbs cloned from E4 boost day 7 GC showed a higher affinity for E4 than those from E4 primed day 7 GC, implying they were memory derived. This demonstrates that IgM memory cells with fewer mutations, from ‘lower’ levels of the memory compartment, participate in secondary responses to variant antigens, and further challenges the hypothesis that highly mutated, class-switched cells elicited by homotypic antigen boosting are a ‘mirror’ of the antibody memory compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Weiss and Rajewsky, 1990</xref>). The slower nature of the E4 boost serum response also suggests a lower level of immediate differentiation of memory cells into AFCs than seen with for example the homotypic or E2 response, and is consistent with reduced numbers of high affinity class-switched memory cells recognizing E4.</p><p>The serum antibody response to the closer variant, E2, was more rapid, more cross-reactive and evidenced some earlier affinity maturation. These observations are consistent with a response derived more from the ‘higher’ layers of the E3 specific memory compartment. The IgM +cells induced by E2 boosting have more mutations than after E4 boosting, indicating they are memory derived. As there are higher proportions of these IgM+ GC B-cells, with fewer mutations relative to the homotypic E3 boost, this provides further support for the hypothesis that IgM+ B cells with fewer mutations furnish memory responses to variant antigens</p><p>Naïve B-cells may contribute to the IgM+ GC B-cells we observe after E4 boosting, although the higher affinities of the rAbs from this group suggest many are memory derived. Also, the slightly higher median level of VH mutation and the higher levels of IgM+ GC B-cells after E4 boosting (2x) compared to priming, suggest IgM +memory B-cells are involved in the boost response consistent with the well established presence of IgM +memory cells with few or no mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dogan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pape et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kaji et al., 2012</xref>) and the known lower activation threshold of memory B-cells in response to antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Good and Tangye, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Whilst E3 specific memory cells may be expected to increase the anti-E3 titre when stimulated by a cross-reactive E4 boost, the small but not significant effect we observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) is consistent with the lowest affinity, least mutated, E3-specific memory cells being stimulated by an E4 boost. Antibodies from such cells may, therefore not add much to the already high, affinity matured, anti-E3 titre induced by E3 priming. The 14-fold higher anti-E4 titre at day 7 after boost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) versus day 17 after prime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) also argues for a significant contribution from B-cell memory.</p><p>The fusion-loop epitope in domain 2 of the dengue envelope protein is 100% conserved between strains and in humans, antibodies against this are prevalent in cross-reactive secondary responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chaudhury et al., 2017</xref>). The E2 boost response is consistent with this effect, especially considering the restricted clonality seen in VH sequences, but the low anti-E3 titre induced by E4 is not. A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chaudhury et al., 2017</xref>) showed that the mouse response to recombinant E-protein is predominantly focused on domain 3 of the protein, and so cross reactivity with the fusion loop epitope (domain 2) should be less dominant. While E2 and E4 are 68% and 63% overall identical to E3, in domain 3, a focus of mouse antibodies, they are 62% and 51% identical, a bigger difference in differences, helping explain the responses we observe here.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals, immunisations and antigens</title><p>Female 8–11 week old BALB/c mice were purchased from Charles River, U.K. Primary immunisations were intra-peritoneal (IP) with 25 μg recombinant Dengue envelope protein (Biorbyt, UK) precipitated in alum with 2 × 10<sup>7</sup> heat-killed <italic>B.pertussis</italic>.

The affinity (Kd) of rAbs B5 and G6 (the two strongest binding rAbs) was estimated from the inflection point of the ELISA titration curve as indicating 50% maximal binding, and on the assumption that at these higher antibody concentrations binding of rAB to immobilized antigen will have a minor effect on concentration of unbound rAb.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Variant proteins stimulate more IgM+ GC B-cells revealing a mechanism of cross-reactive recognition by antibody memory&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Arup Chakraborty, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and also acted as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, the authors study whether cross-reactive memory B cells re-instigate GCs upon sequential immunization with variant antigens. They also study which types of memory B cells initiate such GCs. Toward this end, they prime with a particular strain of dengue virus envelope protein (E3) and then boost with either one of two variants, E2 and E4. E2 has 68% sequence identity with E3 while E4 has 63% . Memory B cell cross reactivity has been previously discussed by several groups, but the present study could be valuable in showing its existence in virus polyepitopic antigens, rather than the monoepitope hapten-carrier system.</p><p>The main finding is that variant proteins (dengue virus) tend to induce germinal centers (GCs) with higher levels of IgM+ memory B cells than the wild type immunizing protein in a mouse model. The most variant protein induced the highest proportion of IgM+ memory cells and a slower IgG response. These findings are potentially interesting and valuable. However, some significant concerns that need to be addressed are noted below. Some of these points involve making clarifications or elaboration of existing data, and only a few new experiments are required.</p><p>Essential points:</p><p>1) One major criticism is that the authors are not able to determine whether the IgM+ GC cells are derived from activated naive B cells or from IgM memory B cells. They also do not clone any mAbs from the GC B cells to analyze binding cross-reactivity (only sequence data is shown). The paper would be considerably stronger with this data.</p><p>2) Figure 1 D and F: The authors show that boosting with E4 did not significantly increase the serum titer to E3 at day 7 or 14. However, the anti-E4 titer rose significantly by day 7. Since a boost alone did not induce a detectable titer by day 7, the authors conclude that the E4 boost response is due to cross-reactive memory cells rather than naïve B cells. If this is the case, how do the authors explain the lack of rise in the E3 titer after E4 boosting? Presumably any cross-reactive memory B cells would have been first induced by the E3 prime and therefore should also cross-react with E3. Furthermore, the fusion loop is 100% conserved between the four serotypes of dengue, and previous studies have shown that this antigenic region is immunodominant in the context of a secondary response. Given this, it is surprising that there are apparently few to no cross-reactive memory B cells in the E3 primed mice that are recalled in response to E4 boost. The authors should comment on this unexpected finding. A related point is why slightly different sequence identities between E2 and E3 and E4 and E3 resulted in such big differences.

However, it is unclear whether these IgM+ B cells originate from naïve or memory B cell precursors. How do the average levels of SHM in these cells compare to the day 7 levels of SHM in IgM+ GC B cells of mice that were boosted with E4 in the absence of an E3 prime (i.e. a true naïve response)?</p><p>5) The authors show that the VH sequences sampled at day 7 from the E2 boosted mice were biased toward two VH germline genes. Since these VH were also present in the homotypic E3 boost day 7 samples, the authors conclude that these cells likely originate from E3-induced memory B cells. Although these data show that there is significant skewing in the E2 boosted mice, there are very few B cells in the E3 boosted mice that utilize these V-genes (depending on the mouse). For example, there is no VH14-3 usage in mouse#1, that 1 out of 14 VH genes sequenced (joined with J4 and IgHD2-1*01) in mouse #2 and that 2 out of 15 VH genes sequenced (joined with J4 and either with IGHD2-12*01 or IGHD2-14*01) in mouse #3. This sequencing data is not strong enough to support the conclusion that antibodies utilizing these germline genes are derived from cross-reactive memory B cells.</p><p>6) Figure 3. The authors claim that the boost with E4 elicited a slower, more &quot;naïve-like&quot; response compared to the E2 boost. However, without showing the responses in a E4 immunized mouse that did not receive an E3-prime (a true naïve response), this conclusion is not strongly supported.</p><p>7) In Figure 3 A and B, the competition assay for affinity measurement in E2 or E4 boosted serum for E2 and E4 target, respectively, is complicated and not accurate. The authors should perform antigen-specific ELISAs for the anti-Dengue antibodies, both in the absence and in the presence of urea 7M. This is a well-established assay used to test antibody affinities (Wong-Baeza, et al., Frontiers in Immunology. 2016, Khurana et al., Sci Transl Med, 2011; Puschnik et al., PLoS Negl Trop Dis, 2013; Westerlund et al., Clin Exp Immunol, 2007).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Variant proteins stimulate more IgM+ GC B-cells revealing a mechanism of cross-reactive recognition by antibody memory&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

They also do not clone any mAbs from the GC B cells to analyze binding cross-reactivity (only sequence data is shown). The paper would be considerably stronger with this data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this criticism and this is an important issue. Whilst such work is a major plan of ours, we consider, however, that the comprehensive level of antibody cloning, and the likely adoptive cell transfers necessary to address these issues, are beyond the scope of this article. We wrote to your journal stating this and you sent the following reply:</p><p>“We agree that making the mAbs would take some time. This should be done for a full picture. However if the authors are seeing this as a short report in which there are a number of unanswered questions and in which they lay out the caveats and limitations of their study clearly, and they describe what still needs to be done, that would be sufficient”</p><p>In response to this we have inserted the following paragraphs into the Discussion:</p><p>“We have not identified a possible contribution of naïve B-cells to the IgM+ GC B-cells we observe after E4 boosting. […] As there are higher proportions of these IgM+ GC B-cells, with fewer mutations relative to the E3 boost, this provides good support for the hypothesis that IgM+ B-cells with fewer mutations furnish memory responses to variant antigens and further challenges the old hypothesis that high affinity, highly mutated, class-switched cells elicited by homotypic antigen boosting are a ‘mirror’ of the antibody memory compartment (Weiss and Rajewsky, 1990)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1 D and F: The authors show that boosting with E4 did not significantly increase the serum titer to E3 at day 7 or 14. However, the anti-E4 titer rose significantly by day 7. Since a boost alone did not induce a detectable titer by day 7, the authors conclude that the E4 boost response is due to cross-reactive memory cells rather than naïve B cells. If this is the case, how do the authors explain the lack of rise in the E3 titer after E4 boosting? Presumably any cross-reactive memory B cells would have been first induced by the E3 prime and therefore should also cross-react with E3. Furthermore, the fusion loop is 100% conserved between the four serotypes of dengue, and previous studies have shown that this antigenic region is immunodominant in the context of a secondary response. Given this, it is surprising that there are apparently few to no cross-reactive memory B cells in the E3 primed mice that are recalled in response to E4 boost. The authors should comment on this unexpected finding. A related point is why slightly different sequence identities between E2 and E3 and E4 and E3 resulted in such big differences. A description of how E3, E2 and E4 differ in their antigenic epitopes might help clarify these points.</p></disp-quote><p>These are important points and we consider that clarification of them has enhanced the article. In the un-revised manuscript results we commented ‘E4 boosting did not significantly increase the anti-E3 titre, even by day 17, showing the E4 variant boost had not induced a significant anti-E3 antibody memory response or the induced antibodies had a low affinity for E3.’</p><p>To properly address these points we have added a paragraph to the Discussion:</p><p>“Whilst E3 specific memory cells may be expected to increase the anti-E3 titre when stimulated by a cross-reactive E4 boost, the small but not significant effect we observe (Figure 1D) is consistent with the lowest affinity, least mutated, E3-specific memory cells being stimulated by an E4 boost. […] While E2 and E4 are 68% and 63% overall identical to E3, in domain 3, a focus of mouse antibodies, they are 62% and 51% identical, a bigger difference in differences, helping explain the different responses we observe here. Over domains 1 + 2 they are equally different, 82%, from E3.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Previous studies have shown that IgG memory B cells have an increased propensity to differentiate into plasmablasts, whereas IgM memory cells preferentially enter GCs. Did the magnitude of the plasmablast response in the spleen or blood of the immunized mice differ between the E3 boosted mice versus the E2 or E4 boosted mice?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good question. We have not analysed the plasmablast cell response and so cannot directly address this point. Consideration of the serum IgG titres as a proxy for plasmablast levels, however, is informative particularly for comparing the E2 and E4 responses (as there was a low IgG titre against both prior to boosting (unlike with E3)). E2 boosting induced large increases in serum IgG, and relative avidity (new Figure 3A) by day 7. This is consistent with the induction of a strong GC-independent plasmablast response derived from memory cells, many of which are likely to be IgG+ (Dogan et al., 2009; Pape et al., 2011). Contrastingly, the slower and lower serum IgG response to E4 boosting, and the low avidity at day 7 (new Figure 3A) implies a smaller and lower avidity GC-independent plasmablast response, probably due to greater antigenic difference, that is nevertheless much larger than the primary response (see our response to point 2)</p><p>We consider it difficult to improve the manuscript to further deal with these issues, and have amended the the second sentence of the Discussion: “All these observations together are consistent with the [E4] response being of an ‘in-between’ type, with lower levels of immediate differentiation of memory cells into antibody forming cells than seen with for example the E2 response.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is interesting that the level of VH mutation (Figure 2F) in IgM+ GC B cells on day 7 (post-boost) is lowest in the E4 boosted mice. However, it is unclear whether these IgM+ B cells originate from naïve or memory B cell precursors. How do the average levels of SHM in these cells compare to the day 7 levels of SHM in IgM+ GC B cells of mice that were boosted with E4 in the absence of an E3 prime (i.e. a true naïve response)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for making this comment. In response we have undertaken an analysis of the primary antibody and GC response to E4. We have added a new figure and section in results to report this. The levels of VH mutation in IgM+ GC B-cells at day 7 after E4 boosting were low anyway (median = 3). Levels of VH mutation 7 days after E4 priming were median = 2, which is lower and suggests that the IgM+ GC B-cells in response to E4 boosting are at least in part memory derived, but this on its own is not conclusive evidence.</p><p>As well as the increased levels of mutation in the E4 boost response, the increased numbers of IgM+ GC B-cells and larger more rapid serum IgG boost response (compared to E4 Priming) are evidence for the E4 boost response originating from memory B-cells, but the action of memory T-cells on naïve B-cells cannot be excluded as a contributor. We discuss all these points in the response to point 1, which forms an extra part of the discussion</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors show that the VH sequences sampled at day 7 from the E2 boosted mice were biased toward two VH germline genes. Since these VH were also present in the homotypic E3 boost day 7 samples, the authors conclude that these cells likely originate from E3-induced memory B cells. Although these data show that there is significant skewing in the E2 boosted mice, there are very few B cells in the E3 boosted mice that utilize these V-genes (depending on the mouse). For example, there is no VH14-3 usage in mouse#1, that 1 out of 14 VH genes sequenced (joined with J4 and IgHD2-1*01) in mouse #2 and that 2 out of 15 VH genes sequenced (joined with J4 and either with IGHD2-12*01 or IGHD2-14*01) in mouse #3. This sequencing data is not strong enough to support the conclusion that antibodies utilizing these germline genes are derived from cross-reactive memory B cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this point. There are not enough VH14-3 and VH14-4 sequences in the E3 boost day 7 sample to argue that the large numbers of these sequences after E2 boosting is evidence of a cross reactive response involving these V-genes, and we have amended the text in the Results and Discussion to remove this implication, even though considering VH14-3 and VH14-4 after E3 boosting there are 2 in mouse 2, and 3 in mouse 3. We consider that the large numbers of VH14-3/4 sequences present after the E2 boost is evidence of a secondary response that is somewhat focused on a particular epitope, and have inserted a sentence in the results to this effect instead. Cross reactive secondary responses focusing on particular epitopes have been identified in humans and are further discussed in the response to point 2 of the reviewers comments, and form part of an addition to the discussion</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3. The authors claim that the boost with E4 elicited a slower, more &quot;naïve-like&quot; response compared to the E2 boost. However, without showing the responses in a E4 immunized mouse that did not receive an E3-prime (a true naïve response), this conclusion is not strongly supported.</p></disp-quote><p>We take this point, as it refers to Figure 3, to mean the use of the statement “naïve-like” to describe the rise in affinity in response to E4 boosting. We agree that this use is incorrect in this context as we had not done an analysis of a primary/naïve response. We have now performed an analysis of the primary response to E4 and have added this to the Results section accordingly. These results show that the real naïve/primary serum IgG response to E4 is at a much lower titre compared to boosting as might be expected. Titres were too low to perform a relative affinity assay and no 7M Urea resistant IgG antibodies were detected at day 7 or 17 after prime (data not shown). We have removed the phrase referred to (naïve-like) from the serum avidity/affinity section of the results</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 3 A and B, the competition assay for affinity measurement in E2 or E4 boosted serum for E2 and E4 target, respectively, is complicated and not accurate. The authors should perform antigen-specific ELISAs for the anti-Dengue antibodies, both in the absence and in the presence of urea 7M. This is a well-established assay used to test antibody affinities (Wong-Baeza, et al., Frontiers in Immunology, 2016, Khurana et al., Sci Transl Med, 2011; Puschnik et al, PLoS Negl Trop Dis, 2013; Westerlund et al, Clin Exp Immunol, 2007).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very valuable point and we have performed a relative avidity assay/7M Urea resistance assay on the serum samples that enhances this study.</p><p>We consider, however, that these two assays measure different things. Resistance to 7M Urea is measuring the avidity of a divalent binding of antibody to immobilized target. The competition assay we have used is more a measure of relative affinity as it is measuring the ability of monovalent interactions between antibody and E-protein in solution to inhibit the binding of the antibody to the immobilized E-protein target.</p><p>For this reason, and because doubts about the quality of the Urea resistance assay have recently been raised (Alexander et al., 2015), particularly with respect to antibodies against conformational epitopes, which are present on E-proteins, we have included both assays in the revised article and modified the Results section accordingly.</p><p>Readings for the 2 assays correlate but show what looks like a discrepancy too, although there is an explanation:</p><p>After E2 boosting there is a rapid increase in serum avidity by day 7 detected by the Urea assay and no apparent further increase until day 32 perhaps, although data variability is high at day 7 and 17. The affinity for E2 measured by competition assay, however, increases from day 7 to day 17. We interpret this to mean that only a small portion of serum IgG has undergone affinity maturation by day 17, which is plausible because of the high levels of serum IgG already present, so it would not be detected by the Urea assay, particularly with the high data variability seen with this assay at these time points, but would by the competition assay. If this were the case (that a minor portion of serum IgG had affinity matured) the competition assay may discriminate less between E2 boost day 7 and day 17 samples at the highest competitor concentrations and this is what we observe. Another explanation for the lack of detectable improvement in avidity for E2 between day 7 and day 17 is that some or all of the affinity matured IgG is against conformational epitopes vulnerable to 7M Urea.</p><p>Both assays show a slower, but equivalent, if not greater, increase in affinity/avidity for E4 after E4 boost compared to affinity/avidity for E2 after E2 boost, which is an important observation.</p><p>As well as revising the Results section to include the new data, we have also amended the first line of the Discussion to: ‘The most variant protein we immunized with, E4, stimulated GCs with the highest proportion of IgM+ cells with the lowest levels of VH gene mutation, greater VH-gene diversity, and a slower, more specific, serum IgG response that interestingly eventually resulted in equivalent if not higher affinity compared to the E2 boost’</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>In their revised manuscript the authors made some progress in that they improved some parts, however, they failed to rectify the major weakness present in their main messages, a fault which renders the manuscript unacceptable.

This provides a starting point to debate the meaning of ‘cross-reactivity’ in antibody memory, of importance for the understanding of for example the generation of bnAbs against HIV, the germline precursors of which have similar affinities to our rAbs.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There is only one important issue that needs to be addressed.
