cell death. While structures of membrane-associated intermediates would provide tremendous insights into the pathology and aid in the design of compounds to potentially treat the diseases, it has not been feasible to overcome the challenges posed by the cell membrane. Here, we use NMR experimental constraints to solve the structure of a type-2 diabetes related human islet amyloid polypeptide intermediate stabilized in nanodiscs. ROSETTA and MD simulations resulted in a unique β-strand structure distinct from the conventional amyloid β-hairpin and revealed that the nucleating NFGAIL region remains flexible and accessible within this isolated intermediate, suggesting a mechanism by which membrane-associated aggregation may be propagated. The ability of nanodiscs to trap amyloid intermediates as demonstrated could become one of the most powerful approaches to dissect the complicated misfolding pathways of protein aggregation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>membrane</kwd><kwd>Amyloid peptide</kwd><kwd>Structure</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG048934</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramamoorthy</surname><given-names>Ayyalusamy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ability of lipid nanodiscs to trap different types of amyloid intermediates, as successfully demonstrated in this study for human-IAPP, could become one of the most powerful approaches to dissect the complicated misfolding pathways of protein aggregation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein aggregation and amyloid formation have been implicated in a range of human pathologies, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, and type II diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiti and Dobson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hartl, 2017</xref>). While the disease phenotypes and the implicated proteins or peptides differ widely, the associated aggregation phenomenon and amyloid formation often have many commonalities such as the role of cell membrane in catalyzing the generation of toxic intermediates. Many of these proteins have been observed to interact preferentially with cellular membranes which may subsequently promote unique folded structures and/or promote amyloid formation while simultaneously altering membrane composition, structure, and integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aisenbrey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byström et al., 2008</xref>). Structural insights into the interaction of α-synuclein, an amyloidogenic peptide associated with Parkinson’s disease, with membrane have been facilitated by the propensity for α-synuclein to readily adopt a helical conformation in the presence of lipids as well as the relatively slow rates of α-synuclein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fusco et al., 2014</xref>). Other amyloidogenic peptides, such as amyloid-β (Aβ) or human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), have been less amenable to high-resolution structural analysis in the presence of membrane, possibly due to their rapid aggregation and membrane disrupting effects, lower propensity towards structure on the membrane, or increased structural heterogeneity. Some insights have been gleaned regarding early, transient interactions between monomeric Aβ and lipid a bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korshavn et al., 2016</xref>), along with preliminary insights into Aβ aggregates prepared at either exceptionally high peptide concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delgado et al., 2016</xref>) or in the presence of detergents which can dramatically impact peptide structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Serra-Batiste et al., 2016</xref>). The rat variant of hIAPP (rIAPP), which does not form amyloid fibrils and not toxic under most conditions, has been used to generate models of membrane-associated dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nath et al., 2011</xref>). This structure was then successfully used to screen for small molecules which promote membrane-associated toxicity of hIAPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nath et al., 2015</xref>). While this structure reaffirms the usefulness of mimetic peptides in the study of amyloids in general, the study of native, amyloidogenic sequences in the presence of membrane remains extremely challenging.</p><p>In order to better study integral membrane proteins in a near-native lipid bilayer environment, recent studies have reported the successful applications of lipid nanodiscs. These nanodiscs traditionally consist of a small (~8–15 nm in diameter), circular patch of lipids surrounded by a scaffold protein, peptide, or polymer and facilitate the stable reconstitution of membrane proteins in their near-native environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hagn et al., 2013</xref>). Nanodiscs have previously been used to study the native function of full-length membrane proteins, protein-protein interactions between integral membrane proteins, and to generate structural data of the typically difficult class of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Denisov and Sligar, 2016</xref>). Nanodiscs were also utilized in a previous study of a stabilized rIAPP dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nath et al., 2011</xref>). Due to the constrained size of the lipid bilayer and devoid of curvature, it is likely that peptide aggregation on the flat surface will be restricted after reaching a certain aggregate size, unlike the aggregation on the surface of a lipid vesicle which is relatively unconstrained and may therefore progress to elongated fibers characteristic of amyloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aisenbrey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Small, isotropic nanodiscs, optimal for solution NMR applications, have also been developed; these nanodisc variants are ideal for the structural analysis of the anticipated stabilized intermediate which may be analyzed in a similar manner as shown previously with integral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hagn et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we evaluated hIAPP, a 37-residue model amyloidogenic peptide, in order to explore the ability of lipid nanodiscs to stabilize distinct, membrane-associated amyloid oligomers. hIAPP aggregation is strongly associated with the progression of type II diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Westermark et al., 1987</xref>). Furthermore, its aggregation on lipid bilayers has been previously demonstrated to destabilize the membrane through multiple mechanisms, suggesting the existence of discrete, non-fibrillar oligomeric species which may be pathogenic and potential targets for isolation via nanodisc stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brender et al., 2012</xref>). Similar to many other amyloids, hIAPP aggregation kinetics and intermediates depend on both the solution conditions and membrane composition; nanodisc-mediated stabilization of folded intermediates may also exhibit a similar dependency. Thus, a thioflavin-T (ThT)-based fluorescence screen was initially used to characterize hIAPP aggregation in the presence of three different membrane scaffold protein-based nanodisc compositions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and buffer conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hagn et al., 2013</xref>). Varying the ratio of negatively charged phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids may tune the affinity of hIAPP for the nanodisc surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Temperature was also modulated to alter the bilayer fluidity, which has previously been demonstrated to modulate the ability of peptides to insert into lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sani et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, the effect of solution pH on hIAPP aggregation in the presence of various nanodiscs was analyzed given the ability of slightly lower pH to dramatically alter hIAPP’s aggregation behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jha et al., 2014</xref>). The optimal combination of nanodisc composition, temperature, and solution pH was subsequently subjected to biochemical characterization and structural analysis by NMR. Through chemical shift analysis, we identified, for the first time, a non-fibrillar β-sheet conformation of hIAPP directly associated with the nanodisc lipid bilayer. This represents the first high-resolution structural model based on experimental constraints of hIAPP associated with a native lipid bilayer and demonstrates the great potential of nanodiscs as a tool to trap and stabilize membrane-associated aggregates of amyloidogenic peptides and proteins in a native, planar bilayer environment.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31226.002</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Nanodisc identity and composition.</title><p>All nanodiscs were formed at a protein (MSP):lipid ratio of 1:50 and purified by size exclusion chromatography prior to use.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Nanodisc</th><th>Lipid composition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ND1</td><td>90% DMPC/10% DMPG</td></tr><tr><td>ND2</td><td>75% DMPC/25% DMPG</td></tr><tr><td>ND3</td><td>50% DMPC/50% DMPG</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Assembly kinetics of hIAPP with nanodiscs</title><p>ThT is a ubiquitous fluorescent probe in the interrogation of amyloid aggregation kinetics and mechanisms, and it is commonly used to characterize the aggregation of various amyloidogenic peptides in the presence of lipid bilayers, making ThT an ideal tool for the initial identification of a lipid bilayer and buffer system suitable for the stabilization and subsequent structural characterization of a membrane-associated hIAPP intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galvagnion et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). After verifying that the fluorescent properties of ThT are minimially perturbed by the presence of nanodiscs in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), a suite of conditions, including varied lipid nanodisc compositions, pH, and temperature were evaluated for their ability to influence the kinetics of hIAPP aggregation as observed by ThT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Resulting curves were subsequently fit to a logarithm to extrapolate their lag time (t<sub>lag</sub>) which correlates to the time required for peptide to convert from its monomeric state to an aggregation-competent oligomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batzli and Love, 2015</xref>). If a set of conditions is capable of promoting a stable membrane-associated intermediate it is likely that the observed t<sub>lag</sub> will increase and/or fibrillation will be completely halted due to the newly stabilized species inhibiting aggregation.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31226.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Nanodiscs modulate the kinetics of hIAPP aggregation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Thioflavin T (ThT) was determined to have no interactions with nanodiscs which could significantly alter the dye’s fluorescent properties (20 mM PO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 25°C).

While it is known that anionic lipids accelerates fibrillation in a dose dependent manner, we observed that, under most conditions, increasing the concentration of nanodiscs increased the t<sub>lag</sub> and delayed aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2013</xref>). However, in agreement with previous observations, as the percentage of DMPG in the nanodisc was increased, the delay in aggregation was reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). When the nanodisc reached 50% DMPG, the aggregation kinetics in the presence of nanodisc were extremely similar to those in the absence, regardless of total lipid concentration. This suggests that the inhibitory ability of nanodiscs is highly dependent upon the concentration of negatively charged lipids; too high a concentration of PG abrogated any inhibitory capacity. Modulating the ratio of membrane components is capable of tuning these two components. It was also observed that raising the solution temperature from 25°C to 35°C generally enhanced the inhibitory activity of lipid nanodiscs, although increases in temperature have previously been shown to accelerate amyloid formation in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batzli and Love, 2015</xref>). The phase transition temperature for the dimyristoyl lipids used in this study is approximately 24°C, thus elevating the temperature to 35°C ensures that the bilayer is completely fluid and may promote peptide insertion into the nanodisc, as hypothesized. Additionally, similar to aggregation experiments performed in the absence of lipid bilayers, decreasing the pH from 7.4 to 5.3 delayed hIAPP aggregation and increased the potency of nanodisc-mediated inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jha et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Based upon the ThT screening results, it was determined that utilizing ND1 (90% DMPC/10% DMPG) in acetate buffer (pH 5.3) would most likely yield a stable, nanodisc associated hIAPP intermediate. Under these conditions, regardless of the temperature studied, fibrillation was not observed, even after 2000 min. To confirm the ability of ND1 to block large aggregate formation, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). While hIAPP incubated at pH 5.3 for 1 week generated conventional amyloid fibrils, hIAPP co-incubated with 1 equiv. of ND1 did not form large fibrillar aggregates during the same incubation time. Instead, nanodiscs of increased size, relative to peptide-free ND1, were observed. This increase in size suggests that hIAPP successfully interacted with and incorporated into ND1 to generate a larger, stable complex, similar to size increases observed for other protein complexes contained within nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). The ability of ND1 to stabilize a non-fibrillar intermediate was further investigated through solution NMR. During amyloid formation, the intensity of the observable resonances originating from the monomeric protein decreased due to the formation of larger, NMR invisible aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Inhibition of this aggregation would maintain the signal from monomeric protein for an extended period of time. The NMR signal for monomeric hIAPP in solution decayed rapidly and reached 50% of its initial intensity after 25 hr. However, freshly prepared, monomeric hIAPP in the presence 1 equiv. of ND1 maintained a relative intensity of ~70% following a rapid initial decay, possibly due to early oligomer formation. These data suggest that ND1 under slightly acidic conditions is capable of blocking conventional amyloid formation by hIAPP and may successfully stabilize a membrane-associated intermediate. This combination of buffer and lipid conditions was used exclusively in subsequent analysis of hIAPP-membrane interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Stabilization and structural characterization of an hIAPP intermediate</title><p>While ND1 is capable of blocking hIAPP fibrillation, applying the optimized conditions to stabilize a distinct, highly populated intermediate state requires further optimization. The aggregation pathway and intermediates formed by amyloidogenic peptides have been previously shown to depend on conditions, particularly peptide concentration and preparation prior to experimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brender et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Serra-Batiste et al., 2016</xref>). To explore the effects of peptide preparation on unique intermediate stabilization, both freshly prepared monomer and a mixed population of oligomers were both prepared, analyzed by both size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and gel electrophoresis, and analyzed for their unique interactions with ND1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–c</xref>). While the oligomeric preparation generated a variety of differently sized species in solution, when separated by both SEC and gel electrophoresis, a single population of hIAPP was observed when the oligomeric population was incubated with ND1, suggesting the stabilization of a unique intermediate. Additionally, dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicates that incubation of the oligomeric hIAPP with ND1 generates species with a larger hydrodynamic radius than free ND1, suggesting that hIAPP is able to interact directly with ND1 under these conditions and generate a larger, stable complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Additionally, when oligomeric hIAPP was incubated with ND1 and its NMR signal monitored over time, it stabilized at approximately 80% relative intensity after a rapid drop off, a trend similar to monomeric hIAPP but with a larger percentage of the signal remaining visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>).

It was shown by SEC that the oligomeric preparation contains a mixture of monomeric and oligomeric species; it is possible that the spectral similarity is due to the monomeric population of the oligomer preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). When monomeric hIAPP was incubated with 1 equiv. of ND1, minimal spectral change was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, black spectrum). The observable residues showed only modest chemical shift perturbations and few resonances exhibited broadening. This suggests that only a small portion of the NMR visible hIAPP population in the monomeric preparation stably interacts with ND1 within the duration of the NMR experiment (~1 hr); monomeric hIAPP undoubtedly binds to ND1; however, the exchange rate of the highly dynamic process is too rapid to result in detectible spectral changes. Additionally, a 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N projection of a 3D triple-resonance HNCA experiment of monomeric hIAPP mixed with ND1 at a 1:1 ratio showed only a few peaks, suggesting that the sample is either unstable or hIAPP exists in many distinct populations, resulting in a broadening of resonances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, green spectrum).

Overall, the simulated structural model represents a consistently folded hIAPP monomeric subunit. Three antiparallel β-strands are observed for A8-L12, F15-H18, and I26-S29 with flexible loops connecting them. Multiple residues (G24, A25) associated with the amyloid-driving region (N<sup>22</sup>FGAIL<sup>27</sup>) of hIAPP are located in the flexible loop regions of the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Westermark et al., 1990</xref>). This suggests that these key residues may be accessible to other monomeric subunits in our model, indicating a possible mechanism of further aggregation for this folded intermediate when found outside of the constraints of the nanodisc. It is likely that this β-strand structure is influenced both by interaction with the lipid bilayer and interactions between monomeric subunits of a membrane-associated oligomer. However, inter-peptide contacts could not be observed in this approach, and therefore we are unable to estimate the size of the oligomer.

When mapped onto a surface model, these residues generally localize to a single region of the structure, suggesting a restricted site of interaction between the surface of ND1 and the folded structure. A Gd(III) solvent PRE complex was also titrated into a preformed complex of oligomeric hIAPP and ND1 in order to identify those residues most exposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b and e</xref>). Titration of a soluble Gd<sup>3+</sup> chelate affected an orthogonal set of resonances as compared to residues affected by binding to ND1 and are located in the loop between the second and third β-strands (F19, N22, F23, A25, and I26), as well as the disordered C-terminus (T30, N31, G33, S34, N35, T36 and Y37). These residues form two discrete surfaces at the ends of the modeled structure encompassing many of the unstructured residues located in the inter-strand loops, and they border the membrane-binding surface identified by titration with ND1, suggesting that these two distinct surfaces interact with high specificity with either the solution environment or the nanodisc. Finally, the membrane interaction region was confirmed by titration with 5-DOXYL steric acid (5-DSA) which preferentially quenches resonances located near the lipid bilayer surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c and f</xref>). Similar to the titration with ND1, 5-DSA selectively broadened residues in the first two β-strands, as well as the loop connecting the two strands, further confirming this region’s preferential association with the lipid bilayer surface. Combined, these results suggest that the folded structure sits close to the bilayer surface with its β-sheet structure roughly perpendicular to the bilayer normal.

In the presence of SDS, hIAPP formed a second helical segment from S20-S29 while that same region is disordered in solution. Meanwhile, one fibrillar isoform of hIAPP formed in the absence of detergents or lipids contains a β-strand in the region where the monomeric form folded into an α-helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luca et al., 2007</xref>). The fiber’s second β-strand encompassed I26-N35, overlapping partly with the second helical segment formed in SDS micelles. Interestingly, the two N-terminal β-strands of the hIAPP structure bound to ND (A8-L121 and F15-H18) overlap significantly with both the α-helical fold of the monomer and the first β-strand of the fibrillar form. The ability of this sequence to adopt diverse secondary structures is surprising based on its predicted α-helical propensity from multiple sequence secondary structure prediction models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drozdetskiy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raghava, 2002</xref>). This highlights one of the fundamental difficulties in the study of amyloid structural intermediates: heterogeneous inter- and intramolecular interactions play a substantial role in promoting folding events. Both the fiber structure and membrane-associated model are capable of adopting the theoretically less favorable β-strand structure due to protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions, respectively. By comparing these four structural examples, however, it does appear that the N-terminal region consistently prefers to adopt some sort of secondary structure, rather than remain completely disordered. The extent of folding, however, is dependent upon external stimuli. It is interesting that the proposed nucleating sequence (N<sup>22</sup>FGAIL<sup>27</sup>) remains solvent exposed in all these models, supporting its role in promoting the interactions of distinct monomeric subunits of hIAPP in the process of amyloid formation.</p><p>The differences between these four structures highlight the challenges associated with structural characterization of hIAPP aggregation intermediates, as well as amyloid intermediates in general. Structure is highly dependent on the context, and those structures which can be observed need not be inherently relevant to the disease associated with the peptide of interest. This later point has been extensively explored in the evaluation of end stage amyloid fibril polymorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">LeVine and Walker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stein and True, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tycko, 2015</xref>). It is a problem likely to persist into the evaluation of oligomers. Nevertheless, it is imperative that the identification and interrogation of intermediate species continues. It is only through a greater breadth of structural information that correlations between structure and relevance can be made. To this end, as the first study to interrogate the structure of an hIAPP aggregation intermediate in the presence of a native lipid bilayer, we have demonstrated the value of nanodiscs in revealing structural details of membrane-associated aggregates. Through variation in lipid bilayer composition, nanodisc size, and aggregation conditions, it may be possible to stabilize and characterize a library of membrane-facilitated hIAPP aggregates. Through these studies, it is our hope that hallmarks of hIAPP oligomers may be identified. We suspect that subsequent studies of this system under different conditions (i.e. altered pH, membrane composition, and temperature) will, for instance, identify a maintenance of the flexible loop containing the self-recognition sequence. The lack of charged residues necessary to promote direct binding to the lipid membrane surface can enable flexibility and solvent exposure. This would reinforce the likelihood of this, or a similar structure, being relevant intermediates in the membrane-mediated aggregation of hIAPP. While this does not inherently translate to pathological relevance, it will provide further insight into the underlying mechanism of hIAPP’s behavior, and possibly other amyloidogenic sequences as well. It is our hope that this overall approach will be translated to the study of other amyloidogenic peptides and proteins whose aggregation in a membrane environment may provide new insights into their toxicity and function. It must be noted that this methodology, while ideal for membrane-associated aggregation studies, has less value for the study of oligomers formed directly in solution as it remains unclear how the preformed oligomers may insert into a nanodisc. The mechanism of insertion into a nanodisc and the formation of oligomers in solution may less likely to be correlated. Therefore, this method yields limited insights to understand the general principles underlying protein aggregation. Our results may act as a blueprint to guide future structural investigations of membrane-associated amyloid species and shed light on the importance of these intermediates in amyloid-associated diseases. To accompany structural studies, experiments involving nanodiscs could be coupled with a variety of cutting edge NMR methodologies to investigate aspects of aggregation dynamics, intermediate size, and heterogeneity. Frosty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mainz et al., 2009</xref>) or sedimentation NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertini et al., 2013</xref>) could be a useful tool to monitor the real-time size changes of nanodisc-associated oligomers, a method that would be intractable with conventional vesicle model membranes given their large size. Exchange-based methodologies such as CEST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fusco et al., 2016</xref>) and DEST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fawzi et al., 2012</xref>) could also be useful for the interrogation of lowly populated, rapidly or slowly exchanging folded or oligomeric intermediates. In addition, recently reported polymer-based nanodiscs and macro-nanodiscs, that uplifts the restriction on the size of lipid nanodiscs, could be used to apply a variety of solution and solid-state NMR experiments. Overall, nanodiscs represent a very powerful platform upon that can be employed to study intermediates formed in the process of protein aggregation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Recombinant hIAPP expression and purification</title><p>Full-length hIAPP (<italic>KCNTATCATQRLANFLVHSSNNFGAILSSTNVGSNTY-NH<sub>2</sub>, disulfide bridge 2–7</italic>), both unlabeled and uniformly, isotopically labeled, was expressed following a previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rodriguez Camargo et al., 2015</xref>).

A MSP-to-lipid ratio of 1:50 was used for DMPC (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and DMPG (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol)) lipids. The percentage of negatively charged DMPG in the lipid blend was varied from 10% to 50%, as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) or Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). The final concentrations of MSP1D1ΔH5 was 200 µM, lipid concentration was 10 mM. Sodium cholate, that is required for lipid solubilization, was kept at a concentration of 20 mM in the assembly mixture in MSP-Buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA). After incubation for one hour at room temperature (RT), 0.7 g / mL of Biobeads-SM2 (Biorad) were added and the mixture was gently shaken for two more hours at RT. After removal of biobeads, the assembled nanodiscs were concentrated in an Amicon centrifugal device (50 kDa cut-off) (Merck-Millipore, Billerica, MA) to a final volume of 1 mL and purified on an S200a size excluzsion column.

Your work has been evaluated very favorably by three experts, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, who felt that it is an interesting and highly relevant paper. The evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission</p><p>The significance of this manuscript is two-fold. First, it provides new insight into how IAPP interacts with membranes, showing that in the membrane-associated intermediate investigated here the nucleating NFGAIL sequence remains flexible and solvent exposed and hence available for interactions with IAPP monomers. Second, this manuscript proposes a widely applicable experimental strategy to overcome the challenges typically encountered when attempting to extract structural information on amyloid intermediates, which are typically transient and polymorphic. Hence, this paper will be of interest to a wide range of readers, particularly in the field of structural biology, biophysics, neuroscience and medicinal chemistry.

Although it is beyond the scope to expect additional structures to be determined under diverse conditions, the authors might be able to comment how pH plays a role or nanodisc composition.

Given the considerable ambiguity within the amyloid field as to the relevance of oligomers, stability of toxic intermediates, and mechanism of action, we do not wish to over interpret the functional impact of our structural study. To reinforce this view, we have expanded our discussion at the end of the paper as follows: “We suspect that subsequent studies of this system under different conditions (i.e. altered pH, membrane composition, and temperature) will, for instance, identify the maintenance of the flexible loop containing the self-recognition sequence. The lack of charged residues necessary to promote direct binding to the lipid membrane surface can enable flexibility and solvent exposure. This would reinforce the likelihood of this, or a similar structure, being relevant intermediate in the membrane-mediated aggregation of hIAPP. While this does not inherently translate to pathological relevance, it will provide further insight into the underlying mechanism of hIAPP’s behavior, and possibly other amyloidogenic sequences as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There appears to be little binding of the monomer, yet binding of a small oligomer.

Do the oligomers dissociate into monomers upon binding? Can the authors be certain that they are focusing on signals only from the bound state and not any unbound monomer?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the initial ambiguity in our analysis pertaining to this point. As noted in the original version of the manuscript, the minimal chemical shift change upon the addition of ND1 to monomeric hIAPP “suggests that only a small portion of the NMR visible hIAPP population in the monomeric preparation stably interacts with ND1 during the time scale of the NMR experiment (~ 1 hour)”. We have updated this section in the revised manuscript to read as follows: “This suggests that only a small portion of the NMR visible hIAPP population in the monomeric preparation stably interacts with ND1 within the duration of the NMR experiment (~ 1 hour); monomeric hIAPP undoubtedly binds to ND1, however the exchange rate of the highly dynamic process is too rapid to result in detectible spectral changes.”</p><p>Additionally, as noted in the discussion, the structure reported in this study was collected under identical solution conditions (pH 5.3, 30 mM acetate) as used in a recent study that reported a monomeric structure of hIAPP in the absence of lipids. A comparison of the chemical shifts observed for the reported solution hIAPP structure with that presented in this study gives us assurance that here we are observing a unique species and not simply unbound monomer which would adopt identical chemical shifts to the previously reported monomeric structure. We believe that the oligomer is the observed species in this study as it is not in rapid exchange with ND1, unlike the monomer, and thus the species is sufficiently stable and long-lived to provide homogeneous NMR signals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the PRE study some of the relative intensities are greater than 1 by a considerable amount. Can the authors speculate about this? There are no error bars in this figure and others like it in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and so I wonder about the quality of the data and hence interpretations. Please include error bars.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight and thank the reviewers for this comment. Error bars are added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> in the revised manuscript. While solvent PRE is a useful tool to study protein solvent interactions, using amide chemical shift to monitor the solvent accessibility present a complication due to the rapidly exchanging hydroxyl protons of residues such as Ser, Thr and Tyr. This rapid exchange can introduce significantly more deviation in the measurement of the exchangeable residues and those which surround it. As a result, we have not used PRE values to make quantitative structural analysis. Instead we have used the PRE results as general indicators of trends for bound or unbound.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Do the molecular dynamics results agree with the results of binding in terms of the positioning of the peptide on the disc? Perhaps a comparison of color coded structures showing regions of interactions with the disc as established by MD and by the NMR study of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> would be illustrative.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this observation. To answer this question and show the agreement of the results, we updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> to include a panel highlighting the interaction region obtained by MD simulation in orange and the results obtained by NMR in red, with the shared residues highlighted in magenta. The interacting regions are very similar, however, not identical. Discrepancies between the NMR and simulations are described in the main text of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Is it possible that Tht interacts with nanodiscs and if so, would such interaction affect the Tht fluorescence and/or the amount of Tht available to interact with cross-β IAPP structures? Addressing these questions through control experiments and/or data analysis would enhance the interpretation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this observation and have updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to share some of our control results. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> now demonstrates, that ThT fluorescence in buffer is comparable to fluorescence in the presence of ND in solution. Additionally, conventional fibrillar aggregates formed in solution achieve similar maximal fluorescence values in comparison to those formed in the presence of ND, which confirms that the fibrillation is not inhibited by interactions with the ND surface. This is explained in detail in the revised manuscript. Use of nanodiscs results in only a minimal reduction of S/N ratio in the experiment, which is a great advantage in the study of amyloid-membrane interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors report that no appreciable chemical shift differences are observed between the 1H-15N HMQC spectra of the monomers and oligomers.

Why are the monomers unable to form the trapped oligomeric intermediate in the presence of nanodiscs?</p></disp-quote><p>Like the reviewers we were surprised by the differences in the spectra of the monomeric and oligomeric preparations of hIAPP in the absence and presence of ND1. It is known that freshly dissolved hIAPP has a small subpopulation of oligomeric species, though their structure and distribution are not well understood. We believe that our oligomeric preparation enriches this population, though the monomeric form of hIAPP remains predominant. When the two different preparations were introduced to ND1, monomeric hIAPP has weak, transient interactions with ND1, as detailed earlier, while the oligomer which is enriched by pre-incubation in solution binds more tightly and shifts the equilibrium towards the oligomeric population in solution, which facilitates further binding. In essence, ND1 acts as a sink for the enriched oligomeric population to drive additional oligomer formation. As this population becomes enriched, it dominates the NMR spectrum. We have not yet attained experimental insight into the driving force which promotes this specific oligomer to interact with the membrane preferentially and is an ongoing area of study that merits its own publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Often trapped oligomeric intermediates are kinetically but not thermodynamically stable. In this case, the order of addition of the reagents in the mixture is critical. Were the nanodiscs added before or after the ~4 weeks incubation period required to generate oligomers? This should be explained clearly in the Material and methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree completely with the reviewers that the order upon which reagents are added is critical for the obtained results. We have explained this in the revised manuscript in detail. To produce oligomers, we incubated hIAPP for approximately four weeks without nanodiscs. The nanodiscs were subsequently added, directly prior to the NMR experiment (excluding the NMR titration experiment). The Materials and methods section has been updated to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) We carefully compared <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and these two figures appear identical to us.

We have corrected the error by removing the duplicated spectrum from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors should explain why in several cases they decided to acquire HN-HMQC vs. HN-HSQC spectra. The effective MW of the IAPP oligomer – ND complexes is presumably quite high. Why not HN- or even better Methyl-TROSY?</p></disp-quote><p>A principle limitation in our study was sample concentration. While we began with a sample of 50 μM, only 70-80% was stable over the course of an experiment, leaving ~40 μM peptide to be observable. We therefore elected to use HMQC given its enhanced sensitivity over HSQC (up to three-fold increase). The sensitivity gains can be traced to the differential relaxation of the transitions that gives rise to the way in which magnetization is transferred in each of the experiments and the correlations. In practice, TROSY has the potential to reduce the fast decay of magnetization due to T2 relaxation (i.e. spin-spin relaxation) by constructive use of the two effects that mainly determine transverse relaxation in large proteins at high magnetic field strengths. These are dipole-dipole coupling between two spins, and chemical shift anisotropy of the two associated nuclei. The TROSY method selects the slowest relaxing component of the multiplet, resulting in a loss of intensity for fast tumbling molecules. We found that TROSY type experiments to be not beneficial for the systems investigated in this study. Empirically, we obtained the best results using a standard HNCA in combination with Non Uniform Sampling (NUS). We did not pursue methyl-TROSY experiments, as we were able to record HMQC and 3D HNCA experiments by overcoming the challenges by the difficult sample.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The authors should clarify the merits of complementing 2D experiments (e.g. HMQC) with 2D projections of 3D experiments (e.g. HNCA)</p></disp-quote><p>Our goal in comparing 2D NMR experiments with 2D projections of 3D experiments was to qualitatively evaluate the status of the peptide’s resonances throughout the course of the assignment experiment, while using the 2D experiments as a reference. In situations when we observed that many of the peaks had disappeared in the 2D projection, we decided no longer to pursue structural characterization of what was likely a highly heterogeneous or unstable sample.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) While the proposed intermediate trapping methods based on nanodiscs is ingenious and elegant, the discussion should emphasize that it is currently unknown to what extent the nanodisc trapped intermediate reflects the oligomers populated in solution in the absence of lipids.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment and the observation is included in the Discussion section. It reads as given below: “It must be noted that this methodology, while ideal for membrane-associated aggregation studies, has less value for the study of oligomers formed directly in solution as it remains unclear how the preformed oligomers may insert into a nanodisc. The mechanism of insertion into a nanodisc and the formation of oligomers in solution may less likely to be correlated. Therefore, this method yields limited insights to understand the general principles underlying protein aggregation.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
