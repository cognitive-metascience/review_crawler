However, what regulates R axon lamination and how lamination affects R neuron function remain unknown. We show here that the EB is sequentially innervated by small-field and large-field neurons and that early developing EB neurons play an important regulatory role in EB laminae formation. The transmembrane proteins semaphorin-1a (Sema-1a) and plexin A function together to regulate R axon lamination. R neurons recruit both GABA and GABA-A receptors to their axon terminals in the EB, and optogenetic stimulation coupled with electrophysiological recordings show that Sema-1a-dependent R axon lamination is required for preventing the spread of synaptic inhibition between adjacent EB lamina. These results provide direct evidence that EB lamination is critical for local pre-synaptic inhibitory circuit organization.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25328.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25328.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25328.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human brain contains around one hundred billion nerve cells, or neurons, which are interconnected and organized into distinct layers within different brain regions. Electrical impulses pass along a cable-like part of each neuron, known as the axon, to reach other neurons in different layers of various brain structures. The brain of a fruit fly contains fewer neurons – about 100 thousand in total – but it still establishes precise connections among neurons in different brain layers.</p><p>In both flies and humans, axons grow along set paths to reach their targets by following guidance cues. Many of these cues are conserved between insects and mammals, including proteins belonging to the semaphorin family. These proteins work together to steer growing axons towards their proper targets and repel them away from the incorrect ones. However, how neurons establish connections in specific layers remains poorly understood.</p><p>In the middle of the fruit fly brain lies a donut-shaped structure called the ellipsoid body, which the fly needs to navigate the world around it. The ellipsoid body contains a group of neurons that extend their axons to form multiple concentric rings. Xie et al. have now asked how the different “ring neurons” are organized in the ellipsoid body and how this sort of organization affects the connections between the neurons. Imaging techniques were used to visualize the layered organization of different ring neurons and to track their growing axons. Further work showed that this organization depends on semaphorin signaling, because when this pathway was disrupted, the layered pattern did not develop properly. This in turn, caused the axons of the ring neuron to wander out of their correct concentric ring and connect with the wrong targets in adjacent rings.</p><p>Together these findings show that neurons rely on evolutionarily conserved semaphorins to correctly organize themselves into layers and connect with the appropriate targets. Further work is now needed to identify additional proteins that are critical for fly brains to form layered structures, and to understand how this layered organization influences how an animal behaves.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25328.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25328.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neural lamination</kwd><kwd>semaphorin</kwd><kwd>ellipsoid body</kwd><kwd>central complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Xiaojun</given-names></name><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Matthew P</given-names></name><name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>Sarah P</given-names></name><name><surname>Kolodkin</surname><given-names>Alex L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01 NS079584</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Xiaojun</given-names></name><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Matthew P</given-names></name><name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>Sarah P</given-names></name><name><surname>Kolodkin</surname><given-names>Alex L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 NS50274</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Xiaojun</given-names></name><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Matthew P</given-names></name><name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>Sarah P</given-names></name><name><surname>Kolodkin</surname><given-names>Alex L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R21 NS088521</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tabuchi</surname><given-names>Masashi</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Mark N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The organization of layered/laminated axon projections in specific regions of the fruitfly central brain is regulated by short-range repulsive guidance and is critical for local inhibitory circuit formation and function.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proper nervous system function relies on precise synaptic connectivity.

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control neuronal lamination remain to be fully elucidated, as does how laminar constraint of synaptic organization in particular brain structures contributes to function.</p><p>The insect brain, although small, is composed of myriad complex synaptic connections organized into multiple neuropil modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ito et al., 2014</xref>), and each module adopts distinct structural features geared toward specific functions. For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> the optic lobes include heavily laminated synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanes and Zipursky, 2010</xref>), while the antennal lobes include individual glomeruli where distinct olfactory sensory neurons contact to second-order neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wilson, 2013</xref>). Deep within the insect brain, a highly conserved neuropil module called the central complex (CX) is composed of several laminated structures critical for sensory integration and motor coordination functions analogous to the vertebrate basal ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Strausfeld and Hirth, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Strausfeld, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Turner-Evans and Jayaraman, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The CX is composed of four neuropil substructures, from anterior to posterior: the ellipsoid body (EB), the fan-shaped body (FB), the noduli (NO) and the protocerebral bridge (PB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In each CX substructure, neuronal processes elaborate their trajectories in precisely defined regions. They form multiple layers, or laminae, from dorsal-to-ventral within the EB, FB and NO, and other neuronal processes form 16–18 columns, medial-to-lateral, within the EB, PB and FB. More than 50 different types of ‘small-field’ and ‘large-field’ neurons innervate these CX substructures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hanesch et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Young and Armstrong, 2010b</xref>). Every small-field neuron innervates one or two columns and contacts one or multiple laminae in specific CX substructures. On the other hand, each large-field neuron innervates an entire single lamina across all columns in certain CX substructures. Therefore, small- and large-field neurons collaboratively form highly organized wiring patterns and are interconnected in all four CX neuropils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2013</xref>), allowing for information flow in precisely defined patterns within the CX.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25328.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Large-field ring neuron axons sequentially innervate the ellipsoid body.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics showing frontal and dorsal views of the central complex (CX) in an adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain.

R2/R4m axons (red arrows) extend into the developing EB earlier than R3/R4d axons (green arrows and arrowheads), as can be observed between 16 and 24 hr APF since R2/R4m axons exhibit dense elaboration and co-localization with strong CadN staining prior to R3/R4d axons.

The major large-field neurons that innervate the EB are called ring (R) neurons, named for their circumferential ring-like axonal arborization patterns that form several circular laminae/rings in the anterior shell of the EB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hanesch et al., 1989</xref>). Anatomical analyses suggest that ring neurons, through their dendrites located in the bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, arrows), receive pre-synaptic inputs from descending neurons of the anterior visual pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Omoto et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, neuronal activity of some ring neuron dendrites correlates with light stimulation and is organized in a retinotopic fashion within the bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2013</xref>). Further, some ring neurons contribute to the circuits that influence visually evoked memory and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Neuser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ofstad et al., 2011</xref>), and they are also involved in homeostatic regulation of behaviors such as hunger sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dus et al., 2013</xref>) and sleep homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). One type of small-field neuron, called ‘pb-eb-gall’ or ‘E-PG,’ elaborates dendrites in the EB that overlap with R neuron axons and presumably serves as their post-synaptic partners. Neuronal activity observed in pb-eb-gall neuron dendrites is tuned to the fly’s head direction coordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Green et al., 2017</xref>). How laminar organization of R axons influences R and pb-eb-gall neuron functions, however, remains unknown.</p><p>To gain insight into the logic of EB neural connectivity, we investigate here the developmental principles and molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of R neuron circumferential lamination and pb-eb-gall dendrite targeting within the EB. We observe sequential innervation of the developing EB by pb-eb-gall neuron dendrites and distinct R neuron axons during pupal development, and we uncover different roles for pb-eb-gall dendrites and R axons in EB patterning. The transmembrane semaphorin semaphorin-1a (Sema-1a) is expressed in multiple types of R neurons and functions with the transmembrane protein plexin A (PlexA) to regulate ring neuron laminar organization in the EB. Disruption of Sema-1a signaling in the EB provides anatomical and functional insight into establishment of local inhibitory connections among R neurons that target adjacent EB laminae. These results show that local axonal interactions, through short-range repellent cues and receptors, regulate the assembly and functional organization of laminated pre-synaptic inhibitory circuits in the central complex within the fly brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ring neuron axons sequentially innervate the ellipsoid body during early pupal stages</title><p>All ring neurons share a common progenitor lineage and follow similar trajectories as their axons approach the brain midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2013</xref>).

Our results confirm that the EB emerges at around 16 hr (16 hr) after pupae formation (APF) with an open crescent shape that in later developmental stages closes toward the ventral side; the complete circular EB morphology is apparent between 40 and 48 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, white dashed lines in panels on right; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, light blue schematics).</p><p>To track EB neuron innervation while overall EB morphology develops, we used both GAL4 and lexA drivers to label processes from multiple types of EB neurons simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pfeiffer et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>R32H08-lexA</italic> and <italic>R15F02-GAL4</italic> were first utilized to express mCherry in R2/R4m neurons and CD8-GFP in R3/R4 neurons, respectively, allowing us to trace ring neuron axon extension during early pupal stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, red and green arrows).</p><p>At 16 hr APF, the earliest time point when it is possible to identify the EB by CadN expression, many R2/R4m axons have already reached the EB. These R2/R4m axons form a circular structure and the dorsal region of this axon trajectory overlaps with strong CadN staining, suggesting that R2/R4m axons have already established specific contacts with other neuronal processes at this early pupal stage. In contrast, CD8-GFP-labeled R3 axons were barely observed at the midline at 16 and 20 hr APF, and they appeared to have simple linear morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, green arrows). These R3 axons are located in the central canal region of the developing EB defined by very weak CadN staining, suggesting that few CadN-mediated interactions have been established among R3 axons and other neurons at these early stages. At 20–24 hr APF, R2/R4m and R3 axons continue to innervate the developing EB, and R4d axons reach the edge of the EB and circle around the contralateral portion of the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, green arrowheads). All R neuron axons continue to extend between 24 and 48 hr APF, forming multiple rings with densely packed R neuron axons.</p><p>These observations show that the EB is sequentially innervated by axons from different R neuron types. R2/R4m neurons precede R3 neurons, and R4d neuron axons follow the axons of these other R neuron types. Moreover, R2/R4m, R3 and R4d axons do not overlap with one another during all the pupal stages we assessed, suggesting that they are segregated from each other soon after they arrive at the EB.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pb-eb-gall neuron dendrites sequentially associate with R2/R4m and R3 axons during ellipsoid body formation</title><p>In contrast to R neuron axons, small-field pb-eb-gall neurons have columnar dendritic elaborations in the EB, extending across multiple rings over the entire EB radius (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and H</xref>).

At 24 hr and 48 hr after temperature shift (ATS) (comparable to 24 hr and 48 hr APF under normal animal rearing conditions), GFP-labeled pb-eb-gall cell bodies and processes were greatly reduced in number, and the remaining neurons exhibited much weaker GFP expression in DTI-expressing animals compared to control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, compare arrows and arrowheads). This demonstrates successful DTI-mediated pb-eb-gall small-field neuron ablation.</p><p>Following loss of pb-eb-gall neurons, the EB developed major aberrant morphologies, including irregular edges and a loss of the EB central canal (data not shown). Further, R2/R4m neurons, labeled by using <italic>R32H08-lexA-</italic>driving myristoylated tdTomato (mtdT), no longer extended axons to form coherent ring-shaped structures in the DTI-expressing animals 48 hr ATS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, red circles and ovals). Similar lamination defects were observed in R3/R4d axons, labeled by <italic>R70B04-lexA-</italic>driving mtdT, when pb-eb-gall neurons were ablated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, red circle and oval). Both R2/R4m and R3/R4d axons appear to occupy the entire EB and therefore likely intermingle with one another in DTI-expressing animals. However, ablation of another type of small-field neuron called ‘pb-eb-no’ or ‘P-EN’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Omoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>) that also elaborates processes in the EB during early pupal stages, using the <italic>R83H12-GAL4</italic> driver, did not cause apparent defects to the R2/R4m ring morphologies (data not shown). These results show that pb-eb-gall neurons are selectively required for instructing R neuron axon patterning during EB development.</p><p>Second, to ask whether R neurons are reciprocally required for pb-eb-gall small-field neuron dendrite elaboration in the EB we ablated R2/R4m neurons, which develop early in EB development, at early pupal stages. We observed a significant loss of R2/R4m GFP-labeled neurons following DTI expression (33.2% decrease at 24 hr ATS; 65.2% decrease at 48 hr ATS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and F</xref>, compare red arrows and arrowheads; quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Upon the loss of a substantial fraction of R2/R4m neurons, the EB was reduced in size and pb-eb-gall dendrite areas were 29% smaller than in controls 48 hr ATS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>, green circles; quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In contrast, the areas occupied by pb-eb-gall axon terminals in the gall remained unchanged in control and in R2/R4m ablation animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>, blue arrow and arrowhead; quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These observations show that R2/R4m axons are required locally for pb-eb-gall dendrite growth in the EB.</p><p>Third, to examine whether or not the ablation of outer R2/R4m axons affects the innervation pattern of inner R3 neuron axons in the EB, we labeled a subset of R3 neurons using <italic>R54B05-lexA</italic> while simultaneously ablating R2/R4m neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). When R2/R4m neurons were ablated, R3 axon arbors occupied a larger area (26.6% increase) at 48 hr ATS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>, green ovals; quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Therefore, R2/R4m ring neurons influence the size of R3 ring neuron axon arborizations.</p><p>Finally, to test whether other R neurons are similarly required for R2/R4m axon development, we used <italic>R15F02-GAL4</italic> to express DTI in R1/R3/R4d neurons. In contrast to what we observed following ablation of R2/R4m neurons, loss of &gt;60% of GFP-labeled R1/R3/R4d neurons (with the remaining R1/R3/R4d neurons exhibiting &gt;10 fold reduction in GFP expression) had no observable effects on EB morphology or R2/R4m axon expansion (data not shown). These data show that although R2/R4m axons constrain R3 axon expansion, other R neuron types likely do not serve a reciprocal function with respect to R2/R4m neurons.</p><p>These neuron ablation experiments suggest that pb-eb-gall dendrites and axons from different R neuron types play distinct roles in EB neuronal process development. The pb-eb-gall neurons are critical for the EB morphogenesis and axon patterning of all R types we examined. In addition, outer R2/R4m axons constrain inner R3 axon arbor expansion. Taken together, analysis of EB development and also EB cell-type-specific ablation experiments show that a series of spatiotemporally regulated interactions among EB neuronal processes facilitates the formation of proper R neuron axon laminae during the development of this central complex structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Sema-1a and PlexA are expressed in the ellipsoid body</title><p>To understand how different groups of R neurons and pb-eb-gall neurons regulate the development of EB morphology and lamination, we investigated neuronal guidance molecules that could be involved in these processes.

First, we generated MARCM clones containing multiple (&gt; or = to 5) R2 and/or R4m cells. Despite the presence of intermingled R2 and R4m axons in the EB, the composition of multiple-cell clones can be determined by the different locations of R2 and R4m dendrites in the bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>, white and yellow circles). In control clones, R2/R4m synaptic terminals, labeled by HA-tagged synaptotagmin (Syt-HA), form a regular ring within the peripheral EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <italic>Control</italic>), displaying a clear inner boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ci</xref>, dashed line). However, in about half of <italic>Sema-1a</italic> mutant clones, the R2/R4m ring was partially deformed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <italic>Sema-1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>). A significant fraction of Syt-HA-positive boutons were mis-localized to regions closer to the EB central canal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Cii</xref>, arrows) and beyond the normal R2/R4m inner boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Cii</xref>, dashed lines). This is in line with the lamination defects observed when <italic>Sema-1a</italic> is knocked down in these same R neuron types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, this outer EB lamination phenotype was only observed in Sema<italic>-1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> clones consisting of R4m neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but not in clones composed of only R2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results show that R2/R4m axon lamination defects in <italic>Sema-1a</italic> LOF experiments are largely due to lack of Sema-1a in R4m neurons, underscoring the select interactions among ring neurons that are required to generate EB laminar organization.</p><p>To confirm the cell-autonomous function of <italic>Sema-1a</italic>, we generated smaller clones in order to label single R4m neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Further, some synaptic boutons, identified by both GFP-labeled varicosities and Syt-HA labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Dii</xref>, small panels, arrowheads), were localized to more central EB regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Dii</xref>, arrows). To confirm that these R4m phenotypes resulted from loss of <italic>Sema-1a</italic> function, we expressed a full-length <italic>Sema-1a</italic> (<italic>Sema-1a rescue</italic>) or a truncated <italic>Sema-1a</italic> (<italic>Sema-1a<sup>EcTM</sup> rescue</italic>) transgene in <italic>Sema-1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> R4m cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Expression of <italic>Sema-1a</italic>, but not <italic>Sema-1a<sup>EcTM</sup></italic>, in <italic>Sema-1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> R4m cells rescued R4m axon arbor phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Diii and 4Div</xref>). To quantify changes in R4m synapse localization, we counted R4m pre-synaptic boutons based on the presence of CD8-GFP<sup>+</sup> varicosities in reconstructed 3D images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1Ciii and 1Cvii</xref>, white dots). We then measured the distance from each bouton to the EB canal center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1Civ and 1Cviii</xref>, color-coded bouton distance), grouped the smallest and largest distances between R4m boutons and the EB center in single R4m clones, and compared them across all four genotypes. The smallest distances, which indicate how close R4m boutons are to the EB center, were significantly decreased in <italic>Sema-1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (11.85 ± 2.36 μm, n = 16 singe-cell clones [SSCs]) and in <italic>Sema-1a<sup>EcTM</sup> rescue</italic> (9.34 ± 1.64 μm, n = 10 SSCs) neurons but showed no difference compared to control R neurons (15.95 ± 1.93 μm, n = 12 SSCs) or <italic>Sema-1a rescue</italic> R neurons (14.62 ± 1.64 μm, n = 9 SSCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In contrast, the largest distances from the EB center, which are a measure of how wide the R4m ring is, were the same across all four genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p>R2/R4m synapses are normally excluded from the central EB region, which is innervated by R3 axons that have arbors with a minimum diameter of about 30 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>, ‘R3 Diameter’). We scored central R4m boutons (defined by their locations within a 15 μm radius originating at the EB center) and calculated the percentage ratio of central bouton number <italic>vs</italic> total bouton number for each R4m neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). A significantly larger fraction of R4m boutons was found in the central EB region in both <italic>Sema-1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (4.66%, n = 16 SSCs) and <italic>Sema-1a<sup>EcTM</sup> rescue</italic> (10.52%, n = 10 SSCs) compared to the control group (0.62%, n = 12 SSCs). The <italic>Sema-1a rescue</italic> R4m neurons (2.43%, n = 9 SSCs), although they exhibited 32.3% fewer total synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), showed no significant change in central synapse distribution compared to controls. In addition to these synapse distribution changes, R4m axon arbor morphology changes were also quantified by tracing R4m axon branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1Cii and 1Cvi</xref>). Total branch length was increased in <italic>Sema-1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (11.6% increase) and <italic>Sema-1a<sup>EcTM</sup> rescue</italic> (16.5% increase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>), and the total number of branch points was decreased by 26.9% in <italic>Sema-1a rescue</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>), compared to controls, suggesting that Sema-1a regulates R4m axon branch formation and extension.</p><p>Taken together, these results demonstrate that full length Sema-1a, but not truncated Sema-1a lacking its cytoplasmic domain, is required cell-autonomously to regulate R4m axon branch growth, lamination and synapse distribution within the EB. Therefore, these functions are likely mediated through a Sema-1a ‘reverse signaling’ pathway in which the Sema-1a protein functions as a receptor in R4m neurons and PlexA protein servers as its ligand in other EB neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Battistini and Tamagnone, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Since lamination defects were observed when either Sema-1a or PlexA was knocked down in R2/R4m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), we suspected that R2 neurons express PlexA and therefore regulate R4m axon lamination through Sema-1a reverse signaling. Unfortunately, all the available R2 drivers we characterized also drive expression in R4m neurons. However, <italic>R40G10-GAL4</italic> drives expression in R1, R2 and R3 neurons throughout pupal and adult stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lovick et al., 2017</xref>).

R4m axons formed an irregular ring but still appeared organized in a laminar fashion in EB outer regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2, Aii and Av</xref>). More severe phenotypes were observed in <italic>PlexA-RNAi</italic> expressing animals. In many <italic>R40G10&gt;PlexA-RNAi</italic> animals, the EB remained completely open and R4m axons expanded their axon projections to cover most EB regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2, Aiii and Avi</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that PlexA in R1–3, and most likely in R2 alone since knocking down PlexA in R1/R3 with multiple drivers did not generate similar defects (data not shown), plays an important role in regulating R4m axon lamination formation through Sema-1a reverse signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Sema-1a and PlexA in R2/R4m neurons are required non-cell autonomously for R3 axon expansion</title><p>From our EB neuron ablation experiments during pupal development, we learned that R2/R4m axons constrain R3 axon expansion within the EB. To further investigate how the disruption of R2/R4m axon lamination in <italic>Sema-1a</italic> or <italic>PlexA</italic> LOF mutants affects R3 axons, we used the <italic>R54B05-lexA</italic> driver to express mtdT and label a subset of R3 neurons, while we also used the <italic>R32H08-GAL4</italic> driver to express CD8-GFP and <italic>Sema-1a-RNAi</italic> (or <italic>PlexA-RNAi</italic>) in R2/R4m neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In controls, R2/R4m and R3 axon arbors exhibit characteristic sizes and are adjacent to one another with a clear boundary separating these two R neuron arbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Ai and 5Aiv</xref>, yellow dashed line). However, in either R2/R4m <italic>Sema-1a-RNAi</italic> or <italic>PlexA-RNAi</italic>–expressing fly lines, R3 axon arbors expand outward within the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Av and 5Avi</xref>), and this is accompanied by inward expansion of R2/R4m axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Aii and 5Aiii</xref>). This results in disruption of the boundary between these two laminae, with the outer edge of the R3 axon arbors displaying a jagged morphology and R3 axons extending outward to more peripheral EB regions. Further, the smallest distance between R3 axons and the outer edge of the R2/R4m ring was greatly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Aiv, 5Av and 5Avi</xref>; double-headed arrows).

Following normalization to controls (n = 8 animals), the area occupied by R3 axon arbors increased 48.3 ± 15.6% (n = 8 brains) and 42.8 ± 12.4% (n = 7 brains) for the two independent <italic>Sema-1a-RNAi</italic> lines, and 34.8 ± 28.7% (n = 8 brains) and 50.4 ± 32.6% (n = 8 brains) for the two independent <italic>PlexA-RNAi</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To address whether Sema-1a or PlexA are required for controlling R neuron numbers, we quantified R3 and R2/R4m cell numbers using mtdT and CD8-GFP labeling, respectively. R3 numbers were similar to controls in all of the RNAi lines except for a small increase (17.6%) in one <italic>Sema-1a-RNAi</italic> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Further, we found that R2/R4m cell numbers remained unchanged in all RNAi experiments compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). To further examine the role of R2 and R4m in constraining R3 axon growth, <italic>R40G10-GAL4</italic> was used to express <italic>Sema-1a</italic> or <italic>PlexA-RNAi</italic> in R1–3 neurons. R54B05-lexA&gt;mtdT-labeled R3 axon arbors were mildly altered but remained within their territory in the inner EB in <italic>R40G10&gt;Sema-1a-RNAi</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2, Bii</xref>). However, R3 axons generally increased their elaboration within the EB in <italic>R40G10&gt;PlexA-RNAi</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2, Biii</xref>). Taken together, these results support the idea that Sema-1a/PlexA-dependent R2/R4m axon patterning is required to control R3 axon expansion through a local repellent signal, thereby regulating R axon lamination.</p><p>Both Sema-1a and PlexA can signal as receptors to mediate repulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jongbloets and Pasterkamp, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Battistini and Tamagnone, 2016</xref>). We wondered whether Sema-1a or PlexA, given their expression patterns, act as signals or receptors between R2/R4m and R3 axons. Therefore, we next tested whether Sema-1a or PlexA function cell-autonomously in R3 neurons to control R3 axon expansion. First, we found that knocking down <italic>Sema-1a</italic> or <italic>PlexA</italic> in R3 neurons did not change the size or morphology of the R3 rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>; quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Second, MARCM experiments show that single R3 axon ring diameters are not different between control and <italic>Sema-1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> R3 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>; ‘Diameter’ quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). However, in <italic>Sema-1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> single R3 MARCM clones, many R3 neurons elaborate axon branches that grow more posteriorly within the EB, and for some R3 neurons (6 out of 21 cells) out of the EB and into the posterior FB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>; quantification of ‘R3 Thickness’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). This suggests that Sema-1a controls longer range R axon extension to secure the overall separation of neighboring brain structures. We were unable to use MARCM to test the cell autonomy of PlexA in R neurons since PlexA is located on the fourth chromosome and tools are not presently available for this experiment.</p><p>Together, these results show that it is unlikely PlexA or Sema-1a act in R3 as receptors for R2/R4m Sema-1a or PlexA to directly regulate R3 axon growth. Although we find that Sema-1a and PlexA function in R2/R4m neurons to organize axon lamination, our data suggest that R2/R4m axons use other molecules to constrain R3 axons and refine axon patterning and lamination during pupal development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Sema-1a and PlexA are not required for pb-eb-gall Dendrite development in the EB</title><p>Our analyses of central complex development show that pb-eb-gall dendrites play an important role in controlling R axon lamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Is R axon lamination also required for pb-eb-gall dendrite elaboration, and do Sema-1a or PlexA play a role in pb-eb-gall development? To address these issues, we first used <italic>R19G02-lexA</italic> to drive mtdT expression in pb-eb-gall neurons in combination with <italic>R32H08-GAL4</italic> to knock down Sema-1a or PlexA in these neurons. The pb-eb-gall dendrites appeared normal when R2/R4m axons expanded their elaboration within the EB in either <italic>Sema-1a-RNAi</italic> or <italic>PlexA-RNAi</italic>–expressing animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2, Aiv-vi</xref>). Secondly, we used the syb:GRASP technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Macpherson et al., 2015</xref>) to detect potential synaptic connections between R2/R4m axons and pb-eb-gall dendrites. The spGFP<sub>1-10</sub>-tagged neuronal synaptobrevin (syb-spGFP<sub>1-10</sub>) was expressed in R2/R4m by <italic>R32H08-GAL4</italic> while CD4-spGFP<sub>11</sub> and mtdT were expressed in pb-eb-gall neurons. Reconstituted GFP (rcGFP) was detected in the EB in both control and <italic>UAS-Sema-1a-RNAi-</italic>expressing animals, even though different GFP fluorescence patterns were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These data suggest that R axon lamination defects do not affect pb-eb-gall dendrite elaboration or synaptogenesis between R axons and pb-eb-gall dendrites. Finally, <italic>R19G02-GAL4</italic> was used to drive <italic>Sema-1a-RNAi</italic> or <italic>PlexA-RNAi</italic> in pb-eb-gall neurons. Knocking down Sema-1a or PlexA in pb-eb-gall neurons partially or completely re-directed their axon projections from the gall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2, Ci-iii and Di-iii</xref>, arrows) to a region close to the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2, Ci-iii and Di-iii</xref>, arrowheads). However, loss of Sema-1a or PlexA in pb-eb-gall neurons did not affect pb-eb-gall dendrite elaboration or R2/4 m and R3/R4d axon lamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2, Civ-vi and Div-vi</xref>), suggesting that Sema-1a and PlexA in pb-eb-gall neurons are not required for pb-eb-gall dendrite or R axon development in the EB.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Ring neurons recruit GABA and GABA-A receptors to their axon terminals</title><p>In invertebrate and vertebrate visual systems, pre- and post-synaptic neurites co-stratify to facilitate appropriate connections for visual system function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zipursky and Sanes, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).

In the EB, multiple different types of laminated R axons converge onto pb-eb-gall neuron dendrites, and so this raises the question: what function does R axon lamination serve, and might it play a role in specifying distinct synaptic connections among R neurons? To understand the functional significance of Sema-1a/PlexA-mediated R neuron axon lamination, we first investigated the neurochemical properties of R neurons.</p><p>Abundant protein expression of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and RDL (a GABA-A receptor subunit) has been observed in the EB and appears to be closely associated with R neuron axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kahsai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martín-Peña et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Enell et al., 2007</xref>). However, the sources of GABA and RDL and their functions in the EB are largely unknown, although a group of R2/R4m neurons are known to be GABAergic and thermogenetic activation of these neurons impairs medium-term olfactory memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). To address this issue, we took advantage of newly developed protein-trap GAL4 and QF2 drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Diao et al., 2015</xref>). These drivers were obtained by converting a MiMic insertion in a coding intron to an exogenous exon containing coding sequences for the transcriptional activators GAL4 or QF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Venken et al., 2011</xref>). This strategy reliably represents the expression of target genes, often more faithfully than traditional enhancer-trap GAL4 driver lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Diao et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We found that fluorescent reporters driven by <italic>Gad1<sup>MI</sup>-QF2</italic> and <italic>Rdl<sup>MI</sup>-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Diao et al., 2015</xref>) were both expressed in a large number of R neurons, displaying characteristic axon trajectories into the bulb and EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and D</xref>, arrowheads and arrows).

Expression levels of GABA and RDL were also reduced in central EB regions when R3 Gal4 drivers were used to express these corresponding RNAi transgenes (data not shown). We also examined three other common neurotransmitter pathways (acetylcholine, glutamate and dopamine) in the EB using antibody staining and similar genetic labeling strategies as we used for GABA. Many fewer cholinergic, glutamatergic or dopaminergic inputs were observed in the EB, and most of these were preferentially localized to posterior EB regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, arrows). Taken together, these results show that multiple types of R neurons are GABAergic and also that they recruit GABA-A receptors to their axon terminals in the EB, raising the question of whether R axon lamination influences EB inhibitory synaptic properties.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25328.021</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Ring neurons transport GABA and GABA-A receptors to their axonal terminals in the ellipsoid body.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>D</bold>) MiMic-based GAL4 and QF2 drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Diao et al., 2015</xref>) were used to express fluorescent reporters and to access Gad1(A) and Rdl (<bold>D</bold>) expression in adult fruitfly brains.

CsChrimson depolarizes R3 neurons upon LED light stimulation, which we first confirmed by field recordings near R3 somas (data not shown). To detect inhibitory input onto R2/R4m neurons from R3 neurons, we performed current-clamp recordings on the cell bodies of single R2 or R4m neurons. In control animals (n = 4), injection of current above a certain threshold (10.5 ± 5.7 pA) successfully evoked trains of action potentials (APs) in R2/R4m neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, blue line). We plotted AP frequencies against the injected current amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,F–I</xref> curves) and observed that above the current threshold the AP frequency in R2/R4m neurons was positively correlated with the depolarization current amplitudes. More importantly, LED stimulation of R3 neurons had little effect on evoking APs in R2/R4m neurons in these control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>, red vs blue lines).

However, following R3 neuron activation (LED on) in these <italic>Sema-1a-RNAi</italic> animals, R2/R4m neurons generated many fewer APs when evoked with the same depolarization currents above the current threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>, red vs blue lines).

Therefore, laminar organization of R axons plays an important role in specifying inhibitory synapse formation between different types of R axons in the EB.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The insect brain central complex (CX) is composed of densely laminated neuropil structures, including the FB and the EB. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> EB harbors a particular laminar organization in which axons from multiple ring (R) neuron types form several adjacent concentric rings/layers. We show here that pb-eb-gall neuron dendrites sequentially associate with ring neuron R2/R4m and R3/R4d axons within the EB during early pupal stages. The pb-eb-gall neurons play essential roles in directing R neuron axon patterning, and R2/R4m neurons are required for confining R3 axon expansion within correct EB laminae. The transmembrane semaphorin Sema-1a and also the PlexA protein each function cell-autonomously in R2/R4m neurons and non-cell autonomously in neighboring R3 neurons to prevent ectopic mixing of these normally separated R neuron axons. Importantly, Sema-1a-dependent R axon lamination is necessary to prevent aberrant inhibitory synapse formation between R2/R4m and R3 axons, as revealed by optogenetic stimulation of R3 neurons and electrophysiological recording from R2/R4m neurons. Our results define interactions among R neurons that are important for lamination within the EB during pupal development, and they demonstrate that EB lamination is critical for constraining inhibitory synapse formation to specific EB laminae.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Interactions between small- and large-field neurons during EB laminae formation</title><p>Previous anatomical analyses show that small-field pb-eb-gall neurons and large-field R neurons elaborate their dendrites and axons, respectively, in the anterior region of the EB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>). How small- and large-filed neuron process elaboration is coordinated during pupal development so as to establish laminar and columnar organization during EB formation was not known. Our findings suggest that small-field pb-eb-gall neuron dendrites and large-field R neuron axons locally interact during the EB lamination.</p><p>The elaboration of pb-eb-gall dendrites can be separated into at least two discrete steps: initial growth with R2/R4m axons shortly after the onset of metamorphosis and a second expansion phase from the peripheral R2/R4m axon regions to the outermost R4d axon and central R3 axon regions of the EB during the second day after pupae formation. This two-step dendrite growth strategy by pb-eb-gall neurons may direct R axon lamina/ring formation since R axon lamination is greatly compromised following pb-eb-gall neuron ablation. Selective association between pb-eb-gall dendrites and early extending R2/R4m axons could serve to localize R2/R4m axons in the peripheral EB and constrain late R3/R4d axon growth in the central and outermost EB through short-range attraction and repulsion. Future studies will determine the underlying molecular mechanisms that regulate pb-eb-gall dendrite/R axon local interactions.</p><p>R neuron axons also influence pb-eb-gall dendrite development. When we ablated R2/R4m axons, pb-eb-gall neurons show delayed dendrite development at early times and developed smaller dendritic fields within the EB at later stages. However, ablation of either R2/R4m or R1/R3/R4d neurons did not change the general innervation pattern of pb-eb-gall dendrites in the EB, indicating that different R types are independently required for pb-eb-gall dendrite development. In the mouse cerebellum, the expansion of Purkinjie cell dendrites is regulated by TrkC signaling initiated by granule cell-derived neurotrophin-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joo et al., 2014</xref>). At present, it is unclear whether R axons merely serve as a substrate for pb-eb-gall dendrite growth or whether they play an active role in pb-eb-gall dendrite expansion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Refinement of R neuron laminar organization within the ellipsoid body</title><p>Though pb-eb-gall dendrites appear to form a scaffold upon which different R axons extend, interactions among R axons further enhance their laminar organization. Ablation of R2/R4m neurons and their axons, which extend early during EB development, leads to ectopic expansion of R3 axon arbors. Knocking down Sema-1a or PlexA in R2/R4m neurons results in expansion of both R2/R4m and R3 axon rings. These results show that R2/R4m axons constrain R3 axons and separate different R neuron axon layers. However, Sema-1 or PlexA knockdown in R3 neurons does not affect R neuron axon lamination, suggesting that other unidentified molecules mediate direct interactions between R2/R4m and R3 axons, or that R2/R4m neurons regulate R3 axons indirectly through other cells, including pb-eb-gall dendrites.</p><p>Within the R2/R4m ring, MARCM analysis shows that Sema-1a in R4m neurons, but not in R2 neurons, cell-autonomously regulates axon morphogenesis and synapse localization. Further, knocking down PlexA, but not Sema-1a, in R2 (along with R1 and R3) resulted in severe R axon lamination defects similar to those observed following expression of <italic>Sema-1a-RNAi</italic> or <italic>PlexA-RNAi</italic> in R2/R4m. Thus, Sema-1a in R4m and PlexA in R2 could act together to modulate R4m and R2 axon branch growth and targeting.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Versatile roles for conserved guidance cues in EB neuron development</title><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Sema-1a was initially identified as a repulsive axon guidance cue that signals through its receptor PlexA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Winberg et al., 1998</xref>). More recent studies revealed that Sema-1a also functions as a transmembrane receptor to mediate both axon repulsion and attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pecot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hsieh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Komiyama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lattemann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernandez-Fleming et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cafferty et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jeong et al., 2012</xref>). In the mouse visual system, Sema6A is expressed in a group of On direction-selective ganglion cells (On DSGC) and acts as the receptor for brain-derived PlexA2 and PlexA4 to mediate target recognition of On DSGC axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that transmembrane semaphorin reverse signaling is conserved across phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Battistini and Tamagnone, 2016</xref>). In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ellipsoid body, Sema-1a is broadly expressed in most, if not all, major R neuron types. Single-cell MARCM analysis shows that Sema-1a is cell-autonomously required for multiple R neuron types to direct their axon growth within correct EB rings. In addition, axon patterning phenotypes in <italic>Sema-1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants are rescued in R4m neurons when full length, but not truncated, Sema-1a is re-introduced into <italic>Sema-1a</italic> mutant R neurons, further supporting the idea that Sema-1a reverse signaling controls R axon growth.</p><p>However, loss of Sema-1a in different R neuron types and in pb-eb-gall neurons has distinct consequences. In R2/R4m neurons, loss of Sema-1a results in disruption of lamination, whereas in R3 neurons it leads to ectopic axon projections to other brain regions. In pb-eb-gall neurons, both Sema-1a and PlexA act cell-autonomously to guide axon projections outside of the EB but they are not required for dendrite development within the EB. Thus, how Sema-1a forward and reverse signaling shape axon growth and targeting is context dependent. Other parameters, including developmental timing and spatial localization of R neuron axons, also are important for establishing EB ring neuron axon organization. For example, R3 axons develop later than R2/R4m axons and they do not make close contacts with pb-eb-gall dendrites until the second day after puparium formation. Thus, a developmental time window may exist when R3 axons rely on EB-extrinsic repulsive guidance cues, such as fan-shaped body or mushroom body PlexA, to constrain their axon growth through Sema-1a signaling. In addition, other axon guidance and adhesion molecules likely act redundantly or collaboratively with Sema-1a to regulate R axon organization, since we observed that R axon innervation was only partially disrupted in <italic>Sema-1a</italic> and <italic>PlexA</italic> LOF mutants. We expect that many additional molecules contribute to EB ring organization and to the development of other CX structures. Our initial observations on Sema-1a- and PlexA-dependent and independent functions within the developing EB will facilitate their identification. For example, one secreted semaphorin, Sema-2b, and its PlexB receptor exhibit complementary expression patterns in the CX (data not shown). Our preliminary data suggest that Sema-2b/PlexA signaling also plays important roles in EB morphogenesis and FB lamination.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Importance of laminated R neuron axons in EB inhibitory circuit organization</title><p>Is neuronal lamination essential for synapse organization or a consequence of developmental programs that produce nervous system wiring? In the mouse retina, heterophilic adhesive interactions between bipolar cell axons and their layer-specific targets in the inner plexiform layer are critical for correct lamination and direction selective visual system responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duan et al., 2014</xref>). However, although establishment of strong synaptic specificity between W3B RGCs and VGT3 amacrine cells (ACs) is dependent upon the homophilic Ig superfamily adhesion molecule sidekidk2, loss of sidekick2 does not result in apparent loss of W3B RGC/VGT3 laminar organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krishnaswamy et al., 2015</xref>). Further, in zebrafish <italic>astray</italic> mutants, RGC axons do not show clear lamination in the tectum, yet they do display visual system directional tuning responses similar to wild-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nikolaou and Meyer, 2015</xref>), and in <italic>reeler</italic> mutant mice sensory maps in barrel cortex are normal despite disorganization of cortical laminar patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guy et al., 2015</xref>). These and additional results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>) suggest that lamination may not always be required for functional circuit assembly.</p><p>Our results on the role played by Sema-1a in EB axon targeting show that disruption of R axon lamination does indeed result in ectopic inhibitory synaptic connections between R2/R4m and R3 neurons, arguing that lamination is required for the organization of inhibitory synapses among R axons in adjacent EB laminae/rings. How does R axon inhibition and laminar organization of R axon inhibitory synapses contribute to the brain functions and behaviors known to involve R neurons and other EB neurons? Previous studies show that R neurons are functionally heterogeneous, mediating behaviors that include learning and memory involving visual and olfactory sensory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Neuser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ofstad et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) and homeostatic regulation of hunger and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). R neuron functions can differ from ring to ring, as exemplified by R3 neurons, but not R4 neurons, being required for visual place learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ofstad et al., 2011</xref>). Even within each ring, R neurons can serve different functions. For example, only a subset of R4m neurons regulate hunger sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dus et al., 2013</xref>), and a small number of R2 neurons encode sleep drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, among co-stratified R neuron axons residing in the same ring, lateral inhibition from one neuron type to another may help fine tune circuit output, and mutual inhibition may serve to shift bipartite behavioral choices from one choice to another: for example, increasing locomotion to forage, or decreasing locomotion to rest. Physical separation of R neuron axons into different rings/laminae is one way to ensure that GABA-mediated inhibition is effectively transmitted from one R neuron axon to others within the same ring, and to minimize GABA-mediated inhibition to R neuron axons in other rings.</p><p>Lamination may also be involved in separating different types of inhibitory synapses. We found that inotropic GABA-A receptors and GABA are homogenously distributed in R axon terminals throughout the EB. However, metabotropic GABA-B receptors (GABA-B-R) are preferentially localized in the peripheral region of the EB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kahsai et al., 2012</xref>). This raises questions as to whether and how GABA-B receptor-expressing neurons form close contacts with select types of R neuron axons and also how intra-ring R neuron connectivity mechanisms are influenced by different inhibitory circuits.</p><p>In conclusion, we have investigated the spatiotemporal innervation by R neuron axons and pb-eb-gall dendrites during EB formation, and we have uncovered different roles played by these cellular components during the formation of the EB circular lamination pattern. Further, the transmembrane proteins Sema-1a and PlexA play critical roles in the development of R neuron axon patterning in the EB. These results provide evidence for the functional significance of R axon lamination in the context of inhibitory synapse organization within and between EB laminae/rings, suggesting that similar developmental strategies are employed by the EB in flies and in other laminated neural systems in both invertebrates and vertebrates.

Perforated patch-clamp recordings with β-escin were performed as previously described with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), in order to measure action potentials (APs) from EB R2/R4m neurons. Brains were removed and dissected in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> physiological saline solution (101 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 20.7 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 5 mM glucose; pH 7.2), which was pre-bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. To better visualize the recording site, the perineuronal sheath surrounding the brain was focally and carefully removed after treating with an enzymatic cocktail, collagenase (0.4 mg/ml) and dispase (0.8 mg/ml), at 22°C for 1 min and cleaning with a small stream of saline pressure-ejected from a large diameter pipette using a 1-mL syringe. In addition, prior to recording, cell surfaces were cleaned with saline pressure-ejected from a small diameter pipette, using a 1-ml syringe connected to the pipette holder. The recording chamber was placed on an X-Y stage platform (PP-3185–00; Scientifica, UK), and the cell bodies of the targeted EB ring neurons were visualized with tdTomato fluorescence on a fixed-stage upright microscope (BX51WI; Olympus, Japan) and viewed with a 40× water immersion objective lens (LUMPlanFl, NA: 0.8, Olympus). Patch pipettes (8–12 MΩ) were fashioned from borosilicate glass capillary without filament (OD/ID: 1.2/0.68 mm, 627500, A-M systems, WA) by using a Flaming-Brown puller (P-1000; Sutter Instrument), and further polished with a MF200 microforge (WPI) prior to filling internal pipette solution (102 mM potassium gluconate, 0.085 mM CaCl2, 0.94 mM EGTA, 8.5 mM HEPES, 4 mM Mg-ATP, 0.5 mM Na-GTP, 17 mM NaCl; pH 7.2). Biocytin hydrazide (13 mM; Life Technologies) was added to the pipette solution before the recording. Recordings were acquired with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices), and sampled with a Digidata 1440A interface (Molecular Devices). These devices were controlled via pCLAMP 10 software (Molecular Devices). The signals were sampled at 20 kHz and low-pass filtered at 2 kHz. Junction potentials were nullified prior to high-resistance (GΩ) seal formation. Cells showing evidence of ‘mechanical’ breakthrough, as assessed by the abrupt generation of a large capacitance transient (as opposed to the more progressive, gradual one generated by chemical perforation) were excluded. One neuron per brain was recorded. During the recording, the bath solution was slowly but continuously perfused with saline by means of a gravity-driven system (approximate flow rate of 1–2 ml/min). APs were elicited in response to current injections with 300 ms stepping pulses at 20 pA increments up to 100 pA. Electrophysiological analysis was performed using custom MATLAB-based software (software code is included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Source code 1</xref>). APs were detected automatically by identification of local maxima and were then manually curated to remove excitatory post-synaptic potentials using minimum voltage threshold criteria. Frequency of detected APs was quantified as mean firing rate during current injection. Several key parameters were calculated or measured from the original data, such as: the slope of the f-I curve, the current threshold and and input resistance and resting membrane potential.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Optogenetic photostimulation</title><p>All-trans retinal (ATR) (R2500, Sigma) was prepared as a 35 mM stock solution dissolved in ethanol, and this stock was mixed into rehydrated fly food flakes (Nutri-Fly Instant, 66–117, Genesee Scientific) at a final concentration of 400 μM. A high-powered red LED with peak wavelength at 627 nm (LXM2-PD01-0050, Lumileds) and Buckpuck driver (RapidLED, Randolph, Vermont) was used to stimulate CsChrimson-expressing EB R3 neurons. The LED was mounted directly underneath the preparation and light was presented at 0.276 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> as measured by light meter (Fieldmate power meter, Coherent, CA).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mani Ramaswami as Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Greg J Bashaw (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper Kolodkin and co-workers explore the role of Semaphorin 1a (Sema 1a) and Plexin A in regulated the formation of the circuitry in the ellipsoid body (EB) in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central brain. They demonstrate that these well-characterized guidance molecules are necessary for the normal lamination of the ellipsoid body neuropil. Using electrophysiology and optogenetics, they demonstrate further that as a consequence of disrupted lamination, neurons form inappropriate (inhibitory) connections with non-target subclasses of neurons. These data argue that lamination is essential to promote normal patterns of synaptic connectivity.</p><p>Visualizing Ring (R) axon targeting in the EB using specific Gal4 and LexA lines, the authors demonstrate through ablation experiments that axon-axon interactions between R neurons contribute to the laminar organization of the EB. The transmembrane receptor Sema1a and its interacting partner PlexinA are broadly expressed in R neurons, and knockdown experiments demonstrate they are required for constraining R2/4m axons to specific lamina. Single cell MARCM clones reveal that Sema1a acts cell autonomously in R4m neurons to limit axonal growth and synapse formation, in a cytodomain-dependent manner. In addition, loss of Sema1a or PlexA in R2/4m neurons non-cell autonomously disrupts laminar target of R3 neurons. Protein trap reporters and antibodies reveal that R neurons are primarily GABAergic. Optogenetics and electrophysiological recordings show that while under control conditions, activating R3 neurons has no significant effect on evoked action potentials recorded in R2/4m neurons, when lamination decfects are induced by Sema/Plexin disruption, then R3 neurons inhibit R2/4m neurons.</p><p>The Sema/Plexin phenotypes are carefully documented and quite convincing. This study is also unique for experimentally demonstrating a role for lamination in restricting inhibitory connections, going beyond previous studies (Duan et al., 2014) and testing the intuitive but unproven idea that lamination plays an important role in preventing the formation of inappropriate synapses.</p><p>This is a valuable contribution. However, it could be improved and deepened by some revisions and clarifications that the authors should try to include, unless there are strong reasons why these would be difficult in a two-month timeframe.</p><p>A relatively major comment:</p><p>1) Though enticing to think PlexA would be required in R2, this is not experimentally addressed and so the developmental mechanism by which Sema1 and PlexA regulate lamination is poorly defined. That is, while both ligand and receptor are required for lamination, it remains unclear whether they are required on the same or different neurons. Can this issue be experimentally addressed?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25328.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Though enticing to think PlexA would be required in R2, this is not experimentally addressed and so the developmental mechanism by which Sema1 and PlexA regulate lamination is poorly defined.

Can this issue be experimentally addressed?</italic></p><p>This is an important point. We were initially unable to directly test this idea because all the R2 drivers we examined also drive expression in R4m neurons. Until recently, we were unaware of the driver R40G10-GAL4, which was characterized by Dr. Volker Hartenstein’s laboratory and will soon be published in The Journal of Comparative Neurobiology. However, based on their findings (communicated to us as a “personal communication” manuscript now “in press”), R40G10-GAL4 drives expression in R1-3 neurons from early pupae to adult stages. Although R40G10-GAL4 is not R2-specific, it does allow us to separate R2 neurons from R4m neurons during pupal development.</p><p>Therefore, we knocked down Sema-1a or PlexA using R40G10-GAL4 and found that both of these manipulations gave strong overall EB morphological and also R axon elaboration defects (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since our previous work showed that knocking down Sema-1a or PlexA with several R1/R3 GAL4 drivers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and “data not shown”) did not cause obvious EB morphology or R axon lamination defects, these defects seen using R40G10-GAL4 are likely due to loss of Sema-1a or PlexA from R2 alone, or a combinatorial effect resulting from removing Sema-1a or PlexA from R1/2/3.</p><p>We observed significant differences between Sema-1a-RNAi and PlexA-RNAi experiments using R40G10-GAL4. First, EB morphology changes were distinct. PlexA-RNAi resulted in a more open EB conformation than we observed with Sema-1a-RNAi (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>: compare Av and Bv, to Avi and Bvi). Second, R axon lamination was disrupted differently when Sema1a or PlexA was knocked down using R40G10-GAL4 to drive RNAi expression. Two different lexA drivers were used to label R neurons: R34D03-LexA for R4m and R54B05-LexA for R3. These were used separately in combination with R40G10-GAL4 to drive expression of UAS-Sema-1a-RNAi or UAS-PlexA-RNAi.</p><p>In Sema-1a–RNAi-expressing animals, although both R4m and R3 axons become disorganized, but their axons remained in the outer and inner regions in the EB, respectively, suggesting preservation of axon lamination (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, Aii and Bii). However, in PlexA-RNAi expressing animals, R4m and R3 axons expand their elaboration to cover most of the EB, as can be appreciated in frontal view images, presumably resulting in a complete breakdown of R axon lamination (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, Aiii and Biii). These new data suggest that Sema-1a and PlexA function differently in R1-3 for EB development (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Most importantly, PlexA, but not Sema-1a, is required in R1-3 for R axon lamination.</p><p>Taken together, our new and previous data support a model in which Sema-1a and PlexA function respectively in R4m and R2 to regulate R axon lamination. The new findings are presented in our New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, and are described in the text of our revised submission.</p></body></sub-article></article>
