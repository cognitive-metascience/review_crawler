Purkinje cells (PCs). Climbing fibers instruct these synaptic modifications when they excite PCs in conjunction with parallel fiber activity, a pairing that enhances climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in PC dendrites. In vivo, climbing fibers spike continuously, including during movements when parallel fibers are simultaneously conveying sensorimotor information to PCs. Whether parallel fiber activity enhances climbing fiber Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling during motor behaviors is unknown. In mice, we found that inhibitory molecular layer interneurons (MLIs), activated by parallel fibers during practiced movements, suppressed parallel fiber enhancement of climbing fiber Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in PCs. Similar results were obtained in acute slices for brief parallel fiber stimuli. Interestingly, more prolonged parallel fiber excitation revealed latent supralinear Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Therefore, the balance of parallel fiber and MLI input onto PCs regulates concomitant climbing fiber Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS083894</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Christie</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Christie</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Christie</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In behaving mice, inhibition from molecular layer interneurons attenuates excitation of Purkinje cells by parallel fibers and suppresses their ability to enhance climbing fiber-triggered dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural circuits that support motor learning must respond to, and adjust for, stimuli relevant for encoding adaptation. With equal importance, these circuits must also prevent network alterations during stimuli unrelated or unnecessary for behavioral modification. In the cerebellar cortex, synaptic re-weighting of parallel fiber input onto Purkinje cells (PCs) is thought to provide the basis for many types of motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ito and Kano, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ito et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kano et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hansel and Linden, 2000</xref>). Climbing fibers instruct synaptic alterations by evoking dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes in PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kano et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hansel and Linden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coesmans et al., 2004</xref>) in response to adaptive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Simpson and Alley, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilbert and Thach, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Medina and Lisberger, 2008</xref>). However, climbing fiber activity also occurs regularly at 1–2 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mukamel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ozden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Gruijl et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, PCs must distinguish which climbing fiber signals are relevant for inducing adaptation, as well as prevent or gate inappropriate circuit alterations by climbing fibers when plasticity is unwarranted or apt to produce an incorrect alteration of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kimpo et al., 2014</xref>). The integrative features of PC dendrites offer solutions as to how PCs accomplish this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Najafi and Medina, 2013</xref>).</p><p>When activated in conjunction with parallel fibers in ex vivo preparations, climbing fiber-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in PC dendrites are enhanced in a supralinear manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Otsu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Piochon et al., 2016</xref>). Supralinear signaling achieves a threshold level of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation that triggers long-term depression (LTD) at parallel fiber-PC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Finch et al., 2012</xref>). Whether climbing fiber Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in PC dendrites are augmented by preceding parallel fiber activity in vivo is unclear. Certainly, PCs receive sensorimotor information transmitted by granule cells during the execution of movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ozden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wilms and Häusser, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, enhanced PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are observed in response to externally produced sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Najafi et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Najafi et al., 2014b</xref>). However, if self-generated parallel fiber activity is sufficient to enhance ongoing climbing fiber Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, then PCs would continuously undergo plasticity despite conditions where learning provides no benefit to motor outcomes. To counteract direct parallel fiber excitation of PCs, parallel fibers also excite molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) driving feed-forward inhibition that can attenuate parallel fiber excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mittmann et al., 2005</xref>). MLIs can also directly reduce climbing fiber-evoked responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Callaway et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kitamura and Häusser, 2011</xref>) and impair LTD at parallel fiber-PC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ekerot and Kano, 1985</xref>). Consequently, the balance of excitatory and inhibitory input onto PCs may determine the level of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and, ultimately, the extent of climbing fiber-dependent learning.</p><p>We examined climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in PC dendrites in vivo to determine how these responses are regulated by local circuit activity in the cerebellar cortex of awake behaving mice. During the performance of practiced movements, we found that parallel fiber and climbing fiber co-activity failed to produce supralinear Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. However, disinhibiting the molecular layer through chemogenetic suppression of MLI activity enhanced the amplitude of climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in PCs, specifically during movements when both parallel fibers and MLIs were activated. Quantitative ex-vivo measurements in PC dendrites confirmed that MLI-mediated feed-forward inhibition limits the ability of parallel fiber excitation to produce supralinearity. Bi-directional optogenetic actuation of MLI activity during parallel fiber stimuli altered associative parallel fiber-climbing fiber Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, dependent on the level of MLI output. Our results show that climbing fiber Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in PCs are regulated by the counterbalance of MLI-mediated inhibition with parallel fiber-evoked EPSPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Climbing fiber Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signals in PCs are unresponsive to behavior-induced parallel fiber activity</title><p>We used two-photon laser scanning microscopy (2pLSM) to measure climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in PC dendrites of lobule Crus II in head-fixed mice conditioned to lick for water from a port when cued by an audible tone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Events were categorized whether they occurred during water consumption when granule cells were active or in the absence of licking movements when granule cells were relatively inactive. Isolated events comprised the majority of all identified Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in PC dendrites, whether or not the animal was actively engaged in water consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Surprisingly, we found no difference in the average amplitudes of isolated Ca<sup>2+</sup> events across PCs between these two behavioral states (ΔF/F = 0.223 ± 0.008 and 0.223 ± 0.011, licking and non-licking, respectively; p=0.99; N = 11 mice; paired Student’s t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Similar results were also obtained for all other PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> events; this included overlapping responses occurring closely in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). The lack of behavioral-dependent differences in PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> event amplitudes was unlikely attributable to GCaMP6f biophysics. While this Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator is nonlinear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), it has been shown to be sensitive enough to report slight alteration of PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals evoked by unexpected sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Najafi et al., 2014b</xref>). Thus, climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in PC dendrites appeared resistant to licking-related co-activity of granule cells. This also suggests that PC dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses are not always subject to enhancement in the context of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Najafi et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Najafi et al., 2014b</xref>) and that the influence of parallel fiber excitation on the integrated dendritic response to climbing fiber input may be subject to regulation.</p><p>In addition to PCs, granule cells also excite MLIs. Therefore, it was not surprising that, using in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, we found that the licking-induced activation of MLIs showed a close correspondence to that of parallel fibers, measured simultaneously, during licking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This suggests a potential regulatory counterbalance of MLI-mediated feed-forward inhibition onto PCs in superimposition with their direct excitation by granule cells. If so, activation of MLIs during licking could alter conjunctive parallel fiber-climbing fiber Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in PC dendrites. To examine the relationship between MLIs and climbing fiber-evoked responses in PCs, we used a dual-color imaging approach to simultaneously measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in both cell types. By performing experiments in <italic>Kit::Cre</italic> mice, a driver line with high specificity for MLIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amat et al., 2017</xref>; these mice may have a low abundance of Golgi cell targeting), we could transduce these cells with an AAV containing Cre-dependent RCaMP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Inoue et al., 2015</xref>), a red genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator spectrally separable from green GCaMP6f expressed in PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). During bouts of cued licking, climbing fibers evoke Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in PCs at the same time that the ensemble of surrounding MLIs was activated by parallel fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). However, the amplitude of climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in PCs did not co-vary with the activity level of MLIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) that increased and decreased in proportion to adjustments in lick rate during water consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaffield and Christie, 2017</xref>).

Intraperitoneal injection of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), the cognate agonist of hM4d, led to an increase in the amplitude of isolated climbing fiber-evoked dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in PCs relative to control measurements obtained in separate sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and F</xref>).

This unbiased measure reflects the integration of all dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> during licking bouts independent of any event detection. The enhancement of trial-averaged dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity was time-locked to the licking-evoked activation of MLIs, measured simultaneously in a subset of these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The effect of disinhibition on trial-averaged PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity is likely attributable to an increased amplitude of climbing fiber events because chemogenetic suppression of MLI activity did not affect the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in PCs (1.55 ± 0.19 Hz and 1.51 ± 0.47 Hz for control and CNO, respectively; p=0.51, paired Student’s t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) and climbing fiber inputs are known to produce the majority of Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in dendrites in response to in vivo excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mukamel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ozden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Najafi et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p>Our previous work showed that bilateral chemogenetic suppression of MLIs in Crus II slows the rate of licking, indicating an influence of MLIs on motor output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaffield and Christie, 2017</xref>). However, in these current experiments, we limited expression of hM4d to MLIs of left Crus II which, upon suppression by CNO administration, failed to significantly affect average licking dynamics (rate, pattern, rhythmicity, and time from cue presentation to lick initiation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). Although this result argues against the possibility that chemogenetic-induced behavioral perturbations accounted for alteration of climbing fiber-evoked responses in PCs, it may be that unquantified orofacial movements, such as lateral tongue displacement, were altered. We attempted to control for this more carefully by also examining PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in a subset of hM4d-expressing mice that had closely matched licking rates before and during molecular layer disinhibition. Even in these animals, isolated Ca<sup>2+</sup> event amplitudes were increased with MLI activity suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>). We conclude that alteration of climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in PCs with disinhibition resulted from the influence of MLIs on PC dendritic integration.

First, we determined the average change in Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity due to movements during cued water consumption relative to baseline measurements in the absence of licking for each pixel in all identified dendrites. This was calculated for the same PCs in both control sessions as well as during chemogenetic activity suppression of MLIs. There was a clear shift to larger values in the disinhibited condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Next, from these distributions, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to estimate that ~66% of the fractional area of all individual dendrites showed enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling with MLI activity suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, inset).

By producing localized inhibitory effects on climbing fiber-evoked dendritic spiking, MLIs can contribute to increased variability of climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the arbors of individual PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Callaway et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kitamura and Häusser, 2011</xref>). Comparisons of climbing fiber Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in two distinct branches of the same PC dendrite showed that, although evoked responses occurred reliably at both locations, their amplitudes could differ slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This held true whether or not the animal was consuming water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F and H</xref>). However, after MLI activity suppression by intraperitoneal injection of CNO, there was a modest decrease in the inter-branch variability during licking movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) that was statistically different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). This points to a potential non-uniform effect of MLI-mediated inhibition on the PC response to climbing fiber excitation during task engagement.

This is because burst firing of olivary projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crill, 1970</xref>), conveyed to the cerebellar cortex by climbing fibers, promotes increased PC dendritic spiking and larger amplitude Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kitamura and Häusser, 2011</xref>).

Therefore, in awake mice, climbing fiber activity reliably drives dendritic spiking in their postsynaptic targets. The amplitudes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in individual climbing fibers showed considerable variation during ongoing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Sorted events, collected across mice, had a non-normal distribution (p&lt;0.0001, Shapiro-Wilk Test; N = 3579 events; 30 climbing fibers; 7 mice). Instead, amplitude distributions skewed towards larger values suggestive of a multimodal composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Our interpretation of these observations is that Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in climbing fibers are generated by discrete, high-frequency (100–400 Hz) bursts of firing and that the variance in their amplitudes reflects heterogeneity in the number of action potentials contained in the burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathy et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in climbing fibers increased at licking onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This indicates that licking initiation is signaled in their activity and generates the corresponding uptick in dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in PCs during the same period of the task (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). To evaluate whether burst firing in climbing fibers encodes licking-related information, we compared Ca<sup>2+</sup> events evoked during water consumption to those occurring in the absence of licking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The lack of significant differences between the amplitudes of mean events in these conditions (p=0.89; paired Student’s t-test) indicates that the spike content of presynaptic bursts in climbing fibers varies independent of practiced movements. Because these measurements were performed in <italic>Kit::Cre</italic> mice expressing hM4d in MLIs, we disinhibited the molecular layer by intraperitoneal injection of CNO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and assessed for differences in climbing fiber Ca<sup>2+</sup> events. Chemogenetic suppression of MLI activity had no effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rates (change of 15.5 ± 16.2% from control, p=0.47, paired Student’s t-test) nor did it affect the amplitude of events evoked during licking when MLIs are normally activated (p=0.66, paired Student’s t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). This result rules out that enhancement of PC dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling with molecular layer disinhibition is due to a change in presynaptic climbing fiber activity. Furthermore, it argues against the possibility that unresolved, closely-spaced Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in postsynaptic PCs, erroneously categorized as individual responses, accounted for the amplitude change with MLI activity suppression. Otherwise, this would have also been reflected as a corresponding increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> event amplitudes in presynaptic climbing fibers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>MLIs suppress supralinear climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signaling in PC dendrites</title><p>The amplitude of climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in PC dendrites can be enhanced if climbing fibers are stimulated in conjunction with preceding parallel fiber activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2000</xref>).

In awake mice engaged in a routine motor task that activates parallel fibers, MLIs enforce normalization of dendritic climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals matching those occurring spontaneously during quiescence when parallel fibers are inactive. In ex vivo recordings, short bursts of parallel fiber stimuli fail to evoke supralinear climbing fiber Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in PCs dendrites due to MLI-mediated feed-forward inhibition that attenuates parallel fiber EPSPs. Thus, during the performance of practiced movements, recruitment of inhibition from MLIs gates climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling that might otherwise induce plasticity and, therefore, is well positioned to constrain learning in the absence of motor performance errors.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Encoding of climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signals in PCs</title><p>Parallel fiber excitation drives simple spiking in PCs while convergent inhibition from MLIs influences the frequency and regularity of these responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Häusser and Clark, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mittmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dizon and Khodakhah, 2011</xref>). In addition, climbing fiber-mediated activation of dendritic voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels produces local, regenerative spikes in PC dendrites that are subject to amplification by preceding parallel fiber activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmolesky et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Otsu et al., 2014</xref>). Our observations indicate that, in behaving mice, climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in PC dendrites is resistant to enhancement by co-active parallel fibers due to inhibition from MLIs. Therefore, in addition to influencing the pattern and timing of PC simple spiking during movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jelitai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), MLIs also participate in encoding the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to climbing fiber excitation by locally gating the dynamics of non-linear dendritic signaling. We propose that by performing these non-mutually exclusive operations, MLIs are well-placed to influence motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heiney et al., 2014</xref>) as well as motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jörntell et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Parallel fiber-evoked EPSPs inactivate subthreshold, voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> currents (<italic>I<sub>SA</sub></italic>) in PC dendrites that can facilitate the initiation and propagation of subsequent climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes into spiny branchlets, thereby enhancing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Otsu et al., 2014</xref>). In our slice recordings, we observed that MLI feed-forward inhibition diminished the ability of parallel fibers to enhance climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. This effect is likely attributable to the marked reduction in parallel fiber-triggered excitatory potentials by feed-forward inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mittmann et al., 2005</xref>). Attenuated PSPs are expected to be less efficacious in generating depolarization-induced K<sup>+</sup> channel inactivation. However, in our acute slice experiments, the sensitivity of climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling to enhancement by parallel fibers could be restored by longer lasting parallel fiber stimuli. Although, this effect could be offset, dependent on the level of MLI activity. Thus, gating of non-linear dendritic signaling in PCs is not necessarily an ‘all-or-none’ phenomenon as classically described for direct climbing fiber excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eccles et al., 1966</xref>). Rather, the average amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in PC dendrites elicited by climbing fibers will depend on the net balance of preceding parallel fiber excitation and MLI-mediated inhibition, with the accumulation and recovery of <italic>I<sub>SA</sub></italic> inactivation evolving with the summating PSPs. Our analysis did not distinguish whether, at the single trial level, the balance of PF-mediated excitation and inhibition influences the probability or the amplitude of a supralinear Ca<sup>2+</sup> event in PC dendrites, though both are apt to affect plasticity induction.</p><p>In our in vivo recordings, the amplitude of climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in PC dendrites did not co-vary with the level of MLI activation during water consumption. This implies that a homeostasis is achieved between the excitatory activity of parallel fibers and inhibition from MLIs to prevent supralinear climbing fiber Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Even under conditions where MLI activity decreased during motor behavior (e.g., as the lick rate decreased), excitation and inhibition appeared in balance, as determined by the high correspondence of parallel fiber and MLI activity. This likely limited any enhancement of PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> events during task performance. Whether feed-forward inhibition can continuously counteract parallel fiber excitation across a range of behavioral conditions is yet to be determined.</p><p>Apart from regulating supralinear enhancement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals by parallel fibers, MLIs can also reduce the amplitude of climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients through direct electrogenic suppression of PC dendritic spiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Callaway et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kitamura and Häusser, 2011</xref>). We cannot rule out the possibility that this mechanism also affects climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling during practiced movements. However, direct suppression of dendritic spiking by inhibition would result in smaller amplitude Ca<sup>2+</sup> events during movement when MLIs are active compared to spontaneous events occurring in quiescence. We did not observe such an effect in our in vivo measurements. Therefore, we conclude that the predominant role of MLIs on climbing fiber-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling during practiced motor behavior is through their inhibitory influence on non-linear dendritic operations in PCs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Climbing fiber Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signaling and plasticity</title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals produced in the PC dendrite by climbing fiber excitation have been subject to intensive investigation because intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation is a biochemical trigger for inducing synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Finch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lamont and Weber, 2012</xref>), and synaptic plasticity has been implicated as a neural correlate of motor learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marr, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albus, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ito and Kano, 1982</xref>).

Unconstrained plasticity in the disinhibited cortex may force parallel fiber-PC synapses into a saturated state where motor learning can no longer occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nguyen-Vu et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, genetic deletion of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs from PCs impedes consolidation of motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wulff et al., 2009</xref>), a result that may be attributable to the disinhibition of PCs and indiscriminate plasticity produced by unregulated, supralinear climbing fiber Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</p><p>Inhibitory control of plasticity by modulation of dendritic excitability may be a ubiquitous function of GABA-releasing interneurons in the brain. Interneurons in the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and striatum are known to dynamically regulate dendritic processing in their postsynaptic targets, electrogenically gating synaptic interactions that lead to alterations in circuit function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paulsen and Moser, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Letzkus et al., 2015</xref>). In this report, we extend inhibitory regulation to non-linear Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in PCs.

Even in experiments where molecular layer disinhibition reduced inter-branch variance of climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses, the effect was small. This suggests that heterogeneity of MLI-mediated inhibition on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling within PC dendritic arbors is limited during practiced movement. Therefore, we envision that inhibition gates plasticity on a cell-wide scale.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Behavioral significance of MLI-gating of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in PCs</title><p>A novel aspect of our findings is that Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in PC dendrites are not always augmented by the context of active motor behavior. However, the lack of supralinear Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling during movement in our study does not preclude the possibility that such responses could occur under different behavioral conditions. In our experiments, mice elicited well-rehearsed motor responses that, through prior practice, resulted in highly stereotyped licks trial after trial indicative of few performance errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaffield and Christie, 2017</xref>). During these trials, as well as during un-cued licking with free access to water, climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity increases in PCs at the onset of water consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaffield et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, we have not yet determined the role these signals play in the cued licking task, nor whether they (or the cerebellum in general) are required for the behavior. That the amplitudes of these evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> events are indistinguishable from spontaneous activity suggests that they may not be useful for learning. As the mice are performing a skilled behavior, these movement-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> events could help with motor memory retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Medina et al., 2002</xref>). During more mistake-prone behaviors, where mice must learn to carefully articulate their movements using the benefit of sensorimotor associations, it may be that parallel fibers contribute to climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling to reach a threshold necessary for inducing plasticity and modification of motor output. In this way, we do not discount the possibility that the extent of climbing fiber-mediated excitation of PCs, which may vary dependent on the severity of motor errors, plays a role in determining the magnitude of learning outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang and Lisberger, 2014</xref>).</p><p>This hypothesis is consistent with work showing that external sensory cues that can guide associative learning (e.g., classical eyeblink conditioning), evoke graded climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in PC dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Najafi et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Najafi et al., 2014b</xref>). Enhancement of these signals may be driven, in part, from conjunctive activity of parallel fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giovannucci et al., 2017</xref>). In this scenario, enhanced climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in PCs during learning may arise from alterations in network activity within the cerebellar cortex. Spike bursting of granule cells could shift the balance of parallel fiber excitation and feed-forward inhibition through short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Häusser and Clark, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grangeray-Vilmint et al., 2018</xref>), perhaps unlocking the ability of parallel fibers to generate non-linear Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in PCs when activated by multimodal streams of sensorimotor information, as occurs during associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chadderton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ishikawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giovannucci et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, MLIs inhibit one another through their structured GABAergic interconnections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rieubland et al., 2014</xref>). Increased inhibition between MLIs in response to salient learning events would allow parallel fibers to generate supralinear Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in PCs during climbing fiber excitation. Alternatively, sensorimotor signals useful for producing learning could be conveyed to PCs through a separate population of granule cells whose parallel fibers bypasses MLIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ekerot and Jörntell, 2001</xref>). Future work will help clarify if and how MLI regulation of climbing fiber Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in PCs is altered during learning.</p><p>An important caveat to our study is that we did not specifically monitor granule cell activity in the disinhibited state. Chemogenetic suppression of some Golgi cells, which may be expected considering that <italic>Kit::Cre</italic> mice are not pristinely selective for MLIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amat et al., 2017</xref>), might produce enhanced excitability in a subpopulation of granule cells. We cannot rule out a scenario where such enhancement of PF signaling onto PCs - not apparent in licking behavior nor in the responsiveness of MLIs whose activity we monitored - directly contributes to increased PC dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity. Notably, the absence of a disinhibitory effect on the behavior-induced MLI population response following CNO administration may reflect the inability of our GCaMP imaging approach to discern the contribution of spike-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry from activity mediated by synaptic sources (e.g., Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable AMPA and NMDA receptors); the latter is expected to be relatively less susceptible to alteration by chemogenetic MLI activity suppression. However, strong hM4d-mediated suppression of MLI neurotransmission, apart from spiking and synaptic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stachniak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amat et al., 2017</xref>), combined with evidence from our ex vivo experiments showing a direct inhibitory influence of MLIs on PF-evoked enhancement of PC dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, support our conclusion that MLI activity gates PC responses to climbing fiber excitation in vivo.</p><p>In summary, our results emphasize the importance of the PC dendrite as a central locus for encoding the integrated response to climbing fiber input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Najafi and Medina, 2013</xref>) and, hence, determining the physiological consequence of olivary signaling in the cerebellar system. Climbing fibers fire in response to motor errors. Climbing fibers also fire during normal movements, activity that may be important for coordinating motor timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lang et al., 2017</xref>). Context-specific MLI activity might allow climbing fibers to functionally multiplex. Complex spikes in the PC soma could be transmitted to downstream premotor targets and influence motor control apart from Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the PC dendrite where plasticity is induced. By gating supralinear climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, molecular layer inhibition may prevent unwarranted or unnecessary adaptation during accurately performed movements.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>strain, (Mus Musculus)</td><td><italic>Kit::Cre</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amat et al., 2017</xref></td><td>on C57Bl/6 <break/>background</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct</td><td>AAV1-<italic>Pcp2</italic>.4-GCaMP6f</td><td>University of North <break/>Carolina</td><td>custom</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct</td><td>AAV1-<italic>Pcp2</italic>.4-FLPo</td><td>University of North <break/>Carolina</td><td>custom</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct</td><td>AAV1-CAG-Flex(FRT) <break/>rev-RCaMP2</td><td>University of North <break/>Carolina</td><td>custom</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct</td><td>AAV1-CAG-Flex(<italic>loxP</italic>) <break/>rev-RCaMP2</td><td>University of <break/>Pennsylvania</td><td>custom</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct</td><td>AAV1-CAG-Flex(FRT) <break/>rev-GCaMP6f</td><td>University of North <break/>Carolina</td><td>custom</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct</td><td>AAV1-CAG-Flex(<italic>loxP</italic>) <break/>rev-ChR2.HA-2a-hM4d</td><td>ViGene</td><td>custom</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct</td><td>AAV1-Syn-GCaMP6f</td><td>University of <break/>Pennsylvania</td><td>AV-1-PV2822</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct</td><td>AAV1-CaMKIIα-GCaMP6f</td><td>University of Pennsylvania</td><td>AV-1-PV2822</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct</td><td>AAV1-EF1α-Flex(<italic>loxP</italic>) <break/>rev-GtACR2.eYFP</td><td>ViGene</td><td>custom</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct</td><td valign="bottom">AAV5-EF1α-Flex(<italic>loxP</italic>) <break/>rev-bReachES-TS-YFP</td><td>University of North <break/>Carolina</td><td>shelf</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>anti HA</td><td>Abcam</td><td>#ab9110</td></tr><tr><td>software, algorithm</td><td>Prism</td><td>GraphPad</td><td>Statistical analysis</td></tr><tr><td>software, algorithm</td><td>Matlab</td><td>Mathworks</td><td>Image analysis</td></tr><tr><td>software, algorithm</td><td>ImageJ</td><td>NIH</td><td>Image analysis</td></tr><tr><td>software, algorithm</td><td>bControl</td><td>Carlos Brody, Princeton</td><td>Behavior control</td></tr><tr><td>software, algorithm</td><td>ScanImage</td><td>Vidrio Technologies</td><td>Microscope control</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Animal procedures were conducted using protocol 15–205 approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience. Heterozygous adult <italic>Kit::Cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amat et al., 2017</xref>) of both genders were used for all experiments (in vivo and ex vivo:&gt;10 and&gt;7 weeks of age, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Surgical procedures</title><p>As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaffield et al., 2016</xref>), cranial windows for in vivo imaging in the cerebellum were prepared from mice under isoflurane (1.5–2.0%). Warmth was provided by a heating pad using biofeedback to maintain a stable core body temperature (37°C). Non-responsiveness to intermittent toe pinches confirmed the surgical plane of anesthesia. For this procedure, the skull was exposed through surgical excision of the scalp (subcutaneous injection of lidocaine/bupivacaine provided local anesthesia). A custom-engineered stainless steel head post was then attached onto the dried, exposed bone, centered on the midline of the cranium, using Metabond (Parkell, Edgewood, NY). A small craniotomy (~2 mm square) was cut over the left lateral cerebellum using a scalpel without disturbing the underlying dura mater. The opening was covered with a small glass coverslip (CS-3R, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT), and cemented in place with Metabond such that the window applied minimal pressure to the brain. Post-operative analgesia (buprenorphine; 0.35 mg/kg) was administered and the animal recovered under supervision until ambulatory.</p><p>Prior to placement of the window, adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) were pressure injected into the brain using beveled glass micropipettes. Viruses included: AAV1-Pcp2.4-GCaMP6f, AAV1-Pcp2.4-FLPo, AAV1-CAG-Flex(FRT)rev-RCaMP2, AAV1-CAG-Flex(<italic>loxP</italic>)rev-RCaMP2, AAV1-CAG-Flex(FRT)rev-GCaMP6f, AAV1-CAG-Flex(<italic>loxP</italic>)rev-ChR2.HA-2a-hM4d, AAV1-Syn-GCaMP6f (all custom prepared at the University of North Carolina Vector Core Facility, the University of Pennsylvania Vector Core Facility, or ViGene, Rockville, MD). For injections into lobule Crus II, the micropipette generally contained multiple viruses (100–150 nl) in order to avoid repeated penetrations of the same location. Three different injection depths (150–350 µm below the dura) were used to evenly transduce both PCs and MLIs. To transduce granule cells, AAV1-Syn-GCaMP6f was injected 250–350 mm below the dura (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giovannucci et al., 2017</xref>); this non-selective approach also resulted in expression of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator in MLIs and Golgi cells. For climbing fiber transduction, AAV1-CaMKIIα-GCaMP6f (University of Pennsylvania) was injected into the inferior olive through a surgical opening in the back of the neck with access to the brainstem through the foramen magnum at the following coordinates from lambda: x = 0.3 mm, y = −4.9 mm, z = −4.6 mm at a depth of 3.6 mm using an approach angle of 62°. Total volumes of injections were ~500 nl. All injection rates were ~25 nl/min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Behavior task</title><p>Mice were head restrained in a previously described behavior apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaffield et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaffield and Christie, 2017</xref>) by attaching the surgically implanted post to a solid rod that provided stiff resistance to movement while the animal sat in a metal tube (diameter 25.4 mm). Water was delivered through a gavage needle with the end positioned about 2.5 mm from the mouth. All behavior timing was controlled using bControl (Brody Lab; Princeton). Licks were detected using a low-current circuit whereby contact of the tongue with the port produced a small electrical signal that was recorded digitally and could be used to register lick timing against time-series images acquired with 2pLSM. Lick timing was used to calculate lick probabilities within a given time bin. We determined lick rate as the inverse of the average inter-lick interval with the exception of the adjusted lick rate (a measure accounting for the intervals before and after each lick), which was calculated as published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaffield and Christie, 2017</xref>). Videography was used to ensure consistent placement of the lick port across all sessions for each mouse.</p><p>To provide motivation for participation in the behavior task, mice were maintained on a water-restricted diet (1 ml of water/day) and monitored daily for health. In the first few sessions, mice were familiarized with the apparatus and head restraint, and were trained to lick from the water delivery port by providing free access to water. After mastery, demonstrated by consistent licking, and judged by the uptake of water under high-speed videography, a tone cue (6 kHz) was added signaling water availability. After many trials (100–200 trials/day; 3–5 days), mice learned to lick at the onset of the tone and refrain from licking after fully consuming the dispensed water droplet. Mice typically completed &gt;150 trails until sate. Tone response time was the interval between the end of the tone cue and the first subsequent lick. Licking movement epochs were defined based on whether a lick had been detected within 0.25 s (roughly two lick cycles). Epochs of non-licking were classified based on the absence of licking for &gt;0.75 s.</p><p>For experiments in mice expressing the engineered receptor hM4d in MLIs, animals received an intraperitoneal injection of CNO prior to start of the task (45 min; 5 mg/kg; Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK; stock solutions were made by dissolving CNO in DMSO to 50 mM). Control measurements in the absence of CNO were made from the same mice on alternate days (&gt;48 hr between sessions).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>In vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging</title><p>We used 2pLSM to image in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in neurons of the lateral cerebellum. The microscope was purpose built and included resonant scan mirrors (CRS 8K, Cambridge Technologies, Bedford, MA), a low power objective (16X, 0.8 NA water, Olympus, Center Valley, PA), and high-sensitivity PMTs (H10770PA-40, Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ) for both red and green channels producing high-resolution (512 pixels x 512 pixels), high frame rate images (30 frames/s). This rate is faster than the response time of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Imaging was controlled using ScanImage 2015 software (Vidrio Technologies, Ashburn, VA). In the emission pathway, a 700 nm shortpass filter limited stray excitation light from reaching the PMT detectors. A 570 nm dichroic split the emission light into red and green channels. The green channel also included a 525/50 filter. GCaMP6f was excited at 900 nm (Chameleon Vision S, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) with &lt;50 mW of power at the objective except for climbing fibers where ~ 100 mW was required. RCaMP2 was excited at 1070 nm (Fidelity 2, Coherent) with &lt;60 mW of power. The same region of cerebellum was imaged across sessions and generally included most of the same PC dendrites although not all dendrites could be automatically re-identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaffield et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Acute brain slice recording</title><p>Parasagittal slices of the lateral cerebellum containing lobule Crus II were prepared from mature <italic>Kit::Cre</italic> mice. Animals were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine by intraperitoneal injection (100 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and, after opening the chest, were perfused with ice-cold (~4°C) saline through the heart. The cerebellum was then removed by rapid dissection and mounted on an agar block and sectioned in thin slices (200 μm) using a vibraslicer (VT1200S, Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Sectioning was performed in an ice-cold solution containing (in mM) 87 NaCl, 25 NaHO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose, and 75 sucrose that was continuously bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Once cut, slices were immediately transferred to a holding chamber containing (in mM) 128 NaCl, 26.2 NaHO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 11 glucose, maintained at 34°C for 30 min and then at room temperature (~23°C) thereafter. For experiments, acute slices were placed in a recording chamber under a microscope and continuously perfused with an oxygenated saline solution of identical composition to that used for holding after slicing. The concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> was kept low (1.5 mM) to reflect a more physiological-like condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jones and Keep, 1988</xref>) and the solution maintained at a near-body temperature (34–36°C) using an inline heater (TC-344; Warner Instruments). Except where noted, all experiments were performed in the absence of drugs so that both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission were unaffected.</p><p>Neurons in Crus II were visually targeted for recording using IR contrast imaging with an upright video microscope (BX51WI; Olympus) and a QIClick CCD Camera (Q-Imaging, Surrey, BC, Canada). PCs and MLIs were easily distinguished based on their location and morphology. Recording pipettes were pulled from thin-walled borosilicate glass (PG 52–165;World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) and filled with a solution containing (in mM) 124 potassium gluconate, 2 KCl, 9 HEPES, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 NaATP, 3 L-Ascorbic Acid, and 0.5 NaGTP (pH = 7.25). For PC recordings, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator dye Fluo-5F (200 μM; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) as well as the volume indicator Alexa 594 (60 μM; Life Technologies) were also included in the pipette solution. Cell-attached recordings from MLIs were achieved by forming a loose seal with the patch electrode (~400 MΩ). This prevented dialyzing the cell and changing the intracellular concentration of Cl<sup>-</sup> and, hence, the reversal potential for currents generated by <italic>Gt</italic>ACR2.</p><p>We used a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) for electrophysiological recordings. Signals were filtered online at 10 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz with a Digidata 1440 A-D converter (Molecular Devices). For whole-cell recordings, the membrane potential of PCs was maintained −75 mV using constant current injections whereas MLIs were maintained at −70 mV. Current offset was not used during cell-attached recordings of MLIs, allowing these cells to fire spontaneously under their own control, at an unperturbed resting membrane potential. Pipette capacitance was neutralized online and series resistance adjusted using the bridge balance circuitry of the amplifier. Liquid junctional potentials, calculated to be 10 mV, were corrected offline. Climbing fibers were stimulated using bi-polar glass electrodes placed near the axon hillock of the targeted PC. Brief electrical pulses (20 μs; 0.1–1.0 V) were delivered using a stimulation isolation unit (Model DS2A; Digitimer, Ft. Lauderdale, FL). Parallel fibers were also stimulated electrically using an electrode placed in the molecular layer adjacent to the dendritic recording site. The intensity of the stimulus was adjusted to produce PSPs, recorded at the PC soma, of similar amplitude across recordings (0.1–1.0 mV). For conjunctive stimulation experiments, parallel fibers were stimulated in bursts at 100 Hz. Climbing fiber were stimulated 50 ms after the end of parallel fiber tetanus, or at a varying interval where noted. Trials occurred at a relatively low frequency (0.125 Hz). In interleaved trials, either parallel fibers or climbing fibers were stimulated in isolation. This also occurred for trials that included optogenetic actuation of MLIs. Light pulses for optogenetic actuation or inactivation of MLIs activity started 10 ms prior to the beginning of the parallel fiber tetanus and lasted for the duration of the electrical stimulus.</p><p>For 2pLSM imaging in slices, we used a commercial scan head (Ultima; Bruker, Billerica, MA) fitted on top of an upright microscope (BX51-WI, Olympus; Tokyo, Japan). The scan head directed laser light (λ = 810 nm) from a mode-locking Ti:sapphire laser (Chameleon Ultra II; Coherent) through a scan lens and pair of galvanometer mirrors (Cambridge Technologies) onto the back aperture of a high-power objective (60X; 1.0 NA). To image Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in PCs, indicators dyes were allowed to dialyze for &gt;30 min before starting recordings. Inclusion of the red volume dye allowed for identification of dendrites and spines for subsequent Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity measurements. However, fluorescence in the red channel was not collected during neural activity measurements because of the interference of light used for the optogenetic stimuli. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were recorded in PC spines using line scans (500 Hz). The PMT used to collect green Ca<sup>2+</sup>-indicator fluorescence was shuttered during blue-light optogenetic stimuli to prevent damage. Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity was therefore not measured during this period. To facilitate comparison between conditions, a comparable region of the control response was blanked.</p><p>For our slice experiments, AAV1-EF1α-Flex(<italic>loxP</italic>)rev-<italic>Gt</italic>ACR2.eYFP (prepared by ViGene) and AAV5-EF1α-Flex(<italic>loxP</italic>)rev-bReachES-TS-YFP (University of North Carolina) were injected into the lateral cerebellum of <italic>Kit::Cre</italic> mice using a surgical procedure identical to that described above except that the size of the craniotomy was reduced (~0.5 mm diameter). Acute slices were prepared from these mice 7 to 14 days after surgery. <italic>Gt</italic>ACR2 and bReaChES were activated using blue and amber light, respectively, delivered from separate LEDs (M470L3 and M590L3; Thorlabs, Newton, NJ). The emission of the LEDS was combined with a dichroic (T570plxr; Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT) and directed, unfiltered (λ = 461 ± 20 nm and λ = 596 ± 16 nm), into the back epi-port of the microscope. This light was combined into the 2P excitation pathway using a second dichroic (700dcxru; Chroma). LEDs were modulated by separate current controllers (LEDD1B; Thorlabs) using digital commands out of the A-D converter and under computer control from the electrophysiology software (Clampex v10; Molecular Devices).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Post-hoc histology and confocal imaging</title><p>Transgene expression was confirmed by visual inspection of tissue from paraformaldehyde-perfused mice. Following the completion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging sessions, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and the chest cavity opened, exposing the heart. The heart was accessed by a needle and the animal was perfused at 2 ml/min with a 0.1 M phosphate-buffered (PB) solution followed by paraformaldehyde (4% by volume in PB) until the perfusate exiting an opening from the pulmonary artery ran clear. The cerebellum was removed by dissection and sliced into 80 µm sections in cold PB. When necessary, HA immunostaining was used to confirm hM4d expression. Samples were first incubated with anti-HA antibody (#ab9110, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), followed by an Alexa 633 secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). DAPI (D1306, Thermo Fisher Scientific) counterstaining was used to identify cell locations in some cases. Images were collected on a confocal microscope (LSM 780 Axio Imager 2; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using 488 nm excitation and 493–598 nm emission for GCaMP6f, 633 nm excitation and 638–747 nm emission for Alexa 633, 405 nm excitation and 410–507 nm emission for DAPI, and 514 nm excitation and 519–620 nm emission for YFP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Image analysis of in vivo data was performed blind to the experimental condition. Time-series images of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in neurons expressing genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators were aligned using a least-squares algorithm. For dual-color imaging, the translation coordinates from PC images were also used to co-register the corresponding MLI images. Individual PC dendrites or individual climbing fibers were segmented using an independent component analysis algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hyvärinen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaffield et al., 2016</xref>). Individual MLIs or parallel fibers were identified using hand-drawn ROIs from averaged images. Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in both PCs and climbing fibers were identified using an inference algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vogelstein et al., 2010</xref>); events were identified whether or not they occurred during the decay of other events. However, to avoid potential uncertainties associated with GCaMP6f non-linearity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), we performed an initial analysis on well-isolated (non-overlapping) events. For inclusion in this analysis, events must have occurred at least 500 ms from proceeding or following events. This time window allowed for the full decay of climbing fiber-evoked PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (τ is approximately 150 ms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaffield et al., 2016</xref>). The relative prevalence of isolated events was calculated by counting the number of isolated events, along with the number of times two events occurred within 500 ms, but were isolated by 500 ms from any other events, and the number of times three events occurred within 1000 ms, but were isolated by 500 ms from any other events. A subsequent analysis was performed on overlapping events comprising of two distinct events. In this case, consecutive events were selected that occurred within 150–200 ms of each other; all other events not meeting this criteria were rejected. In a final analysis, we also simply measured the peaks of all algorithmically identified Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses.</p><p>For in vivo measurements of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in PCs and climbing fibers, ΔF/F was calculated using a baseline fluorescence period immediately prior to an identified event (~200 ms). For overlapping responses, this baseline period was during the decay of preceding events. For trial-averaged PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity measurements, we calculated ΔF/F for all PC dendrite ROIs using the smallest GCaMP6f-fluorescence values obtained during recordings as the baseline. The average of responses in control was subtracted from that measured in CNO for each mouse before generating an overall average. In bouton measurements from parallel fibers, ΔF/F values were corrected by subtracting the neuropil signal from an area immediately adjacent to each fiber.

Analysis of inter-branch climbing fiber Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in PCs was performed by selecting two equally sized segments (average area = 190 ± 4 µm<sup>2</sup>; centers separated by 98 ± 4 µm) from a single dendrite then comparing the amplitudes for each identified event occurring simultaneously at each location. Similar to that of previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kitamura and Häusser, 2011</xref>), dendritic variability was defined as:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Where A1 and A2 are the peak fluorescence amplitudes for branch 1 and branch 2, respectively.</p><p>For ex vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments, fluorescence changes in PC dendrites were quantified as ΔF/F (average ~10 trials per condition). The peak climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient was determined from an exponential fit of the fluorescence decay immediately following the electrical stimulus.</p><p>All image analysis was performed with Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA) or ImageJ (NIH). AxoGraph (Axograph) was used to analyze electrophysiological data. Additional calculations and plotting was performed with Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and Prism (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jennifer L Raymond as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Martijn Schonewille (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Gaffield and colleagues described an elegant series of experiments investigating the effects of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to the Purkinje cells climbing fiber-evoked calcium signals. Historically, the climbing fibers were thought to elicit a reliable, all-or-none (binary) calcium response in Purkinje cells, which triggered associative LTD in coactive parallel fibers. However, a number of recent in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that the climbing fiber-elicited calcium response is graded, and that variations in the amplitude of the calcium response can modify the probability that associative plasticity is induced. The current manuscript extends this work by identifying inhibition from the molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) as a signal that can regulate the calcium response elicited by the climbing fibers.</p><p>The authors employ a powerful combination of complementary in vivo and in vitro calcium imaging, optogenetic and pharmacogenetic manipulation, and slice physiology. They show that the amplitude of calcium transients during a well-learned behavior (licking), which increases both MLI activity and the rate of these transients (Figure 1), is similar to calcium transients in the absence of movement. Chemogenetic inactivation of MLIs, however, unmasks a widespread, movement-specific increase in transient amplitude (Figure 2, Figure 3). This increase appears to be postsynaptic, as direct imaging of climbing fibers fails to reveal an influence of the ligand on presynaptic calcium preceding or during movement (Figure 4). Optogenetic suppression of MLIs in acute slices enhances parallel fiber (PF) postsynaptic potentials at the Purkinje cell soma and induces a supralinear dendritic calcium response to paired parallel and climbing fiber stimulation. Finally, the authors demonstrate that long trains of PF stimulation can induce a similar supralinear calcium response, but that this interaction is erased by optogenetic activation of MLIs.</p><p>The work is of high potential impact. The results extend our understanding of events that can gate or modulate the climbing fiber's impact on their Purkinje cell targets, which is thought to provide instructive signals that guide the induction of cerebellum-dependent learning. The experiments are well-designed, the claims are clearly explained, and the data support the claims. However, the reviewers agreed that some issues should be addressed by the authors.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Because long trains of PF stimulation can induce a supralinear PF+CF effect on calcium, the authors should rule out the possibility that pharmo- and opto-genetic perturbations drives an increase in PF activity (e.g. by increasing the frequency of some possibly unobserved movement, or via inhibition of Golgi cells, which also have some expression in the c-kit line). The most direct way to achieve this would be to perform calcium imaging in granule cells and check that activity is similar between treatment and sham conditions. It may also be helpful to provide a more thorough analysis of the effects of the MLI manipulations on behavior. Is enhanced calcium still observed with CNO if the analysis is limited to CNO and control trials with the behavior as closely matched as possible (subsample Figure 2C data to control for licking rate)?</p><p>2) More thorough analysis of the data, and more complete presentation of the results are needed throughout the manuscript.</p><p>a) In the analysis of the in vivo calcium events, the authors focus on the unitary calcium responses, and exclude the multipeaked responses from most pf the analyses. The description of how the unitary events were identified is scanty (subsection “Image Analysis”). The authors should provide more information about how they did the analysis and provide an analysis of the robustness of the results to their specific choices for the analysis. What does the distribution of all (single and multipeaked) calcium event amplitudes look like? What is the distribution of single, double, triple peaked events? Does the latter differ during cued licking behavior vs. spontaneous? The example trace in Figure 1C suggests there is surprisingly large variation in the size of unitary events (a ~3-fold difference in the peak with the green check mark vs. the first peak in the multiple event)-this makes me wonder how many of the unitary events selected for analysis are actually composed of two smaller calcium events occurring close together in time. What is the temporal resolution for discriminating one vs. two closely spaced events? A more careful consideration of how the choice of analysis could affect the results and the interpretation of the results is needed.</p><p>b) The authors show in Figure 3C that ~63% of the dendritic area shows enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling after MLI disinhibition. If I understand correctly the figure also indicates that the other ~37% has a substantial decrease of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This should be addressed, also in relation to the chance of random changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (is the 67% statistically significant from random 50%). Similarly, the remark about the 'arbor-wide' influence should be re-worded to more careful terms.</p><p>c) For Figure 5D and Figure 6, it would be very helpful if the evoked PF and CF transients were also shown individually, before the summed transient is shown. Also, please state clearly if the summed response for the suppressed inhibition is based on the PF with or without inhibition.</p><p>d) Figure 6G and associated text suggest that the MLIs exert a graded effect on the climbing fiber-elicited calcium response. Is there truly a graded effect on amplitude, or might it be an effect on the probability of an additive vs. supralinear event of a more uniform amplitude? Additional analysis could distinguish these two equally interesting possibilities.</p><p>e) The point of Figure 1 is that the amplitude of the calcium events is the same during movement or no movement. However, in Figure 2F, this does not seem to be the case for the hM4d animals, even in the absence of CNO. If the calcium sensing is nonlinear, this could potentially influence what is measured with CNO. This possibility should be considered.</p><p>f) There are some places where individual examples are shown, but no group data, for example, Figure 4E.</p><p>g) There are some places where results are presented without statistics. For example, is there is a significant difference between movement vs. no movement and between CNO vs. control in Figure 3FG? Also, the error bars on the CNO-control PC data for simultaneous PC/MLI imaging (Figure 2G, red trace) are very large. Please provide the same statistical analyses for these data as were used for the data in Figure 2F to justify the claim that the difference is positive. Also, please provide the same analysis for the climbing fiber imaging data in Figure 4G, where the difference appears to be negative, but is asserted to not differ from zero.</p><p>h) To support the claim that peak PC ΔF/F does not co-vary with MLI activity (Figure 1G), please plot compute the correlation between the peak amplitude and MLI activity for all dendrites and complex spike event, and display a scatterplot of these values.</p><p>i) A video of mouse behavior and two-color imaging (Figure 1) would be useful.</p><p>j) Figure 5D shows that MLI inactivation induces a supralinear interaction between PF and CF stimulation on dendritic calcium. Is the same true of the somatic membrane potential? Please overlay plots of the PF+CF and PF+CF (sum) for control and light conditions (similarly to Figure 5D) in Figure 5F, and make a similar plot for the ephys data in the long pulse train experiments (Figure 6E).</p><p>k) Was there any correlation between calcium transient amplitude and behavior? For instance, were transients larger on trials with longer or mistimed licking bouts? Similarly, did the correlation between PC calcium and MLI calcium change with any aspect of behavior? Although the authors have addressed some of these questions in previous work, it would be helpful to have this information for the current manipulations and data.</p><p>l) In general, the figure legends and text describing the figures should be edited to be more precise and make it easier for the reader to understand what is in the figure. For example, in Figure 2G and associated text, I am guessing that the &quot;totality of all calcium responses&quot; includes the multipeaked as well as the unitary responses, but after considerable effort, I am still not sure. Another example, it is not clear whether the averaged calcium activity in Figure 1F is from one mouse or all mice. Please carefully review all figure legends to make sure that the reader is provided with sufficient information about what is in each figure panel.</p><p>m) Please provide time units for the event probability plots to allow comparison across figures, and with previously published climbing fiber firing rates. I would expect the probabilities in Figure 1E and Figure 4E to be similar, but they differ by twofold. How does this compare with the typical climbing fiber rate of 1 Hz?</p><p>3) The current results would have more impact if more effectively framed in the context of what is already known about variations in climbing fiber-triggered responses in the Purkinje cells, how the current work extends what is known, the conclusions that can be drawn, and any caveats.</p><p>a) Previous work has associated the calcium transients with plasticity, however, the reviewers thought there was too much emphasis on plasticity (using &quot;instructional Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling&quot; in the Title and last sentence of the Abstract and &quot;circuit modifications&quot; in the first sentence of the Abstract), given that plasticity is not tested in the in vitro or in vivo experiments.</p><p>b) Najafi et al., have reported that climbing fiber-associated calcium responses are enhanced when they occur during a learning task as compared with the spontaneous calcium events, which are presumably due to spontaneous climbing fiber spiking. In contrast, the current results indicate that the calcium responses during the well-learned lick task are the same as the spontaneous calcium events. The authors cite Najafi, but don't directly compare the two results so that the reader can effectively appreciate the new finding that the calcium responses are not always enhanced in the behavioral context. This would better frame the current Results section than the current statement in the Introduction &quot;whether CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in PC dendrites are augmented by preceding PF activity in vivo is unclear&quot; and would explain why the results in Figure 1D are described as &quot;Surprising&quot;.</p><p>c) More discussion of the cued licking task, and the role of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in Purkinje cells during the movement in the lick task is needed. From the example mouse data in Figure 1B, it is difficult to tell how much of the behavioral response and neural activity is learned (a conditioned response) versus an unconditioned response to the water — it looks like the majority of the neural and behavioral response could be unconditioned. Which components of the lick task are cerebellum dependent-acquisition of learning? expression of the condition response? performance of unconditioned licks? Discussion of these issues would help to clarify the potential role of the calicum transients in the behavior.</p><p>d) In Figure 5 and Figure 6, might the lack of supralinear calcium responses result from the use of a suboptimal parallel fiber-climbing fiber pairing interval?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Inhibition gates supralinear Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in Purkinje cell dendrites during practiced movements&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jennifer L Raymond as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Martijn Schonewille (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript provides evidence that the molecular layer interneurons in the cerebellar cortex modulate the climbing fiber-triggered calcium responses in Purkinje cells. Historically, the climbing fibers were thought to elicit a reliable, all-or-none (binary) calcium response in Purkinje cells, which triggered associative LTD in coactive parallel fibers. However, a number of recent in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that the climbing fiber-elicited calcium response is graded, and that variations in the amplitude of the calcium response can modify the probability that associative plasticity is induced. The current manuscript extends this work by identifying inhibition from the molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) as a signal that can regulate the calcium response elicited by the climbing fibers. The authors employ a powerful combination of complementary in vivo and in vitro calcium imaging, optogenetic and pharmacogenetic manipulation, and slice physiology. In response to the previous review, the authors have conducted a number of additional analyses, which increase the rigor and strengthen the conclusions. In addition, they included new data from experiments imaging the parallel fiber axons during their cued licking task. Overall, this study represents a significant advance in understanding how the cerebellum implements learning, in particular, the events governing the induction of associative LTD at the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapse. The reviewers did not think additional experiments were necessary for this to make a valuable contribution, however, they felt that some additional revisions of the text were needed to better acknowledge and discuss some of the limitations of the current study that were raised in the previous review, and which were not fully addressed by the additional analyses and experiments provided in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript provides convergent evidence that inhibition from the molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) can gate supralinear calcium responses to combined parallel fiber and climbing fiber activity. This is likely correct. However, it is also difficult to rule out the possibility that in vivo, the chemogenetic suppression of MLIs could have resulted in changes (increases) in granule cell/parallel activity, which could contribute to the enhanced calcium responses. The authors need to be more forthcoming and explicit in the manuscript about acknowledging this possibility and the limited extent to which their evidence addresses it.</p><p>Their argument that argument that parallel fiber activity is not altered by suppression manipulation of MLI activity hinges on:</p><p>a) new data showing that in the absence of MLI manipulation, calcium imaging-based measurement of parallel fiber activity closely tracks MLI activity (Figure Figure 1—figure supplement 1) and an assertion in their point-by-point response that &quot;unilateral chemogenetic disinhibition of MLIs in Crus II did not affect the population response of MLIs (data not shown). There are some concerns with this argument. First, just because the activity of two populations of neurons is similar under one measurement condition, it does not mean that it will be similar under all conditions, such as experimental manipulation of inhibition. Second, the whole point of the chemogenetic manipulation of MLIs is to suppress their activity, so why does it not affect the population response? Are we missing something? Third, the Kit promoter has some expression in Golgi cells, which directly inhibit the granule cells-this needs to be acknowledged.</p><p>b) Lack of change in the behavior. The additional data provided in Figure 2—figure supplement 3 is helpful, but does not fully address the possibility of other, unmeasured behavior differences (lateral deviation of the tongue, other orofacial movements), which is why the reviewers had asked for sample videos with and without chemogenetic suppression. Also, the lack of behavioral difference does not rule out a difference in the granule cells that does not affect the behavior, but could contribute to calcium transients in the Purkinje cells.</p><p>In the absence of more direct recordings from the granule cells or parallel fibers comparing responses in the presence or absence of the disinhibition manipulation, we would be satisfied with a more thorough acknowledgement and discussion of the above caveats in the manuscript.</p><p>2) Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and 1E show that PF activity is well correlated with licking behavior after the cue. However, it is not very clear in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D. In particular, fluorescence signals begin to increase mostly before licking starts in the B3 bouton. It is therefore important to show PF and MLI activity not only when the cue induces licking but also fails to induce licking as described above. In addition, please indicate in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D when the cue was presented. Otherwise, readers cannot tell which licking bouts are learned behavior.</p><p>3) In the first round of review, one of the reviewers asked more discussion of the cued licking task, for example, which components of the lick task are cerebellum dependent-acquisition of learning. The authors address the comment, but their rebuttal letter has addressed the comment better than the manuscript itself. It is important to let readers know that it is currently unclear (1) the role of climbing fibers in the cued licking task, and (2) which aspects of this learning task are regulated by the cerebellum. These limitations do not diminish the value of this study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36246.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Because long trains of PF stimulation can induce a supralinear PF+CF effect on calcium, the authors should rule out the possibility that pharmo- and opto-genetic perturbations drives an increase in PF activity (e.g. by increasing the frequency of some possibly unobserved movement, or via inhibition of Golgi cells, which also have some expression in the c-kit line). The most direct way to achieve this would be to perform calcium imaging in granule cells and check that activity is similar between treatment and sham conditions. It may also be helpful to provide a more thorough analysis of the effects of the MLI manipulations on behavior. Is enhanced calcium still observed with CNO if the analysis is limited to CNO and control trials with the behavior as closely matched as possible (subsample Figure 2C data to control for licking rate)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have collected a new set of data using GCaMP6f to measure the activity of parallel fiber axons during our cued-licking task. Parallel fibers were robustly activated during the consumption of water and were relatively inactive in the absence of licking (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Parallel fiber activity also closely tracked licking kinematics. Interestingly, the movement-induced activation of MLIs was essentially an exact match of that of the average response of the parallel fibers in the same region. This indicates that MLI activity measurements can be used to infer the overall activity of the granule cell population. Unilateral chemogenetic disinhibition of MLIs in Crus II did not affect the population response of MLIs, measured using our Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging approach. Thus, by inference, disinhibition did not affect the overall level of granule cell activity. This rules out the possibility that enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in PCs was the result of a CNO-induced change in the presynaptic activity level of granule cells.</p><p>Addressing the specific question of parallel fiber signaling onto Purkinje cell dendrites with and without MLI block is not technically feasible in awake behaving animals at this time. We are therefore left with relying on the reduced preparation experiments where we show that shifting the balance between parallel fiber excitation and MLI inhibition of PCs can likewise affect PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity. These points are now emphasized in the revision.</p><p>We apologize for not being forward in our reporting of potential motor changes with chemogenetic suppression of MLI activity. We actually went out of our way to identify conditions that were not conducive to affect behavior as this could complicate the interpretation of our results. We now present our analysis showing the absence of changes in average licking performance following unilateral suppression of MLI activity in the small area of left Crus II under our imaging window (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). We do not think this result contradicts our previous work where we reported a small, but significant reduction in lick rate with MLI activity suppression by hM4d activation (Gaffield et al., 2017). This is because in this prior work, we inhibited MLI activity bilaterally in large swaths of both left and right Crus II, a much more robust perturbation of the MLI population controlling orofacial function. At the reviewers’ request, we examined PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in a subset of mice showing the smallest deviations in lick rate with chemogenetic disinhibition, compared to control. MLI activity suppression continued to enhance climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in PCs from these mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). Moreover, limited behavioral differences indicate that granule cell activity (which tracks behavior) is also unlikely to change with chemogenetic inhibition of MLIs, which further supports our conclusion that the observed alteration of PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling by chemogenetics is not due to activity changes in granule cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) More thorough analysis of the data, and more complete presentation of the results are needed throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made extensive new additions to the manuscript including many new supplemental figures to address each of the reviewers’ concerns.</p><p> <italic>a) In the analysis of the</italic> in vivo <italic>calcium events, the authors focus on the unitary calcium responses, and exclude the multipeaked responses from most pf the analyses. The description of how the unitary events were identified is scanty (subsection “Image Analysis”). The authors should provide more information about how they did the analysis and provide an analysis of the robustness of the results to their specific choices for the analysis. What does the distribution of all (single and multipeaked) calcium event amplitudes look like? What is the distribution of single, double, triple peaked events? Does the latter differ during cued licking behavior vs. spontaneous? The example trace in Figure 1C suggests there is surprisingly large variation in the size of unitary events (a ~3-fold difference in the peak with the green check mark vs. the first peak in the multiple event)-this makes me wonder how many of the unitary events selected for analysis are actually composed of two smaller calcium events occurring close together in time. What is the temporal resolution for discriminating one vs. two closely spaced events? A more careful consideration of how the choice of analysis could affect the results and the interpretation of the results is needed.</italic></p><p>We apologize for the inadequacy of our description of unitary event selection for analysis of PC dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Specifically, we used a previously published inference algorithm (Vogelstein et al., 2010) to identify all climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in PCs, whether or not they occurred during the decay of preceding events. The reviewers refer to these overlapping events as “multi-peaked”. We are hesitant to use this terminology as it seems to imply some sort of physiological relevance rather than simply reflecting that climbing fiber-evoked events can occur in succession and the decay time of GCaMP6f is relatively slow (τ is approx. 150 ms for PCs [Gaffield et al., 2016]). We rejected overlapping dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> events from our initial analysis because of possible uncertainties of GCaMP6f nonlinearity. Therefore, our criteria for inclusion was that an event occurred at least 500 ms from proceeding or following events, a window that allows for GCaMP6f fluorescence to decay back to baseline levels (as shown in Figure 1D). We have now included a better description of our selection criteria and rationale in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>In response to the reviewers urging, we now report the distribution of single vs. overlapping events. Isolated, single events comprise the majority of the response population; this makes sense because the average Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rate in PCs is low, about 1.5 Hz. We found that these distributions don’t change during motor behavior (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><p>A major finding of our report is that with chemogenetic suppression of MLI activity, Ca<sup>2+</sup> event amplitudes increased during movement. This is a robust result. New analysis shows that this holds true not only for discrete single events, but also for all other events including overlapping responses (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Regarding the discrimination of overlapping Ca<sup>2+</sup> events, our imaging rate is 30 Hz (~33 ms); this defines a theoretical temporal resolution by which we could distinguish two closely spaced dendritic events. That said, we don’t believe that unresolved, closely-spaced responses appearing as single events accounted for the difference in response amplitude with chemogenetic disinhibition. If so, this would have been reflected in the presynaptic activity of climbing fibers. Because Ca<sup>2+</sup> event amplitudes (and frequency) did not change in climbing fibers with molecular layer disinhibition, this argues strongly against this possibility. We now state this in the text.</p><p>Like the reviewers, we are fascinated by the variability in the amplitudes of PC dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> events. Identifying the mechanistic underpinnings of this variability is a major goal of ours. That similar variability is apparent in the amplitudes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in climbing fibers indicates the PC dendrites are simply integrating the level of presynaptic activity from these inputs. We hypothesize that MLI-mediated gating of dendritic nonlinearities allow for the faithful conversion of presynaptic climbing fiber activity into postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in PCs. However, this investigation is beyond the scope of the current report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The authors show in Figure 3C that ~63% of the dendritic area shows enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling after MLI disinhibition. If I understand correctly the figure also indicates that the other ~37% has a substantial decrease of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This should be addressed, also in relation to the chance of random changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (is the 67% statistically significant from random 50%). Similarly, the remark about the 'arbor-wide' influence should be re-worded to more careful terms.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we have changed our analysis approach and now include use of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to diagnose the probability of disinhibition-induced shifts in Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity across all pixels of identified PC dendrites (i.e., area under the curve). This analysis indicates a widespread effect (Figure 3C). In addition, we have re-worded the Results section, taking caution about the use of the phrase ‘arbor-wide influence’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) For Figure 5D and Figure 6, it would be very helpful if the evoked PF and CF transients were also shown individually, before the summed transient is shown. Also, please state clearly if the summed response for the suppressed inhibition is based on the PF with or without inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show both the individual, parallel fiber- and climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in Figure 5D (the parallel fiber response is always quite small or negligible for all recordings). This should help readers understand our approach for quantifying supralinearity in dendritic PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling more easily. The same method applied for dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity measurements in Figure 6. We now state, in the accompanying legend of Figure 5, that the summed response for the suppressed condition is based on a PF stimulus without feed-forward inhibition (MLI activity during the parallel fiber tetanus was eliminated by <italic>Gt</italic>ACR2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Figure 6G and associated text suggest that the MLIs exert a graded effect on the climbing fiber-elicited calcium response. Is there truly a graded effect on amplitude, or might it be an effect on the probability of an additive vs. supralinear event of a more uniform amplitude? Additional analysis could distinguish these two equally interesting possibilities.</p></disp-quote><p>Single-trial analysis of climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients could distinguish these possibilities. However, the feasibility of such analysis has not been established for PCs, at least to our knowledge. This is because single trial analysis is made difficult due of the low signal-to-noise level of climbing fiber-evoked responses. We could change our recording parameters in an attempt to help improve the quality of evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (e.g., increasing the concentration of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> or the number of conjunctive climbing fiber stimuli, etc.). This would be very laborious and time consuming. In the end, parsing which mechanism is responsible for the observed effect would not change the overall interpretation of our results as both possibilities are interesting and relevant. Therefore, we have removed the term “graded” from the manuscript in favor of simply stating that the effect of parallel fiber excitation on climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in PCs was dependent on the level of MLI activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) The point of Figure 1 is that the amplitude of the calcium events is the same during movement or no movement. However, in Figure 2F, this does not seem to be the case for the hM4d animals, even in the absence of CNO. If the calcium sensing is nonlinear, this could potentially influence what is measured with CNO. This possibility should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers point to a trend towards a larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> response with movement, compared to events in the absence of movement, in hM4D-expressing mice. However this difference is not significant. We now state this in legend of Figure 2. The major concern with uncertainties regarding GCaMP6f nonlinearity is whether there is a faithful reporting of the relative change in amplitudes (including the absence of change due to saturation). This is compounded for responses that occur in the decay of others because Ca<sup>2+</sup> unbinding isn’t yet complete. This is a major reason why we avoided including such events in our initial analysis (we now include such events in a second analysis at the reviewers’ request). Heeding this concern, we were also hesitant about making significant conclusions based on how much change we observed in the disinhibited condition. Thus, we don’t believe that enhancement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling by GCaMP6f can be explained by a nonlinearity, although the absence of effect may warrant caution. In response to the reviewers, we now state in the text that GCaMP6f is known to be nonlinear but, based on previous reports, is sensitive enough to report small changes in climbing fiber-evoked PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling to different behavioral stimuli. This point is quite moot later in the manuscript when we show that enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling can be uncovered with chemogenetic-induced, molecular layer disinhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) There are some places where individual examples are shown, but no group data, for example, Figure 4E.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed Figure 4E to include group data; we can find no other instances where group data are not reported either in the text or in a separate Figure panel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g) There are some places where results are presented without statistics. For example, is there is a significant difference between movement vs. no movement and between CNO vs. control in Figure 3FG? Also, the error bars on the CNO-control PC data for simultaneous PC/MLI imaging (Figure 2G, red trace) are very large. Please provide the same statistical analyses for these data as were used for the data in Figure 2F to justify the claim that the difference is positive. Also, please provide the same analysis for the climbing fiber imaging data in Figure 4G, where the difference appears to be negative, but is asserted to not differ from zero.</p></disp-quote><p>The statistical comparisons for the data shown in Figure 3F and 3G are presented in Figure 3H (in this comparison, mean variability of PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity was significantly different following chemogenetic suppression of MLIs). We apologize for not pointing out this figure panel in our original submission. This has now been corrected.</p><p>For activity measurements in climbing fibers, we compared the peak amplitudes of averaged Ca<sup>2+</sup> events collected in control and during disinhibition of the molecular layer (Figure 4G). The difference trace, like those shown in Figure 2C-2E, are for the reader’s convenience. The statistical test for this comparison is reported in the text; it was non-significant (P = 0.66; Student’s t-test).</p><p>Regarding our results examining trial-averaged PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity during cued licking, we show the subtracted difference between responses measured in control and with molecular layer disinhibition (Figure 2G, top panel, red trace). We chose to present the subtracted difference because it facilitated comparison to the activity plot of MLIs (i.e., the change in PC activity with disinhibition closely corresponded to the time period when MLIs were normally activated by the behavior). This was also for the reader’s convenience but, as requested, we performed a statistical analysis of this dataset (inset of Figure 2G). Based on the reviewers’ comments, we believe presenting the data as we did may have caused confusion. Therefore, we now show responses of trial-average PC activity in the two conditions used to generate the difference plot (control and with chemogenetic MLI activity suppression) as well as an accompanying statistical analysis of these data (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>h) To support the claim that peak PC ΔF/F does not co-vary with MLI activity (Figure 1G), please plot compute the correlation between the peak amplitude and MLI activity for all dendrites and complex spike event, and display a scatterplot of these values.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in our analysis of mean activity (Figure 1G), there is no relationship between the amplitude of climbing fiber-evoked dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in PCs and the corresponding level of MLI activation.

Is the same true of the somatic membrane potential? Please overlay plots of the PF+CF and PF+CF (sum) for control and light conditions (similarly to Figure 5D) in Figure 5F, and make a similar plot for the ephys data in the long pulse train experiments (Figure 6E).</p></disp-quote><p>Hyperpolarization of the membrane potential by somatic current injection diminishes climbing fiber-evoked responses in PC dendrites including supralinear Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (Wang et al., 2000, Kitamura et al., 2011, and Otsu et al., 2014). This is likely mediated through the passive spread of voltage into the dendritic compartment, preventing parallel fiber-mediated inactivation of Kv4 currents (Otsu et al., 2014). It follows then that GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated hyperpolarization, elicited by MLI activity, is sufficient to prevent the supralinear interaction of parallel fibers and climbing fibers in PC dendrites, as observed in our experiments. At the reviewers’ request, traces of complex spikes with and without preceding parallel fiber stimulation are shown superimposed in Figure 5F for both control and the responses with optogenetic suppression of MLIs. For the data presented in Figure 6, these are included as a supplement additional figure (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>k) Was there any correlation between calcium transient amplitude and behavior?

This is now reported in the manuscript (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). A more in depth examination of deviant licking, perhaps reflecting motor errors that lead to learning, was not pursued. Regarding motor errors and climbing fiber-evoked signals, it is certainly a future interest of ours to understand the behavioral conditions conducive to producing PC supralinear Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. To address this point carefully, will require more exacting control of the movement task as well as additional tools to measure and manipulate neural activity in the granule cell and molecular layers. Thus, this is beyond the scope of the current study. As the reviewers point out, we have previously reported that the rate of climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in PC dendrites increases at the onset of licking while MLI activity increases and decreases with changes in licking rate during water consumption. This is now discussed in greater detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>l) In general, the figure legends and text describing the figures should be edited to be more precise and make it easier for the reader to understand what is in the figure. For example, in Figure 2G and associated text, I am guessing that the &quot;totality of all calcium responses&quot; includes the multipeaked as well as the unitary responses, but after considerable effort, I am still not sure. Another example, it is not clear whether the averaged calcium activity in Figure 1F is from one mouse or all mice. Please carefully review all figure legends to make sure that the reader is provided with sufficient information about what is in each figure panel.</p></disp-quote><p>The “totality of all calcium responses” was meant to indicate that we simply averaged all Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity (including overlapping events spaced closely in time) in all identified PCs across all trials. We have attempted to improve the clarity of our language regarding this dataset and have added a new figure to illustrate this result more directly (Figure 2— figure supplement 2). We now report numbers for Figure 1F in the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>m) Please provide time units for the event probability plots to allow comparison across figures, and with previously published climbing fiber firing rates. I would expect the probabilities in Figure 1E and Figure 4E to be similar, but they differ by twofold. How does this compare with the typical climbing fiber rate of 1 Hz?</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the plots to include time units (rate/frequency). We show that the average rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events is the same for both climbing fibers and PCs. The increase in peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rates at the initiation of licking is also not significant between climbing fibers and PCs (there is large amount of variability in the climbing fiber response); we don’t report this because our preference is to more carefully compare climbing fibers and PCs using simultaneous dual-color imaging of pre- and post-synaptic activity in the same mouse which we hope to publish in the near future. The rates of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events detected in PCs in our experiments closely matches that of previously published values. This is now stated in the text with accompanying references. To our knowledge, we are unaware of anyone else who has measured activity rates directly from climbing fibers, so we are proud to say that this is a first!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The current results would have more impact if more effectively framed in the context of what is already known about variations in climbing fiber-triggered responses in the Purkinje cells, how the current work extends what is known, the conclusions that can be drawn, and any caveats.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting areas of our manuscript where we could include clarification to increase the impact of our work.</p><p> <italic>a) Previous work has associated the calcium transients with plasticity, however, the reviewers thought there was too much emphasis on plasticity (using &quot;instructional Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling&quot; in the Title and last sentence of the Abstract and &quot;circuit modifications&quot; in the first sentence of the Abstract), given that plasticity is not tested in the</italic> in vitro <italic>or</italic> in vivo <italic>experiments.</italic></p><p>As requested, we have removed most of these phrases from the Title and Abstract. However, the first sentence of the Abstract simply describes what the cerebellum does and emphasizes the motivation for understanding dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in PCs. Similarly in the Introduction, our use of terms like “circuit alterations” and “plasticity” is necessary to put our experiments in context. Therefore we kept these words in the first two paragraphs while removing them from the third as this was merely speculative.</p><p> <italic>b) Najafi et al. have reported that climbing fiber-associated calcium responses are enhanced when they occur during a learning task as compared with the spontaneous calcium events, which are presumably due to spontaneous climbing fiber spiking. In contrast, the current results indicate that the calcium responses during the well-learned lick task are the same as the spontaneous calcium events. The authors cite Najafi, but don't directly compare the two results so that the reader can effectively appreciate the new finding that the calcium responses are not always enhanced in the behavioral context. This would better frame the current Results section than the current statement in the Introduction &quot;whether CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in PC dendrites are augmented by preceding PF activity</italic> in vivo <italic>is unclear&quot; and would explain why the results in Figure 1D are described as &quot;Surprising&quot;.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. We now emphasize the novelty of our findings regarding that lack of behavior-related augmentation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in PCs. A detailed comparison of the work by Najafi et al., contrasting their findings to ours, is also provided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) More discussion of the cued licking task, and the role of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in Purkinje cells during the movement in the lick task is needed. From the example mouse data in Figure 1B, it is difficult to tell how much of the behavioral response and neural activity is learned (a conditioned response) versus an unconditioned response to the water — it looks like the majority of the neural and behavioral response could be unconditioned. Which components of the lick task are cerebellum dependent-acquisition of learning? expression of the condition response? performance of unconditioned licks? Discussion of these issues would help to clarify the potential role of the calicum transients in the behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added to the Discussion section to address some of these points. In summary though, we have not yet identified which aspects of lick-related behavioral refinement are due to this region of the cerebellum nor do we understand the importance of the climbing fiber-evoked responses in PCs, elicited at licking onset, to task performance. It is enticing to speculate on the potential role of these PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in guiding learning. But we conjecture that learning is not apt to be occurring during this well-practiced motor behavior. That said, climbing fiber activity has been shown to be important for motor memory retention (Medina et al., 2002). It may be that the climbing fiber-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that we studied are import for maintenance of some earlier aspect of behavioral adaptation during task training (e.g., timing of lick responses to the cue). Certainly, there is an abundant literature indicating that complex spikes evoked by climbing fibers are important for online motor control. As discussed, MLI-mediated suppression of nonlinear Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling could allow climbing fibers to multitask. Supporting both online motor control through the influence of complex spike bursts at the PC soma separate from the acquisition of plasticity in the dendrite.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) In Figure 5 and Figure 6, might the lack of supralinear calcium responses result from the use of a suboptimal parallel fiber-climbing fiber pairing interval?</p></disp-quote><p>We tried different pairing intervals. However, supralinear Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were not apparent with feed-forward inhibition intact. These new data are now included in the manuscript (Figure—figure supplement 2).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Essential revisions:</p></disp-quote><p><italic>1) The manuscript provides convergent evidence that inhibition from the molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) can gate supralinear calcium responses to combined parallel fiber and climbing fiber activity. This is likely correct. However, it is also difficult to rule out the possibility that</italic> in vivo<italic>, the chemogenetic suppression of MLIs could have resulted in changes (increases) in granule cell/parallel activity, which could contribute to the enhanced calcium responses. The authors need to be more forthcoming and explicit in the manuscript about acknowledging this possibility and the limited extent to which their evidence addresses it.</italic></p><p>In the revised manuscript, we now attempt to make these points more explicit and state the limitations of our approach/conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Their argument that argument that parallel fiber activity is not altered by suppression manipulation of MLI activity hinges on:</p><p>a) new data showing that in the absence of MLI manipulation, calcium imaging-based measurement of parallel fiber activity closely tracks MLI activity (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) and an assertion in their point-by-point response that &quot;unilateral chemogenetic disinhibition of MLIs in Crus II did not affect the population response of MLIs (data not shown). There are some concerns with this argument. First, just because the activity of two populations of neurons is similar under one measurement condition, it does not mean that it will be similar under all conditions, such as experimental manipulation of inhibition. Second, the whole point of the chemogenetic manipulation of MLIs is to suppress their activity, so why does it not affect the population response? Are we missing something? Third, the Kit promoter has some expression in Golgi cells, which directly inhibit the granule cells-this needs to be acknowledged.</p></disp-quote><p>We now state/discuss these caveats. The chemogenetic inhibitor hM4d is thought to work by a presynaptic action (now cited in the discussion, Stachniak et al., 2014). This would block release of GABA from MLIs, but not necessarily affect the calcium activity driven in large part by parallel fiber input. The revision includes specific mention of possible Golgi cell expression of hM4d in our <italic>Kit::Cre</italic> driver line.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Lack of change in the behavior. The additional data provided in Figure 2—figure supplement 3 is helpful, but does not fully address the possibility of other, unmeasured behavior differences (lateral deviation of the tongue, other orofacial movements), which is why the reviewers had asked for sample videos with and without chemogenetic suppression. Also, the lack of behavioral difference does not rule out a difference in the granule cells that does not affect the behavior, but could contribute to calcium transients in the Purkinje cells.</p><p>In the absence of more direct recordings from the granule cells or parallel fibers comparing responses in the presence or absence of the disinhibition manipulation, we would be satisfied with a more thorough acknowledgement and discussion of the above caveats in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We now point this out in the Results section. Specifically we state that we cannot rule out behavioral alterations such as those described by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and 1E show that PF activity is well-correlated with licking behavior after the cue. However, it is not very clear in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D. In particular, fluorescence signals begin to increase mostly before licking starts in the B3 bouton. It is therefore important to show PF and MLI activity not only when the cue induces licking but also fails to induce licking as described above. In addition, please indicate in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D when the cue was presented. Otherwise, readers cannot tell which licking bouts are learned behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>The data for PF activity have been added to Figure 1—figure supplement 1. It is essentially a flat line. The result for MLIs is the same, but has been excluded from the plot for clarity. This is stated in the figure legend. The timing of the sound cue is now shown in panel D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the first round of review, one of the reviewers asked more discussion of the cued licking task, for example, which components of the lick task are cerebellum dependent-acquisition of learning. The authors address the comment, but their rebuttal letter has addressed the comment better than the manuscript itself. It is important to let readers know that it is currently unclear (1) the role of climbing fibers in the cued licking task, and (2) which aspects of this learning task are regulated by the cerebellum. These limitations do not diminish the value of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>Provided that the reviewers found our response in the rebuttal informative, we simply moved these sentences into the Discussion section of the revision.</p></body></sub-article></article>
