We recently identified two groups of immunoglobulin superfamily proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Dprs and DIPs, as strong candidates for synapse targeting functions. Here, we uncover the molecular basis of specificity in Dpr–DIP mediated cellular adhesions and neuronal connectivity. First, we present five crystal structures of Dpr–DIP and DIP–DIP complexes, highlighting the evolutionary and structural origins of diversification in Dpr and DIP proteins and their interactions. We further show that structures can be used to rationally engineer receptors with novel specificities or modified affinities, which can be used to study specific circuits that require Dpr–DIP interactions to help establish connectivity. We investigate one pair, engineered Dpr10 and DIP-α, for function in the neuromuscular circuit in flies, and reveal roles for homophilic and heterophilic binding in wiring.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell surface receptors</kwd><kwd>immunoglobulin superfamily</kwd><kwd>synapse specificity</kwd><kwd>neuromuscular system</kwd><kwd>crystal structure</kwd><kwd>protein engineering</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS097161</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Özkan</surname><given-names>Engin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01 NS102342</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carrillo</surname><given-names>Robert A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001207</institution-id><institution>Esther A. and Joseph Klingenstein Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Özkan</surname><given-names>Engin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

Modified local or global connectivity is observed in numerous neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calhoun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Supekar et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, genes that govern wiring processes are commonly associated with such diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mitchell, 2011</xref>). However, establishment of the proper connectivity is not a trivial process: There appears to be no correlation between how widely two neurons contact each other and how often they would participate in a synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kasthuri et al., 2015</xref>), and the large numbers of neuronal cell types in dense neuropils present a significant challenge for how a genetically encoded program can establish the specific connectivity patterns.</p><p>In stereotyped neuronal networks, synaptic connectivity is believed to be dictated by cell surface proteins and secreted molecules, which can (1) assign unique identities to neurons, and (2) mediate axon guidance and synaptic targeting functions through specific interactions with their cognate ligands and receptors. This paradigm of <italic>chemoaffinity</italic>, first elaborated by Roger Sperry, has been supported by the discovery of a number of molecules that participate in wiring-related functions, especially in axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sanes and Zipursky, 2010</xref>). Many of these chemoaffinity molecules function as neuronal adhesion molecules, and are conserved across animal taxa from nematodes to mammals. Nevertheless, discovery of synapse-targeting adhesion molecules, proteins that determine which pairs of neurons will create synapses, has been limited.</p><p>We have recently identified interactions between two groups of <italic>Drosophila</italic> IgSF (immunoglobulin superfamily) cell adhesion molecules with properties closely matching a neuronal chemoaffinity function: 21 Dpr proteins, named after the founding member Defective proboscis extension response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakamura et al., 2002</xref>), selectively bind nine proteins, now called the Dpr-interacting proteins, or DIPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Özkan et al., 2013</xref>). Dprs and DIPs are expressed across the nervous system. In agreement with the paradigm that they can serve as ‘identity tags’ on neurons, different combinations of Dprs and DIPs are known to be expressed on different neuronal classes in the optic lobe, giving neuronal surfaces unique ‘identity codes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). A similar expression pattern has been observed in the ventral nerve cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Özkan et al., 2013</xref>) and the olfactory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barish et al., 2018</xref>). Most importantly, in the knockouts of the interacting pair Dpr11 and DIP-γ, synapse targeting defects have been observed in the optic lobe for synapses formed between Dpr11 and DIP-γ-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, Dprs and DIPs are strong candidates for a synapse specification or targeting function. In addition, they have been shown to be necessary for neuronal survival in the optic lobe, and synapse maturation of neuromuscular junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>), both important aspects of establishing functional neural circuits.</p><p>To mediate a wiring specificity function, Dprs and DIPs cannot promiscuously interact with all possible binding partners. Accordingly, out of 189 possible Dpr–DIP interaction pairs, only 36 Dpr–DIP interactions could be demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>). The mechanisms by which molecular recognition, and therefore cellular connectivity, is established between cognate Dpr–DIP pairs is not clear: Our crystal structure of the first Dpr–DIP complex, Dpr6 bound to DIP-α, showed a role for shape complementarity, but no clear determinants of specificity were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>). Comparative structural studies are necessary for revealing how similar sets of Dpr and DIP molecular interfaces can be used to create a multitude of productive protein complexes, while excluding others.</p><p>In this study, we undertook a structural, biophysical and biological characterization of Dpr and DIP adhesive complexes to explain the molecular basis of Dpr–DIP specificity and function. We present several crystal structures, including the complexes of three Dprs for which a neural phenotype has been demonstrated: Dpr11 with DIP-γ, Dpr1 with DIP-η and Dpr10 with DIP-α. We compare the interaction interfaces of heterophilic and homophilic complexes with respect to differences that lead to specificity as well as interaction energetics. Furthermore, we investigate structure-based rational design and strategies for switching affinities between Dprs and DIPs. Specifically, we demonstrate that structure-based mutagenesis of selected Dpr–DIP pairs can be used to study specific wiring defects and are useful tools for understanding circuit wiring in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> nervous system. With these tools, we establish that homo- and heterodimeric interactions of DIP-α are both required for proper wiring between a motor neuron and a postsynaptic muscle target. Overall, the work presented here provides a biochemical and structural framework for investigating protein families that may function as molecular specificity molecules in synaptic partner matching.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sequence relationships of Dpr and DIP subclasses explain the Dpr–DIP interactome</title><p>All 21 Dprs and nine DIPs are predicted to contain two and three immunoglobulin (IG) domains, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Dpr and DIP sequences can be easily identified across all major arthropod groups; however, there is little to no sequence conservation outside the predicted immunoglobulin domains. Despite the lack of conservation, most Dprs and DIPs contain signal sequences at their N termini, and hydrophobic patches, likely to be transmembrane helices or GPI linkage sites, at or close to their C termini. Therefore, we predict Dprs and DIPs to be cell surface glycoproteins. Our previous work identified the first IG domains, termed IG1, as the domains mediating the Dpr–DIP interaction by the formation of a pseudo-symmetric IG1-IG1 heterocomplex using the <italic>GFCC’C’</italic> face of the immunoglobulin fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41028.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dprs and DIPs can be classified into five classes based on sequence relationships and their interactions.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cellular topologies and domain compositions of Dprs and DIPs.

The closely related DIPs-η and -θ, 71% identical in their IG1 domains, commonly interact with Dprs 1, 2 and 3, which are 65% identical in IG1. Based on phylogeny, Dprs and DIPs can both be classified into five subclasses, and each Dpr subclass can be assigned to a DIP subclass as cognates. 31 out of 36 interactions reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrillo et al. (2015)</xref> are between the cognate Dpr and DIP subclasses. Therefore, the evolutionary histories of the Dprs and DIPs greatly explain the Dpr–DIP interaction network; however, a molecular and structural basis for specificity of Dpr–DIP interactions has remained elusive.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Shared and divergent features in the structures of Dpr–DIP heterocomplexes</title><p>Our first structure, Dpr6 IG1 bound to DIP-α IG1 +2, showed highly complementary interaction surfaces (shape complementary value, <italic>sc</italic> = 0.74), but included one hydrogen bond pair, two marginal hydrogen bonds (at 3.5 Å donor-to-acceptor distance) and no salt bridges between Dpr and DIP side chains, leaving shape complementarity as the major strategy for explaining Dpr6–DIP-α specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Özkan et al., 2013</xref>). Since there is significant sequence diversity for residues at the Dpr–DIP interface, it was not clear if this explanation would hold for the 35 remaining Dpr–DIP pairs.</p><p>For a comparative analysis of Dpr–DIP complexes, we set out to determine structures of complexes of Dprs and DIPs from branches distant to Dpr6 and DIP-α. We chose complexes of Dpr1 and Dpr11, as they are reported to have neuronal phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakamura et al., 2002</xref>), and therefore these complex structures can be directly used to investigate the relationship between Dpr–DIP interactions and the observed phenotypes. We crystallized and solved the structures of Dpr1 IG1 with DIP-η IG1, and Dpr11 IG1 with DIP-γ IG1 +2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Overall, the three IG1-IG1 heterodimers, including the Dpr6–DIP-α pair, can be confidently overlaid: the average root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of all IG1 Cα atoms within the three complex structures is 0.78 Å (±0.14). All three complex interfaces are comprised of the same set of residues belonging to the <italic>GFCC’C’</italic> face of the IG domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Interestingly, while the pairwise sequence identities among the three Dpr–DIP pairs are comparable (49% to 56%), the Dpr11–DIP-γ structure is significantly different than the other two. When the interface residues at the Dpr subunits are superimposed, the three DIP subunits are slightly displaced, with DIP-γ (dark gray in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) more distant from the other DIPs (~1.2 Å at the interface and up to 3 Å at the back face of the IG domain, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref> for details of the displacement at the interface). Hence, different Dpr–DIP complexes can be established not only through shape complementarity between Dpr and DIP surfaces, but also by small but significant movements of the Dpr and DIP monomers with respect to each other, a mechanism not commonly recognized for related interaction pairs.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41028.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Structural comparison of three heterodimeric Dpr–DIP complexes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Dpr1–DIP-η, Dpr6–DIP-α, and Dpr11–DIP-γ structures overlaid by aligning Dpr IG1 domains.

This has allowed us to compare three structures containing DIP IG1 and IG2 domains and the relative orientations of these IG domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). In all structures, the two IG domains are in an extended conformation. This is unlike many multi-IG domain cell adhesion molecules known to adapt horseshoe-like structures, which require minimally four-amino acid linkers for the U turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freigang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sawaya et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Su et al., 1998</xref>), but is similar to cadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shapiro and Weis, 2009</xref>) and certain classes of immunoglobulin superfamily receptors, such as the Synaptogenesis (SYG) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Özkan et al., 2014</xref>). The extended conformation is due to lack of linker sequences between the two IG domains in DIPs, which also holds true at the predicted DIP IG2-IG3 and the Dpr IG1-IG2 boundaries. However, despite the lack of sizeable linker sequences, the DIP IG1-IG2 domain boundary is flexible, allowing for movement of the DIP IG2 with respect to IG1. This is a result of the lack of stabilizing influences such as calcium ions found in cadherin domain boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shapiro and Weis, 2009</xref>) or hydrogen bonds between the domains observed in SYG-1 and SYG-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Özkan et al., 2014</xref>). In the cases of cadherins and SYGs, rigidity of ectodomains was shown to be necessary for function and signaling. Lack of rigidity in Dprs and DIPs might indicate that they may not serve as signaling receptors directly and may not relay force or connect to cytoskeleton. This is corroborated by the fact that most Dprs and DIPs do not appear to have intracellular regions, supporting a model where Dprs and DIPs function as adhesion and specificity receptors on neuronal surfaces, but rely on co-receptors to relay signal intracellularly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Molecular details of Dpr–DIP complex interfaces driving specificity</title><p>We next compared the Dpr–DIP interaction surfaces of the three heterocomplexes of Dpr1, 6 and 11, which belong to different subclasses and should therefore present largest differences among heterocomplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The centers of the interfaces are highly hydrophobic and conserved in sequence (marked in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> with *, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> (yellow side chains)), and likely provide significant energetic contributions to binding while not contributing to Dpr–DIP specificity. Yet, we also observed differences at these conserved positions at the structural level via rotameric changes and by rigid-body movements of DIPs with respect to Dprs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c,d</xref>), which allow for multiple complexes between Dprs and DIPs to form utilizing the same positions as conserved contact sites.</p><p>Outside the hydrophobic core, the interface residues are more polar, and significant differences in sequence and structure are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref> (cyan side chains)). To visualize how specificity is established, we focused on residue positions with stark differences among the three Dprs and DIPs in the periphery of the interface. Surprisingly, these sequence differences and their structural consequences, in several cases, cannot be explained by simple substitution of electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions. For example, Val164 in Dpr6 is a lysine in Dpr1 and Dpr11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d<sub>1</sub></xref>). However, this Val to Lys substitution is not accompanied by the presence of hydrophobic and acidic residues in DIPs directly interacting with this position. Instead, the presence of two Cγ atoms in Val164 results in crowding and an Ala82 in DIP-α, which is otherwise a valine in Dpr1 and Dpr11. Remarkably, the lysine residues replacing Val164 in Dpr1 and 11 do not form any salt bridges or hydrogen bonds to side chains in DIP-η and -γ, but serve in van der Waals interactions with DIPs.</p><p>A second highly variable position, Leu154 in Dpr11 (Lys in Dpr1 and His in Dpr6) also fails to explain specificity via simple electrostatic or hydrophobic matching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d<sub>2</sub></xref>): The interfacing residue in the three DIPs is a glutamine or lysine (Gln78 of DIP-γ), which is pushed away by the hydrophobic Leu154 of Dpr1, but not in complexes with Dpr6 or 11. This movement of Gln78 in DIP-γ is then accommodated by a glycine in Dpr11 position 157, which is otherwise a bulkier and hydrophobic Leu and Ile in Dpr1 and 6. Therefore, the Dpr11–DIP-γ crystal structure enables us to see that Leu154 and Gly157 in Dpr11 are structurally linked and are needed for DIP-γ binding. Interestingly, the position equivalent to Gly157 of Dpr11 (and Dpr15) in the two other DIP-γ binders, Dprs 16 and 17, are larger but <italic>polar</italic> amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d<sub>2</sub></xref>), which can still be accommodated at the site as hydrogen bond participants with Q78 in DIP-γ.</p><p>We further looked to understand specificity via co-variation of Dpr and DIP residues in interacting pairs. We hypothesized that if there are sites in Dprs and DIPs that co-evolve, these could correspond to specificity determinants. For an analysis of sequence co-variation, we created artificial sequences where each sequence contained the IG1 from a Dpr, followed by the IG1 from a cognate DIP, resulting in 36 sequences. Covariation analysis by available tools is hindered due to the requirement for larger numbers of sequences. However, one method, the statistical coupling analysis (SCA) version 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lockless and Ranganathan, 1999</xref>), identified one pair of amino acids, Dpr His94 (Dpr1) and DIP Met132 (DIP-η) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). These two residues directly contact each other and cap the hydrophobic interior of the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). In DIP-ε and -ζ, the methionine is replaced by an alanine, and ε-/ζ- binders Dprs 14, 18, 19 and 20 have non-histidine amino acids in the statistically coupled Dpr position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). It would be of future interest to determine the structures of DIP-ε and -ζ complexes to reveal the nature of the interaction at these positions. Overall, it appears that Dpr–DIP specificity is encoded not only by relationships between pairs of Dpr and DIP residues (e.g., K144 in Dpr1 with T83 in DIP-η, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d<sub>1</sub></xref>), but also through coupling of multiple residues, and through shape complementarity, where rotameric changes help create complementary surfaces.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Energetics of the Dpr–DIP complex interface</title><p>While we could demonstrate and explain structural and amino acid differences between the three Dpr–DIP complexes through crystallography, static structures can rarely elucidate energetics of binding.

For the Dpr1–DIP-η and Dpr6–DIP-α complexes, His-to-Ala mutation unexpectedly <italic>increased</italic> affinity despite removing a hydrogen bond and significant packing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–f</xref>). However, in Dpr11–DIP-γ, for which our structure unexpectedly shows no hydrogen bond, the His-to-Ala mutation abolished binding by more than five-fold. On the DIP side, the Gln-to-Ala mutation universally decreased or abolished affinity. These results indicate that even relatively conserved side chain-to-side chain hydrogen bonds can be dispensable for binding, and our ability to predict binding energetics based on static structures is limited. Interestingly, the His94 (Dpr1) residue is one of the statistically coupled residues mentioned above.</p><p>For hydrophobic side chains at the core of the interface, single-site alanine mutations consistently resulted in loss of affinity, and sometimes almost completely abolished binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–f</xref>). We were not able to observe a rank order, or if a certain position is energetically more important across multiple complexes, that is a conserved hotspot. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a–b</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that while the energetics of the interface shows some variation among the complexes, the hydrophobic conserved core of the interface provides much of the energy of binding, and the periphery is likely responsible for specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Structure-based alteration of dpr/DIP specificities</title><p>Engineered variants of Dprs and DIPs can be used to study wiring specificity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> nervous system. In addition to the mutations described above, which decreased or increased affinities compared to wild-type, mutants with modified specificities can prove especially useful. For this purpose, we took a rational approach to modify Dpr11 to bind DIP-α. As DIP-α binds Dpr6, we substituted every interface amino acid in Dpr11 to its equivalent in Dpr6 (marked by * in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>), and performed a highly sensitive, high-throughput ELISA-like binding assay, the extracellular interactome assay (ECIA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Özkan et al., 2013</xref>). This method can be used to report interactions with affinities as weak as approximately 1 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Özkan et al., 2013</xref>), and was used to originally discover Dpr–DIP interactions.</p><p>The first round of single-site and some double-site mutagenesis identified Dpr11 A165Y and two double mutants to weakly interact with DIP-α (marked by <bold>+</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). Further installation of Dpr6 amino acids at the DIP-binding interface of Dpr11 slightly improved DIP-α affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). As a result of the second round of mutagenesis, we identified a triple-mutant Dpr11 variant, A165Y F167Y K207V (marked by <bold>*</bold>), which binds DIP-α and -γ. Interestingly, further non-exhaustive mutagenesis of the Dpr11 interface beyond A165Y F167Y K207V resulted in loss of binding to both DIPs. The identification of these residues is not accidental: two of the mutations are non-conservative changes in the polar periphery of the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2c</xref>); the K207 position was already highlighted as a specificity determinant above, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d<sub>1</sub></xref>. The A165Y mutation is expected to create of a hydrogen bond absent in the Dpr11–DIP-γ complex but present in Dpr6–DIP-α and the engineered Dpr11 A165Y F167Y K207V–DIP-α complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>). Overall, this set of experiments demonstrates that Dpr/DIP specificities can be modified through rational design and the use of an inexpensive, high-throughput, fast and sensitive interaction assay.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>DIP homodimers are structurally similar to Dpr–DIP heterodimers</title><p>As we purified and crystallized several Dpr–DIP complexes, we were also able to grow crystals of DIP-η IG1 and determined its structure at 1.9 Å resolution, which revealed a homodimer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). These crystals only grew in the absence of Dpr1, which indicated that the heterodimers are likely more stable than the homodimer under the crystallization conditions used. The homodimeric DIP-η structure closely mimicked the Dpr1–DIP-η heterodimer: When DIP-η monomers were aligned, the other subunits, DIP-η in the homodimer and Dpr1 in the heterodimer, were only displaced by an RMSD of 0.78 Å for 87 out of 102 Cα atoms, excluding the variable DE loop and the mobile half of the A strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). This is comparable to differences observed between heterophilic complexes.

As we use lepidopteran cells to express Dprs and DIPs, the glycan structure and composition in our structure likely match the native insect Dpr/DIP glycans. The structure shows that the first N-acetyl glucosamine (NAG) is fucosylated at both the third and sixth carbon positions – commonly observed in arthropods but not in mammals. The glycan linked to Asn82 in Dpr10, which is present in seven out of 21 Dprs, is ordered as it inserts itself into a groove on the DIP-α surface, and adds a further 440 Å<sup>2</sup> area to the buried surface area (total area: 2,240 Å<sup>2</sup>). While the energetic contribution of the glycan is yet to be determined, biochemical studies of Dprs and DIPs may benefit from over-expression in eukaryotic, and specifically arthropod cell lines, due to native-like glycosylation.</p><p>During our work with Dpr10 and DIP-α, we detected DIP-α homodimerization with ECIA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>, upper left corner). DIP-α homodimers are also observed via size-exclusion chromatography, similar to DIP-η, in the mid-micromolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1c</xref>). The heterophilic Dpr6–DIP-α interaction, with a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 0.37 µM, is stronger than homodimerization of DIP-α, as mixing DIP-α with stoichiometric amounts of Dpr6 creates only heterophilic complexes observable on gel filtration columns, breaking up weaker DIP-α homodimers, and crystal trials including Dpr6 and DIP-α yield heterocomplex crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>As DIP-α and DIP-η can form homophilic and heterophilic interactions, genetic studies using mutations at their binding interfaces cannot unambiguously conclude whether homo- or heterophilic binding activity of these DIPs contribute to the function studied. To create molecular tools that can test the importance of this interface, and to possibly distinguish between both activities, we mutated DIP-α and its binding partner Dpr10 and searched for mutations that preferably break homophilic and/or heterophilic binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Using ECIA, we demonstrated that DIP-α I83A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>, red box) can no longer form homophilic dimers, but still has affinity towards Dpr10 (green box). Titrations using ECIA show that the I83A mutant appears to have a 7.8-fold <italic>higher</italic> affinity for Dpr10 than WT DIP-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a</xref>). This is in contrast to an expected loss of affinity based on our SPR data: the I83A mutation causes 700-fold loss of binding to Dpr6, which is a close paralog of Dpr10. In the context of a highly oligomerized or clustered distribution of DIP-α molecules, such as in ECIA or at the site of a cellular adhesion, the weak <italic>cis</italic> DIP-α homodimerization will successfully compete with the <italic>trans</italic> heterodimer, depressing heterophilic affinity. DIP-α I83A, which cannot homodimerize, is free to interact with Dpr10, and therefore appears to have high affinity for Dpr10.</p><p>Among the mutants tested in the mutational analysis of the Dpr10–DIP-α interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>), the Dpr10 mutant Y103A abolishes DIP-α binding (orange box), and therefore can be used to study the Dpr10–DIP-α complex function, without effecting DIP-α homodimerization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Dpr10 and DIP-α in the establishment of neuromuscular circuitry</title><p>The Drosophila larval neuromuscular system consists of 35 motor neurons, which innervate 30 muscles within each hemisegment, forming an invariant circuit that is ideal for delineating genetic mechanisms underlying synaptic connectivity. Although numerous screens and studies have been conducted to uncover potential connectivity molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aberle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banovic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liebl et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mosca et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nose, 2012</xref>), we still lack a complete understanding of how a motor neuron chooses its appropriate muscle target(s). This critical gap in knowledge led us to investigate whether Dprs and DIPs have roles in neuromuscular development and specifically in synaptic partner choice. In a prior study, we found that several Dprs and DIPs, including Dpr11 and one of its interacting partners, DIP-γ, were expressed in motor neurons. Importantly, Dpr11 and DIP-γ are required for normal motor neuron terminal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>). Although the process of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) expansion does not reflect initial synaptic connectivity, the same Dpr–DIP pair is also required for connectivity in the optic lobe. Thus, we delved deeper into Dpr and DIP function at the NMJ.</p><p>In the fly larval neuromuscular system, muscles are innervated by multiple motor neurons. The majority of these motor neurons are the class one type, and these can be further subdivided into 1b (big) or 1 s (small) indicative of their terminal, or bouton, sizes. Several additional key factors differentiate 1b and 1 s motor neurons: most 1b motor neurons innervate single muscle targets whereas 1 s motor neurons innervate subgroups of muscles (dorsal, lateral and ventral muscles) and the amount of subsynaptic reticulum (SSR) surrounding 1b boutons is much greater than 1 s. Here we focus on one 1 s motor neuron, the MNISN-1s, that innervates the dorsal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoang and Chiba, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Landgraf et al., 2003</xref>). In a concurrent study, we demonstrate that <italic>DIP-α</italic> is expressed in MNISN-1s, and a DIP-α binding partner, Dpr10, is expressed postsynaptically in muscles.

Further analysis of a <italic>DIP-α</italic> mutant revealed that the remaining MNISN-1s muscle connections were still present; thus, highlighting the specificity inherent in connectivity codes, even within a single neuron, and the potential requirement for combinatorial interactions between cell surface proteins for establishing synaptic partner matching.

Utilizing this approach, we can rescue the LOF <italic>DIP-α</italic> phenotype by expressing a wild-type UAS-<italic>DIP-α</italic> in cells which normally express <italic>DIP-α</italic>, including MNISN-1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashley et al., 2019</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d,g</xref>). We favor a model whereby transsynaptic Dpr10–DIP-α interactions mediate connectivity, which we set out to demonstrate using single-site mutations that break the interaction. For this purpose and to tease apart roles for homophilic and heterophilic interactions, we constructed a <italic>DIP-α</italic> mutant I83A (<italic>DIP-α<sup>I83A</sup>)</italic> which abolishes homophilic binding but does, at least partly, retain the Dpr10 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d and g</xref>, expression of UAS-<italic>DIP-α</italic> in cells that normally express DIP-α is able to rescue the loss of <italic>DIP-α</italic> phenotype confirming our previous finding. However, when the same experiment is repeated with UAS-<italic>DIP-α<sup>I83A</sup></italic>, we no longer observe rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f,g</xref>), suggesting that the DIP-α interaction interface we identified is required for the connectivity of MNISN-1s to m4, and that the connectivity might depend on homodimerization activity of DIP-α. These results are not due to changes in DIP-α<sup>I83A</sup> expression since the mutant and wild type DIP-α are expressed at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Also, to confirm that there are no inherent sex differences in the formation of these terminals, we scored female and male heterozygous transgene controls and found no significant differences in m4 innervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Overall, this suggests a multistep process of m4 innervation requiring both a Dpr10–DIP-α interaction as well as a homomeric DIP-α–DIP-α interaction.</p><p>In our concurrent study describing the role of Dpr10–DIP-α interactions in wiring of the neuromuscular circuit, we found that overexpression of UAS-<italic>dpr10</italic> in muscles caused the partial loss of MNISN-1s innervation of m4, similar to the <italic>dpr10</italic> mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashley et al., 2019</xref>). We sought to determine if this gain-of-function (GOF) phenotype was a direct consequence of overexpressed Dpr10 interacting with endogenous DIP-α. As discussed above, the Dpr10 mutant Y103A (hereafter denoted <italic>Dpr10<sup>Y103A</sup></italic>) is unable to bind DIP-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>), providing an ideal tool for exploring this GOF phenotype. Unlike muscle overexpression of UAS-<italic>Dpr10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>), similar high level expression of UAS-<italic>dpr10<sup>Y103A</sup></italic> in muscles does not affect MNISN-1s innervation of m4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b,c</xref>), suggesting that the Dpr10–DIP-α interaction is an integral component of the Dpr10 GOF phenotype. This GOF phenotype is dependent on the levels of UAS-<italic>dpr10</italic> overexpression, as mild muscle expression does not reveal the GOF phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). To address the possibility of an unexpected downstream effect of the Dpr10<sup>Y103A</sup> mutant, we showed that the Y103A mutation does not affect the interaction of Dpr10 with cDIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2b</xref>); however, we cannot rule out effects mediated by unknown binding partners of Dpr10. Furthermore, we reasoned that if overexpressed Dpr10 is acting through DIP-α, partial loss of <italic>DIP-α</italic> should exacerbate the GOF UAS-<italic>dpr10</italic> phenotype while overexpression of UAS-<italic>dpr10<sup>Y103A</sup></italic> should be insensitive to DIP-α levels.

Previous evidence shows that Dprs and DIPs may be representative of neuronal surface proteins that have expanded in the arthropod line to help wire complex but stereotyped brains.</p><p>The interaction network created by the Dprs and DIPs demonstrates how gene duplication events have led to diversity in molecular recognition and function in neuronal surface molecules. While the distant gene duplication events have given rise to the five Dpr and five DIP subclasses and have resulted in specialization of interactions, the more recent duplication events have only created mostly redundant molecular interactions. A comprehensive analysis of other arthropod Dprs and DIPs may reveal evolutionary forces that have resulted in repeated gene duplications in these families, and it is intriguing to speculate that the complexity of neural networks and the numbers of Dprs, DIPs and other neuronal surface receptors may correlate in arthropod species.</p><p>The Dpr and DIP complex structures we have determined show a two-fold pseudo-symmetric architecture. Here, we also show the presence of DIP-η and DIP-α homodimers in solution and present a symmetrical DIP-η homodimer structure that closely mimics heterodimeric Dpr–DIP complexes. This raises the question of whether the homophilic or the heterophilic interaction evolved first. Since Dpr and DIP IG1 sequences can be aligned with identities well above any random IG domain sequences, and Dpr and DIP IG1 domains are nearly identical in structure (RMSD values ≤ 1 Å), we believe that Dpr and DIP IG1 domains may be the result of an ancient duplication event of a homodimeric IG domain. Following this logic, the DIP-η and DIP-α complexes may represent homodimers that were retained through multiple gene duplications. As heterophilic binding allows for higher diversity in neuronal recognition than homophilic would (i.e. 21 × 9 possible heterodimers &gt; 30 possible homodimers), heterophilic binding must have been favored for specifying neuronal connections in complex structures such as the fly optic lobe. This is corroborated by our observations that heterodimers have higher affinities than the homodimers.</p><p>The observations we report here, including the lack of intracellular regions and the flexible nature of the ectodomain, have led us to believe that Dprs and DIPs may not be signaling receptors, and would require binding to co-receptors or secreted ligands for relaying signal to the cytoplasm upon formation of homo or heterodimers. It is also unclear if <italic>cis</italic> dimers can form, and signal. As <italic>cis</italic> dimers would inhibit productive <italic>trans</italic> cell-adhesive structures, their presence has significant functional relevance. We believe that interdomain flexibility and long low-complexity ‘stalk’ regions linking the IG domains to the membrane would enable <italic>cis</italic> dimerization for homodimeric DIPs, such as DIP-α and DIP-η. In fact, our SPR experiments where DIP-η is captured on solid support at high densities reports much higher apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values for the Dpr1–DIP-η interaction (23 µM vs 4.0 µM measured when non-dimerizing Dpr1 is captured on SPR chip; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>), as the <italic>cis</italic> DIP-η homodimer formation on the chip likely competes with Dpr1 binding. The <italic>cis</italic> homodimerization may actually be the result of a strategy to inhibit cellular adhesions resulting from relatively weak <italic>trans</italic> interactions, which would not be able to overcome the <italic>cis</italic> homodimers. This would lead to more stringent selectivity for intercellular interactions, and would prevent non-specific synapses. We examined these interactions using engineered mutations in the NMJ, and found evidence for functional relevance for both <italic>cis</italic> homodimeric and <italic>trans</italic> heterodimeric interactions, supporting our view.</p><p>The requirement of the homomeric DIP-α–DIP-α interaction for proper synaptic targeting presents a layer of complexity to what at first appearance was a straightforward binary model. We now know that DIP-α is required for proper synapse wiring, as a wild type UAS-<italic>DIP-α</italic> transgene in the mutant background can restore connectivity. However, when we introduce a UAS-<italic>DIP-α</italic> transgene with a mutation that breaks the DIP-α–DIP-α interaction in the same mutant background, the mutant form is unable to rescue the loss of connectivity. This does not appear to be a trafficking defect, as DIP-α<sup>I83A</sup> appears at similar wild-type levels in 1 s terminals as it does on other muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1c,d</xref>). DIP-α<sup>I83A</sup> binds Dpr10, so we cannot rule promiscuous binding of DIP-α<sup>I83A</sup> to Dpr10 on other muscles; however, overexpression of UAS-<italic>DIP-α<sup>I83A</sup></italic> with either <italic>DIP-α-GAL4</italic> or <italic>Eve-GAL4</italic>, which also drives in MNISN-1s, does not reveal a GOF phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1f</xref>). Instead, our data support a model in which weak <italic>trans</italic> interactions with other molecules are resisted by homodimeric DIP-α complexes. This mode of targeting would allow for motor neuron growth cones to bypass non-specific or very weak interactions on non-target muscles and only synapse on bona-fide muscle targets. Interestingly, our concurrent study demonstrates that Dpr10 is expressed in specific muscles during embryonic development synchronous with growth cone exploration of those muscles, and thus overcome DIP-α homodimerization in favor of the stronger Dpr10–DIP-α heterodimer.</p><p><italic>Note added in proof:</italic> During the late revision stages of our manuscript, two articles from the Shapiro, Honig and Zipursky groups were published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cosmanescu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). The results in our manuscript and the accompanying manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashley et al., 2019</xref>) are in general agreement. The structures presented here and in Cosmanescu et al. show a conserved mode of binding, now observed crystallographically across three DIP homodimers and five Dpr–DIP heterodimers. The conservation of the hydrophobic core and the variable polar periphery is another shared observation. The amino acids chosen to disrupt DIP-α and Dpr10 complexes, DIP-α I83 and Dpr10 Y103, were common to both studies. Finally, both sets of studies demonstrate phenotypes when DIP-α homodimers or Dpr10–DIP-α heterodimers are affected via mutagenesis.</p><p>One point of difference is in the SPR-measured affinities of heterophilic Dpr–DIP complexes. Our reported <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values for the Dpr6–DIP-α, Dpr11–DIP-γ and Dpr1–DIP-η interactions are 6, 7, and 21-fold lower (i.e. interactions are stronger), respectively, than those of Cosmanescu et al., and as a result, these heterodimer affinities are much stronger than the homodimer affinities reported by both manuscripts. We do not believe that the disparities for heterodimeric affinities are due to the presence of additional IG domains included in SPR experiments in Cosmanescu et al., since these domains do not contribute structurally and energetically to binding as we have demonstrated initially via SPR in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>. Instead, we show that DIP homodimer formation may cause SPR experiments to underestimate heterodimeric affinities (i.e. over-report <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values) due to competition between the two modes of binding, which we endeavored to remedy in our study. The interactions we identified with ECIA for DIP-ζ, -η and -θ which were not detected in Cosmanescu et al. may have been affected by this artifact during SPR experiments. The measurement of accurate affinities at overlapping homo- and heterophilic binding sites remains a significant challenge, including for Dprs and DIPs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Phylogenetics</title><p>The regions containing immunoglobulin domains from the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Dpr and DIP sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Edgar, 2004</xref>).

While there is no explicit mathematical model for small-zone SEC for fast-kinetics oligomers (Stevens, 1989), simulations can accurately predict elution profiles.

The DIP-η homodimerization experiments were performed with a Biorad ProteOn XPR36 using the low-capacity Neutravidin chips. For mutants with high dissociation constants (usually &gt;100 µM), maximum response (<italic>R</italic><sub>max</sub>) values could not be determined. In such cases, estimates of dissociation constants were calculated while constraining <italic>R</italic><sub>max</sub> to well-determined values measured on the same channel from wild-type measurements. All buffers included the surfactant 0.05% Polysorbitan-20 to prevent non-specific binding. Fitting to binding isotherms were done in BIAEvaluation (GE Healthcare), Prism 6 (GraphPad) or MATLAB (Mathworks) using 1:1 Langmuir binding models.</p><p>Affinity measurement for homodimeric proteins by SPR are complicated by the fact that homodimers form between analyte and ligand (on the chip), between ligand and ligand (on the chip), and between analyte and analyte (in the mobile phase). To avoid ligand-ligand homodimerization on the chip, we created a SPR chip by loading it with dilute (i.e. monomeric) DIP-η and only sparsely populated a low-capacity Neutravidin chips, approximately 100 response units on the ProteOn XPR36 system.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Molecular Basis of Synaptic Specificity by Immunoglobulin Superfamily Receptors in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript presents a structural study of proteins from the immunoglobulin superfamily, Dprs and DIPs, which have been reported to regulate synaptic connectivity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central and peripheral nervous systems. The authors use evolutionary, biophysical and biochemical approaches to analyze sequence similarities and differences in specific regions of Dpr/DIP heterophilic complex, including the hydrophobic core, in order to evaluate binding specificity after mutating amino acids at the interface. The authors also compare the structure of a homodimer of DIP with heterodimers between DIP and Dpr. They generate multiple variants that selectively abolish homodimerization of DIP-α, or the formation of heteromeric complexes of DIP-α with Dpr10. Using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval neuromuscular junction as a model, the authors conduct in vivo studies to further test the roles of DIP-α/Dpr10 complexes and DIP-α homodimers in neuromuscular circuit wiring. The authors highlight the function of cis-dimers of DIPs in regulating synaptic wiring, on top of the reported heterodimeric trans interactions between DIPs and Dprs.</p><p>The structural studies are extensive and outstanding and will provide useful information for the research community focusing on proteins containing immunoglobulin domains. While the quality of the structures data and analyses is generally high, the in vivo study of DIP-α/Dpr10 should be improved to better support the conclusions as outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall</p><p>It would greatly strengthen the work to more clearly highlight what the novel aspects are. What do we now know that we did not know before about how the DPR:DIP system works? Several strategic sentences placed throughout the text would be very helpful for the reader.</p><p>In vivo experiments</p><p>Some alternative explanations for the Dpr10 / DIP-α mutants need to be considered: what evidence exists that the only defect in Y103A is its interaction with DIP-α? The data suggest the authors' preferred model IF there are no other defects in the function / ability to interact with other downstream molecules of this particular Dpr10 mutant. Is this true? If this evidence does not exist, the authors should at least highlight that possibility more clearly. A similar argument for DIP-α I83A- the mutation removes some of the interaction ability with Dpr10. How can the authors ensure that this removal doesn't also affect the system? What if the phenotype is sensitive to Dpr10 interaction levels? Though these may be the most parsimonious explanations, they have not been conclusively shown by the data and more information should be offered or an appropriate scaling back of the conclusions and recognition of alternate explanations should be made.</p><p>The NMJ studies lack certain controls and experiment information – especially in Figure 7 and Figure 8, the data lack a wild-type control, a base loss-of-function to evaluate the phenotype, and sample sizes for all experiments.

The authors use evolutionary, biophysical and biochemical approaches to analyze sequence similarities and differences in specific regions of Dpr/DIP heterophilic complex, including the hydrophobic core, in order to evaluate binding specificity after mutating amino acids at the interface. The authors also compare the structure of a homodimer of DIP with heterodimers between DIP and Dpr. They generate multiple variants that selectively abolish homodimerization of DIP-α, or the formation of heteromeric complexes of DIP-α with Dpr10. Using the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction as a model, the authors conduct in vivo studies to further test the roles of DIP-α/Dpr10 complexes and DIP-α homodimers in neuromuscular circuit wiring. The authors highlight the function of cis-dimers of DIPs in regulating synaptic wiring, on top of the reported heterodimeric trans interactions between DIPs and Dprs.</p><p>The structural studies are extensive and outstanding and will provide useful information for the research community focusing on proteins containing immunoglobulin domains. While the quality of the structures data and analyses is generally high, the in vivo study of DIP-α/Dpr10 should be improved to better support the conclusions as outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall</p><p>It would greatly strengthen the work to more clearly highlight what the novel aspects are. What do we now know that we did not know before about how the D:DIP system works? Several strategic sentences placed throughout the text would be very helpful for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these comments. We feel we have addressed their concerns to the best of our ability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In vivo experiments</p><p>Some alternative explanations for the Dpr10 / DIP-α mutants need to be considered: what evidence exists that the only defect in Y103A is its interaction with DIP-α? The data suggest the authors' preferred model IF there are no other defects in the function / ability to interact with other downstream molecules of this particular Dpr10 mutant. Is this true? If this evidence does not exist, the authors should at least highlight that possibility more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>Dpr10 was first reported in the literature as part of our large-scale protein interactome dataset, which identified DIP-α and cDIP as the only binding partners (Özkan et al., 2013). To address the possibility that Dpr10 Y103A mutation might break an interaction with cDIP, we repeated the binding assay with cDIP. Our results (the new Figure 6—figure supplement 2B) now show that Y103A does not affect cDIP binding. However, we agree with the reviewers that we cannot rule out downstream effects of this single-site mutation mediated by unknown binding partners. The text reflects this now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A similar argument for DIP-α I83A- the mutation removes some of the interaction ability with Dpr10. How can the authors ensure that this removal doesn't also affect the system? What if the phenotype is sensitive to Dpr10 interaction levels? Though these may be the most parsimonious explanations, they have not been conclusively shown by the data and more information should be offered or an appropriate scaling back of the conclusions and recognition of alternate explanations should be made.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers. The known heterophilic binding partners of DIP-α are Dpr6 and Dpr10 – cDIP does not bind DIP-α (Özkan et al., 2013). We already show in Figure 4—figure supplement 3 that the DIP-α I83A mutation does decrease affinity towards the closely related Dpr6 binding by ~700 fold, and we expect a similar effect for Dpr10–DIP-α Ι83Α binding. The expected partial loss of affinity in the Dpr10–DIP-α I83A interaction due to the I83A mutation might illicit a (partial) phenotype.</p><p>For our revision, we conducted a titration series of DIP-α wild-type and the I83A mutant against Dpr10 using ECIA. In the context of our high-avidity binding assay designed to mimic adhesion molecule interactions between molecular clusters on two-dimensional surfaces, the DIP-α I83A mutant binds Dpr10 not weaker, but ~8x stronger than DIP-α WT. This apparent higher heterophilic affinity for I83A is likely due to abolishment of the competing DIP-α–DIP-α interaction, which is only present for DIP-α WT in the context of the highly clustered ECIA. Even though we expect DIP-α I83A to bind Dpr10 weaker, lack of competing DIP-α homodimerization allows for DIP-α I83A to retain effective binding to Dpr10 better than the WT. Unfortunately, it is very hard to predict what would happen on a neuron, and whether the SPR setup (Figure 4) or the ECIA (Figure 6—figure supplement 2) is more representative of the physiological interaction. Any DIP mutant that only removes homodimerization may effectively increase Dpr affinity depending on the avidity (clustering and local concentration) of the binding partners in the system being studied.</p><p>Based on these results, DIP-α I83A may be a valuable tool to test the functional outcomes for lack of homophilic DIP-α binding, while the heterodimer (DIP-α–Dpr10) can still form. However, we believe the safer course would be to explicitly state alternate explanations in our manuscript, as the reviewers suggest. We have changed the results and Discussion sections to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The NMJ studies lack certain controls and experiment information – especially in Figure 7 and Figure 8, the data lack a wild-type control, a base loss-of-function to evaluate the phenotype, and sample sizes for all experiments.

DIP-η IG1 runs ~30% smaller than its expected elution volume for a globular protein of same molecular weight, both for the monomer and dimer, likely due to transient non-specific interactions with gel filtration resin. While this kind of behavior is common, it does not affect our analysis of dimerization. Finally, we have added labels for protein concentrations. We calculate protein amounts in each peak not by the amounts loaded, but using the areas under each peak, to correct for any protein loss common to chromatography injections and runs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please explain why the magenta and mustard concentrations run so differently? Are these both monomers?</p></disp-quote><p>This comment, and others below, indicated to us that we missed an opportunity to explain in detail a feature of low-affinity, fast-kinetics complexes in our manuscript. When a protein is in a fast equilibrium of monomers and dimers (such as DIPs), one cannot observe separate monomer and dimer peaks in gel filtration, but a peak at one intermediate position determined by the ratio of monomers-to-dimers. This is conceptually identical to how NMR chemical shifts separate into peaks when a protein experiences slow-exchange kinetics but take single intermediate positions in fast-exchange kinetics. To our knowledge, this behavior was first rigorously demonstrated and simulated thirty years ago by Stevens, (1989). Further details of this behavior can be found in a protocol paper by his group (Wilton et al., 2004).</p><p>This phenomenon might be best simplified if one imagines a group of molecules traveling within a gel filtration column. Since the rates of P+P→P<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>2</sub>→P+P conversions are fast and happening several times per second for a fast-kinetics dimer, any given P molecule can recycle through monomer and dimer many times within one gel filtration experiment: up to 1,800 times if <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> = 1 s<sup>-1</sup> and the elution time = 30 min. So, the average migration speed of the protein molecule will be more than the dimer’s but less than the monomer’s. The fast exchange rate will not allow monomeric and dimeric proteins to separate into peaks. In the case of slow kinetics (e.g., <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> &gt; 1 h<sup>-1</sup>), a protein is unlikely to convert between monomer to dimer during one chromatography run, and the two populations will separate into two peaks.</p><p>Stevens lab’s simulations describe how such chromatograms should appear in their 2004 paper. Panel A below shows actual data for a fast-exchange monomer/dimer with a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 10 µM, and panel B shows expected chromatograms based on simulations. Our gel filtration results in Figure 5 and Figure 6 closely match their experimental and theoretical data.</p><p>We also would like to note that low-affinity/µM interactions almost always have fast kinetics, even though this is not theoretically required. In our case, our SPR results here and in Carrillo et al., (2015) show the fast kinetics.</p><p>In short, the mustard peak in Figure 5E belongs to protein molecules at a low concentration, which have spent most of their time on the SEC column in a fast-eluting monomeric state, and less time as a slow-eluting dimer. The magenta peak belongs to a sample 5x more concentrated, which has existed approximately same amount of time as a fast-eluting monomer and as a slow-eluting dimer. The peaks further to the left, at even higher concentrations, mostly existed as a dimer during the 1-hour long SEC experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not clear in Figure 5 —figure supplement 1 how the curves in Figure 5E could be used to calculate the ratio of monomer to dimer, leading to an estimated KD of 10-40 µM. This is a key point used to argue that DIP homodimers form with somewhat less affinity than Dpr:DIP heteromers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now corrected this oversight and expanded the methodology further in the manuscript. However, we would still like to emphasize that the evidence for heterodimers having higher affinity is not limited to these calculations.</p><p>Finally, we show in the manuscript that the Dpr-DIP heterodimer affinities may be underestimated (i.e. appear weaker) in SPR experiments due to competing homodimers. Therefore, it is more likely that we are underestimating heterophilic affinities, and the heterodimers are even more stronger than homodimers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The legend of Figure 5 —figure supplement 1 states: &quot;Dimer fraction was calculated by identifying monomeric and dimeric elution velocities and calculating monomer and dimer fractions for any given peak position.&quot; However, the trailing shoulders of the peaks in Figure 5E cannot be assumed to be dimer or monomer based on the elution position in the chromatogram alone because of protein loading issues. Large amounts of protein will have larger trailing peaks. So, the contents of the peaks must be validated by PAGE (native gels) to demonstrate dimer, monomer or a mixture.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that when peaks trail it is problematic to assign an average elution volume, or migration speed, to the protein sample in the experiment. These “trailing shoulders” are expected (especially at intermediate concentrations), because the peak’s leading edge will start to separate from the peak and will migrate faster as the protein is more diluted and will lean further towards the monomeric state. This issue stem from the fact that in gel filtration chromatography the entire protein sample is not in equilibrium across the elution profile. Partly because of this, we report dissociation constants as a range, rather than precise numbers. Also, using an absorbance-weighted average value as the elution volume does not significantly change the apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values calculated from the binding isotherm.</p><p>The “trailing shoulders” is also a feature reported in Stevens’ simulations, explicitly mentioned in Wilton, Myatt and Stevens, (2004) further supporting our results.</p><p>Finally, the native PAGE experiment suggested by the reviewer will also not give multiple bands, but only an intermediate and probably fuzzy band, simply because the separation of PAGE bands happens on the timescale of minutes, while DIPs interconvert between monomer to dimer in the millisecond to second timescale.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Likewise, Figure 6D is surprising as well. If you have a monomer-dimer equilibrium you would expect two resolved peaks (e.g., the red curve for the dimer and the blue curve for the monomer). But a mixture should show two peaks/adjacent bumps (one for the dimer and one for the monomer) not something in the middle (green curve).</p></disp-quote><p>As explained above, in a fast-exchange monomer-dimer equilibrium, one should only observe one intermediate peak, and no separate peaks. Only in the slow-exchange regime, or when a kinetic trap can prevent quick conversion between monomer to dimer, multiple peaks can be observed. We have indeed worked with such proteins and published such data before (the cell-cycle control protein Mad2 can exist in multiple states, which are stable for hours to days, and monomers or dimers can be separated (Hara et al., 2015)). For such behavior, the kinetics of oligomerization and dissociation should be happening in timescales of at least minutes to hours.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there perhaps a typo for the green curve in Figure 6D which reads 59 μM? Please show the calibration markers for the SEC column in Figure 6D.</p></disp-quote><p>There is no typo. We need to test DIP-α and DIP-η homodimerization at [DIP] concentrations in the high μM and even millimolar range, as a result of their weak affinities compared to the heterodimers. Figure 6D shows gel filtration results at 7.8 µM, 59 µM and 1.13 millimolar concentrations. It appears that only at 1.1 mM, DIP-α is in ≥90% dimer. Such weak affinities (and even worse) are observed for well-established cell adhesion complexes; classical Cadherins homodimerize with <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>s in the range of 14 µM to 127 µM (Vendome et al., 2014), which are still strong enough to create adherens junctions.</p><p>The calibration markers are shown in Figure 6D as triangles above the curves. Unlike our DIP-η IG1 construct (pI = 8.7), DIP-α IG1 (pI = 6.9) elutes as monomer and dimer at volumes expected for a globular protein of the same size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For all SPR data please add the model used (presumably 1:1 interaction model) to each curve so the reader can see how well the data fits the model and thus how accurate the KD are that are calculated based on the data. Please state in the legend which interaction model was used.</p></disp-quote><p>The binding model fits to the SPR data for all Dpr-DIP complexes are in Figure 4A-D, and all raw data are in the supplemental figures. This was mentioned in the legend for Figure 4 but needed to be further stated in the main text. We have added wording to the main text and expanded the Figure 4 legend. Also, the figure supplements include tables for each <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> measurement, and the standard error of mean values associated with those fits.</p><p>SPR data was fit using the 1:1 interaction model, except in Figure 5—figure supplement 1D, which measures DIP-η homodimerization using SPR. For this dataset, we modified binding equations to account for homodimerization in solution, and we fit the data to the modified model in MATLAB, as mentioned in the original manuscript. We had failed to include the equations used for DIP-η homodimer fitting in the Methods section, which has been remedied in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
