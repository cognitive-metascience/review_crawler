We analysed Dystrophin binding dynamics in vivo for the first time. Within maturing fibres of host zebrafish embryos, our analysis reveals a pool of diffusible Dystrophin and complexes bound at the fibre membrane. Combining modelling, an improved FRAP methodology and direct semi-quantitative analysis of bleaching suggests the existence of two membrane-bound Dystrophin populations with widely differing bound lifetimes: a stable, tightly bound pool, and a dynamic bound pool with high turnover rate that exchanges with the cytoplasmic pool. The three populations were found consistently in human and zebrafish Dystrophins overexpressed in wild-type or <italic>dmd<sup>ta222a/ta222a</sup></italic> zebrafish embryos, which lack Dystrophin, and in <italic>Gt(dmd-Citrine)</italic><sup><italic>ct90a</italic></sup> that express endogenously-driven tagged zebrafish Dystrophin. These results lead to a new model for Dystrophin membrane association in developing muscle, and highlight our methodology as a valuable strategy for in vivo analysis of complex protein dynamics.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06541.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06541.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06541.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A protein called Dystrophin plays a key role in maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells as they contract and relax. Mutations in the gene that encodes Dystrophin can cause several different types of muscular dystrophy, a group of diseases in which muscle progressively weakens. Some mutations in Dystrophin can lead to mild symptoms that may affect the quality of life but are not life threatening. However, in more serious cases, patients lose the ability to walk in childhood and have shortened life expectancy. There is no cure for these diseases, and there are still big gaps in our understanding of how Dystrophin works, which makes it more difficult to develop efficient therapies.</p><p>The zebrafish is often used as a model to study muscular dystrophies. In this study, Bajanca et al. introduced human Dystrophin into zebrafish muscle cells and analysed its behaviour using a combination of mathematical modelling and a method known as ‘fluorescence recovery after photobleaching’. In these experiments, the human Dystrophin was attached to a tag that fluoresces green under a microscope, which allowed it to be easily seen and be followed in real time inside the cells of live animals.</p><p>Bajanca et al. observed that Dystrophin could either remain firmly associated with the membrane that surrounds the cell over long periods of time or interact briefly with the membrane. Bajanca et al. carried out further experiments with the Dystrophin protein naturally found in zebrafish and observed that it behaved in a similar manner to the human protein, suggesting this behaviour is likely to be important for the ability of the protein to work.</p><p>Bajanca et al.'s findings reveal that Dystrophin displays complex behaviour in living muscle cells. The fact that some Dystrophin molecules are firmly attached to the membrane support previous findings that this protein provides mechanical stability to the cells. However, the discovery that there is a group of more mobile Dystrophin molecules within muscle cells suggests that this protein may also play other roles. Therefore, these findings open a new avenue for research that may contribute to the development of new therapy approaches in future.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06541.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06541.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Dystrophin</kwd><kwd>muscle</kwd><kwd>binding dynamics</kwd><kwd>diffusion</kwd><kwd>FRAP</kwd><kwd>software</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Association Monégasque Contre les Myopathies</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ICE consortium</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>Luis</given-names></name><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Simon M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Région Midi-Pyrénées</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13053025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bajanca</surname><given-names>Fernanda</given-names></name><name><surname>Theveneau</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale (FRM)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AJE201224</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Theveneau</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission (EC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Curie MC253305</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bajanca</surname><given-names>Fernanda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Kwan Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gonzalez-Perez</surname><given-names>Vinicio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003513</institution-id><institution>University of Surrey</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Overseas Research Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gonzalez-Perez</surname><given-names>Vinicio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Vacation Bursary</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gillespie</surname><given-names>Sean J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council (MRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Programme grant G1001029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Simon M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A multidisciplinary approach was used to translate the mathematical analysis of Dystrophin movements inside muscle cells into the biology of how Dystrophin interacts with the cell membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Muscle Dystrophin establishes a link between Dystroglycan complexes at the cell membrane and actin in the cortical cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al., 1992</xref>;

Mutations in the <italic>Dystrophin</italic> gene often lead to a non-functional protein and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), characterised by severe muscle degeneration from early childhood. In-frame deletions within the Dystrophin sequence can result in a shortened but partially functional protein that causes Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koenig et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>A major international effort aims to develop gene therapy for DMD. Yet, there are still big gaps on our understanding of how Dystrophin works within cells. It is important to understand the dynamics of Dystrophin in vivo and how this could vary within cellular context, influencing the phenotype of BMD and gene therapy planning for patients with DMD. For example, many current approaches for gene therapy in DMD aim to restore ‘short’ Dystrophins, known to be partially functional from studies of patients with BMD and murine transgenic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Konieczny et al., 2013</xref>). How the dynamics of these proteins compare with those of full-length Dystrophin has not been addressed due to the lack of a suitable method. However, if some short Dystrophin forms bind more efficiently and stably than others this will have an impact on the relative amount of protein necessary to recover function. The knowledge of Dystrophin dynamics and a methodology to perform comparative studies is therefore needed.</p><p>Dystrophin is well studied in zebrafish and its homology with the human Dystrophin is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guyon et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lai et al., 2012</xref>). Several mutant and transgenic lines have been used as model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and testing potential therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kunkel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kawahara and Kunkel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Waugh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wood and Currie, 2014</xref>). The loss of Dystrophin is lethal to both people and zebrafish, primarily due to striated muscle defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bassett et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berger et al., 2010</xref>). Both species show developmental progression towards the adult localisation of Dystrophin. In human embryos, Dystrophin first appears in the cytoplasm, at the tips of myotubes, then becomes widespread throughout the myofibres in foetal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wessels et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clerk et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chevron et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mora et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Torelli et al., 1999</xref>). In embryonic zebrafish muscle, Dystrophin transcripts are reported to accumulate initially in the cytoplasm, and from 24 hr post fertilization (hpf) until early larval stages, Dystrophin protein and transcripts are primarily located at muscle fibre tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bassett et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guyon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Böhm et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruf-Zamojski et al., 2015</xref>). In both species, Dystrophin becomes localised under the sarcolemma in maturing and adult muscle fibres where it concentrates at costameres, neuromuscular and myotendinous junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Samitt and Bonilla, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miyatake et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chambers et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guyon et al., 2003</xref>). Dystrophin half-life is believed to be very long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tennyson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Verhaart et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, to study Dystrophin binding dynamics, it may be advantageous to look at the moment where binding complexes are actively forming, during muscle development.</p><p>Study of protein dynamics in living tissue faces many technical hurdles that no available method can tackle satisfactorily. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) requires stable confocal imaging of submicron volumes and is thus sensitive to drift in living tissue. Moreover, FCS is only applicable over a limited range of fluorophore concentrations and is greatly impeded by the presence of significant quantities of immobile fluorophores. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) avoids these problems. However, imaging in a living organism is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio that worsens as tissue thickness increases and protein abundance decreases. In addition, cells are located at variable optical depths and have varying shapes and protein levels, all of which introduces variability. This hampers identification of real variation in protein dynamics and prevents the common procedure of pooling data from multiple cells to reduce noise.</p><p>In this study, we assess human Dystrophin dynamics in muscle cells of host zebrafish embryos, using a new approach to perform and analyse FRAP in the context of the living muscle fibre that specifically deals with the challenges of in vivo protein analysis. We thoroughly characterize the expression of the exogenous human Dystrophin within zebrafish host muscle cells. Overexpression often results in an excess of cytoplasmic Dystrophin, which is taken into account on the analysis of Dystrophin binding dynamics. We demonstrate that Dystrophin diffuses freely in the zebrafish muscle fibre cytoplasm and determine its diffusion constant. At the binding sites localised at the muscle cell tips, we found the existence of two membrane-bound pools with distinct binding constants: an immobile pool bound stably during our imaging timescale and a mobile-bound pool with a highly dynamic turnover. We test several potential factors that could potentially interfere with the binding dynamics of Dystrophin, or with its analysis, and result in wrong identification of a labile-bound pool: lateral diffusion of bound Dystrophin, transient dark state of fluorescent proteins, artificial increase of the cytoplasmic pool, competition with endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin, or weak interaction between inter-species proteins. Our data allowed us to dismiss all these hypotheses, supporting the real existence of two bound forms of Dystrophin in maturing fibres of the zebrafish embryo. Taken together, these results suggest a model for Dystrophin association with the membrane and provide a baseline and a validated methodology to analyse how modifications in Dystrophin structure may alter its dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dystrophin mRNA and protein localization are environmentally determined</title><p>We set out to analyse human Dystrophin protein dynamics in vivo in the physiological environment of the muscle fibres of zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Expression of huDys or GFP control in zebrafish embryos was achieved through the injection of the DNA constructs into newly fertilized embryos at the early 1 cell stage, aiming to obtain mosaic expression to facilitate single cell analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). From 24 hpf onwards, huDys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, green) accumulated progressively at both ends of transgenic fibres (hereafter referred to as ‘tips’), as observed for endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, red). GFP control showed no tip accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

We investigated this difference.</p><p>As intensity around 3 units above the background is easily detected under our imaging conditions (‘Materials and methods’), we can distinguish huDysGFP in a cytoplasmic voxel (a three dimensional pixel of 0.024 µm<sup>3</sup>) down to a number per voxel around 60 times lower than in the brightest fibre tip voxel (avoiding saturation of the detector by setting it to under 255 on 8-bit grayscale). As less than 1% of the entire cell volume is in the tip region, it is possible that even in cells with cytoplasmic huDysGFP below detectable levels there could be as much huDysGFP in the cytoplasm as in the tip region. This could equally be the case for endogenous Dystrophin. Therefore, the observed difference may be partially due to lower sensitivity of the antibody detection of cytoplasmic endogenous Dystrophin compared to the higher sensitivity of GFP detection. However, higher levels of cytoplasmic accumulation are likely an artefact of the overexpression of exogenous Dystrophin. Therefore, to confidently analyse Dystrophin binding dynamics, the presence of this cytoplasmic pool has to be taken into account and a deeper characterisation is required.</p><p>We analysed in more detail how each pool, tips, and cytoplasm, distribute. As predicted, in the majority of the muscle fibres, most huDysGFP is in the cytoplasm, with only a minority at the tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), even though the higher concentration at the tips might have suggested otherwise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). Even in cells with cytoplasmic levels close to the detection limit, there is at least as much huDysGFP dispersed in the whole cytoplasm as that concentrated at the tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Across a population of fibres, more huDysGFP fluorescence was detected in the cytoplasm of fibres with higher total huDysGFP levels (blue triangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, the fluorescence at the tips does not increase with the total fluorescence of the fibre (green circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating that tip binding is limited by the presence of a limited number of binding sites that easily saturate. Thus, the accumulation of huDysGFP in the fibre cytoplasm does not appear to affect the binding at the tips. Also, fibre tips generally had greater fluorescence intensity than fibre cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). High intensities at the tips can be achieved even with low cytoplasmic huDysGFP concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, at low overall fibre intensities, there is clear preference for accumulation at the tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). All these data indicate that human Dystrophin is preferentially bound at the zebrafish fibre tips regardless of the amount of cytoplasmic Dystrophin.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06541.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Comparison of tip and cytoplasm huDysGFP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Variation of the total fluorescence (as raw integrated density or sum of pixel values) at tips (green circles) and cytoplasm (blue triangles) over a population of 32 fibres expressing huDysGFP.

Dystrophin is a high molecular mass protein with multiple actin binding sites. We asked whether huDysGFP can diffuse freely in muscle fibre cytoplasm or whether it may be bound to cytoplasmic structures such as actin fibres.</p><p>We developed a modified FRAP approach to analyse protein dynamics in vivo. Even in the best imaging conditions, one faces the challenge of low signal-to-noise ratio that worsens as tissue thickness increases and protein abundance decreases. Although we are able to detect cytoplasmic huDysGFP, the signal is weak and the signal-to-noise ratio in single pixels or even small volumes is low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To address these issues, we increase the signal by increasing laser power and studying large areas (‘Materials and methods’). Under these conditions, we acquire a consistent signal both for GFP and huDysGFP. However, using a high laser power to image over large areas results in significant photobleaching during imaging, and, even at 100% laser power, bleaching is so slow that significant diffusion occurs during bleaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weiss, 2004</xref>). We compensate for both using a mathematical model applied to the FRAP experimental data (‘Materials and methods’). This was integrated in a user-friendly application written to allow easy data analysis of multiple experiments (see ‘Materials and methods’).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06541.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Bleaching areas: size optimization, orientation, and definition of Cartesian coordinates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Noise reduction in GFP FRAP curve for increasing areas: 1 (blue), 25 (red) and 256 (black) pixels.

We studied diffusion along the long axis of the muscle cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The selected fibre is oriented such that the image <italic>X</italic>-axis aligns to the fibre long axis (i.e., roughly anterior-posterior in the animal) and the <italic>Y</italic>-axis is dorso-ventral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>). In each cell, one or two large rectangles of different sizes (narrow and wide) were bleached, avoiding nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The bleached rectangles are shorter along the <italic>X</italic>-axis than in <italic>Y</italic> and cross the entire cell transversely. This makes recovery almost entirely due to mobility along the <italic>X</italic>-axis, simplifying modelling and fitting. We analyse the profile along the <italic>X</italic>-axis taken immediately after bleaching GFP-expressing fibres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This profile is not a top-hat but a Gaussian, much wider than the region actually bleached, consistent with diffusion during the bleaching phase. This diffusion is taken into account in the modelling as neglecting it would lead to significant error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">González-Pérez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Müller et al., 2012</xref>) (‘Materials and methods’).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06541.007</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Analysis of cytoplasmic diffusion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>D</bold>) FRAP experimental data and fitting curves.

The triangles are not far from falling on a straight line of slope one. The small cell-to-cell variation in huDysGFP, relative to the variation between cells suggests that the mobility of huDysGFP genuinely varies from one fibre to another. For GFP, there is no definite trend visible, just scatter, presumably due to lower signal-to-noise with the more rapid diffusion of GFP. It is, therefore, not clear whether the mobility of GFP varies significantly from one fibre to another.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06541.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06541.007</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06541-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>We fit the recovery for each individual case to obtain the diffusion constant (<italic>D</italic>) and a bleaching-due-to-imaging parameter (<italic>β</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

fibre. For most cells, two different size regions were bleached per fibre. The width of the bleached region in pixels is indicated for each data set (one pixel is 0.147 μm wide). Intentional bleaching was performed between time points 20 and 21. Two-parameter, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>β,</italic> fits were performed to long acquisition times, either to time points 21 to 200 (∼40 s) or time points 21 to 500 (∼110 s). One-parameter fits were also performed to only the initial recovery curve (points 21 to 50, or ∼7 s). For the latter fits, bleaching during imaging is too small to fit <italic>β</italic>, so we fix <italic>β</italic> = 0. Results of fits to FRAP curves for GFP and huDysGFP are presented for a model using either the actual fibre length and bleach position or with the standard length of 90 μm and a bleach position at 45 μm. Note that in most GFP cases, the difference between the fitted <italic>D</italic> values for standard and actual lengths and bleach positions is less than 1 μm<sup>2</sup>/s. This is smaller than our estimate of the uncertainties in these <italic>D</italic> values, which is several μm<sup>2</sup>/s. For huDysGFP, there was no difference within two significant figures. Due to the smaller diffusion constants of huDysGFP, varying the cell length within these limits makes no difference to the values of <italic>D</italic>. During a ∼30-s experiment, the bleached profile is not affected by a fibre tip ∼45 μm away, for values of <italic>D</italic> typical of huDysGFP. Values of <italic>D</italic> in the main text are obtained using all <italic>D</italic> values obtained for two-parameter fits to data to point 200, using model cells with the standard cell length and bleach position.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>We used the FRAP method described above to analyse cytoplasmic huDysGFP dynamics. The Dystrophin profile immediately after bleaching, similar to that of GFP, is not a top-hat but a Gaussian, wider than the region actually bleached, and consistent with diffusion during the bleaching phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). However, the Gaussian's amplitude is narrower and the depth greater for huDysGFP than GFP, consistent with slower diffusion (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>). Indeed, <italic>D</italic><sub>huDysGFP</sub> best-fit values (fitted to data over ∼40 s) ranged from 1.4 to 10.1 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, with a mean of 4.4 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Again, the Gaussian profile and our ability to fit a simple diffusion model to the recovery are strong evidence for huDysGFP diffusion, and rule out large scale (above μm) directed motion along the long axis of the cell, or significant binding of huDysGFP to immobile structures.</p><p>huDysGFP has significantly lower <italic>D</italic> than GFP, reflecting the different protein sizes of 454 kD and 27 kD, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, p &lt; 0.0001). By comparing narrow and wide bleaches in the same cell across our population of muscle fibres, we found that <italic>D</italic><sub>huDysGFP</sub> appears to vary between cells, that is, there is real variability in huDysGFP cytoplasmic dynamics from one cell to another. The difference between <italic>D</italic><sub>huDysGFP</sub> values for a pair of experiments in the same cell is significantly smaller than between values in different cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Pairs of <italic>D</italic> values obtained from the same cell are well correlated (<italic>R</italic><sub>huDysGFP</sub> = 0.9813; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This indicates that Dystrophin's diffusion in the cytoplasm shows important variations from cell to cell but that it is consistent within one cell. Further, this finding highlights the limitations of reducing noise by ‘pooling’ FRAP results from more than one cell. Therefore, each FRAP curve was analysed independently throughout this study and pooling was deliberately avoided. The original data and relevant analysis files for each case are available online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Bajanca et al., 2015</xref>) to complement representative examples shown in figures and main data summarised in tables. We conclude that, although there is fibre-specific variation of <italic>D</italic>, there is no evidence that cytoplasmic Dystrophin either binds cytoskeletal elements or is actively transported towards fibre tips.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Human Dystrophin is bound at muscle fibre tips</title><p>The fibre tip region presumably contains huDysGFP bound to the Dystroglycan complex at the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guyon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Böhm et al., 2008</xref>) and a portion diffusing in the adjacent cytoplasm. FRAP can test whether huDysGFP is able to bind stably at the tips and reveal binding dynamics, but this is a challenging task. Diffusion of cytoplasmic protein into the bleached area, combined with bleaching-due-to-imaging, masks the real binding dynamics. We tested diffusion-plus-binding models to analyse the tip FRAP curves but these require too many variables to be reliably fitted, reflecting the complexity of the binding dynamics, as will be shown. The relatively featureless, and noisy, recovery curves of in vivo FRAP within a complex tissue cannot adequately constrain this number of variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sadegh Zadeh et al., 2006</xref>). Instead, to understand human Dystrophin dynamics at the tip, we use direct semi-quantitative analysis of bleaching and recovery. A FRAP protocol that bleached only part of the tip allowed comparison of bleached and unbleached regions of the tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We combined this with analysis of the cytoplasm intensity near the tip in each cell to measure how much recovery to expect due to diffusion. In addition, recovery is followed at an initial fast acquisition rate to detect fast recovery, and then at a slower pace over longer time periods with reduced bleaching-due-to-imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06541.009</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Analysis of bound Dystrophin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) FRAP protocol for tips and schematic FRAP curves showing effect of bleaching-due-to-imaging at high and low imaging frequency.

First, there is only partial recovery in the bleached region of the tip regardless of the huDysGFP expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–F</xref>). Second, the normalized intensity difference between the unbleached and bleached regions in most tips (black crosses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>) reaches a plateau above zero (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). At the end of the experiment, both halves of the tip have received the same amount of light (and thus bleaching) for ∼250 s after the intentional bleaching phase, so the difference observed is created by the huDysGFP bleached earlier that did not turn over. Third, in the unbleached half of the tip, which receives the same bleaching-due-to-imaging as the cytoplasm, both the normalized and the absolute drops in intensity from start to end of the experiment are much larger than in the cytoplasm (compare drops in the tips with those in the cytoplasms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

Surprisingly, the FRAP curves revealed complex binding dynamics of Dystrophin at the tips that vary between fibres. We analysed the recovery pattern in the bleached region when switching to a slow acquisition regimen (transition from step 3 to 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Despite the very slow turnover that characterizes the immobile-bound pool at the tips, for many fibres there is an almost immediate partial recovery (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>). A shift of the dynamic equilibrium between dark-state and excitable GFP could result in apparent recovery following a switch to slow acquisition speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mueller et al., 2012</xref>). However, we verified that the extent to which this phenomenon occurs in huDysGFP could only justify a very small fraction of recovery (&lt;1%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We next evaluated the contribution of free diffusion of cytoplasmic huDysGFP into the bleached region, occurring as demonstrated with a <italic>D</italic> around 4 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. As the bleached region contains bound and unbound huDysGFP and both are subjected to bleaching, it is not straightforward to analyse the recovery against a control cytoplasmic region, which is not subjected to intentional bleaching. Therefore, we compared unbleached tip and cytoplasm traces, which were submitted to comparable experimental conditions, without intentional bleaching but with strong bleaching-due-to-imaging during the fast acquisition phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). On switching to slow acquisition, any recovery on the unbleached tip would be expected to parallel the recovery on the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, the immediate recovery is in most cases larger than that expected from diffusion of cytoplasmic huDysGFP despite a steady state is reached soon after, characteristic of the large immobile pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, compare open or hatched squares [unbleached tip] with the respective open or hatched triangles [cytoplasm]). In most cases, at least 50% of the total recovery of unnormalised unbleached minus cytoplasm curves occur within 10 s (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). This indicates that there is an unaccounted third pool of huDysGFP, in addition to the immobile-bound pool and the cytoplasmic-free diffusible pool: a rapidly turning-over dynamic bound huDysGFP pool.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06541.011</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Effect of dark state and lateral mobility on huDysGFP intensity recovery.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) To evaluate the recovery fraction due to dark state, huDysGFP was bleached in entire muscle fibres in vivo.

If the bound Dystrophin is mobile at the tip in the plane of the membrane, bleached bound huDysGFP would leave the deliberately bleached half of the tip and be replaced by fluorescent huDysGFP from the unbleached half. This would help drive fluorescence recovery and would be especially pronounced at the boundary between the bleached and unbleached halves of the tip, generating a gradient of fluorescence along the <italic>X</italic><sub>T</sub> axis. We see no evidence of such gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In particular, in the middle panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, although there is substantial recovery (compare the turquoise crosses with the immediately post-bleach orange triangles), there is no overall tendency in the intensity in the unbleached part of the tip to decrease from right to left as the bleached tip area is approached. The same applies to cases of little recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), where only substantial bleaching-due-to-imaging is observed on the unbleached tip half. The lack of evidence of lateral mobility of bound huDysGFP argues in favour of the existence of a bound-mobile pool with a fast turnover rate responsible for the fast fluorescence recovery observed in most fibres.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Human Dystrophin efficiently rescues zebrafish dystrophic embryos and two bound pools are still found in the absence of competition with endogenous Dystrophin</title><p>The experiments above were performed in wild-type zebrafish embryos.

In the absence of competition with the endogenous protein, huDysGFP appears to occupy more of the available binding sites, showing a 2.5-fold increase in the intensity ratio tips:cytoplasm compared to that found in wild-type background.

Regardless of the genotype, most tips show the three typical signatures of an immobile-bound population described above: only partial recovery in the tip bleached region independently of the cytoplasmic intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), the normalized intensity difference between the unbleached and bleached regions in most tips reaches a plateau above zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), and unbleached tip half intensity shows higher drop than the cytoplasm in the fast acquisition phase (see original curves in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Bajanca et al., 2015</xref>). Also regardless of the genotype, the tip intensity registers a rapid recovery that is uncharacteristic of an immobile fraction while higher than the estimated contribution of the cytoplasmic pool. Evidence is clear when comparing events on switching between fast and slow acquisition in the unbleached tip half and cytoplasm unnormalised intensity curves. At least 50% of the total recovery occurs within 10 s in most fibre tips, too fast for the immobile-bound pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).

Exogenous zfDysGFP is able to rescue the dystrophic phenotype in <italic>dmd</italic><sup><italic>ta222a/ta222a</italic></sup> mutants (32/32, p = 0.003; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Like huDysGFP, most zfDysGFP tips show the typical signatures of an immobile-bound population regardless of the genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). There are no statistically significant differences between the fractional recoveries of Dystrophin of the different species and in the different genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). However, the final unbleached minus bleached intensity of huDysGFP is statistically significantly lower than zfDysGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). Using a two-way ANOVA to test the effect of genotypic background (wild-type or <italic>dmd</italic><sup><italic>ta222a/ta222a</italic></sup>) and Dystrophin origin (human or zebrafish) on the immobile fraction, we observed a significant effect of Dystrophin origin (human vs zebrafish) [F(1,87) = 11.21, p = 0.0012] but not of the host genotype [F(1,87) = 0.02326, p = 0.8791], and there was no significant interaction between origin and genotype [F(1,87) = 1.367, p = 0.2455]. While a final unbleached minus bleached intensity above zero indicates the existence of an immobile-bound fraction, its value is not a direct measurement of the amount of immobile-bound Dystrophin. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that huDysGFP forms less, or less stable, immobile-bound links than zfDysGFP, in the zebrafish environment. The background genotype appears not to influence this trait, suggesting that if there is a difference in the immobile fraction that is independent from competition with endogenous Dystrophin.</p><p>Like huDysGFP, most zfDysGFP-expressing fibres show a fast recovery phase that is higher than the estimated contribution of the cytoplasmic pool. Typically, at least 50% of the total recovery of unbleached tip half minus cytoplasm intensity curves occurs within 10 s in the majority of the cases, regardless of species and genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). This recovery is very fast and the characteristic immobile pool plateau is soon reached, suggesting the existence of an additional bound pool of zfDysGFP with rapid turnover. These results show that, like huDysGFP, zfDysGFP can be found in three populations, one diffusible and two bound with different binding lifetimes. Therefore, regardless of any differences between huDysGFP and zfDysGFP, our results confirm that the mobile-bound pool previously found for the human Dystrophin is not caused by weaker interactions with a different species environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin diffusion and binding dynamics</title><p>Analysis of FRAP curves of both huDysGFP and zfDysGFP indicated that when a low level of diffusible Dystrophin is detected in cytoplasm, there can be a significant amount of bound-mobile pool. However, there is the possibility that the labile-bound pool is caused by an excess of cytoplasmic Dystrophin resulting from overexpression. We questioned whether a mobile-bound pool can also be found in endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin, where a cytoplasmic pool of the protein is not known.

As every muscle fibre expresses Citrine-tagged Dystrophin (zfDysCitrine; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>), and different tissues may have different background fluorescence, it is not easy to evaluate with confidence whether there are low levels of cytoplasmic zfDysCitrine above the background. We hypothesized that if there is zfDysCitrine in the cytoplasm, we should register a recovery after photobleaching. Control siblings lacking zfDysCitrine show a flat and noisy FRAP curve that reflects the background fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, plot a). In contrast, the very low zfDysCitrine intensity detected in the cytoplasm could be bleached to even lower levels, and a recovery curve is registered, indicating the presence of diffusible zfDysCitrine in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, plot b). The switch from a dark state of Citrine was evaluated and contributes little to the recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, plot c).

This suggests the presence of a mobile-bound pool, regardless of the statistically significant difference in the time it takes for zfDysCitrine and zfDysGFP to recover (p = 0.0016). The tendency to take longer to recover is likely to reflect the dependency of the mobile-bound pool on cytoplasmic availability of free Dystrophin. This is in accordance with our previous observations that recovery of the mobile-bound pool is fast enough that it may be limited by diffusion. The data therefore indicate that endogenous Dystrophin with an inserted Citrine, like exogenous zfDysGFP and huDysGFP, can be found in two states, immobile and mobile, regardless of a very low, but detectable, cytoplasmic pool.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Altogether, our results show that Dystrophin can exist in three populations in muscle cells in vivo: one freely diffusing in the cytoplasm, a second stably anchored at the plasma membrane that shows no lateral diffusion, and a third, dynamically bound to the plasma membrane. A stable-bound pool is consistent with Dystrophin's well-described function of sustaining mechanical stability upon muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Levine et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ervasti and Campbell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rybakova et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2000</xref>). Additionally, the presence of a dynamic pool with weak and short-term binding points to a new aspect of Dystrophin biology. Based on these results, we propose a model for Dystrophin association with the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Even very low levels of freely diffusible cytoplasmic Dystrophin can stochastically bind to molecules at the plasma membrane, entering a mobile-bound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, arrows). This may represent an intermediate state towards Dystrophin stabilization, possibly more abundant in the immature fibres of the developing embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, dashed arrow 1). Alternatively, Dystrophin may coexist in two distinct bound forms with specific roles, possibly reflecting the mature state of the membrane association.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06541.018</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Model for Dystrophin membrane association.</title><p>Dystrophin is present in three states: cytoplasmic, bound mobile, and bound immobile.

Furthermore, exogenous zebrafish and human Dystrophin have diffusion and binding dynamics similar to those of endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin, in spite of the artificially raised cytoplasmic levels caused by over-expression. Furthermore, we found that Dystrophin dynamics is not affected by the position of the fluorescent tag (internally close to the actin binding site [Citrine] or in C-terminal position [GFP]). Importantly, both zebrafish and human Dystrophins were able to rescue the dystrophic phenotype of <italic>dmd</italic><sup><italic>ta222a/ta222a</italic></sup> embryos. Taken together, these data indicate that the zebrafish embryo is a good model system to study the dynamics of human Dystrophin in live muscle cells in vivo using fluorescently tagged versions of the protein. It is important to keep in mind that human Dystrophin may behave differently in zebrafish than in human muscle. The FRAP analysis methodology developed in this study could be applied for studies on human primary muscle cell cultures, or even pluripotent human stem cells differentiated into muscle fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chal et al., 2015</xref>). However, until a suitable 3D ex-vivo physiologically relevant human muscle system is readily available for routine experimentation, our methodology and findings provide a baseline for future comparative studies.

However, whereas GFP is a small (3 × 3 × 4 nm) globular protein, Dystrophin is thought to be a rod perhaps 100 nm long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pons et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arrio-Dupont et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhasin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kameta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kinsey et al., 2011</xref>), so a diffusion constant only a quarter that of GFP is surprising. As Dystrophin appears to diffuse, perhaps so-called ‘active diffusion’ due to energy-using cellular processes (e.g., molecular motors) enhances its apparent mobility in a non-directed manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brangwynne et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weber et al., 2012</xref>). As whole Dystrophin structure has not been reported, one can imagine that a compact rapidly diffusing Dystrophin conformation may account for Dystrophin dynamics in vivo. For now, it is not known whether cytoplasmic Dystrophin also exists in low amounts in adult human skeletal muscle cells. However, many studies have shown that, in human embryos and foetuses, Dystrophin first appears in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wessels et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clerk et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chevron et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mora et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Torelli et al., 1999</xref>).

The dynamic mobile-bound pool is found in fibres with undetectably low levels of cytoplasmic huDysGFP, zfDysGFP, or endogenously-driven zfDysCitrine, indicating that the mobile-bound state occurs independently of over-expression or high level cytoplasmic accumulation.</p><p>A proportion of the Dystrophin located at muscle fibre tips is in free exchange with the cytoplasmic diffusible pool, whereas a further portion binds stably at muscle fibre tips. Whether this immobile pool is generated by stabilisation of the mobile-bound pool, or by another route, remains to be determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). It is not clear whether the dynamics of early tip-localised Dystrophin is different from the later costameric Dystrophin. The tip region of zebrafish muscle fibres corresponds to myotendinous junction at the ends of human muscle fibres, where Dystrophin is also found enriched in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhao et al., 1992</xref>) and in several other mammals, namely mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Samitt and Bonilla, 1990</xref>), rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kääriäinen et al., 2000</xref>), and guinea pig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Masuda et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>The immobile Dystrophin pool at the cell tips is bound tightly enough to transmit significant (10 pN/molecule) forces for significant (1 s) times, enough to unfold Dystrophin's spectrin domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhasin et al., 2005</xref>). Dystrophin in the bound mobile pool presumably cannot transmit significant force. However, weak binding would allow response to weak short-lived (sub-pN/molecule, sub-second) forces or may fulfil another function, such as structure assembly, sensing, or signalling. Interestingly, studies of mutants of ezrin, which, like Dystrophin, binds both β-dystroglycan and actin, revealed immobile and mobile membrane bound forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coscoy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spence et al., 2004</xref>). The dynamic membrane-bound ezrin was suggested to be an intermediate conformation state leading to actin anchoring and full complex assembly. Similarly, it is possible that Dystrophin binding to β-dystroglycan facilitates a conformation change to promote actin binding and stabilization of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedel et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Membrane localization, turnover, and clustering of other adhesion molecules such as cadherins is known to be influenced by the tension experienced by the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Delanoë-Ayari et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yonemura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Beco et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it would be interesting to investigate whether muscle contraction might favour the conversion of some of the mobile-bound or cytoplasmic Dystrophin into immobile Dystrophin.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>mRNA accumulation at the tip of muscle cells</title><p>Our expression vectors contain a CMV promoter that drives human and zebrafish Dystrophin expression throughout the fish. Nonetheless, we observed that muscle cells accumulate Dystrophin protein much more frequently than other cell types, suggesting that human Dystrophin stabilization is tissue dependent. The availability of suitable docking sites or specific partner proteins may play a role in stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Le Rumeur et al., 1804</xref>). In addition, sub-cellular accumulation of the mRNA itself may contribute to Dystrophin positioning at the tip. Like zebrafish Dystrophin mRNA, RNA encoding human Dystrophin localized near the tips of fibres. The expression constructs engineered in the present study do not contain the Dystrophin 5′- or 3′-UTR or introns. Instead, the coding sequence is preceded by a standard chimaeric intron. While previous studies showed a role for 5′ and 3′ UTR regions into controlling tissue-specific expression and transcriptional regulation of Dystrophin (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Larsen and Howard, 2014</xref> and references therein), our results show that UTR regions are dispensable for accumulation of the mRNA at the tip. It is therefore unlikely that Dystrophin RNA accumulation at the tips is due to specific RNA transport since that would most likely require the presence of the untranslated regions (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kloc et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holt and Bullock, 2009</xref>). Thus, the signals controlling the correct localization of the mRNA remain unclear. One possibility is anchorage by numerous nascent protein chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). This might then facilitate transition of Dystrophin into the strongly bound form.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Transferring the present model to general studies on protein dynamics</title><p>The new analysis methods developed here broaden the applications of FRAP. Specifically, our modelling overcomes low signal-to-noise ratios and accounts for diffusion during intentional bleaching and unintentional bleaching during imaging. Bleaching due to imaging is here used to analyse binding dynamics. Indeed, at the high laser powers needed in vivo a specific bleaching step may not be necessary, or even optimal. These advances may be generally valuable for studies of embryos and thick tissues or biomaterials by allowing higher laser powers. Also, our results show that pooling results from different cells in a complex in vivo environment may lead to error and mask individual cell-to-cell variability. Finally, our model for one-dimensional diffusion may be especially useful in elongated cells such as muscle cells or neurons. The model was implemented in open-source software that fits diffusion coefficients to data without programming (‘Materials and methods’). Our methodology may have general application for analysis of protein dynamics in vivo.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study reveals for the first time the complex dynamics of Dystrophin in maturing muscle cells within the intact animal. It reveals important cell-to-cell variations that most likely reflect fibre or tip maturation but could have another origin. Both developmental state and genetic background are thus expected to influence the stability of Dystrophin, which could prove important in the clinic. Unstable binding or overall shortage of a specific pool may affect Dystrophin turnover and muscle performance. In future, the methodology developed here can be used to test for the comparative performance of short Dystrophin forms in use in gene therapy trials, with the aim of focusing on stable versions that may favour a more successful clinical outcome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression plasmids</title><p>Full-length 427-kd human Dystrophin (huDys) was produced by generating a human Dystrophin cDNA using long-range PCR (primers F1: SpeI_GACTAGTGTGTTCTTCATATGTATATCCTTCC; R1: MluI_CGACGCGTCATTGTGTCCTCTCTCATTG), digested with SpeI and MluI and cloned into pCI plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI, United States) downstream of a CMV promoter at the NheI and MluI restriction sites.

(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). One box is intentionally bleached (bleached tip), while the other is imaged in an identical way but not intentionally bleached (unbleached tip). A region of similar size in the cytoplasm at a distance from the bright tip region is also analysed. For all regions, the background is subtracted and time points 4 to 20 are used to generate an initial pre-bleach average image for normalization, as for the cytoplasmic studies described above. The background-subtracted intensity is assumed to be proportional to Dystrophin concentration. To understand Dystrophin dynamics at the tip, and to distinguish between different bound populations, direct semi-quantitative analysis of bleaching and recovery is used. FRAP data are analysed in three ways:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Direct analysis of the FRAP curve for the bleached half of the tip. Lack of recovery is strong evidence of immobility on the timescale of the experiment. Rapid, but partial, recovery, are indicative signatures of a mobile pool and an immobile pool.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Comparative analysis of unnormalized intensities in the unbleached tip region and cytoplasm. Photobleaching due to imaging lowers the final intensity; this effect and a small immobile pool may be indistinguishable. To counter this problem, the identical photobleaching-due-to-imaging received by the unbleached tip region and cytoplasm is used to probe the dynamics. Unnormalized intensity plots (background-subtracted) allow direct comparison of the amount that is unintentionally bleached and then recovers in the tip and the cytoplasm. Presumably, the size of the cytoplasmic component in a tip pixel is at most equal to that in a cytoplasmic pixel, and its FRAP dynamics are similar. Therefore, a permanent drop in tip intensity that is much larger than the drop in the cytoplasmic intensity indicates a large immobile pool. In addition, a dip for the tip signal that is much larger than that in the cytoplasm, and that rapidly recovers, indicates that there is a dynamic bound pool at that tip. Analysis of unnormalized minus cytoplasm intensity curves evaluates if at least 50% of the final recovery occurred at the first or second time points after switching from fast to slow (every 10 s) acquisition rates.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Analysis of the difference between bleached and unbleached tip regions. Both regions of the tip receive the same bleaching-due-to-imaging for ∼250 s.

However, if the difference is close to zero, then any bound species is dynamic on this timescale.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Whole cell bleaching and evaluation of recovery fraction due to dark state</title><p>Tests were made to evaluate whether bleaching may cause a significant portion of huDysGFP to enter a transient dark state, which then contributes to the fractional recovery after photobleaching. Typically, huDysGFP was bleached in an entire muscle fibre in vivo. Cells expressing high levels (including in the cytoplasm) were chosen to allow better detection of potential low levels of a dark-state pool. Bleaching was performed using the Argon laser at 100%, at which intensity we measured a direct laser power of 0.39–0.5 mW. To image the whole cell, a 20×/1.0 W Plan-Apochromat (Zeiss) objective was used. Due to the size of a muscle cell, similar tests bleaching the entire cell are not possible to perform using exactly the same conditions as in our FRAP experiments, where a 40×/0.8 Achroplan (Zeiss) objective was used. However, the laser power per area is higher in the conditions we use both in cytoplasmic and tips FRAP experiments, which is demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mueller et al.

Your full submission has been evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior Editor) and three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Although all reviewers concur on the novelty and potential relevance of your work, major concerns were raised on the experiments performed to support your conclusions. In particular the over-expression of human dystrophin in a wt zebrafish, which already produces its own dystrophin, was considered as a potential cause for the cytoplasmic pool. Moreover, the differences between the human and the fish protein may be at the basis of the different membrane bound pools.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a well written and executed work that proposes a novel, exciting and potentially very important new mechanism of dystrophin localisation and dynamics inside the muscle fibre. Given the relevance of the conclusions deriving from this work, it is essential that possible biological artefacts be ruled out. Unfortunately they are not.</p><p>The major concern is the fact that a human protein is over-expressed in a remotely distant species. Therefore to validate the conclusions, it would be important to know:</p><p>1) What are the level of expression of total dystrophin (zebrafish + human) in the fish and how many times it exceeds the wt level? A WB analysis of total dystrophin would have clarified the level of overexpression. The cytoplasmic pool may be simply a consequence of the over expression and may not exist in a wt animal. Moreover, in order to conclusively demonstrate that human dystrophin functionally replaces the fish counterparts, experiments should have been performed in dystrophic zebrafish embryos, with the double advantage to be able to modulate the level of expression to wt levels and, equally important, to demonstrate that human dystrophin rescues muscular dystrophy in the fish. The authors mention that human dystrophin rescues muscular dystrophy in the fish only as “unpublished” in the Discussion. While it is understandable that they may want to publish these data separately, the problem of level of expression remains.</p><p>2) Even though human dystrophin localises like its zebrafish counterpart, the spatial organization is significantly different in the embryos of two species as is the overall muscle structure. Moreover, accumulation at the muscle fibre tip is not observed in human muscle and this is a matter of concern to extrapolate that what observed in the zebrafish also occurs in human muscle. To conclusively demonstrate this, the experiments should be repeated in a well-differentiated DMD muscle fibre in vitro, as it is now possible to obtain with biomaterials and stretching. While this would be a completely new work and it would be unfair to ask to include all this work in this paper, the concern on extrapolating these data to human muscle remains and bears consequences on the design of dystrophin replacement strategies in patients.</p><p>3) Although all the proteins interacting with dystrophin are well conserved during vertebrate evolution, there is no evidence in the paper that rules out that the bound mobile dystrophin pool may be the consequence of a weaker interaction of human dystrophin with fish complex proteins and may not exist in human cells, or even in the zebrafish embryo expressing a wt level of the fish protein.</p><p>Because of these major biological concerns, publication of the article in its present form is not recommended, since the intriguing and important conclusions of this work are not validated by the data presented.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors propose a novel hypothesis according to which a large fraction of Dystrophin is present in a soluble cytoplasmic form. However, the whole study is based on unsupported and possibly erroneous assumptions that human Dystrophin, fused to GFP tag, and over-expressed in zebrafish myofibres, is functionally and kinetically equivalent to the native protein.</p><p>First, it is important to consider that zebrafish and human Dystrophin differ at amino acid level and hence the affinity of the human protein might be lower to its binding partners at the zebrafish sarcolemma. This can lead to the accumulation of the human protein in the zebrafish myofibre cytoplasm. Indeed, the data presented in the manuscript tends to support this, as the authors did not detect any endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin in the cytoplasm. It might be due to undetectable level in the cytoplasm, as the authors hypothesize. However, if this is the case, then it should be proven by cell fractionating and biochemical methods.</p><p>Second, all the conclusions rely on using an overexpression plasmid that is controlled by viral promoter. It is probable that there are limited binding sites for Dystrophin at the cell membrane and such overexpression system would lead to the accumulation of protein in the cytosol. In fact, the authors show that at low expression level they could not find Dystrophin-GFP in the cytoplasm. Expression driven by endogenous promoter would have eliminated all these concerns (i.e. BAC transgenic fish).</p><p>Third, the authors fail to show whether the C-terminal GFP tag alters Dystrophin kinetics. Although GFP size is small relative to Dystrophin, it is large enough to alter binding affinity to other proteins. While GFP-tagged human Dystrophin can rescue dystrophic zebrafish in short-term experiments, then this do not require native protein kinetics. Control experiments with N-terminal tag would have been essential. Especially considering that the C-terminus of Dystrophin is located towards the membrane bound dystroglycan complex and the addition of GFP could have weakened the interaction of the fusion protein with it.</p><p>Fourth, as it appears from the Materials and methods section, the area that was bleached in FRAP was significantly lager in the cytoplasm than at the membrane. Yet, one cannot compare two regions with different size as diffusion occurs faster in a smaller area. By using a small bleached area at the membrane one would overestimate protein diffusion there in comparison to much larger bleached area in the cytoplasm.</p><p>In sum, it is possible that Dystrophin can be present in the cytoplasm, but the manuscript fails to provide convincing experimental support for this. Correct analysis of Dystrophin kinetics in zebrafish would require complete restructuring of the work, focusing on the kinetics of the native protein, preferably in its original genomic location. Biochemical and cell biology experiments can be implemented to study Dystrophin in human muscle fibres. In either case this would involve a significant amount of work and this reviewer cannot see a possibility to recommend the current study for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes a very interesting investigation of the mobility of dystrophin within developing muscles of the zebra fish embryo. Although the functional equivalencies of this protein in the two species are not precisely matched, the visual accessibility provided by the zebra fish system provide a unique opportunity to examine the behaviour of this protein at the molecular level. The general validity of the approach is justified by a comparison of the distribution of the labelled human dystrophin with that of the endogenous zebra fish dystrophin. The investigation of the mobility of labelled dystrophin protein is a heavily modified version of the standard recovery from bleaching technique for measuring protein mobility.</p><p>The outcome is the conclusion that there is little lateral diffusion or other movement within the membrane-bound dystrophin compartment, most restoration of dystrophin to sites of bleached membrane occurring by interchange with the much larger cytoplasmic compartment. The other main conclusion is that there are two bound states of dystrophin, a strong slowly exchanging state, presumed to be in strong association with other proteins of the membrane complex and a more rapidly exchanging state the nature of whose binding is uncertain.</p><p>Overall, the investigation is interesting, carefully performed, controlled and interpreted. It provides new information that, with due allowance for the differences between the model of developing zebra fish muscle and postnatal human muscle in which it the object of medical interest, usefully enhances our understanding of its functional properties.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for your letter appealing our initial decision. We have consulted among the editors and would be willing to encourage the submission of a revised manuscript, though we cannot guarantee the final outcome.</p><p>In your letter you stated two main points that addressed two of three major concerns. However we believe that you may also have or can easily produce data to address the third and final important concern. Specifically:</p><p>1) You stated clearly (but this was not in the first version) that the cytoplasmic pool might well be an artifact due to over expression. Once this is made clear there is no longer the risk to mislead the reader about a physiologically significant pool of soluble dystrophin.</p><p>2) You proposed to insert the rescue of the dystrophic fish by human dystrophin. A careful analysis of the resulting phenotype would strengthen the work considerably.</p><p>3) The third concern that you do not address in your letter relates to possible different binding kinetics between fish and human proteins. This is important because the labile membrane bound pool may be a consequence of this difference. If you have performed, as control, rescue of dystrophic fish by fish dystrophin and you also see the two pools, that would be sufficient to rule out a species difference. Ideally one would like to see the same also in human cells but we understand that this would be a whole new set of experiments that you may not be in a position to do. If the fish data can be provided, then just a word of caution in the discussion, as to the fact the final confirmation of the two pools in human muscle awaits experiments in human cells should acknowledge the unlikely possibility that things may be different in human.</p><p>Therefore, if you think you can address the three major points raised we would be happy to reconsider the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06541.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[Editors’ note: this article was originally rejected after discussions between the reviewers, but the authors were invited to resubmit after an appeal against the decision</italic>.<italic>]</italic></p><p>We are pleased to read that the reviewers agree on the novelty and potential relevance of our work, and understand the major concerns that lead to the rejection decision. However, each of the major concerns is based on a wrong assumption that we would like to challenge.</p><p>Firstly, it is not true to say that zebrafish Dystrophin is located differently from human Dystrophin and that this gives grounds to worry about the relevance of our work to humans. We present below extensive bibliographic evidence of the similar distribution of human and zebrafish Dystrophins. While, of course, work in a model organism cannot be thoughtlessly applied to humans, it has nevertheless proved highly relevant in many areas of biomedicine. Secondly, it is incorrect to suppose, as Reviewer 2 seems to do, that we regard the observed cytoplasmic pool of Dystrophin as a key feature of our findings. We obviously did not explain clearly enough, for which we apologize. Like Reviewer 2, we think the large cytoplasmic pool present in some fibres is simply an artefact of over-expression. Nevertheless, we showed that the size of the cytoplasmic pool does not determine Dystrophin binding dynamics, and specifically, does not determine our new weakly membrane-bound Dystrophin pool. Thirdly, Reviewers 1 and 2 both thought we needed to demonstrate functional relevance. We now have data showing that human Dystrophin-GFP rescues the fish <italic>dmd</italic> mutant phenotype cell autonomously at a single fibre level. While these new extended functional data were previously intended to form a second manuscript, we would be willing to add them to the present manuscript if a resubmission were allowed.</p><p>Please find below a more detailed refutation of the major criticisms by reviewers 1 and 2 that includes new data to support our claims. Reviewer 3 is very positive and does not present any major criticism.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) What are the level of expression of total dystrophin (zebrafish + human) in the fish and how many times it exceeds the wt level? A WB analysis of total dystrophin would have clarified the level of overexpression</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for this comment. We have addressed this point. Unfortunately, western blots are not relevant as our expression is intentionally mosaic in single isolated cells to permit FRAP. In addition, note that immunostaining using MANDRA1 antibody, which recognizes a conserved epitope on both human and zebrafish Dystrophins, does not show increased accumulation at the ends of fibres containing huDysGFP compared with adjacent fibres lacking huDysGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, the presence of excess cytoplasmic huDysGFP likely displaces some of the endogenous Dystrophin, rather than forcing extra binding sites to form. Further, the huDysGFP intensity in the whole fibre and locally at the fibre tips was measured in wild-type embryos (where it coexists with the endogenous Dystrophin) and in <italic>dmd</italic><sup><italic>ta222a</italic></sup> dystrophic embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). In the absence of competition with the endogenous protein, huDysGFP can occupy all the available binding sites, showing a 2.5 fold increase in the intensity ratio tips:cytoplasm comparing with that found in wild-type background. Or, in different words, fibres expressing the same intensity in the cytoplasm can accumulate more at the fibre ends in the mutant background. This nicely shows that our experiments in the wild type background were made in non-saturating conditions. Moreover, we have repeated the key FRAP experiments in the dystrophic background and our analysis found no differences regarding the cytoplasmic pool or the mobile and immobile bound fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; Results section “Human Dystrophin efficiently rescues zebrafish dystrophic embryos and two bound pools are still found in the absence of competition with endogenous Dystrophin”).</p><p><italic>The cytoplasmic pool may be simply a consequence of the over expression and may not exist in a wt animal</italic>.</p><p>We do agree that most of the cytoplasmic Dystrophin that accumulates in highly expressing fibres is a consequence of the over expression. We now make this point clear both in the Results and Discussion sections. However, the existence of a cytoplasmic pool does not invalidate our results. Firstly, our data rules out that the size of the cytoplasmic pool affects the overall binding (see Results section “Increase of cytoplasmic Dystrophin does not affect accumulation at the fibre tips”). Secondly, the weakly-bound Dystrophin pool can be found in fibres with no detectable or very low levels of cytoplasmic unbound huDysGFP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), and cells with high cytoplasmic huDysGFP intensity do not necessarily recover more (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). This implicates that the size of the cytoplasmic pool does not determine the weakly-bound Dystrophin pool.</p><p>Furthermore, we have now added the FRAP analysis of endogenously-driven zebrafish Dystrophin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>; Results section “Endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin diffusion and binding dynamics”). Our results show clearly that there are low levels of endogenous cytoplasmic Dystrophin in muscle fibres of <italic>Gt(dmd-citrine)</italic><sup><italic>ct90a</italic></sup> zebrafish embryos, in which the endogenous gene was tagged by a gene trap. We demonstrate that endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin also shows the characteristic two bound pools at the membrane.</p><p>Importantly, note that the observed accumulation in the cytoplasm mimics the expression pattern observed in embryonic/foetal human muscle fibres. Wessels and colleagues showed that in human embryos Dystrophin first appears in the <italic>cytoplasm</italic>, at the <italic>ends of myotubes</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wessels et al., 1991</xref>, ). It then becomes widespread throughout the myofibres in foetal stages (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wessels et al., 1991</xref>), becoming restricted to the sarcolemma only in maturing and adult muscles. Several other studies from different labs and using a wide range of different antibodies (including some of the most extensively used nowadays like DYS-1, DYS-2, DYS-3) confirm the initial cytoplasmic accumulation in human embryos and that the level of internal staining declines with age and is considerably lower in adult muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clerk et al., 1992</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chevron et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mora et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Torellia et al., 1999</xref>). Interestingly, a cytoplasmic Dystrophin pool was also found in regenerating muscle fibres (e.g., Kääriäinen et al., Neuromuscul Disord. 2000), in differencing human primary muscle cultures (e.g., Miranda et al., Am J Pathol. 1988) and in the adult heart (e.g, Peri et al., Mol Cell Biochem. 1994). Therefore, even though there are cases in our study where large amounts of Dystrophin accumulate in the cytoplasm due to overexpression, it is very likely that baseline biological levels are present in most cells, at least in the embryonic context that we study here.</p><p><italic>Moreover, in order to conclusively demonstrate that human dystrophin functionally replaces the fish counterparts, experiments should have been performed in dystrophic zebrafish embryos, with the double advantage to be able to modulate the level of expression to wt levels and, equally important, to demonstrate that human dystrophin rescues muscular dystrophy in the fish. The authors mention that human dystrophin rescues muscular dystrophy in the fish only as “unpublished” in the Discussion. While it is understandable that they may want to publish these data separately, the problem of level of expression remains</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We are happy to include the analysis of human Dystrophin expression in dystrophic fish (<italic>dmd</italic><sup><italic>ta222a/ta222a</italic></sup>). We show that exogenous human Dystrophin efficiently rescues the dystrophic phenotype indicating that human Dystrophin is fully functional within fish muscle cells and analyse Dystrophin binding dynamics in rescued DMD fibres by FRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; Results section “Human Dystrophin efficiently rescues zebrafish dystrophic embryos and two bound pools are still found in the absence of competition with endogenous Dystrophin”). We find no differences between the dynamics of huDysGFP in wild type embryos and in DMD embryos. This result indicates that the competition with endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin in the original wild-type host embryos was not the cause of the mobile-bound Dystrophin pool we observed.</p><p><italic>2) Even though human dystrophin localises like its zebrafish counterpart, the spatial organization is significantly different in the embryos of two species as is the overall muscle structure. Moreover, accumulation at the muscle fibre tip is not observed in human muscle and this is a matter of concern to extrapolate that what observed in the zebrafish also occurs in human muscle. To conclusively demonstrate this, the experiments should be repeated in a well-differentiated DMD muscle fibre in vitro, as it is now possible to obtain with biomaterials and stretching. While this would be a completely new work and it would be unfair to ask to include all this work in this paper, the concern on extrapolating these data to human muscle remains and bears consequences on the design of dystrophin replacement strategies in patients</italic>.</p><p>This is indeed a very interesting point. However, we respectfully disagree with the reviewer argument that there are key differences between our observations and the reality of Dystrophin localisation in human muscles that render our data on human Dystrophin in fish cells irrelevant. In the original submission, it was our mistake not to properly highlight the similarity between human and zebrafish Dystrophin localisations, when both cell location and developmental stage are taken into account. Human Dystrophin localises in zebrafish embryonic muscles just as it localises in human embryonic muscles. As already mentioned above, several studies showed that in human embryos and foetuses Dystrophin first appears in the <italic>cytoplasm</italic>, at the ends of myotubes and then widespread, before becoming restricted to the sarcolemma (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wessels et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clerk et al., 1992</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chevron et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mora et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Torelli et al., 1999</xref>). In the original study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wessels et al (1991)</xref> said that “The sarcoplasmic localization in embryonic and fetal tissue and the sarcolemmal localization of dystrophin in mature muscle <italic>suggests the accumulation of dystrophin in the cytoplasm prior to its integration into the membrane</italic>.” The same group also detected cytoplasmic accumulation in an aborted Duchenne foetus, with antibodies against N-terminal Dystrophin (Ginjaar et al., 1989). While at the time they did not have the tools available to test their hypothesis, our results confirm the existence of a cytoplasmic pool of dystrophin in embryonic muscle cells. It would be nice to be able to analyse this cytoplasmic pool directly in human muscle cells. We now mention this point in the Discussion. We believe it is advantageous to analyse Dystrophin dynamics in developing muscle fibres in the embryo, where binding complexes are actively forming. In the adult, there are presumably more stable complexes with a slower turnover and the discrete details of the assembly mechanism may become harder to spot. However, in human DMD therapy situations the complexes will be forming de novo in existing and nascent regenerating fibres.</p><p>Regarding regenerating fibres, relevant in the DMD context, it was shown that the localisation of Dystrophin <italic>recapitulates that found during embryonic muscle development</italic> during regeneration of rat muscles in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kääriäinen et al., 2000</xref>) and again in differentiation of human primary muscle cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miranda et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Torelli et al., 1999</xref>). In both cases Dystrophin starts by localising in the cytoplasm before incorporating the membrane complexes. Moreover, Dystrophin <italic>was found enriched at the at the myotendinous junction (MTJ) localised at the fibre tip region in human muscle biopsies</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhao et al., 1992</xref>; Note the antibodies used are still among the most widely used to these days) and in <italic>several other mammals</italic>, namely mouse (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Samitt &amp; Bonilla, 1990</xref>), rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kääriäinen et al., 2000</xref>), and guinea pig (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Masuda et al., 1992</xref> ). The fact that most studies focus on the costameres expression (which is commonly all that can be observed in a biopsy as surgeons do not perform biopsies near tendons) may in fact contribute to an incomplete view of the biology of Dystrophin in human cells. However, we would like to stress that as our data stands, we do not make direct extrapolations to the human muscle or DMD patients, but the working model arising from our data raises new questions and opens a new avenue for more applied research to follow. We added a statement to the Discussion acknowledging the importance of confirming the dynamics of human Dystrophin in human cells in future studies. We also integrate better the literature on dystrophin in human cells to make it clearer that what we observe in our experimental system fits with previous studies in embryonic and regenerating human muscles (Introduction and Discussion sections).</p><p><italic>3) Although all the proteins interacting with dystrophin are well conserved during vertebrate evolution, there is no evidence in the paper that rules out that the bound mobile dystrophin pool may be the consequence of a weaker interaction of human dystrophin with fish complex proteins and may not exist in human cells, or even in the zebrafish embryo expressing a wt level of the fish protein</italic>.</p><p>We completely agree with this comment and have addressed it in two ways. First, we made a new expression construct to exogenously express GFP-tagged zebrafish Dystrophin. This construct was expressed in both wild-type and dystrophic embryos and the binding dynamics were analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>; Results section “Two bound populations also characterize the dynamics of zebrafish Dystrophin-GFP”). The two bound pools are present in both genetic backgrounds, confirming that the mobile-bound pool is not a consequence of a different binding kinetics between human and zebrafish proteins. However, there was still the possibility that the mobile-bound pool was due to the over-expression strategy. Therefore, our second approach was to perform FRAP analysis of endogenously-driven zebrafish Dystrophin As mentioned in the reply to point 1, this mobile-bound form is also found in muscle fibres of <italic>Gt(dmd-citrine)</italic><sup><italic>ct90a</italic></sup> zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>; Results section “Endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin diffusion and binding dynamics”). We believe that these new experiments, together with the clear acknowledgment of the importance of confirming the dynamics of human Dystrophin in human cells in future studies that we now add to the Discussion bring our manuscript closer to the expectations of the reviewer.</p><p>Considering this is the first study of Dystrophin dynamics in vivo we cannot know if Dystrophin behaves similarly in all species and all developmental stages, but the question is raised. The FRAP analysis developed for this work can now be used to analyse human Dystrophin dynamics in primary muscle cell cultures, or even pluripotent human stem cells differentiated into muscle fibres. However, to perform these experiments in human cells is no trivial task. It will be necessary to transfect the full-length human Dystrophin, or to modify the endogenous <italic>dmd</italic> locus to insert a fluorescent tag, and then to study well-differentiated muscle fibres in vitro, for example by using biomaterials and stretching techniques as suggested by this reviewer. Ideally, 3D cultures with muscle-tendon attachments and innervations would guarantee more reliable results. We believe this first study of Dystrophin dynamics on the zebrafish embryo shows thought-provoking results and sets up a methodology that may now be used to explore further the implications of the proposed model.</p><p>Taking into consideration this evidence, we believe that we now provide the main technical controls asked by the reviewer. Importantly, we also better integrate the literature on dystrophin in human cells to make it clearer that what we observe in our experimental system fits with the proposed dynamics of dystrophin in embryonic and regenerating human muscles.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>The authors propose a novel hypothesis according to which a large fraction of Dystrophin is present in a soluble cytoplasmic form</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for this comment, which highlighted the fact that we had been unclear in our original submission. We do not regard the observed cytoplasmic pool of Dystrophin as a key feature of our findings. We think the large cytoplasmic pool present in some fibres is simply an artefact of over-expression. This is now made clear both in the Results and Discussion sections. Yet, since this large cytoplasmic pool is present we had to take it into account in the analysis. We show that this pool exist in a smaller scale in the endogenous situation (citrine fish, please see below) and that the two membrane form of dystrophin are still detectable regardless of the amount of cytoplasmic dystrophin present in the cells. We made several changes in the manuscript to make this point clear. We hope this reviewer will find it satisfactory.</p><p><italic>However, the whole study is based on unsupported and possibly erroneous assumptions that human Dystrophin, fused to GFP tag, and over-expressed in zebrafish myofibres, is functionally and kinetically equivalent to the native protein</italic>.</p><p>These are fair concerns. We have now added several controls to better consolidate our results on the human Dystrophin. Importantly, we added data showing that human Dystrophin fully rescues the dystrophic phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; Results section “Human Dystrophin efficiently rescues zebrafish dystrophic embryos and two bound pools are still found in the absence of competition with endogenous Dystrophin”) indicating that huDys-GFP is functional in the fish background. In addition, we have analysed the dynamics of exogenous zebrafish Dystrophin with C-terminal GFP-tag, equivalent to the human Dystrophin-GFP, and compared both with endogenous Dystrophin of <italic>Gt(dmd-citrine)</italic><sup><italic>ct90a</italic></sup> zebrafish embryos, in which a Citrine-tag was inserted close to the actin binding site by a gene trap. We have found similar dynamics in all three conditions, despite the different tags and their different localisation within the protein. Further, our results show that exogenous zebrafish and human Dystrophin have diffusion and binding dynamics similar to those of endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin, in spite of the artificially raised cytoplasmic levels caused by over-expression. Therefore, neither the over-expression nor different binding kinetics between fish and human proteins affect Dystrophin dynamics in our system. In addition to the data added to the Results section (“Two bound populations also characterize the dynamics of zebrafish Dystrophin-GFP” and “Endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin diffusion and binding dynamics”; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9 fig10">Figures 9, 10</xref>), we have improved the Discussion to make clear that our system can be used to study human Dystrophin dynamics, with limitations (see “Validating Dystrophin over-expression in Zebrafish as a model system to study Dystrophin dynamics in vivo”). There, we stress the importance of confirming the dynamics of human Dystrophin in human cells in future studies.</p><p>Given that no similar analysis has ever been done on human protein in human (or any other species), our data does, at the very least, raise a valid issue.</p><p><italic>First, it is important to consider that zebrafish and human Dystrophin differ at amino acid level and hence the affinity of the human protein might be lower to its binding partners at the zebrafish sarcolemma. This can lead to the accumulation of the human protein in the zebrafish myofibre cytoplasm. Indeed, the data presented in the manuscript tends to support this, as the authors did not detect any endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin in the cytoplasm. It might be due to undetectable level in the cytoplasm, as the authors hypothesize. However, if this is the case, then it should be proven by cell fractionating and biochemical methods</italic>.</p><p>The accumulation of Dystrophin in the cytoplasm does not invalidate our results, independently of any speculation about its driving source. Note that we thoroughly analysed the cytoplasmic pool to make sure its dynamics would be taken into account at all steps of the analysis. We have found that the overall binding of human Dystrophin at the membrane is not affected by the amount of Dystrophin in the cytoplasm (see Results section “Increase of cytoplasmic Dystrophin does not affect accumulation at the fibre tips”). In addition, the size of the cytoplasmic pool does not determine the presence of the mobile-bound Dystrophin pool. Indeed, our data show that the mobile-bound Dystrophin pool can be found in fibres with no detectable or very low levels of cytoplasmic unbound huDysGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, F</xref>), and cells with high cytoplasmic huDysGFP intensity do not necessarily recover more (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, E, F</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, we have now added the FRAP analysis of endogenously-driven zebrafish Dystrophin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>; Results section “Endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin diffusion and binding dynamics”). Our results show that there are low levels of endogenous cytoplasmic Dystrophin in muscle fibres of <italic>Gt(dmd-citrine)</italic><sup><italic>ct90a</italic></sup> zebrafish embryos and we demonstrate that endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin also shows the characteristic two bound pools at the membrane. This observation is in line with previous observations. Cytoplasmic dystrophin was shown in developing human muscle fibres independently by different labs, using several different antibodies, many of which are still among the most widely used and more trusted ones (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figure 3 and 4</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wessels et al., 1991</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clerk et al., 1992</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chevron et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mora et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Torelli et al., 1999</xref>). Cytoplasmic Dystrophin was also described in regenerating muscle fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kääriäinen et al., 2000</xref>), in differencing human primary muscle cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miranda et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Torelli et al., 1999</xref>) and in the adult heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peri et al., 1994</xref>). Considering that we express the human Dystrophin in a skeletal muscle embryonic environment it is not surprising, and it is even reassuring, that it would behave as in the human embryonic environment and be found in a cytoplasmic form. We apologize that the bibliographic evidence required to put many of our results in context was missing, which, together with the focus on comparing the exogenous human Dystrophin expression with that of the endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin may have misled the reviewer in many ways. We hope these points were now made clearer (Introduction and Discussion).</p><p><italic>Second, all the conclusions rely on using an overexpression plasmid that is controlled by viral promoter. It is probable that there are limited binding sites for Dystrophin at the cell membrane and such overexpression system would lead to the accumulation of protein in the cytosol. In fact, the authors show that at low expression level they could not find Dystrophin-GFP in the cytoplasm. Expression driven by endogenous promoter would have eliminated all these concerns (i.e. BAC transgenic fish)</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer. The new analysis of endogenously-driven Dystrophine-Citrine eliminated these concerns.</p><p><italic>Third, the authors fail to show whether the C-terminal GFP tag alters Dystrophin kinetics. Although GFP size is small relative to Dystrophin, it is large enough to alter binding affinity to other proteins. While GFP-tagged human Dystrophin can rescue dystrophic zebrafish in short-term experiments, then this do not require native protein kinetics. Control experiments with N-terminal tag would have been essential. Especially considering that the C-terminus of Dystrophin is located towards the membrane bound dystroglycan complex and the addition of GFP could have weakened the interaction of the fusion protein with it</italic>.</p><p>This is a fair point. We have compared the dynamics of zebrafish Dystrophin with a C-terminal GFP tag with that of zebrafish Dystrophin with Citrine tag localised close to the actin binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruf-Zamojski et al., 2015</xref>). We found that Dystrophin dynamics is not affected by the position of the fluorescent suggesting that the tags are unlikely to significantly perturb the dynamics of Dystrophin.</p><p>In addition, note that we do show in the manuscript that human Dystrophin without the tag binds like huDysGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure1</xref>). We also present new data to strengthen our technical controls on the functionality of the GFP-tagged human Dystrophin we use (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; Results section “Human Dystrophin efficiently rescues zebrafish dystrophic embryos and two bound pools are still found in the absence of competition with endogenous Dystrophin”). Hence, we believe that the risk of the GFP-terminal tag affecting the binding of Dystrophin is most likely negligible.</p><p><italic>Fourth, as it appears from the Materials and methods section, the area that was bleached in FRAP was significantly lager in the cytoplasm than at the membrane. Yet, one cannot compare two regions with different size as diffusion occurs faster in a smaller area. By using a small bleached area at the membrane one would overestimate protein diffusion there in comparison to much larger bleached area in the cytoplasm</italic>.</p><p>We are puzzled by the reviewer’s claim that the diffusion rate would be faster in a smaller area. The diffusion rate is a measure of the distance travelled per unit of time (we measure it in micrometers travelled per second). By physical laws, the size of the observed region has no effect on the diffusion rate itself. Therefore, it is absolutely correct to compare different areas/volumes using diffusion equations.</p><p>Taking into consideration this evidence, we believe there is no reason to dismiss our results as pure artefacts. The new data presented provides further technical controls that we believe strengthen the manuscript. We acknowledge that a better integration of the literature on Dystrophin in human muscle cells was required to make it clearer that what we observe in our experimental system fits with the proposed dynamics of dystrophin in embryonic and regenerating human muscles.</p><p><italic>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration</italic>.<italic>]</italic></p><p><italic>1) You stated clearly (but this was not in the first version) that the cytoplasmic pool might well be an artifact due to over expression. Once this is made clear there is no longer the risk to mislead the reader about a physiologically significant pool of soluble dystrophin</italic>.</p><p>We do agree that there is often an excess of cytoplasmic Dystrophin in the zebrafish host muscle fibres due to over expression. We now make this point clear both in the Results and Discussion sections. The question was raised by the referees with the concern that an excess of cytoplasmic Dystrophin could be the cause of the mobile-bound pool identified. To further support our original claims that the existence of extra cytoplasmic Dystrophin does not invalidate our results, we have now added the FRAP analysis of endogenously-driven zebrafish Dystrophin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>; Results section “Endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin diffusion and binding dynamics”). Although this experiment was not requested by the editors, we believe it adds important new data. Our results show clearly that there are low levels of endogenous cytoplasmic Dystrophin in muscle fibres of <italic>Gt(dmd-citrine)</italic><sup><italic>ct90a</italic></sup> zebrafish embryos, in which the endogenous gene was tagged by a gene trap. We demonstrate that endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin also shows the characteristic two bound pools at the membrane. With these new data in mind, the question is no longer whether there is a physiologically significant pool of soluble Dystrophin, but whether there is a similar low level of soluble Dystrophin in human cells. To put our data into context, we added citation of several independent studies suggesting that this may be the case, at least during development and regeneration. Whether the presence of this cytoplasmic pool is linked with the fact that Dystrophin complexes may be actively being formed in these situations remains an open and interesting question.</p><p><italic>2) You proposed to insert the rescue of the dystrophic fish by human dystrophin. A careful analysis of the resulting phenotype would strengthen the work considerably</italic>.</p><p>We have now included the analysis of human Dystrophin expression in dystrophic fish (<italic>dmd</italic><sup><italic>ta222a/ta222a</italic></sup>). We show that exogenous human Dystrophin efficiently rescues the dystrophic phenotype indicating that human Dystrophin is fully functional within fish muscle cells. In addition, we analysed Dystrophin binding dynamics in rescued DMD fibres by FRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; Results section “Human Dystrophin efficiently rescues zebrafish dystrophic embryos and two bound pools are still found in the absence of competition with endogenous Dystrophin”). We find no differences whatsoever between the dynamics of huDysGFP in wild type embryos and in DMD embryos. This result indicates that the competition with endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin in the original wild-type host embryos was not the cause of the mobile-bound Dystrophin pool we observed.</p><p><italic>3) The third concern that you do not address in your letter relates to possible different binding kinetics between fish and human proteins. This is important because the labile membrane bound pool may be a consequence of this difference. If you have performed, as control, rescue of dystrophic fish by fish dystrophin and you also see the two pools, that would be sufficient to rule out a species difference. Ideally one would like to see the same also in human cells but we understand that this would be a whole new set of experiments that you may not be in a position to do. If the fish data can be provided, then just a word of caution in the discussion, as to the fact the final confirmation of the two pools in human muscle awaits experiments in human cells should acknowledge the unlikely possibility that things may be different in human</italic>.</p><p>We made a new expression construct to exogenously express GFP-tagged zebrafish Dystrophin. This construct was expressed in both wild-type and dystrophic embryos and the binding dynamics were analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>; Results section “Two bound populations also characterize the dynamics of zebrafish Dystrophin-GFP”). The two bound pools are present in both genetic backgrounds, confirming that the labile-bound pool is not a consequence of a different binding kinetics between human and zebrafish proteins. However, there was still the possibility that the mobile-bound pool was due to the over-expression strategy. As mentioned in the reply to point 1, this mobile-bound form is also found in muscle fibres of <italic>Gt(dmd-citrine)</italic><sup><italic>ct90a</italic></sup> zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>; Results section “Endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin diffusion and binding dynamics”).</p><p>We added a statement to the Discussion acknowledging the importance of confirming the dynamics of human Dystrophin in human cells in future studies .
