carrying it through the 80 Å glycocalyx and the 40 Å lipid bilayer. Transport begins when cholesterol binds to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of NPC1, which projects to the surface of the glycocalyx. Here, we reconstitute cholesterol transport by expressing the NTD as a fragment separate from the remaining portion of NPC1. When co-expressed, the two NPC1 fragments reconstitute cholesterol transport, indicating that the NTD has the flexibility to interact with the remaining parts of NPC1 even when not covalently linked. We also show that cholesterol can be transferred from the NTD of one full-length NPC1 to another NPC1 molecule that lacks the NTD. These data support the hypothesis that cholesterol is transported through interactions between two or more NPC1 molecules.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NPC1 fragments</kwd><kwd>cholesterol transport</kwd><kwd>reconstitution</kwd><kwd>split nanoluciferase</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL20948</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>Joseph L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1910</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seemann</surname><given-names>Joachim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM008014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trinh</surname><given-names>Michael Nguyen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM096070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seemann</surname><given-names>Joachim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The N-terminal domain of one NPC1 molecule can transfer its cholesterol to another NPC1 molecule lacking the N-terminal domain, suggesting that NPC1 forms multimers that transport cholesterol out of lysosomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cholesterol enters mammalian cells through the receptor-mediated uptake of plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brown and Goldstein, 1986</xref>). After its liberation from LDL in lysosomes, cholesterol is bound by a soluble intralysosomal carrier protein designated Niemann-Pick C2 (NPC2), which delivers it to a membrane-embedded transport protein designated NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pentchev, 2004</xref>). The mechanism by which NPC1 transfers cholesterol across the lysosomal membrane is beginning to be elucidated through a combination of studies that are functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Infante et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deffieu and Pfeffer, 2011</xref>) or structural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Li et al., 2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2016b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2017</xref>). Successful elucidation of this transport mechanism will provide a paradigm for the transport of a lipid across a membrane, and it will also advance the understanding of Niemann-Pick C disease, a fatal lysosomal lipid storage disease caused by mutations in NPC1.</p><p>NPC1 is a complex protein of 1278 amino acids with 13 transmembrane helices and three structured lumenal domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Cholesterol-loaded NPC2 binds to one of these domains designated the middle lumenal domain (MLD), which positions NPC2 so that it can transfer its cholesterol to the N-terminal domain (NTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deffieu and Pfeffer, 2011</xref>). The NTD then must transfer its cholesterol across the ~80 Å glycocalyx so that it can reach the membrane domain of NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Neiss, 1984</xref>). This transfer is believed to require the interaction of the NTD with a 9-amino acid loop designated the Ω loop in the C-terminal domain (CTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The membrane domain of NPC1 contains a sequence of five transmembrane helices that is shared with other membrane proteins whose actions are related to cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2018</xref>). This sequence, termed the sterol-sensing domain (SSD), contains an intramembrane cleft that has been proposed to bind cholesterol and may function in the transport reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Li et al., 2016b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38564.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Human NPC1: topology, structure, and function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Predicted topology of human NPC1 based on the data of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Davies and Ioannou (2000)</xref>.

Our data demonstrate that the NTD can accomplish this transfer even when it is produced as a separate protein that is not linked covalently to the remainder of NPC1. Moreover, we show that the NTD of one full-length NPC1 protein can transfer its cholesterol to a separate NPC1 protein that does not contain an NTD, indicating that cholesterol transfer may normally occur through the interaction of two or more NPC1 molecules. Considered together with previous data, the current studies begin to provide a glimpse into the mechanism by which a lipid can be transferred across a glycocalyx and through a membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows the membrane topology of NPC1 with its three large lumenal loops designated N-terminal domain (NTD), middle lumenal domain (MLD), and C-terminal domain (CTD). The MLD and CTD flank the sterol-sensing domain (SSD), which is composed of five membrane spanning helices separated by short connecting loops. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows the structure of NPC1 as determined by cryo-electron microscopy to 4.4 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gong et al., 2016</xref>). The NTD is connected to the membrane by a long stalk that extends far enough to cross the ~80 Å glycocalyx that shields the lysosomal membrane from lysosomal lipases and proteases. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> illustrates a proposed mechanism by which NPC1 facilitates cholesterol transport out of the lysosome. Cholesterol released from LDL is bound to NPC2 (<italic>step 1</italic>), which binds to the MLD of NPC1, which orients the NPC2 so that it can transfer its cholesterol to the NTD by a sliding mechanism (<italic>step 2</italic>) termed the hydrophobic handoff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>). The next step is the transfer of cholesterol from the lumenal NTD through the glycocalyx to reach the membranous SSD (<italic>step 3</italic>). This transfer would require a large conformational change in the protein to re-orient the NTD so that it approaches the membrane. A recent structural analysis of NPC1 by X-ray crystallography at 3.3 Å resolution demonstrated that the NTD binds to the CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Binding is mediated by a short loop designated the Ω loop that projects from the CTD and binds to a region of the NTD. When the Ω loop was deleted from the CTD, the mutant protein traveled normally to lysosomes, but it failed to transport cholesterol, suggesting that this interaction is crucial for the transfer of cholesterol from the NTD to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Li et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To further define the mechanism for cholesterol transfer from the NTD, we sought to determine whether the NTD could still interact with the remainder of NPC1 if the NTD was produced as a separate protein. For this purpose, we created a plasmid encoding the NTD linked to the membrane by a single transmembrane helix that corresponds to the first transmembrane helix (TM1) of NPC1, which normally follows the NTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In this plasmid TM1 is followed by a lysosomal targeting sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Watari et al., 1999</xref>) and two epitope tags, Flag and StrepTactin. We also created a plasmid designated pΔNTD that encodes the remainder of NPC1 that is missing the NTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38564.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mutant versions of human NPC1 used in cholesterol esterification assays.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) pNTD-TM1 encodes the signal sequence of human NPC1, followed sequentially by the NTD, TM1, a lysosomal targeting signal, and epitope tags.

We introduced plasmids encoding Flag-tagged versions of NPC1 into SV589 cells, a line of SV40-immortalized human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Yamamoto et al., 1984</xref>). We fixed and permeabilized the cells and visualized NPC1 by incubation with an antibody against the Flag epitope tag followed by a second antibody conjugated to a dye that fluoresces green. Lysosomes were visualized with anti-LAMP-2 directed against a lysosomal protein followed by a second antibody that fluoresces red. Full length NPC1, ΔNTD, and NTD-TM1 all localized to lysosomes as indicated by the yellow color in the merged images. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> we also studied the localization of three other versions of NPC1 that are described later in this paper. Two of these proteins localize to lysosomes. One of these, pNTD*-TM1, encodes NTD-TM1 with two amino acid substitutions that eliminate cholesterol binding (P202A/F203A), and the other, pNPC1(ΔΩ), encodes NPC1 with a deletion of the 9-amino acid loop (designated Ω) that mediates binding to the NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The third version of NPC1, NTD-TM13, encodes the NTD followed by the 13th transmembrane helix of NPC1 instead of the first transmembrane helix; it shows a predominant ER localization.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38564.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Localization of mutant NPC1 proteins to lysosomes.</title><p>SV589 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids encoding Flag-tagged fragments of NPC1 as described in Materials and methods.

To test for cholesterol transport from lysosomes, we incubated the cells either with lipoprotein-deficient serum or with FCS that contains LDL particles that deliver cholesterol to lysosomes through receptor-mediated endocytosis. When cholesterol is liberated from lysosomes, it travels to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it is converted to cholesteryl esters by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT).

To examine this question, we took advantage of the observation that the NTD appears to bind to a 9-amino acid loop that projects from the CTD as determined by a combined analysis of the structures determined by x-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Li et al., 2016b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2017</xref>).

The protein lacking the Ω loop is designated NPC1(ΔΩ). Inasmuch as NPC1(ΔΩ) contains an intact NTD, we wondered whether that NTD could transfer its cholesterol to the ΔNTD protein that lacks an NTD but has an intact CTD (<bold><italic>see diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref></italic></bold>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38564.007</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Transfer of cholesterol from NPC1(∆Ω) to ∆NTD as determined by cholesterol esterification assay.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model showing how the NTD of NPC1(∆Ω) might transfer its cholesterol to the SSD of ∆NTD.

On day 3, the cells received fresh medium B containing compactin and mevalonate in the presence of either 5% LPDS or 10% FCS. After incubation for 4 hr at 37°C, each cell monolayer was pulse-labeled for 2 hr with 0.1 mM sodium [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate (9452 dpm/nmol).

The first hurdle is overcome by NPC2, which binds cholesterol in the lumen and delivers it to the NTD of NPC1 that lies on the surface of the glycocalyx. The current study deals with the second hurdle – namely, the mechanism by which the NTD transports cholesterol across the glycocalyx.</p><p>Studies using cryo-EM demonstrated that the NTD is attached to a proline-rich stalk that is long enough to position the cholesterol-binding site just outside of the glycocalyx where it is accessible to NPC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gong et al., 2016</xref>). In order for this cholesterol to reach the membrane, either the NTD must move by 80 Å to deliver it there or the cholesterol must be released to an intermediate carrier or channel that is formed by the MLD and CTD. No such channel is visible in the structures obtained by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gong et al., 2016</xref>) or X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Li et al., 2016b</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the current paper, we demonstrate that the NTD can transfer its cholesterol to the membrane even when the NTD is not covalently attached to the remainder of NPC1. This finding suggests that any change in the location of the NTD is mediated by its interactions with the MLD and CTD. We also show that the NTD of one full-length NPC1 can transfer its cholesterol to another NPC1 that lacks its own NTD. This finding suggests that full-length NPC1 molecules interact with each other, raising the possibility that NPC1 molecules form a complex with each other and that cholesterol transfer results from interactions between neighboring molecules.</p><p>NPC1 is related by amino acid sequence and structural conformation to a family of bacterial proteins called resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Tseng et al., 1999</xref>). These proteins function as proton-coupled antiporters, expelling a variety of structurally unrelated hydrophobic toxins from gram negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Seeger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Yamaguchi et al., 2015</xref>). Like NPC1, RND proteins must transport their cargo across a lipid membrane and across an aqueous space (the periplasm). When purified in detergents, RND proteins crystallize as homotrimers. One of the monomers binds the ligand and undergoes a series of conformational changes that shifts the ligand through a protein-enclosed tunnel until it is discharged on the other side.</p><p>In contrast to RND proteins, NPC1 is a monomer when purified in detergents and subjected to cryo-EM or X-ray crystallography. Nevertheless, the current evidence of interaction between neighboring NPC1 molecules raises the possibility that the protein may form functional multimers in the membrane and that cholesterol may be transported through the glycocalyx by means of a functional interaction between neighboring NPC1 molecules.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>Sodium dodecyl <break/>sulfate (SDS)</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>71736</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>Benzonase nuclease</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>E1014</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>Bovine serum <break/>albumin</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>A7284</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>[1-<sup>14</sup>C]Oleic acid <break/>(50 mCi/mmol)</td><td>PerkinElmer, <break/>Waltham, MA</td><td>NEC317050UC</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>SuperSignal West Pico <break/>Chemiluminescent <break/>Substrate</td><td>Thermo Fisher <break/>Scientific</td><td>34580</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>Zeocin</td><td>Life Technologies, <break/>Grand Island, NY</td><td>R25005</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>FuGENE HD</td><td>Promega Corporation, <break/>Madison, WI</td><td>E2311</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>Formaldehyde</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>F8775</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>Penicillin-Streptomycin <break/>Solution</td><td>Corning</td><td>30–002 Cl</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>Methanol</td><td>Fisher Scientific, <break/>Hampton, NH</td><td>A412</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>Hexane</td><td>Fisher Scientific</td><td>H292</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>Isopropanol</td><td>Fisher Scientific</td><td>A416</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>Heptane</td><td>Fisher Scientific</td><td>H350</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>Ethyl ether</td><td>Fisher Scientific</td><td>E138</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>Acetic acid</td><td>Fisher Scientific</td><td>A38C</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>Sodium compactin</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brown et al.

In addition, we show that cholesterol can be transferred from the NTD of one NPCI to the transport domain of a second NPC 1, indicating that NPC I may function as a multimer, a hypothesis that has not been suggested previously. As an additional element, the manuscript also employed a split nanoluciferase reconstitution assay to demonstrate that the N-terminal domain binds to the remaining portion of NPC 1.</p><p>The reviewers did not express significant concerns about the functional reconstitution as measured by cholesterol esterification. However, they raised several questions regarding the split nanoluciferase interaction. We recognize that additional controls would be necessary to verify the specificity of the split nanoluciferase assay. Performing these controls will require the development of several lines of stably transfected cells that will take many months to complete. Even then, the results may not rule out the possibility that the interaction is caused by the binding of the two luciferase fragments instead of the binding of NPC1 fragments.</p><p>We believe that the functional reconstitution assay stands on its own and provides important new information for this field. Accordingly, we have eliminated all figures and all text references that deal with the split nanoluciferase assay. Inasmuch as there were no expressed reservations regarding the functional reconstitution assays, we hope that this manuscript will now be acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is important to acknowledge and discuss the limitations of using split nanoluciferase to assess whether two proteins interact.

In the new figure, there is no broken axis.</p><p>Since we do not mention the glycocalyx in our discussion of the original Figure 9B (now Figure 6B), we do not understand the relevance of this comment. The evidence that the NTD reaches through the glycocalyx is based on the structure of NPCI (see Figure 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Determine whether the interaction of ΔNTD and ΔΩ is cholesterol dependent, similar to what was shown for NTD-TM1 in Figure 8.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment relates to a nanoluciferase experiment that has been removed from the revised paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
