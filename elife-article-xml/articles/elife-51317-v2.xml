proteins exhibiting large expression changes in response to proinflammatory cytokines. Here we show that the expression pattern of a major human APR, that is <italic>C-reactive protein</italic> (<italic>CRP</italic>), is casually determined by DNMT3A and TET2-tuned promoter methylation status. <italic>CRP</italic> features a CpG-poor promoter with its CpG motifs located in binding sites of STAT3, C/EBP-β and NF-κB. These motifs are highly methylated at the resting state, but undergo STAT3- and NF-κB-dependent demethylation upon cytokine stimulation, leading to markedly enhanced recruitment of C/EBP-β that boosts <italic>CRP</italic> expression. Withdrawal of cytokines, by contrast, results in a rapid recovery of promoter methylation and termination of <italic>CRP</italic> induction. Further analysis suggests that reversible methylation also regulates the expression of highly inducible genes carrying CpG-poor promoters with APRs as representatives. Therefore, these CpG-poor promoters may evolve CpG-containing TF binding sites to harness dynamic methylation for prompt and reversible responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>C-reactive protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31671339</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31870767</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31570749</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ji</surname><given-names>Shang-Rong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31770819</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ji</surname><given-names>Shang-Rong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>DNA methylation status can be exploited to finely and reversibly tune the expression of highly inducible genes with CpG-poor promoters in response to environmental cues.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute phase reactants (APRs) are liver-produced plasma proteins constituting an integral part of innate defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gabay and Kushner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Medzhitov, 2007</xref>). They are defined by a substantial change (&gt;25%) of their plasma concentrations in response to inflammation. IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kopf et al., 1994</xref>) and IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>) are chief inducers of APR expression through activation of STAT3, NF-κB and C/EBP in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bode et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Quinton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Poli, 1998</xref>). C-reactive protein (CRP) is the first APR to be discovered, whose plasma concentrations at baseline are less than 2–3 µg/ml, but can rapidly increase up to 1000-fold upon infection or tissue injury; the heightened levels of CRP, however, return to the baseline with the resolution of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pepys and Hirschfield, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du Clos, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pathak and Agrawal, 2019</xref>). The mechanisms of <italic>CRP</italic> induction have been thoroughly examined by reporter assays and truncation analysis. A region of ~220 bp in the proximal promoter of <italic>CRP</italic> that contains (nonconical) binding sites for STAT3, NF-κB and C/EBP-β is identified to be sufficient to mediate <italic>CRP</italic> induction by IL-6 and IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Singh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Young et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Methylation level of <italic>CRP</italic> promoter is inversely associated with expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of <italic>CRP</italic> promoter in which SNP rs3091244, CpG motifs and TF binding sites are indicated.

(<bold>E</bold>) Levels of <italic>CRP</italic> expression (left) and promoter methylation (right) in tumor versus normal tissues from human livers (n = 5) were determined by q-PCR and bisulfite cloning sequencing, respectively.

The result of one representative experiment is shown.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51317-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Intriguingly, a promoter SNP (rs3091244) associated with plasma levels of CRP is located at 286 bp upstream the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Szalai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zacho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allin et al., 2010</xref>). This SNP does not exist in binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) critical to <italic>CRP</italic> expression. Rather, the major −286C allele constitutes a CpG motif, at which DNA methylation frequently occurs; whereas the minor alleles of −286A/T disrupt the CpG motif and are associated with enhanced <italic>CRP</italic> expression. Beside the −286CpG, there are only four additional CpGs within the proximal promoter of <italic>CRP</italic>. Importantly, two of those CpGs are located at the binding sites of STAT3 and NF-κB/C/EBP-β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Given that promoter methylation affects TF recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yin et al., 2017</xref>) and contributes to gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jones, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu and Zhang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dor and Cedar, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blattler and Farnham, 2013</xref>), it is notable that levels of promoter methylation and expression of <italic>CRP</italic> appear to be negatively associated albeit with undefined causality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). In the present study, we demonstrate that the expression pattern of <italic>CRP</italic> is causally determined by reversible promoter methylation, and that this regulation may also apply to highly inducible genes with CpG-poor promoters.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Promoter methylation is inversely associated with CRP expression</title><p>To determine whether promoter methylation affects <italic>CRP</italic> expression, we first compared methylation levels of <italic>CRP</italic> promoter in different human tissues. <italic>CRP</italic> is expressed predominantly, if not solely, by the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pepys and Hirschfield, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du Clos, 2013</xref>). Accordingly, methylation levels of <italic>CRP</italic> promoter in normal liver tissues were much lower than that in other tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Analysis of published bisulfite sequencing datasets also confirmed that <italic>CRP</italic> promoter was most demethylated in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Similar results were further obtained in rabbits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), wherein <italic>CRP</italic> exhibits a comparable expression pattern as in humans. Moreover, malignant liver tissues expressed more <italic>CRP</italic> than adjacent normal tissues, and they were also less methylated at <italic>CRP</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These data together reveal an inverse association between levels of promoter methylation and <italic>CRP</italic> expression across different tissues or cell types.</p><p>Hepatic Hep3B cell line is a conventional model to investigate APR expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Singh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Young et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>CRP</italic> promoter in Hep3B cells harbors distinct alleles at the −286 position, with −286C on one allele and −286A on the other. Intriguingly, in addition to lacking the −286CpG, all other promoter CpGs on the −286A allele were much less methylated than that on the −286C allele at the resting state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Such an allelic imbalance of promoter methylation was further reinforced at the induced state. Notably, the induction of <italic>CRP</italic> by IL-6 and IL-1β was accompanied by prominent promoter demethylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Following washout of the cytokines, however, both the expression and the promoter methylation of <italic>CRP</italic> were rapidly recovered. By contrast, the methylation level of a 5’ UTR CpG remained constant during the entire time course. Therefore, levels of promoter methylation and <italic>CRP</italic> expression are also specifically and dynamically associated in the same cell type.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Promoter methylation causally determines CRP expression</title><p>To clarify whether the observed association is causal, we directly modulated methylation levels of <italic>CRP</italic> promoter and examined its consequence on expression. Treating Hep3B cells with 5-aza or RG108 to inhibit DNA methylation significantly enhanced <italic>CRP</italic> expression at the resting state, but showed little effect at the induced state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) wherein <italic>CRP</italic> promoter also underwent active demethylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Nevertheless, 5-aza could moderately rescue the induced expression of CRP when STAT3 or NF-κB was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>), hinting for their involvement in active demethylation of <italic>CRP</italic> promoter. Moreover, in vitro methylation before transfection markedly suppressed the reporter activity of <italic>CRP</italic> promoter in Hep3B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This suppression, however, was partially reversed by mutating individual CpG motifs, and was completely absent with a CpG-null mutant of <italic>CRP</italic> promoter. These results suggest that promoter methylation inhibits, whereas its demethylation enhances <italic>CRP</italic> expression, thus supporting a causal association.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Methylation levels of <italic>CRP</italic> promoter causally determines expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The effects of DNA methylation inhibitor RG-108 (25 μM, 24 hr) or 5-aza (5 μM, 12 hr) on <italic>CRP</italic> expression in Hep3B cells at the resting or induced state (n = 3).

As such, p50 selectively recruited during the time lag could be responsible for promoter demethylation to prime the second wave. Accordingly, C/EBP-β appears to be the major effector that responds to promoter demethylation: its overexpression did not demethylate <italic>CRP</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H and I</xref>), but when combined with blockage of DNA methylation, it drove the resting expression of <italic>CRP</italic> to a level approaching to that induced by IL-6 and IL-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). <italic>C/EBP-β</italic> KO, however, lowered the induced expression of <italic>CRP</italic> by ~70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>).

At the induced state, the pioneered binding of STAT3 to <italic>CRP</italic> promoter in hepatocytes drives a minor wave of induction, and further licenses the subsequent recruitment of NF-κB p50. The two TFs probably work together to tip the balance of TET2 and DNMT3A at <italic>CRP</italic> promoter, leading to its demethylation. As significant cell proliferation was not noted, the methylated cytosine might be eventually removed by base excision repair mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu and Zhang, 2014</xref>). Consequently, the demethylated promoter enhances the recruitment of C/EBP-β to drive the major wave of <italic>CRP</italic> induction. During the recovery phase, however, the loss of activated STAT3 and p50 results in a rapid remethylation of <italic>CRP</italic> promoter and termination of induction. At the resting state, however, the relatively hypomethylated promoter of <italic>CRP</italic> in the liver versus other tissues likely favors C/EBP-β recruitment, contributing to its tissue-specific, basal expression. These may form the basis for CRP, a putative pattern recognition receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du Clos, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bottazzi et al., 2010</xref>), to constitute an integral part of immune surveillance in both homeostasis and inflammation.</p><p>In addition to <italic>CRP</italic>, we further show that reversible methylation also appears to be involved in regulation of highly inducible genes carrying CpG-poor promoters with APRs as representatives.

Our findings here identify an important scenario in which reversible promoter methylation plays a critical role in determining the expression pattern of a class of proteins featured by CpG-poor promoters in response to inflammatory stimuli.</p><p>Acute changes in DNA methylation have also been analyzed at a genome-wide scale in previous studies. One study examined mouse neurons activated by electroconvulsive stimulation, and found that methylation changes were preferentially occurred in CpG-poor regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2011</xref>). Though promoters were underrepresented in these regions, their methylation changes were nevertheless modestly anticorrelated with gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2011</xref>). Such CpG content-dependent changes in DNA methylation, however, were not observed in another study examining neurons activated by contextual learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Halder et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, DNA methylation changes in human dendritic cells following infection rarely occurred at promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pacis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pacis et al., 2015</xref>), and were claimed to be a consequence of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pacis et al., 2019</xref>). Those findings thus argue that the regulation of reversible methylation on inducible expression of genes with CpG-poor promoters may be context-dependent, and that rigorously controlled case study should be integrated into genome-wide investigation to conclude on causality.</p><p>Interestingly, genes showing inducible expression in macrophages activated by endotoxin have been classified into two groups: nucleosome remodeling-independent genes with CpG-rich promoters, and nucleosome remodeling-dependent genes with CpG-poor promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ramirez-Carrozzi et al., 2009</xref>). Despite their distinct requirements for SWI/SNF complexes, preassembled Pol II and new protein synthesis, both groups of genes exhibit a single-wave kinetics of induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ramirez-Carrozzi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hargreaves et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramirez-Carrozzi et al., 2006</xref>). This is in contrast with CRP and probably other major APRs, which show a two-wave kinetics of induction with the second wave licensed by promoter demethylation. However, nucleosome remodeling might still act downstream in the second wave, as C/EBP-β has recently been shown to promote CRP expression by recruiting BRG1 via MKL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fan et al., 2019</xref>). Conversely, promoter methylation could also contribute to inducible expression of nucleosome remodeling-dependent genes in macrophages by directly regulating TF recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Despite that most CpGs in mammalian promoters not associated with CGIs are usually methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu and Zhang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luo et al., 2018</xref>), TETs and DNMTs can nevertheless mediate active demethylation and de novo methylation, respectively. This indicates that the methylation status of part of the genome may depend on the balance of the two types of enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jones, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu and Zhang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dor and Cedar, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blattler and Farnham, 2013</xref>). Cellular signaling able to tip the balance of TETs and DNMTs could thus represent a regulatory mechanism that finely and reversibly tunes the expression of certain genes in response to environmental cues. In case of <italic>CRP</italic>, DNMT3A and TET2 appear to be involved in the regulation. Though the mechanism of TF-induced local demethylation is not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luo et al., 2018</xref>), TFs including NF-κB and EGR1 have been reported to evoke DNA demethylation in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jarome et al., 2015</xref>) for example by recruiting TET1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). Future study is warranted to elucidate how TFs regulate the balance of TETs and DNMTs and to discover scenarios where regulation by reversible DNA methylation plays a prominent role.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Determination of promoter methylation level</title><p>Frozen tumor/normal tissue sample pairs were obtained from the tissue bank of Gansu Cancer hospital.

which play an essential role in inflammatory responses to infection or tissue injury in the liver. CPR needs to be quickly activated after stimulation by cytokines, and its activation is reversible upon resolution of inflammation. Zhang and colleagues report here that the dynamic expression of CPR is causally regulated by DNA methylation, and that this type of regulation may apply to other inducible genes that are endowed with CpG-poor promoters and have evolved CpG-containing binding sites for transcription factors specialized in rapid and reversible responses.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Reversible promoter methylation determines fluctuating expression of acute phase proteins&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The interesting novelty and appeal of the study comes from 1) the biological importance of <italic>CRP</italic> and acute phase reactant genes in general, and 2) the details of <italic>CRP</italic> regulation in sequential phases by STAT3, NFkB and DNA demethylation/5OHT, and subsequent CEBP binding and activity. The evidence is supported by a satisfactory range of complementary experiments, from functional screens to modulation of DNA methylation by chemical inhibitors and knock-out or knock-down of methylating (<italic>DNMT3A</italic>) or demethylating (<italic>TET2</italic>) enzymes, with validations by targeted epigenomic editing.</p><p>However, the reviewers share the common concern that the manuscript is too concise in its current state to be fully instructive and convincing. More details are clearly required:</p><p>– In the Introduction, to provide proper background.</p><p>– In the Results section to explain the experimental design, methods and results and provide proper validation.</p><p>– In the Discussion, to replace the results in the current state of knowledge and clarify the model.</p><p>I agree that here is a need for further analyses of existing data and for inclusion of important missing controls to fully support interpretations and conclusions.</p><p>Please address the following comments in a revised version of your manuscript:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Provide information (in main text and figure legends) about i) how the CRISPR KO was performed: which exons were targeted? Was the analysis performed on single clones or cell bulk? And ii) how was DNA methylation analyzed in Figure 1: bisulfite sequencing? Available GEO datasets (and please cite the source if it is the case)?</p><p>2) Provide validation of <italic>TET2</italic> and <italic>DNMT3A</italic> KO or KD by Western blot and RT-qPCR, respectively (as a supplementary figure).</p><p>3) Provide evidence that DNA methylation of the <italic>CRP</italic> promoter is directly changed in the experiments of functional modulation of DNA methylation (using DNA methylation inhibitors, <italic>DNMT3A</italic> and <italic>TET2</italic> KO or KD). This is absolutely crucial for supporting conclusions. Along the same line, to further prove that the effect is not indirect, the expression of STAT3, p50 and C/EBP should be assessed (Western blot or RT-qPCR) in <italic>DNMT3A</italic> KO, <italic>TET2</italic> KO and upon treatment with DNA methylation inhibitors.</p><p>4) Throughout the manuscript, figures illustrating methylation profiles are needed. In Figure 1F, please show raw bisulfite sequencing data with individual clones rather than fold differences between the two alleles-an unusual and incomplete way to show the data. This will benefit interpretation of differences between the 286A and 286C alleles (are most of the maintained CpGme (Figure 1G) on the A allele?). Also, please show WGBS tracks of the <italic>CRP</italic> gene in various human tissues (available from public databases) to see how many CpG sites of the <italic>CRP</italic> promoter are specifically hypomethylated in liver.</p><p>5) At the end of the manuscript, the authors investigate if demethylation of CpG-poor promoters is a general feature for the activation of APR genes, in cells and liver. This is important and potentially interesting but again, the authors need to provide much more details on what was done and to perform a more thorough analysis of their WGBS and RNA-seq data. Otherwise, Figure 7 is a too vague genomic characterization of CpG frequency and expression associations. How many replicates of RNA-seq and WGBS? Do replicates correlate? How many genes upregulated and what are the genes upregulated? Is <italic>CRP</italic> demethylated upon inflammation in the liver (genome browser views)? How do changes in expression and methylation correlate? How many DMRs and do they preferentially locate to CpG poor promoters? These are obvious questions that need to be addressed, possibly in supplementary figures.</p><p>6) To further support their assumption that APR genes may behave in general as <italic>CRP</italic>, it would be beneficial if the authors could look by RT-qPCR at expression of several of these genes in the +/- 5aza conditions (with cDNA from Figure 2A) to see if they go up, as they would predict. They could also include some gene sets based on PRG, CpG low status, etc… as well as known rapid response genes (see Hargreaves et al., 2009) that seem to be regulated in a very different manner than APR genes. These may be similar to the authors &quot;cytokine&quot; genes.</p><p>7) The sequential model proposed by the authors is confusing. First, according to Figure 4 and Figure 5B-D, all three TFs (STAT3, p50 and C/EBP) are potentially sensitive to DNA methylation, which contradicts the model. Second, to test which TF requires demethylation for binding, the kinetic experiments described in Figure 5B-D should be performed in <italic>TET2</italic> KO cells (also generated by the authors) instead of <italic>DNMT3A</italic> KO cells, to determine which TF has reduced binding when demethylation is compromised.</p><p>8) There is a lack of thorough introduction and/or discussion of existing evidence from the literature to place the authors' study in the current knowledge context. First, it is known that dynamic DNA methylation changes usually affect CpG-poor promoters, in part due to lack of protective binding of methyl DNA binding proteins, while CpG islands (CGI) promoters, on the contrary, are predominantly non-methylated and stable to ensure expression of housekeeping genes and primary response genes (Hargreaves et al., 2009). Apart from the studies cited in the Discussion of this manuscript, acute changes in DNA methylation have been described in other contexts such as in neurons, upon activation (Guo et al., 2011 among others). As in the present study, but at a genome wide scale, the authors described dynamic reversible methylation of low density CpG promoters in brain-specific genes, and correlated them with gene expression. Moreover, CpG methylation is known to affect transcription factor binding (Yin et al., 2017), and specifically STAT3 binding (Thomas, 2012). And very recently, in neurons as well, TF were described to recruit <italic>TET1</italic> to demethylate specific promoters upon neuronal activation (Sun et al., 2019). Second, in relationship with inflammation and APR gene regulation, the authors should discuss the work of Stephen Smale (Hargreaves et al., 2009) -and potentially others- about conventional categorization of CpG-rich promoters in inflammatory gene induction: nucleosome poor promoters, accessible, independent of remodeling, one step induction. This provides an interesting contrast with the sequential kinetics of <italic>CRP</italic>, regulated in part by changes in DNA methylation and temporal waves of TF binding, as demonstrated here by the authors.</p><p>Recommended changes:</p><p>1) Why is <italic>CRP</italic> hypomethylated in liver cells in unstimulated conditions? Is it because a basal level of expression is needed? This could be discussed.</p><p>2) In Figure 2A, the authors show that DNA methylation inhibitors enhance <italic>CRP</italic> expression at the resting stage. However, they did not assess as to whether <italic>CRP</italic> expression is modified by these inhibitors after induction (it should not), while this would be an important point for their demonstration. Please include this analysis after Figure 2A.</p><p>3) To assess whether DNA demethylation precedes or follows gene activation, please add a 24h time point for DNA methylation analysis (Figure 1G), if possible.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51317.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Provide information (in main text and figure legends) about i) how the CRISPR KO was performed: which exons were targeted?

We have assessed the changes in DNA methylation of <italic>CRP</italic> promoter in Hep3B cells following treatment with DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza, or <italic>DNMT3A/TET2</italic> KD/KO. The results indicated that 5-aza and <italic>DNMT3A</italic> KD/KO reduced, whereas <italic>TET2</italic> KD/KO augmented DNA methylation of <italic>CRP</italic> promoter (Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><p>We have assessed the expression of STAT3, p50 and C/EBP-β in Hep3B cells following treatment with 5-aza, or <italic>DNMT3A/TET2</italic> KD/KO (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). 5-aza treatment reduced the expression of STAT3, but did not affect that of p50 and C/EBP-β. <italic>DNMT3A</italic> or <italic>TET2</italic> KD showed little effect on the expression of the three TFs. <italic>DNMT3A</italic> or <italic>TET2</italic> KO tended to reduce their expression. Because the observed effects on <italic>CRP</italic> expression by 5-aza or <italic>DNMT3A/TET2</italic> KD/KO are consistent or complementary, the above results suggest that these manipulations regulate <italic>CRP</italic> expression by directly modulating promoter methylation.</p><p>Further support to this suggestion is provided by specifically modulating promoter methylation of <italic>CRP</italic> via dCas9-mediated targeting of the catalytic domains of DNMT3A or <italic>TET2</italic>. Enforced methylation of <italic>CRP</italic> promoter by <italic>DNMT3A-dCas9</italic> reduced the expression of <italic>CRP</italic> in Hep3B cells, but showed little effect on that of <italic>serum amyloid A (SAA</italic>, another major human APR) and <italic>serum amyloid P component</italic> (<italic>SAP</italic>, a paralog of <italic>CRP</italic>) (Figure 3F). By contrast, enforced demethylation of <italic>CRP</italic> promoter by <italic>TET2</italic>-dCas9 only selectively enhanced the expression of <italic>CRP</italic> (Figure 3G). We thus conclude that <italic>DNMT3A</italic> and <italic>TET2</italic>-tuned methylation status of <italic>CRP</italic> promoter constitutes a key part of the regulatory mechanism that causally determines the expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Throughout the manuscript, figures illustrating methylation profiles are needed.

This is important and potentially interesting but again, the authors need to provide much more details on what was done and to perform a more thorough analysis of their WGBS and RNA-seq data. Otherwise, Figure 7 is a too vague genomic characterization of CpG frequency and expression associations. How many replicates of RNA-seq and WGBS? Do replicates correlate? How many genes upregulated and what are the genes upregulated? Is CRP demethylated upon inflammation in the liver (genome browser views)? How do changes in expression and methylation correlate? How many DMRs and do they preferentially locate to CpG poor promoters? These are obvious questions that need to be addressed, possibly in supplementary figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed additional experiments and analysis as suggested by the editor and reviewers.</p><p>Two biological replicates were examined for both RNA-seq and WGBS. For RNA-seq, the correlations (R<sup>2</sup>) between the replicates are 0.991 for resting Hep3B cells, 0.998 for induced Hep3B cells, 0.884 for resting mouse livers and 0.803 for induced mouse livers (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A and B). For WGBS, the correlations (R<sup>2</sup>) between the replicates are 0.828 for resting mouse livers and 0.810 for induced mouse livers (Figure 7—figure supplement 1C).</p><p>The expression of 2705 and 3371 genes were changed by over 2-fold (up- and down-regulated) in induced Hep3B cells and in induced mouse livers, respectively. In Hep3B cells, the “regulation of inflammatory response”, “acute inflammatory response” and “regulation of immune effector process” are the top 3 activated biological processes. In induced mouse livers, the “acute inflammatory response”, “positive regulation of response to external stimulus” and “cell chemotaxis” are the top 3 activated biological processes (Figure 7—figure supplement 1D and E).</p><p>In contrast to human <italic>CRP</italic>, mouse <italic>CRP</italic> is not an acute phase protein [<sup>1-3</sup>] (possibly due to the loss of binding sites for C/EBP-β as revealed by bioinformatics analysis), and its promoter did not undergo demethylation in induced livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Although genes with CpG-poor promoters tended to show greater changes in both expression and methylation (Figure 7D and 7E), changes in expression and promoter methylation per se did not show significant correlation. These would suggest that promoter methylation and gene expression may be qualitatively but not quantitatively associated with each other.</p><p>Overall, 1262 differentially methylated regions (DMR; 1k sequence window) were identified in induced versus resting mouse livers. The CpG ratios of these DMRs (median: 0.07; 25th~75th percentile: 0.04~0.17) are significantly lower than that of non-DMRs (median: 0.16; 25th~75th percentile: 0.11~0.23; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-15</sup>). Therefore, differential methylation prefers to occur in CpG-poor regions. However, there are only 85 promoters located in these DMRs. Such an under-representation is consistent with previous findings made in mouse neurons activated by electroconvulsive stimulation <sup>4</sup>.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The bisulfite sequencing tracks of <italic>Nxpe5</italic> (Log2(FC of expression) = 3.6), <italic>Cyp4a14</italic> (Log2(FC of expression) = -3.1), <italic>Clec4n</italic> (Log2(FC of expression) = 1.9) and <italic>CRP</italic> (Log2(FC of expression) = 0.8).</title><p>Promoter CpGs are boxed by red rectangles.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51317-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) To further support their assumption that APR genes may behave in general as CRP, it would be beneficial if the authors could look by RT-qPCR at expression of several of these genes in the +/- 5aza conditions (with cDNA from Figure 2A) to see if they go up, as they would predict. They could also include some gene sets based on PRG, CpG low status, etc… as well as known rapid response genes (see Hargreaves et al., 2009) that seem to be regulated in a very different manner than APR genes.

First, according to Figure 4 and Figure 5B-D, all three TFs (STAT3, p50 and C/EBP) are potentially sensitive to DNA methylation, which contradicts the model. Second, to test which TF requires demethylation for binding, the kinetic experiments described in Figure 5B-D should be performed in TET2 KO cells (also generated by the authors) instead of DNMT3A KO cells, to determine which TF has reduced binding when demethylation is compromised.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed additional experiments as suggested by the editor and reviewers. <italic>TET2</italic> KO almost abrogated the recruitment of p50 and C/EBP-β to <italic>CRP</italic> promoter, but the recruitment of STAT3 was still apparent (Figure 5A-D). This indicates that STAT3 can nevertheless be recruited to <italic>CRP</italic> promoter even when demethylation is compromised, consistent with the observations that vector binding of STAT3 was least sensitive to methylation (Figure 4B and C). This also indicates that STAT3 can act largely independent of p50 and C/EBP-β to drive <italic>CRP</italic> expression, albeit markedly impaired (Figure 5A). Indeed, the sole activation of STAT3 in wildtype cells drove <italic>CRP</italic> expression to a level comparable to the minor peak, whereas the sole activation of NF-κB was completely ineffective (Figure 5E). NF-κB inhibition (with intact STAT3) at the induced state, however, resulted in an even stronger methylation of <italic>CRP</italic> promoter (Figure 5F) and a reversal of allelic imbalance (Figure 5G). Therefore, promoter demethylation requires p50 that acts downstream of STAT3.</p><p>Interestingly, enforced DNA demethylation by <italic>DNMT3A</italic> KO not only tripled <italic>CRP</italic> expression during the entire course of induction, but eliminated the time lag between the two waves (Figure 5A). The augmented amplitude can be explained by enhanced recruitment of three TFs, while the altered dynamics may correspond to the shifted timing of p50 recruitment (Figure 5B-D). As such, p50 selectively recruited during the time lag could be responsible for promoter demethylation to prime the second wave. Accordingly, C/EBP-β appears to be the major effector that responds to promoter demethylation: its overexpression did not demethylate <italic>CRP</italic> promoter (Figure 5H and I), but when combined with blockage of DNA methylation, it drove the resting expression of <italic>CRP</italic> to a level approaching to that induced by IL-6 and IL-1β (Figure 5J). <italic>C/EBP-β</italic> KO, however, lowered the induced expression of <italic>CRP</italic> by ~70% (Figure 5K). These results together are consistent with the proposed sequential model.</p><p>We have carefully revised the manuscript to elaborate the sequential model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) There is a lack of thorough introduction and/or discussion of existing evidence from the literature to place the authors' study in the current knowledge context. First, it is known that dynamic DNA methylation changes usually affect CpG-poor promoters, in part due to lack of protective binding of methyl DNA binding proteins, while CpG islands (CGI) promoters, on the contrary, are predominantly non-methylated and stable to ensure expression of housekeeping genes and primary response genes (Hargreaves et al., 2009). Apart from the studies cited in the Discussion of this manuscript, acute changes in DNA methylation have been described in other contexts such as in neurons, upon activation (Guo et al., 2011 among others). As in the present study, but at a genome wide scale, the authors described dynamic reversible methylation of low density CpG promoters in brain-specific genes, and correlated them with gene expression. Moreover, CpG methylation is known to affect transcription factor binding (Yin et al., 2017), and specifically STAT3 binding (Thomas, 2012). And very recently, in neurons as well, TF were described to recruit TET1 to demethylate specific promoters upon neuronal activation (Sun et al., 2019). Second, in relationship with inflammation and APR gene regulation, the authors should discuss the work of Stephen Smale (Hargreaves et al., 2009) -and potentially others- about conventional categorization of CpG-rich promoters in inflammatory gene induction: nucleosome poor promoters, accessible, independent of remodeling, one step induction. This provides an interesting contrast with the sequential kinetics of CRP, regulated in part by changes in DNA methylation and temporal waves of TF binding, as demonstrated here by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript has been carefully revised according to the comments of the editor and reviewers.</p><p>Acute changes in DNA methylation have also been analyzed at a genome-wide scale in previous studies. One study examined mouse neurons activated by electroconvulsive stimulation, and found that methylation changes were preferentially occurred in CpG-poor regions [<sup>4</sup>]. Though promoters were underrepresented in these regions, their methylation changes were nevertheless modestly anticorrelated with gene expression [<sup>4</sup>]. Such CpG content-dependent changes in DNA methylation, however, were not observed in another study examining neurons activated by contextual learning [<sup>6</sup>]. Moreover, DNA methylation changes in human dendritic cells following infection rarely occurred at promoters [<sup>7, 8</sup>], and were claimed to be a consequence of gene expression [<sup>7</sup>]. Those findings thus argue that the regulation of reversible methylation on inducible expression of genes with CpG-poor promoters may be context-dependent, and that rigorously controlled case study should be integrated into genome-wide investigation to conclude on causality.</p><p>Interestingly, genes showing inducible expression in macrophages activated by endotoxin have been classified into two groups: nucleosome remodeling-independent genes with CpG-rich promoters, and nucleosome remodeling-dependent genes with CpG-poor promoters [<sup>5</sup>]. Despite their distinct requirements for SWI/SNF complexes [<sup>5</sup>], preassembled Pol II [<sup>9</sup>] and new protein synthesis [<sup>5, 9, 10</sup>], both groups of genes exhibit a single-wave kinetics of induction [<sup>5, 9, 10</sup>]. This is in contrast with <italic>CRP</italic> and probably other major APRs, which show a two-wave kinetics of induction with the second wave licensed by promoter demethylation. However, nucleosome remodeling may also act downstream in the second wave, as C/EBP-β has recently been shown to promote <italic>CRP</italic> expression by recruiting BRG1 via MKL1 [<sup>11</sup>]. Conversely, promoter methylation may also contribute to inducible expression of nucleosome remodeling-dependent genes in macrophages by directly regulating TF recruitment [<sup>12-14</sup>].</p><p>Despite that most CpGs in mammalian promoters not associated with CGIs are usually methylated [<sup>15, 16</sup>], <italic>TETs</italic> and <italic>DNMTs</italic> can nevertheless mediate active demethylation and de novomethylation, respectively. This indicates that the methylation status of part of the genome may depend on the balance of the two types of enzymes [<sup>15-19</sup>]. Cellular signaling able to tip the balance of <italic>TETs</italic> and <italic>DNMTs</italic> could thus represent a regulatory mechanism that finely and reversibly tunes the expression of certain genes in response to environmental cues. In case of <italic>CRP, DNMT3A</italic> and <italic>TET2</italic> appear to be involved in the regulation. Though the mechanism of TF-induced local demethylation is not fully understood [<sup>16</sup>], TFs including NF-κB and EGR1 have been reported to evoke DNA demethylation in neurons [<sup>20</sup>] for example by recruiting <italic>TET1</italic> [<sup>21</sup>]. Future study is warranted to elucidate how TFs regulate the balance of <italic>TETs</italic> and <italic>DNMTs</italic> and to discover scenarios where regulation by reversible DNA methylation plays a prominent role.</p><p>These discussions have been included in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommended changes:</p><p>1) Why is CRP hypomethylated in liver cells in unstimulated conditions? Is it because a basal level of expression is needed? This could be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed by the editor and reviewers, hepatocytes secrete <italic>CRP</italic> in unstimulated conditions, yielding a basal circulating level of about 1~3 μg/ml in apparently healthy individuals [<sup>22-24</sup>]. <italic>CRP</italic> has been proposed to act as a soluble pattern recognition receptor in host defense [<sup>25, 26</sup>]. Therefore, basal levels of circulating <italic>CRP</italic> may constitute an integral part of immune surveillance that contributes to the silent clearance of invading pathogens and apoptotic cells in homeostasis. These discussions have been included in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 2A, the authors show that DNA methylation inhibitors enhance CRP expression at the resting stage.
