specify fates within developing tissues, morphogenetic cues must be correctly positioned and interpreted. Here, we investigate mouse hair follicle development to understand how morphogens operate within closely spaced, fate-diverging progenitors. Coupling transcriptomics with genetics, we show that emerging hair progenitors produce both WNTs and WNT inhibitors. Surprisingly, however, instead of generating a negative feedback loop, the signals oppositely polarize, establishing sharp boundaries and consequently a short-range morphogen gradient that we show is essential for three-dimensional pattern formation. By establishing a morphogen gradient at the cellular level, signals become constrained. The progenitor preserves its WNT signaling identity and maintains WNT signaling with underlying mesenchymal neighbors, while its overlying epithelial cells become WNT-restricted. The outcome guarantees emergence of adjacent distinct cell types to pattern the tissue.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>morphogen gradient</kwd><kwd>positional information</kwd><kwd>pattern formation</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>sharp boundary formation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37-AR27883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuchs</surname><given-names>Elaine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Progenitors establish a single-cell length WNT morphogen gradient to transmit signals directionally and differentially to neighbors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Embryonic development has long fascinated generations of scientists. Despite years of research, developmental biologists are still puzzled by the remarkable emergence of complex multicellular organisms from single cells. Central to understanding metazoan phenotypic reproducibility is the problem of pattern formation.</p><p>In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, biologists began providing a new conceptual framework for understanding how cellular fates are specified during morphogenesis. Initially, it was proposed that depending upon their local concentration, ‘materials’ form gradients that dictate distinct patterning of otherwise uniform cellular sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boveri, 1901</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morgan, 1901</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dalcq, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rogers and Schier, 2011</xref>). This notion began to crystallize in 1952, when Alan Turing applied mathematical modeling to explain how diffusion of two interacting chemical substances could spontaneously produce a pattern from an homogeneous field of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Turing, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heller and Fuchs, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Some years later, Lewis Wolpert posited the ‘French Flag Problem’ to describe a cell’s differential gene expression according to its position within a morphogen gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wolpert, 1968</xref>). He suggested that thresholds of morphogen gradients would establish boundaries that result in distinct cell fates. The ‘positional information’ model was then proposed to describe how complex patterns emerge from prior asymmetries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Green and Sharpe, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wolpert, 1969</xref>). The premise is that each cell has a positional value that specifies its position, and it is the interpretation of positional information that dictates cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wolpert, 1989</xref>).</p><p>Overall, these early studies popularized the view that morphogens and positional information function centrally in generating the symmetry-breaking events that differentiate cellular fates and drive morphogenesis. Despite these important advances on the establishment of two-dimensional patterns, comparatively little is known about the molecular nature of the positional information needed to generate three-dimensional tissue patterns, or how closely juxtaposed cells within a developing tissue and organ adopt and maintain distinct cellular fates. Here, we tackle this problem by using the emergence of hair follicles in developing mammalian skin as a classical example of three-dimensional patterning in morphogenesis.</p><p>During embryonic development, the first of three spatially positioned arrays of hair placodes emerges when some cells within an epithelial monolayer begin to experience a higher level of WNT signal than their neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DasGupta and Fuchs, 1999</xref>). Similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic> development, these WNTs act as short-range inducers and long-range organizers. Thus, through either rapid reaction-diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sick et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glover et al., 2017</xref>) or mechanotransduction-mediated mesenchymal self-organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shyer et al., 2017</xref>), the WNT<sup>hi</sup> cells within the plane of homogeneous epidermal cells cluster into an array of evenly spaced placodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahtiainen et al., 2014</xref>). As placodes form, they produce inhibitory signals such as bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) that limit placode size and distance placodes from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Narhi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Noramly and Morgan, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Three dimensional pattern formation begins when WNT signaling reaches a threshold in placode cells, stimulating them to divide perpendicularly relative to the epidermal plane and generating differentially fated progenitor daughters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ouspenskaia et al., 2016</xref>). Intriguingly, these early basal daughters both produce WNTs and respond to WNTs, as exemplified by WNT-reporter activity and nuclear LEF1, a positive-acting downstream DNA binding effector of WNT-stabilized β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ouspenskaia et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the overlying suprabasal daughter displays a paucity of WNT signaling and adopts a new fate, while the dermal condensate beneath the hair bud shows robust WNT signaling. How this positional information is locally and directionally partitioned and how sharp boundaries in WNT signaling are established between neighboring cells has remained elusive.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Two-dimensional patterning of hair placodes is severely affected upon sustained autonomous WNT activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sagittal views and schematic of skin section depicting a basal hair bud progenitor and underlying dermal condensate (DC, encased by blue dotted lines).

By coupling transcriptome analyses with gain and loss of function studies, we unveil a cohort of WNT antagonists whose transcripts are WNT-sensitive and specifically activated in the WNT signaling basal progenitors. While morphogen inhibitors have been typically associated with negative feedback loops that either dampen or impair signaling, we find that even though they produce these inhibitors, basal progenitors still signal through WNTs. Moreover, they appear to do so by differentially polarizing activators and inhibitors to establish a spatially confined gradient within the placode. By perturbing it, we learn that this single-cell length morphogen gradient endows basal progenitors with the ability to orchestrate directional signaling. Progenitors generate a WNT-restricted microenvironment for their apical daughters, while fueling a basal basement membrane niche that is rich in WNT signaling at the epithelial-mesenchymal border.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sustained activation of WNT disrupts embryonic skin hexagonal patterning</title><p>In the skin, it is well-established that nuclear LEF1 co-localizes not only with nuclear β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuchs et al., 2001</xref>) but also with both <italic>TOPGAL</italic>, a WNT-reporter driven by an enhancer composed of multimerized LEF1 DNA binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DasGupta and Fuchs, 1999</xref>), and as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <italic>Axin2-LacZ,</italic> a WNT-reporter driven by the endogenous WNT target <italic>Axin2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lustig et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, in this research, we often used nuclear LEF1 as a proxy for WNT signaling.</p><p>To begin to understand how WNT signaling promotes the symmetry-breaking events during skin development, we turned to our powerful in utero delivery method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beronja et al., 2010</xref>). This method was superior over prior transgenic methods in that it allowed us to first, manipulate WNT signaling early, while the skin was still a single-layered epithelium, and second, generate mosaic perturbations in the signals that dictate hair follicle patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andl et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>To gain initial insights, we accentuated the WNT signaling response in skin patches by transducing a lentivirus (LV) harboring Cre recombinase into E9.5 mouse embryos floxed for <italic>Adenomatous Polyposis Coli</italic> (<italic>Apc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>). As expected from prior <italic>Apc</italic> loss of function studies on E14.5 embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kuraguchi et al., 2006</xref>), mosaic loss of <italic>Apc</italic> resulted in overactivation of β-catenin/WNT signaling in patches of transduced skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to wild-type and/or <italic>Apc<sup>-/+</sup></italic> skin, where waves of LEF1+ placodes were patterned equidistantly in hexagonal arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>), hair follicle patterning was severely perturbed upon mosaic, autonomous over-stabilization of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). While immunostaining revealed intense nuclear β-catenin as well as nuclear LEF1, <italic>Apc-</italic>null clusters were of random sizes and organization and the clusters never developed into bona fide hair buds. Instead, clusters remained uniform for the natural markers of WNT<sup>hi</sup> placode cells LEF1, β-catenin and Lhx2, but they failed to generate the WNT<sup>lo</sup> suprabasal cells that characterize the placode to hair bud transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). No signs of DNA damage were observed in <italic>Apc-</italic>null clusters as judged by the absence of γH2AX signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>).</p><p>Although wild-type WNT<sup>hi</sup> hair bud cells are slow-cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ouspenskaia et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>Apc</italic>-null clusters appeared to be altogether non-proliferative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>). Moreover, as illuminated by co-transducing E9.5 embryos with GFP- and RFP-tagged Cre recombinase-expressing lentiviruses, both wild-type placodes and <italic>Apc-</italic>null clusters were multiclonal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>), in agreement with the notion that WNT drives the organization of non-dividing cells into placodes within the epidermal plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahtiainen et al., 2014</xref>). The distinct morphology of <italic>Apc-</italic>null clusters within the epidermis was characterized by a loss of E-cadherin but not P-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>), suggestive of a collective cell sorting mechanism dependent on sustained WNT activation. Integrin β4 was also markedly reduced, consistent with an overall loss of polarity in these clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A–B</xref>).

The early developing skin is composed of a single layer of multipotent epithelial progenitor cells that will either stratify and develop into the skin’s epidermal barrier or form epithelial placodes to launch hair follicle morphogenesis. Positional cues are important not only to specify the uniform distribution of hair follicles across the tissue, but also to differentiate the cells within each of these mini-organs. In uncovering the existence of an internal WNT morphogen gradient within the earliest progenitors of the hair placode, we have begun to understand how WNT signals can be directionally distributed to neighboring cells to break symmetry and trigger the morphogenetic transition from the two-dimensional early placode to a three-dimensional mini-organ.</p><p>WNT signaling has long been known to be important broadly for regenerative and morphogenetic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petersen and Reddien, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Loh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clevers et al., 2014</xref>). The presence of inhibitors of the WNT signaling pathway has also long been recognized, and given the oft short-lived nature of WNT signals in development, it has always been assumed that inhibitors function in a negative feedback loop to turn off the signal for the next step in lineage specification. Although the existence of such feedback loops is well-established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Perrimon and McMahon, 1999</xref>), such a mechanism did not reconcile how WNT signaling remains high in basal hair bud progenitors that also simultaneously express at least four different WNT inhibitors. An additional conundrum was how this WNT expressing, WNT signaling progenitor gives rise to only one daughter cell that retains this status, while the other daughter cell adopts a WNT-restricted state.</p><p>Our findings show that by differentially compartmentalizing WNTs and WNT inhibitors, basal placode progenitors not only maintain both positive and negative WNT morphogens simultaneously, but also directionally target the signals, providing the requisite positional cues to transition from two to three dimensional patterning within the developing tissue. By polarizing WNTs basally, progenitors are able to retain their own WNT signaling as well as that of their underlying mesenchymal neighbors to fuel hair follicle morphogenesis at the dermal-epidermal interface. Conversely, by polarizing WNT inhibitors apically, the same hair bud progenitors directionally orchestrate WNT<sup>lo</sup>SOX9+ fate specification of their overlying neighbors to launch the diversification of the epithelial cells within the developing hair follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Summarizing model.</title><p>WNT signaling basal progenitors form opposing intracellular morphogen gradients of WNT inhibitors and WNT ligands/activators.

Our findings best fit a model whereby developing hair follicle progenitors use WNTs and WNT inhibitors to build local boundaries. By localizing WNT inhibitors apically, WNT<sup>high</sup> progenitors limit the WNT response, preserving their own WNT<sup>high</sup> signaling identity while simultaneously preventing their suprabasal daughter from responding to the WNT signal.</p><p>A similar refining mechanism has been previously proposed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal disks. In the <italic>wingless</italic> expressing cells of the wing margin, cells that are closer to the dorsoventral boundary are able to repress <italic>wingless</italic> expression in their juxtaposed neighbors through a self-refining mechanism. In this case, however, the mechanism appears to involve NOTCH, whose activity is required for <italic>wingless</italic> expression, which in turn appears to repress NOTCH activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rulifson et al., 1996</xref>). In the hair follicle, NOTCH signaling has not been detected in the WNT10B+ progenitors, but rather the WNT<sup>low</sup> differentiating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanpain et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, while the mechanisms seem to be evolutionarily divergent, the functional output is similar and involves the establishment of a sharp boundary that enables the emergence of juxtaposed cell fates.</p><p>Although our current study focused on the existence of this single-cell length morphogen gradient and its functional significance, it will be interesting in the future to unravel how bidirectional targeting occurs. WNTs are known to be N-glycosylated, and studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggest that WNTs can be secreted apically and then transported basally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yamazaki et al., 2016</xref>). Intriguingly, however, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, N-glycosylation-deficient Wingless is secreted without consequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tang et al., 2012</xref>), and in mammalian cells, WNTs have been found to be more potent and bind extracellular matrix more robustly in the absence of N-glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doubravska et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, although our tunicamycin results suggest a role for N-glycosylation in WNT-inhibitor apical secretion, it may be advantageous for cells such as hair bud progenitors that adhere to a basement membrane to secrete their WNTs basally. The ability of ECM to retain growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baeg et al., 2001</xref>), including WNT regulators, makes this hypothesis all the more attractive.</p><p>In closing, by establishing a morphogen gradient at the cellular level, signals are constrained such that two neighboring cell populations in direct physical contact can effectively receive different signaling inputs. Overall, the ability to directionally control rapid changes in daughter fates, and to establish sharp tissue boundaries without the need for direct competition and/or elimination, offers basic advantages to this mechanism that are likely to be broadly applicable in development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains, lentiviral transduction and constructs</title><p>Mice were housed and cared for in an AAALAC-accredited facility at the Rockefeller University.

The authors show that Wnts and Wnt inhibitors to create boundaries and gradients to generate 3D pattern formation.

To this end, we now begin our Results section by citing our prior studies in which we have shown that in the skin, nuclear LEF1 colocalizes with a) TOPGAL, a WNT reporter driven by multimerized LEF1 DNA binding sites but requiring β-catenin for its action (DasGupta and Fuchs, 1999); b) nuclear β-catenin (Merrill et al., 2001); c) AxinLacZ a second WNT reporter, knocked into the Axin2 locus (Ouspenskaia et al., 2016). We also now add Figure 6—figure supplement 4 in which we add the lentiviral WNT reporter GFP, and show its co-localization not only with LEF1 but also with other products of WNT target genes like TCF1/TCF7, FZD10 and WIF1. We used LEF1 frequently because our goal in those experiments was to use its nuclear intensity to reproducibly measure how WNT signaling changed when we manipulated WNT inhibitors. Indeed we show that nuclear LEF1 in progenitor cells from the developing hair follicle robustly responded to the porcupine inhibitor treatment and wash-out. We now explain this more clearly in the text, and these new data and our discussion of prior data make this all the more forceful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Protein expression: The analysis of Notum and Wif1 protein expression lacks quantification to show the localization of morphogens.

We added a new figure (now Figure 4) where we show the pixel intensity profiles measured from immunofluorescence images using antibodies against the endogenous proteins. We validated the antibodies using KO tissue. Furthermore we show a wider view of the optical section. We use whole-mount imaging as it takes into account the whole structure and not just a snapshot of the tissue. The new figure illustrates the localization of WIF1 and NOTUM in placodes, buds and germs and underscores the reproducibility of the apical polarization of WNT inhibitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The deletion of APC, while impacts Wnt signaling, would also impact other aspects of cells including DNA damage and cell adhesion. Have that authors examined whether DNA damage and cell adhesion was altered in the APC mutant?</p></disp-quote><p>Finally, the reviewers asked about the impact of APC on other major cellular functions apart from WNT signaling. To this end, we’ve added 3 new supplementary figures and one table (Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Figure 1—figure supplement 4, Figure 1—figure supplement 5, Figure 2—figure supplement 2). To access for DNA damage we used immunostaining to detect the phosphorylation of the histone γH2AX that is present when double strand breaks occur. As judged by this assay, <italic>Apc-null</italic> cells were comparable to heterozygous and wild type (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). By contrast, both cell-cell and cell substratum changes were observed. E-Cadherin was lost altogether, but P-cadherin was retained (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). Given the pioneering studies of Takeichi showing that E-cadherin and P-cadherin cells sort out in a dish, these data explain why <italic>Apc-</italic>null cells cluster tightly. In addition, we observed a loss of the integrin β4, accounting for the loss of polarization of the <italic>Apc-</italic>null clusters (Figure 1—figure supplement 5). The new table shows upregulated transcripts that fall into the cell adhesion gene ontology category (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p></body></sub-article></article>
