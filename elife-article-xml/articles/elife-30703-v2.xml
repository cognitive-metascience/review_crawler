Response to tissue injury can lead to either scar formation or complete tissue regeneration, which occurs in certain teleosts and amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wehner and Weidinger, 2015</xref>). Understanding repair in regenerative animals can help inform these processes in humans and other species where scar formation is the primary response to injury. Recent studies highlight the importance of early signaling events after damage, including the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS), in tissue regeneration in zebrafish and tadpoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gauron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Love et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoo et al., 2012</xref>). In tadpoles, injury induced ROS activate growth factor signaling pathways through Wnt and fibroblast growth factor (fgf) that mediate regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Love et al., 2013</xref>). Inhibiting early ROS signaling at damaged epithelium for just 1 hr pre-and post-injury in larval zebrafish impairs subsequent fin regeneration 3 days post-injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoo et al., 2012</xref>). Although a role for Src family kinase signaling has been implicated as a pathway downstream of this early ROS signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoo et al., 2012</xref>), the redox-dependent pathways that mediate full regeneration in zebrafish larvae remain unclear.</p><p>Movement of epithelial cells is thought to play key roles in ensuring proper wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">LeBert and Huttenlocher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sonnemann and Bement, 2011</xref>). During this migration, epithelial cells undergo a process known as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a progression conserved during normal development as well as the malignant transformation of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Craene and Berx, 2013</xref>). The intermediate filament protein vimentin is expressed during EMT and provides a marker of EMT during cell transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Craene and Berx, 2013</xref>). Although well characterized as a marker of EMT, how vimentin regulates wound healing is still unclear. A recent report demonstrated that vimentin regulates wound healing by affecting fibroblast proliferation and the differentiation of keratinocytes via transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) and Slug signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, vimentin has been implicated in regulating cell movements during wound repair, as seen with vimentin’s role in the collective movements of lens epithelium after damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Menko et al., 2014</xref>). In glial cells, vimentin polarizes toward the wound edge, in collaboration with the microtubule network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leduc and Etienne-Manneville, 2017</xref>). In recent studies, vimentin was shown to orient actin filaments and traction stress during single cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Costigliola et al., 2017</xref>). These recent studies suggest an important role for vimentin in regulating the movement of cells during wound repair.</p><p>In addition to cell movement, a critical stage of normal repair is the deposition of a collagen-rich extracellular matrix (ECM) to provide the framework for regenerative growth. The transient ECM that forms during wound healing is subsequently degraded during the remodeling phase of wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCarty and Percival, 2013</xref>). Collagen accumulates in response to tissue injury and it appears vimentin is required for this accumulation, likely indirectly as suggested by the deficiency of wound-associated fibroblasts in vimentin null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eckes et al., 2000</xref>). In addition to the production of collagen, a key step in the repair process is the remodeling of wound-induced collagen structures, probably through the action of proteases such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). In zebrafish larvae we recently reported a central role for MMP9 in collagen reorganization and regeneration after tail transection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">LeBert et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here we sought to determine the pathways that function downstream of wound-associated ROS that mediate wound healing and subsequent regrowth. We generated a reporter of mesenchymal cells by driving GFP from the <italic>vimentin</italic> promoter and found that early redox signaling at the wound was required for <italic>vimentin</italic> expression at the wound margin. We also found that inhibition of ROS, NFκB or depletion of vimentin impaired both <italic>collagen</italic> expression at the wound and the dynamic reorganization of collagen into projections. Live imaging demonstrated that these collagen projections guide epithelial regrowth during regeneration of the fin. Treatments that disrupt collagen organization, such as inhibition of cross-linking or destruction of collagen fibers by thermal injury, diminished the formation of epithelial projections and subsequent wound healing was impaired. These results provide a pathway linking early ROS signaling to the physical and mechanical processes of healing and regrowth. This healing process is mediated by vimentin and its regulation of collagen fiber/epithelial cell projections that promote the forward progression of the wound plane and lead to the regeneration of the caudal fin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of a <italic>vimentin</italic> reporter line in zebrafish</title><p>Previous studies demonstrated that loss of vimentin impaired wound healing in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eckes et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting that vimentin plays a role in tissue repair. To determine how <italic>vimentin</italic> is regulated in response to tissue injury in zebrafish larvae, we generated a reporter of <italic>vimentin</italic> expression by driving EGFP from the <italic>vimentin</italic> promoter, herein referred to as the <italic>Tg(−2vim:egfp)</italic> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Reporter activity was detected as early as the two somite stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and later observed in early differentiating neurons in the head and in glial cells within the developing spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). From 2–3 days post fertilization (dpf) the EGFP expression pattern was maintained in the cranial ganglion cells, spinal cord neurons and opercle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D,E,F</xref>). This expression pattern is consistent with the <italic>vimentin</italic> expression pattern previously shown by in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cerdà et al., 1998</xref>). We also noted EGFP expression in developing fin mesenchymal cells at 3 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,G</xref>). It is known that vimentin expression increases with the induction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franke et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thiery, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vuoriluoto et al., 2011</xref>). To examine the expression of this reporter during EMT we transiently expressed either wild type (HRas<sup>G12</sup>) or oncogenic RAS (HRas<sup>V12</sup>), tagged with RFP, from the <italic>krt4</italic> promoter in the <italic>Tg(−2vim:egfp)</italic> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>), thereby inducing EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Freisinger and Huttenlocher, 2014</xref>). Overexpression of oncogenic HRas<sup>V12</sup>, but not wild type HRas<sup>G12</sup>, induced <italic>vimentin</italic> promoter activity and expression of EGFP that co-localized in the same cells expressing HRas<sup>V12</sup>. Taken together, these data show that the <italic>Tg(−2vim:egfp)</italic> line recapitulated previously published in situ <italic>vimentin</italic> expression data and vimentin was expressed in cells undergoing EMT, thereby providing a powerful tool to report <italic>vimentin</italic> promoter activity in larval zebrafish.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30703.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of the <italic>Tg(−2vim:egfp)</italic> zebrafish line.</title><p>The <italic>Tg(−2vim:egfp)</italic> larvae express EGFP in cranial ganglion cells, spinal cord neurons, the opercle and fin fibroblasts.

To address this question, we performed whole mount in situ hybridization (WMISH) to probe <italic>vimentin</italic> expression in unwounded and wounded larvae and found that tail transection induced localized <italic>vimentin</italic> expression at the wound edge by 24 hr post wound (hpw), an outcome not observed with the sense probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To further characterize the population of cells that express <italic>vimentin</italic> at the wound edge (vim+), we utilized long duration time-lapse laser scanning confocal microscopy of living <italic>Tg(−2vim:egfp)</italic> reporter larvae. Interestingly, in the unwounded fin, the reporter line labeled a population of elongated mesenchymal cells that extend toward the tip of the fin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Since the majority of these vim+ cells in the fin were removed during the tail transection no clear signal was detected along the wound edge at 2 hpw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In accordance with the in situ results, vim+ cells were detected by 20 hpw at the wound edge and showed enhanced expression at 26 hpw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>). To determine if this population of vim+ cells at the wound edge resulted from the migration of distal vim+ cells, we performed long duration time-lapse laser scanning confocal microscopy in a controlled environment using the zWEDGI platform that is compatible with long term live imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huemer et al., 2017</xref>). Surprisingly, the vim+ cells did not migrate to the wound from surrounding fin tissue but rather expression developed in what appeared to be a non-motile population of cells at the wound edge (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). It should be noted that these vim+ cells did not appear to arise from epithelial cells based on live imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>). However, these data do not preclude the possibility that the vim+ cells are the result of an EMT event beyond the time resolution of our studies. Additionally, the vim+ cells did not appear to colocalize with a macrophage marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and their presence was not influenced by the depletion of leukocytes using the <italic>pu.1</italic> morpholino (MO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), suggesting that immune cells were not involved directly or indirectly in the vimentin expression. It is possible that a specialized population of cells, including a type of progenitor cell, migrates to the wound edge from the surrounding tissue and subsequently activates the v<italic>imentin</italic> promoter, although our studies cannot confirm this possibility. Regardless, our findings demonstrate that wounding induces a population of vim+ cells along the wound edge.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30703.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A population of vimentin-positive cells with a rounded morphology developed at the wound edge and associate with areas of collagen misalignment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whole mount in situ hybridization for <italic>vimentin</italic> RNA in 4 dpf unwounded larvae.

Our earlier work demonstrated that early ROS signaling immediately before and after damage, mediated fin regeneration three days later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoo et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we sought to determine whether early wound-induced ROS mediate <italic>vimentin</italic> expression at the wound. Using a pharmacological inhibitor of NAD(P)H oxidase enzyme activity, Diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), we found that inhibition of ROS for 1 hr before and 1 hr after wounding was sufficient to impair the appearance of vim+ cells at the wound edge 1 dpw in the <italic>Tg(−2vim:egfp)</italic> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). Reduced reporter activity after tail transection with early ROS inhibition was quantified by assessing the relative fluorescence intensity above background at the wound edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). Similar results were observed with morpholino depletion of Duox1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoo et al., 2012</xref>), which is necessary for the generation of wound-induced ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>). Previous studies using a transgenic nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) activation reporter <italic>Tg(nfκb:egfp)</italic> line showed that early ROS signaling regulates NFκB activity following caudal fin amputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Oliveira et al., 2014</xref>). This led us to investigate if ROS was regulating <italic>vimentin</italic> activation through NFκB. Using a pharmacological inhibitor of NFκB activation, Withaferin A (WA), which has previously been shown to inhibit caudal fin wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">LeBert et al., 2015</xref>), we found that early inhibition of NFκB was sufficient to block EGFP expression at 1 dpw in the <italic>Tg(−2vim:egfp)</italic> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). It should be noted that WA can directly inhibit the vimentin protein, and thus the influence of WA downstream of <italic>vimentin</italic> promoter activation must also be considered. However, the findings suggest that early ROS signaling, likely at least in part through NFκB activity, regulates <italic>vimentin</italic> promoter activation at 1 dpw following caudal fin amputation.</p><p>The radiating, elongated morphology of the vim+ cells in the unwounded fin was reminiscent of the pattern previously reported for collagen fibers in the developing zebrafish fin using second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">LeBert et al., 2015</xref>). To address a possible association between the vim+ cells and collagen fibers, we performed SHG imaging of the caudal fin in the <italic>Tg(−2vim:egfp)</italic> line.

To determine whether vimentin is required for larval caudal fin regeneration, we used morpholino depletion of <italic>vimentin</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We found that vimentin-deficient larvae had impaired regenerate area and regenerate length at 3 dpw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), indicating that vimentin is required for proper wound healing. This defect was wound-specific, as unwounded morphants did not display a defect in fin length or area compared to age matched controls during normal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F–H</xref>). These findings are consistent with the wound defect reported with VIM-/- mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eckes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Menko et al., 2014</xref>). It should also be noted that vimentin-deficient larvae displayed no defect in the appearance of vim+ cells at the wound edge following amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), indicating that vimentin is not required for the activation of the <italic>vimentin</italic> promoter along the wound edge. To determine if the regenerative defect was due to effects on cell survival, we assessed apoptosis by TUNEL staining. No defect was observed in the vimentin-deficient larvae at 1 hpw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>), providing evidence that the wound healing defect is likely not due to changes in cell survival. To confirm that the regeneration defect was not due to off-target effects of the MO, we rescued <italic>vimentin</italic> expression using co-injection of <italic>vimentin</italic> MO1 and zebrafish <italic>vimentin</italic> RNA and also used a second MO (MO2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>).

The CRISPR was validated by TOPO cloning and sequencing of individual F0 larvae as well as by sequencing germline DNA isolated from F0 adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>).

During regeneration of the caudal fin following amputation, the wound edge formed an uneven border that contained growing epithelial cell extensions (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). The formation of these epithelial extensions, herein referred to as projections, was not present during normal development of the caudal fin, which occurred with the extension of a smooth fin edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The first visible projections after tail transection could be identified at 18 hpw and became prominent by 24 hpw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The projections continued to extend and new projections formed throughout wound repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). By contrast, vimentin-deficient larvae possessed a smooth wound edge and relative absence of the epithelial projections for more than 24 hpw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref>).

We observed thin finger-like projections at the wound edge that extended around fibrillar proteins that protruded into the tips of the projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). This observation of fibrillar structures was supported by LC-PolScope microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oldenbourg, 2005</xref>) suggesting that the fibrillar protein was a collagen structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keikhosravi et al., 2017</xref>). LC-PolScope, although similar to traditional polarized light microscopy, uses near circular polarized light that permits high sensitivity detection of fibers in all directions. These fibers appeared to induce a physical stress on the epithelial projections since the epithelial cells, whose membranes are also birefringent and can be detected with LC-PolScope microscopy, appear elongated, with the cell membranes stretched outward around the fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). To further characterize these projections, we used SHG microscopy. Live SHG imaging after tail transection confirmed the presence of fibers in the projections and indicated a close association between the fibers and the projecting epithelial cells. Notably, the SHG fibers appeared to push the epithelial cells outward during extension of the wound edge (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video3">Figure 4—video 3</xref>). These findings suggest that the SHG fibers in the caudal fin, which we have previously shown are important for proper wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">LeBert et al., 2015</xref>), play a guidance role in the formation of epithelial projections during wound repair. This was more clearly shown by dual imaging of SHG fibers and cell borders, using both phalloidin staining on fixed samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) or by performing live imaging of the <italic>Tg(krt4:egfp-caax)</italic> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video4">Figure 4—video 4</xref>).

To determine if perturbing collagen cross linking affects the formation of projections and wound repair, we used a pharmacological inhibitor of lysyl oxidase, beta aminopropionitrile (BAPN) to inhibit collagen I cross-linking and the formation of collagen I fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kagan and Li, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pinnell and Martin, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tang et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wilmarth and Froines, 1992</xref>). Constant inhibition of lysyl oxidase throughout the wound healing process caused a significant reduction in regeneration of the larval fin at 2 dpw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Experiments to 3 dpw were not possible as the inhibitor caused lethality in both wounded and un-wounded larvae between 4 and 5 dpf (data not shown). It is possible that the observed effects on regeneration were in part due to toxicity but it should be noted that no effect on developmental fin length was observed at the concentration that impaired regeneration. We next performed SHG imaging to determine if a defect in collagen fiber projections was also present. Interestingly, BAPN treatment caused an increase in contour length over control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). We believe this to be a consequence of the measurement technique, as the V-shaped fin in the BAPN treated larvae created more contour to measure. However, the BAPN treatment caused a significant decrease in SHG fiber mean angle, consistent with vimentin-deficient larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and indicates a disruption in fiber organization.

Using short bursts of stimulation from a cauterizing wire, we generated a wound to the caudal fin epithelium that also caused significant damage to the integrity of the SHG fibers near the wound edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) such that fibers were absent from the region adjacent to the wound. We performed SHG imaging on phalloidin labeled samples 24 hr post burn (hpb) and again observed a striking absence of fibers in the region near the wound edge in the burned caudal fins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). To determine if fins experiencing a burn wound and subsequent loss of collagen fiber integrity along the wound edge impacted healing dynamics, we compared burned caudal fins to age-matched, caudal fin-amputated larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Compared to amputated fins, burn wounds resulting in a loss of SHG fiber integrity led to a significant reduction in the percentage of larvae displaying epithelial projections at 24 hpb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>).

Using live imaging, our work uncovered a previously unknown mechanism whereby collagen projections at the wound edge guide epithelial growth during fin regeneration, a process dependent on vimentin. In response to wounding, cells at the wound edge turn on <italic>vimentin</italic> expression and are critical for an increase in <italic>collagen</italic> expression and subsequent collagen reorganization at the wound that promotes proper tissue repair. This finding suggests that vim+ cells affect the behavior of adjacent tissues by regulating the scaffold needed for regenerative outgrowth through the polarized formation of epithelial membrane extensions. Further, direct disruption of collagen organization by burn wound impairs the formation of the projections and subsequent regrowth.</p><p>Our findings suggest that vim+ cells are critical to generate a wound microenvironment that optimizes for efficient wound healing in zebrafish larvae. It was an unexpected finding that the vim+ cells in the fin did not migrate to the wound margin, but rather remained stationary while a population of cells at the wound turned on expression of <italic>vimentin</italic>. This population of cells was also not particularly motile but appeared to be critical for regulating the collagen scaffold for epithelial projections that ultimately led to efficient wound repair. The idea that vimentin regulates cell migration has been long established, however, recent studies have also highlighted the role of vimentin in regulating ECM production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Darby et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eckes et al., 2000</xref>). Vimentin regulates collagen mRNA through Larp6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Challa and Stefanovic, 2011</xref>) and was also shown to regulate collagen accumulation at the wound in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2016</xref>). Herein, we support, and extend, the evidence of these previous studies by showing a critical role for vimentin in both collagen expression and its dynamic reorganization during the repair process in zebrafish larvae.</p><p>Substantial evidence implicates injury-induced ROS as a key player in modulating tissue regeneration. Prior studies indicate ROS regulates growth factor pathways such as Wnt/fgf signaling after amputation in Xenopus tadpoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Love et al., 2013</xref>). Our findings identify a new pathway through which ROS can regulate regeneration through a population of vim+ cells at the wound margin. We propose that ROS stimulates <italic>vimentin</italic> expression in a population of cells at the wound through its effects on NFκB activity. NFκB is known to be a redox sensitive transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakajima and Kitamura, 2013</xref>). Moreover, wound induced activation of DUOX1 and the generation of hydrogen peroxide appears to be critical for the activation of NFκB reporter activity in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Oliveira et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, these findings provide a link between ROS, NFκB and the organization of collagen at the wound margin to promote healing. Moreover, these findings, in combination with published work, suggest that redox signaling may have beneficial effects on the ECM in the wound microenvironment to promote wound healing in zebrafish. It is interesting to speculate that this may also be the case in humans, rather than just having the detrimental effects suggested by some clinical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dhall et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Long-term time-lapse imaging of SHG and epithelial cell dynamics demonstrated a close association between the extending SHG filaments and the epithelial cell projections. This imaging supports a role for these collagen projections in guiding the epithelial membrane extensions. As the collagen projections progressed the epithelial cells showed close apposition to these ECM structures. In future studies, it will be intriguing to investigate the adhesion sites that form in these projections and if integrin-containing focal contact sites are critical for this guidance. The absence of projections when collagen cross-linking was impaired supports a key role for these structures in tissue guidance. A caveat is that this treatment was ultimately toxic at later developmental stages, preventing longer term analysis of these effects.</p><p>Further support for a role of these SHG fibers in tissue guidance and wound healing was based on our findings with caudal fin burn wounds. The localized caudal fin burn wound led to a complete loss in SHG signal in the wound margin. This burn wound response was surprisingly different from the wound ECM response in the well-studied tail transection model and makes it a unique model for future studies. This type of thermal damage abrogated epithelial projections and significantly impaired regeneration and repair of the fin in the time frame examined. It is also relevant to highlight that fin growth during normal development does not exhibit this type of collagen guidance, but rather progresses as a smooth surface without projections. These findings highlight the key role for collagen as a guidance cue that can promote wound healing in some contexts. In agreement with this idea substantial clinical efforts have focused on utilizing collagen scaffoldings with promising results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reilly et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tracy et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our findings suggest that caudal fin transection induces a ROS mediated program leading to a collagen matrix organization that guides epithelial behavior and wound repair. Key to this work was the ability to live image the process of wound healing over extended durations. Using a new reporter of vim+ mesenchymal cells our findings revealed that this cell population did not migrate during wound healing but rather regulated the wound microenvironment to promote efficient regeneration. To our knowledge, this was the first time that collagen structure using SHG and epithelial cell membranes were imaged long term in vivo, allowing the identification of these dynamic cell projections that occur during fin growth after injury. This type of study highlights the power of zebrafish for imaging dynamic processes over time in vivo to uncover new mechanisms of regulation. However, a caveat is that it remains unclear how these observations translate to mammalian wound healing. As cutaneous wounds are a worldwide clinical problem, the findings suggest the possibility that zebrafish may be a powerful tool to identify new mechanisms that regulate collagen re-organization, guiding future development of therapeutics focused on optimal repair of different types of wounds, including mechanical injury and burn wounds.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="bottom">Designation</th><th valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (Danio Rerio)</td><td valign="bottom">vimentin(vim)</td><td valign="bottom">this paper</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">crispr RNA targeting exon 1 <break/>(5’- CAAAGGAGCGTCCCGGGT – 3’)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain (D.

The system was controlled using the OpenPolScope hardware and software for birefringence imaging (openpolscope.org) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keikhosravi et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Analysis of projections at the wound edge</title><p>Larvae were fixed at 1 dpw (3 dpf) as described above. Caudal fins were imaged using a Zeiss Zoomscope microscope using a Zeiss PlanNeoFluar Z 1X:0.25 FWD 56 mm lens. Images were then assessed for the presence or absence of projections along the amputated plane.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Analysis of SHG projections at the wound edge</title><p>Because of the three dimensional nature of the caudal fin, for ease of analysis sum z-projections of SHG images were generated in FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). In FIJI, a 512 pixel (215 micron) region, at the wound edge distal to, and centered on, the tip of the notochord was used as the region of interest (ROI). Contour length was determined by a freehand line tracing the detailed contour of the fibers at the wound edge. Analysis of SHG fiber angle relative to the wound edge was conducted using CurveAlign open source software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bredfeldt et al., 2014</xref>); liu et al., 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schneider et al., 2013</xref>). SHG and bright field z-stacks were z-projected using FIJI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fiji.sc/">https://fiji.sc/</ext-link>), and the resulting 2D images were used for analysis. Within the CurveAlign software, the wound edge was drawn on the bright field image and then applied as a boundary for the CurveAlign analysis. In CurveAlign, curvelets fiber representation (CFR) mode was used to track individual fibers and each fiber was represented as a group of curvelets that have localized fiber orientation information. The angle of each curvelet, relative to the wound boundary and within a 60 micron distance from that boundary, was determined. The mean value of these angles was used as the overall orientation value for each tail.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>RNA extraction for qRT-PCR</title><p>RNA was extracted from an approximately 500 µm length portion of the fin using the miRvana RNA purification kit (Ambion). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using super script III (Invitrogen).

Annealed oligos were ligated into the vector using quick ligase (New England Biolabs). Single colonies were selected following transformation and digest confirmed with BglII. Candidate plasmids were sequenced using M13 primer. Sequence confirmed plasmids were linearized with BamHI (New England Biolabs) and in vitro transcribed using MAXIScript T7 kit (Ambion, Life Technologies). The resulting guide RNA was injected into the yolk at the one cell stage at a volume of 2 nl. The final concentrations of the injection mixes were as follows: gRNA at ~40 ng/μl and Cas9 protein (New England Biolabs) at ~55 ng/μL. To confirm, 2–5 dpf larval zebrafish were individually digested overnight at room temperature in 100 µl DNAzol plus 200 µg/µl proteinase K.

A fine tip cautery (BVI Accu-Temp; cat #8442000) was used to burn the caudal fin. The cautery was turned on after being placed into the water and was held on the posterior tip of the caudal fin for 1–2 s, until a slight bend in the fin was apparent. After the burn, fish were placed into a clean milk-treated 35 mm petri dish with fresh E3 and held in an incubator at 28.5 degrees. For regeneration assessment, embryos were imaged at 1 and 2 dpw on a Zoomscope (EMS3/SyCoP3; Zeiss; Plan-NeoFluar Z objective). Images were taken on an Axiocam MRm CCD camera using ZEN pro 2012 software (Zeiss).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical parameters are included in the figure legends including the number of experimental replicates and total ‘n’.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Damage-induced reactive oxygen species regulates <italic>vimentin</italic> and dynamic collagen-based projections to mediate wound repair&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Fiona Watt as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Victoriano Mulero (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study reports the generation of a <italic>vimentin</italic> reporter zebrafish line to study in vivo, in real time, EMT during wound repair. Pharmacological inhibition studies show that <italic>vimentin</italic> activation in the wound is downstream of ROS and NFkB. Genetic experiments show that <italic>vimentin</italic> is required for regeneration and vim+ cells are associated with, and required for, extension of collagen fibers. Finally, disruption of collagen fibers by impairing their crosslinking or in a new burn-wounding model impairs healing. The study is well performed and provides new insights into the role of <italic>vimentin</italic> in the healing process.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) The morpholino activity is not sufficiently validated in comparison with the CRISPR-Cas9 mutant. The reviewers are not suggesting that the authors should repeat all the experiments using the mutant; however, additional validation of the morpholino effects would strengthen the work significantly.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>: although the pictures and Video 1 show that epithelial (<italic>krt4</italic>+) and mesenchymal (vim+) cells do not colocalize in the wound edge, the video should be performed in <italic>krt4:tom;vim:gfp</italic> larvae to confirm that keratinocytes do not show EMT. In addition, the authors should use a genetic inhibition approach, at least for ROS, to confirm the results, since DPI is not specific and side effects are expected at the high concentration used. Imaging of ROS and NFkB using appropriate reporters may also reveal if these signals are intrinsically required by cells activating <italic>vimentin</italic> in the wound.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>: as in point 2, genetic inhibition and reporters would be very informative.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>: these results show that collagen fiber disruption impairs regeneration.

We have also shown that transient CRIPSR replicates the findings shown with MO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-G</xref>). It is important to note that the <italic>vimentin</italic> deficient line recapitulates findings in the <italic>vimentin</italic> knockout mice where it has been previously reported that there is a defect in wound healing and collagen accumulation at the wound. Our findings extend these reports by performing live imaging of wound healing using a novel <italic>vimentin</italic> reporter line. We spent substantial effort to develop and characterize the <italic>vimentin</italic> mutant; unfortunately, the mutant is not ready for validation and will require several more outcrosses before it can be used for these studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>: although the pictures and Video 1 show that epithelial (krt4+) and mesenchymal (vim+) cells do not colocalize in the wound edge, the video should be performed in krt4:tom;vim:gfp larvae to confirm that keratinocytes do not show EMT.
