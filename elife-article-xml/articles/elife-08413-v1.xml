expansion whilst retaining the potential to differentiate into all mature cell populations. However, these cells harbor significant risks, including tumor formation upon transplantation. One way to mitigate this risk is to develop expandable progenitor cell populations with restricted differentiation potential. Here, we used a cellular microarray technology to identify a defined and optimized culture condition that supports the derivation and propagation of a cell population with mesodermal properties. This cell population, referred to as intermediate mesodermal progenitor (IMP) cells, is capable of unlimited expansion, lacks tumor formation potential, and, upon appropriate stimulation, readily acquires properties of a sub-population of kidney cells. Interestingly, IMP cells fail to differentiate into other mesodermally-derived tissues, including blood and heart, suggesting that these cells are restricted to an intermediate mesodermal fate.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08413.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08413.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08413.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The development of ‘human pluripotent stem cells’ has the potential to revolutionize the future of medicine. This is because these cells can both replicate themselves indefinitely (i.e., they can self-renew) and develop into any of the cell types found in the human body (a process that is referred to as differentiation). These abilities mean that the cells could in theory be used to replace any tissues or organs that have been damaged by disease or injury. Unfortunately, transplanting stem cells that are capable of developing into any type of cell comes with the significant risk that these cells will form into a tumor.</p><p>Once a cell has started to differentiate it can typically only go on to generate a restricted number of cell types. However, these differentiating cells also generally lose their ability to self-renew. Kumar et al. set out to challenge this fundamental property of differentiating cells. A high throughput-screening approach was used to test thousands of combinations of bioactive molecules (i.e., molecules that are known to affect living cells in different ways) to identify some that could promote the self-renewal of cells with a restricted potential to differentiate.</p><p>Kumar et al. found specific conditions that could cause a population of cells, which they referred to as ‘intermediate mesodermal progenitor cells’ (or IMP cells for short), to self renew. These cells resemble those found in the middle layer of a very early human embryo, which typically go on to develop into only a subset of tissue types in the body—for example, muscle, kidneys and blood vessels, but not brain or lungs. Yet, when Kumar et al. stimulated the self-renewing IMP cells, these cells only differentiated into the cell types that make up the kidney and not any other types of cell.</p><p>This tight restriction on the differentiation potential of these cells is highly important, because it means that these cells could greatly advance methods to generate kidney cells or even whole kidneys in the laboratory that are suitable for transplantation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08413.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08413.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>pluripotent stem cell</kwd><kwd>intermediate mesoderm</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd><kwd>arrayed cellular microenvironment</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RB3-05086</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>Nathan</given-names></name><name><surname>Richter</surname><given-names>Jenna</given-names></name><name><surname>Brafman</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Willert</surname><given-names>Karl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01-DK089567</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>Nathan</given-names></name><name><surname>Brafman</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Willert</surname><given-names>Karl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An expandable cell population derived from human pluripotent stem cells exhibits properties of mesoderm and is restricted to differentiate into derivatives of intermediate mesoderm.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs; including human embryonic stem [hES] cells and human induced pluripotent stem [hiPS] cells) have the potential to generate the various cell types of the adult body. With their capacity to expand indefinitely, hPSCs provide a potentially unlimited source of mature cell types that can be used for disease modeling, drug discovery, and regenerative medicine purposes. Current methods for generating these therapeutically relevant cell types follow a linear approach in which hPSCs are differentiated in small, discrete steps that mimic the sequence of events occurring during development. The initial step typically involves specification of hPSCs into one of the three embryonic germ layers—ectoderm (EC), endoderm (EN), or mesoderm.</p><p>In the case of mesoderm, several protocols have been developed to derive mature tissues stemming from this lineage, including muscle, blood, and urogenital cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kee and Reijo Pera, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Taguchi et al., 2014</xref>). While these studies have demonstrated the potential of hPSC-derived mesodermal tissues for cell replacement therapies, these protocols result in the generation of heterogeneous cell populations, some with tumor forming potential, which limits their clinical utility. Additionally, because of the inefficiency of these established protocols, large numbers of input cells are necessary to generate cell types in the quantities necessary for clinical applications.</p><p>Expansion of intermediate progenitor populations of differentiating hPSCs followed by subsequent differentiation is an alternative approach for generating highly enriched and well-defined cell populations required for cell-based therapies and disease modeling. For example, homogenous, expandable ectodermally- and endodermally-restricted progenitor populations have been generated from hPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reubinoff et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>). However, similar methods to generate cell types restricted to the mesodermal lineage have yet to be developed.</p><p>The cell microenvironment plays a critical role for regulating self-renewal and differentiation of many progenitor cell populations that exist within the developing and fully mature adult organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Moore and Lemischka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones and Wagers, 2008</xref>). In this study, we used a multifactorial high-throughput screening technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flaim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brafman et al., 2012</xref>) to engineer in vitro microenvironments that allow for the homogenous expansion of a hPSC-derived mesodermally restricted progenitor population, which we refer to as mesodermal progenitors (MPs). Gene expression analysis and differentiation assays indicated that these cell lack tumor forming potential and exhibit properties associated with intermediate mesoderm, an observation that led us to re-name MP cells as intermediate mesodermal progenitor (IMP) cells. Upon modulation of their culture conditions, IMPs readily generate cell types of the renal lineage. Interestingly, IMP cells fail to differentiate into other mesodermal lineages, such as blood and cardiac muscle. Therefore, IMP cells provide a useful tool to not only study the mechanisms that regulate human mesoderm development but also a homogenous, non-tumorigenic cell source for regenerative medicine purposes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ACME screen to identify culture conditions of MP cells</title><p>Using a high-throughput screening platform previously developed in our laboratory referred to as arrayed cellular microenvironments (ACMEs, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brafman et al., 2012</xref>]) we sought to identify culture conditions to derive, maintain and expand a cell population with mesodermal properties from hPSCs (including human embryonic and human induced pluripotent stem [hES and iPS] cells). To readily observe and detect acquisition of a mesodermal phenotype, we utilized the hES cell line H9/WA09 harboring the gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the <italic>Brachyury</italic> (<italic>T</italic>) promoter (referred to as H9-T-GFP; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kita-Matsuo et al., 2009</xref>]). <italic>Brachyury</italic>, which is expressed early in embryonic development in the primitive streak, is transiently expressed as hPSCs exit the pluripotent state and differentiate into mesodermal (ME) lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rivera-Perez and Magnuson, 2005</xref>).</p><p>To induce mesodermal differentiation, we treated H9-T-GFP cells with the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR98014 (CHR) for 2 days, at which point cells uniformly expressed GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and were seeded onto ACME slides printed with combinations of bioactive molecules. We performed two sequential screens to identify conditions that maintain GFP expression over a 3-day period: a first screen to identify an optimal substrate composed of extracellular matrix proteins (ECMPs), and a second screen to identify growth factors (GFs) and small molecules (SMs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The second screen was performed using the optimal substrate composition identified in the first screen.

Hit conditions were defined as those ECMP combinations that supported maximal cell numbers, as well as GFP expression. The distribution of total cell number and GFP signal intensity across conditions was summarized in a normalized, clustered heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, several defined ECMP combinations increased total cell number relative to Matrigel, a commercially available extracellular matrix that is commonly used for growth of hPSCs and their derivatives. Further, several ECMP combinations maintained expression of GFP to a greater extent than Matrigel. Cells growing on one of these representative ‘hit’ conditions (C1 C3 C4 FN VN) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>.</p><p>For the second GF and SM screen, we used one of the optimal matrix compositions (C1 C3 C4 FN VN) as a substrate to deposit combinations of up to three GF and SM, which are known to exert potent effects during early developmental processes. Certain factor combinations increased, while others decreased, cell number and GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Conditions with positive effects in this assay contained a Wnt agonist (either Wnt3a [WNT] or CHR) and a member of the FGF superfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Consistent with this observation, a global main effects principal component analysis of all GF and SM revealed that CHR, WNT, Rspondin and FGF exerted the most potent effects on GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To a lesser extent, the FGF family members VEGF (VGF) and KGF, also positively influenced GFP expression, whereas Wnt antagonists (DKK1 and IWP2) negatively influenced GFP expression.</p><p>We confirmed the ECMP hit conditions by scaling up the 10 top-performing matrix compositions shown in the heatmap of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> into traditional cell culture formats. Compared to Matrigel and a sub-optimal matrix (C1 C4 C5 LN), 8 of the 10 ECMP hit conditions significantly increased the percentage of GFP positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Importantly, in this scaled-up format, the optimal matrix identified in the primary screen (C1 C3 C4 FN VN) consistently led to higher cell numbers and GFP expression compared to the other top ECMP combinations, thus demonstrating the robustness of the ACME screening platform.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08413.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Validation of high-throughput ACME screens.</title><p>Scale up analysis of hits from the ACME screens.

By using the ACME screening technology, we were able to simultaneously define and optimize derivation and expansion conditions for these intermediate mesodermal progenitor (IMP) cells. Although it was our initial intention to produce a progenitor cell population with broad differentiation potential into all mesodermally-derived tissues, we made the surprising finding that the differentiation potential of these IMP cells was restricted to the IM lineage. Consequently, we were unable to coax IMP cells to differentiate into cell types derived from LM, such as blood and CMs. This exquisite lineage restriction was particularly surprising in light of the expression of multiple pan-mesodermal marker genes, such as <italic>LHX1</italic>, <italic>MESP1</italic> and <italic>MIXL1</italic>. Given their ability to differentiate into cell types with gene expression patterns associated with renal lineages, we hypothesize that this IMP cell population is an in vitro counterpart to intermediate mesoderm. It will be interesting to investigate whether IMP cells are capable of differentiating into other derivatives of intermediate mesoderm, such as the Wolffian and Müllerian ducts of the developing reproductive system.</p><p>Generation of expandable, lineage restricted progenitor cell populations offers several advantages over the use of undifferentiated hPSCs in tissue engineering approaches. First, differentiated cultures derived directly from hPSCs often harbor undifferentiated cells, which retain the potential to seed tumor growth. Such tumor-initiating potential is problematic when cells are intended for transplantation to repair or replace damaged tissue. Based on our sub-cutaneous injections into immune-compromised mice, IMP cells do not grow into teratomas, a defining property of undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells. Our gene expression analysis provides further evidence of this loss of pluripotency and hence of teratoma-seeding potential: IMP cells express nearly undetectable levels of pluripotency markers, such as <italic>POU5F1</italic>/<italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>SOX2</italic>, both of which show residual expression in mesodermally differentiated hPSCs. Second, lineage-restricted progenitors require less elaborate manipulation to derive more mature cell populations. In the case of the IMP cells, early differentiation steps to usher cells into a mesodermal lineage are no longer needed, thereby truncating differentiation protocols to derive more mature cell populations. A third benefit for using expanded progenitor cells is that such cultures are often quite homogenous. In contrast, hPSC cultures instructed to differentiate into a specific lineage generally contain other cell types. Therefore, the yield of more mature cell types upon subsequent differentiation is higher when starting with a homogenous, lineage restricted cell population than when starting with undifferentiated hPSCs.</p><p>The conditions that we developed for the culture and expansion of IMP cells are fully defined and free from animal-derived components, which will be important when cells are intended for therapeutic applications. Moreover, these optimized conditions are robust, as demonstrated by their ability to support derivation and expansion of IMP cells from two hES (H9 and Hues9) and one hiPS (RiPS) cell lines. Additionally, IMP cells grown in these optimized conditions can be frozen and thawed without any detectable effect on proliferative capacity or differentiation potential. Finally, these optimized conditions allow for near unlimited expansion to quantities (∼10<sup>20</sup>) necessary for drug screening or regenerative medicine purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Expandable lineage restricted cell populations have been developed for other lineages, including the neural and EN lineages. Several protocols have been described for the derivation of neural progenitor (NP) cells, which can proliferate extensively and differentiate into all the neural lineages and supporting cells (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes) that compromise the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reubinoff et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>). EN progenitor (EP) cells represent another example of lineage restricted progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>). These cells retain the ability to differentiate into endodermally derived tissues, including liver and pancreas. Interestingly, differentiation into functional beta-cells is greatly improved when starting with EP cells compared to undifferentiated hPSCs.</p><p>Although both EP and IMP cells exhibit restriction with respect to their developmental potency, IMP cells are more severely restricted as they fail to produce certain mesodermally-derived cell populations, such as blood and heart muscle. We currently do not understand the mechanism by which the culture conditions defined for the derivation and expansion of IMP cells lead to this highly restricted developmental potential. During embryogenesis, as the mesoderm emerges and migrates from the primitive streak, it is further specified into PM, LM, and IM. Interestingly, both FGF and WNT/β-catenin signaling regulate this ME cell specification, migration, and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciruna and Rossant, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sweetman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aulehla and Pourquie, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Along similar lines, modulation of the certain signaling pathways, such as WNT, can further refine and specify the differentiation potential of hPSC-derived progenitors. For example, we previously showed that levels of WNT/β-catenin signaling instruct the positional identity of NPCs and, upon subsequent differentiation, of the resulting neuronal cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moya et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, high levels of WNT signaling instructed NP cells to adopt a posterior fate, consistent with WNT's role in posterior patterning during development. In a separate study, the level of WNT activation achieved through GSK3-β inhibition was found to directly influence the ME subtype of differentiating hPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mendjan et al., 2014</xref>). We speculate that continuous activation of the WNT and FGF signaling pathways is acting not only to stabilize the IMP cell state, but also to restrict its differentiation potential to cell types derived from the IM lineage.</p><p>The development of lineage-restricted progenitors offers an opportunity to investigate mechanisms by which specific developmental stages can be paused. Recent studies to profile epigenetic changes during the differentiation of hPSCs to pancreatic beta cells indicate that specific chromosomal regions open during specific windows of differentiation, thereby conferring a certain developmental competence to sequentially acquire increased lineage restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In the future, the intermediate mesodermally restricted cell population described here can provide a further window into the mechanisms by which developmental competence is established and maintained.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>hPSC culture</title><p>Human ES cell lines H9 and Hues9 were obtained from WiCell and Harvard University, respectively.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Amy Wagers, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors report on a new system to derive mesodermal progenitor cells from human pluripotent stem cells. They use an arrayed cellular microenvironments (ACME) system to identify and optimize culture conditions to support derivation of this population of cells, and show that this MP population differentiates readily along the renal lineage, but does not generate blood or cardiac cell fates. Overall, the reviewers found the manuscript interesting and the data of high quality. The reviewers agreed that the cellular microarray technology employed is clever and of potential broad interest to other groups seeking to generate defined cell types from pluripotent cells, as establishing appropriate in vitro conditions to “capture” the desired cell fate is often a bottleneck for such endeavors. While the ACME system itself has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brafman et al., 2012</xref>), its application to hPSC differentiation has not previously been reported. Also, the new protocol described for the generation of expandable mesodermal precursors is novel, and likely to be useful for a number of other laboratories and studies. However, all three reviewers raised concerns that the testing done thus far of renal differentiation is inadequate. A more stringent assessment of the potential of these cells is needed for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, and the reviewers have provided specific suggestions to address this point below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The experiments testing differentiation capacity to renal lineage are not entirely convincing. Using a single cell disassociation and re-aggregation assay, the authors show that the MP cells incorporate around a cap-mesenchyme-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The problem is that this by no means shows renal lineage differentiation. The MP have a location consistent with FoxD1<sup>+</sup> mesenchyme, which go on to develop into renal stroma. But there is no co-staining for FoxD1 to prove that these cells have actually differentiated into the renal lineage. Nor is there co-staining for Six2 to delineate the location of the cap mesenchyme. It is surprising that the MPs apparently do not integrate into the Six2<sup>+</sup> cap mesenchyme – which should be present in this reaggregation assay – given that the authors show the potential of these cells to express Six2, or at least a fraction of them. The embryonic rat spinal cord assay results are similarly hard to interpret. ECAD and LTL expression are evident, but there is no clear tubule-like structure. Others have published very nephron-like structures using this assay, and even glomerulus-like structures. The Six2 expression is punctate, and scattered across the cell population. In nephrogenesis, Six2<sup>+</sup> cells aggregate adjacent to one another, in the cap mesenchyme sitting on top of the ureteric-bud. These structures have all been published by others using the two assays shown here, but there is no real incorporation of the MP cells into nephron-like structures. The study therefore requires better evidence of true differentiation into renal lineage and incorporation of MP-derived cells into nephron-like structures in order to prove that this new line has actual renal potential and should examine the histogenetic potential of the MP-derived cells in both types of explant systems employed. A more informative study would be to harvest the MP-derived cells from the two types of explants and ascertain the differentiation endpoints of these cells by transcriptome analysis (e.g. RNA-Seq) against the kidney cells (as for the analysis of the MM cells in vitro, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Additionally, the developmental potency of the MP cells may be studied by testing if MP cells alone can generate both metanephric mesenchyme and ureteric bud/nephron progenitors, as shown previously for hESCs in other studies. The authors should consider the type of analysis published by Little (Nat Cell Bio 2014 January;16(1):118–26) and Belmonte (Nat Cell Bio 2013 December;15(12):1507–15). In these studies, researchers took their candidate cells and, using the same reaggregation assays these authors used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>, clearly showed by high power confocal, that their human ES-derived cells integrated into differentiated structures. In Little's case, into Six2<sup>+</sup> cap mesenchyme as well as into a tubule-like structure. At present, the current manuscript shows no integration – just the presence of HuNu<sup>+</sup> cells around an epithelial structure. This reaggregation assay needs to be pushed further, i.e., (1) to generate real tubules and determine if any cells integrate, (2) to co-stain for cap mesenchyme (Six2) and determine if the cells integrate there, and (3) to co-stain for stromal progenitors (FoxD1) and ask if cells integrate there. Alternative, but also less stringent options, might be to extend the spinal cord assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8DE</xref> to determine if tubules are formed that contain lumens, polarized expression. These studies must use high power images, as the low power ones available in the current manuscript are insufficient to discriminate the morphological features. Finally, if it proves technically difficult to evaluate the morphogenetic potential of the MP-derived cells in these explants, an in-depth molecular profiling of the MP-derived cells in the explants could be performed to establish the identity of these cells at the endpoint of the culture experiment.</p><p>2) Regarding differentiation of MP cells along non-renal lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), it would be useful to extend the analysis past day 14 to test the possibility that MP cells are simply delayed in their differentiation along these lineages.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Generation of an expandable intermediate mesoderm restricted progenitor cell line from human pluripotent stem cells” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

We have included additional immunofluorescence (IF) data that clearly demonstrate that metanephric mesenchyme (MM) derived from IMP cells efficiently incorporate into the mesenchyme surrounding tubule-like structures. In addition, we show that these cells co-stain for FOXD1 and the lectin LTL, both markers of kidney mesenchyme. We made the following changes to the manuscript to include this new data:</p><p>A) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> now shows the spinal cord induction assay. This experiment is informative as it shows that the IMP cells differentiate to express mature markers of the developing kidney, including ECAD, LTL, SALL1 and SIX2. In contrast, undifferentiated hES cells fail to express any of these markers.</p><p>B) Since the spinal cord co-culture experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> did not produce clear nephron-like structures, we also performed kidney re-aggregation assays. This data was originally shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>. We now show this data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> along with the new IF results. The overall conclusion from the reaggregation assay is that IMP-derived MM cells efficiently incorporate into the mesenchyme surrounding tubule-like structures. These cells express FOXD1 and LTL. We do not see evidence of these cells incorporating into tubules or into the cap mesenchyme. As a negative control, we show that hES cells fail to incorporate into these kidney aggregates.</p><p>Taken together, we show that IMP cells can efficiently differentiate towards the kidney lineage and incorporate into the developing kidney. It can be argued that additional experiments to further characterize the renal potential of IMP cells are warranted. However, we contend that these extensive and comprehensive studies to generate and characterize these IMP cells are of significant value and interest to the scientific community and are worthy of publication at this point. Certainly, additional experiments are needed to further characterize the full differentiation potential of these IMP cells, but such experiments will be the subject of future studies.</p><p><italic>2) Regarding differentiation of MP cells along non-renal lineages (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>), it would be useful to extend the analysis past day 14 to test the possibility that MP cells are simply delayed in their differentiation along these lineages.</italic></p><p>We have extended these differentiations beyond day 14 and have not seen any differentiation towards cardiomyocyte or hematopoietic lineages. In addition, since it is well established that differentiation into cardiomyocytes requires inactivation of Wnt signaling at a stage shortly after mesoderm induction, we have treated the IMP cells for several days with the Wnt inhibitor IWP in the absence of the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR98014 (= CHR, a Wnt agonist required for expansion and maintenance of MP cells, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) prior to initiating differentiation towards the cardiomyocyte lineage. These manipulations also failed to promote cardiomyocyte differentiation, further underscoring our observation that IMP cells have a highly restricted lineage potential that does not include heart or blood differentiation. We have altered the text describing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to further emphasize these findings.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The reviewers appreciate the inclusion of additional data related to the differentiation potential of the derived IMP cells.

The new panel C of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> does not include these arrow heads.</p><p>In addition, in support that the IMP cells are capable of expressing FOXD1, we would also like to draw attention to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, which shows that FOXD1 expression is detectable by qPCR in IMP cells differentiated towards metanephric mesenchyme for 14 days. As expected, levels of FOXD1 expression in Day 14 MM is lower than in embryonic kidney. This data serves as independent confirmation that IMP cells are capable of generating FOXD1-positive cells.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08413.030</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08413.030">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08413.030</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-08413-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</italic></p><p><italic>In particular, while the arrowheads are helpful and support from the RT-PCR analysis is noted, the data still are not entirely convincing.

In conjunction with the secondary only control stains, this data shows that all positive staining for FOXD1 and HuNu is real and specific.</p></body></sub-article></article>
