multiple, essential cellular functions. How microtubule binding stimulates their ATPase and controls force generation is not understood. To address this fundamental question, we visualized microtubule-bound kinesin-1 and kinesin-3 motor domains at multiple steps in their ATPase cycles—including their nucleotide-free states—at ∼7 Å resolution using cryo-electron microscopy. In both motors, microtubule binding promotes ordered conformations of conserved loops that stimulate ADP release, enhance microtubule affinity and prime the catalytic site for ATP binding. ATP binding causes only small shifts of these nucleotide-coordinating loops but induces large conformational changes elsewhere that allow force generation and neck linker docking towards the microtubule plus end. Family-specific differences across the kinesin–microtubule interface account for the distinctive properties of each motor. Our data thus provide evidence for a conserved ATP-driven mechanism for kinesins and reveal the critical mechanistic contribution of the microtubule interface.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03680.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03680.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03680.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The interior of a cell is a hive of activity, filled with proteins and other items moving from one location to another. A network of filaments called microtubules forms tracks along which so-called motor proteins carry these items. Kinesins are one group of motor proteins, and a typical kinesin protein has one end (called the ‘motor domain’) that can attach itself to the microtubules. The other end links to the cargo being carried, and a ‘neck’ connects the two. When two of these proteins work together, flexible regions of the neck allow the two motor domains to move past one another, which enable the kinesin to essentially walk along a microtubule in a stepwise manner.</p><p>To take these steps along microtubules, each kinesin motor domain in the pair must undergo alternating cycles of tight association and release from their tracks. This cycle is coordinated by binding and breaking down a molecule called ATP, which also provides the energy needed to take the next step. How the cycle of loose and tight microtubule attachment is coordinated with the release of the breakdown products of ATP, and how the energy from the ATP molecule is converted into the force that moves the motor along the microtubule, has been unclear.</p><p>Atherton et al. use a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to study—in more detail than previously seen—the structure of the motor domains of two types of kinesin called kinesin-1 and kinesin-3. Images were taken at different stages of the cycle used by the motor domains to extract the energy from ATP molecules. Although the two kinesins have been thought to move along the microtubule tracks in different ways, Atherton et al. find that the core mechanism used by their motor domains is the same.</p><p>When a motor domain binds to the microtubule, its shape changes, first stimulating release of the breakdown products of ATP from the previous cycle. This release makes room for a new ATP molecule to bind. The structural changes caused by ATP binding are relatively small but produce larger changes in the flexible neck region that enable individual motor domains within a kinesin pair to co-ordinate their movement and move in a consistent direction. This mechanism involves tight coupling between track binding and fuel usage and makes kinesins highly efficient motors.</p><p>The structures uncovered by Atherton et al. reveal a mechanism that links microtubule binding, the energy supplied to the motor domain and the force that moves the kinesin along a microtubule. Future work will clarify whether the key features observed in the motor domains of kinesin-1 and kinesin-3 are also found in other types of kinesin motors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03680.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03680.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>kinesin</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>motor</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>ATPase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/J000973/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Atherton</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name><name><surname>Moores</surname><given-names>Carolyn A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1GM102875-07</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenfeld</surname><given-names>Steven S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/K01692X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farabella</surname><given-names>Irene</given-names></name><name><surname>Topf</surname><given-names>Maya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>I-Mei</given-names></name><name><surname>Houdusse</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>I-Mei</given-names></name><name><surname>Houdusse</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Federation pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>I-Mei</given-names></name><name><surname>Houdusse</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Marie Curie Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Incoming Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>I-Mei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of two microtubule-bound transport kinesins at 7 Å resolution reveal how microtubule track binding stimulates ADP release, primes the active site for ATP binding and enables force generation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kinesins are a large family of microtubule (MT)-based motors that play important roles in many cellular activities including mitosis, motility, and intracellular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vale, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hirokawa and Noda, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hirokawa et al., 2010</xref>). Their involvement in a range of pathological processes also highlights their significance as therapeutic targets and the importance of understanding the molecular basis of their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mandelkow and Mandelkow, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greber and Way, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Henry et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stokin and Goldstein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>). Kinesins are defined by their motor domains that contain both the MT and ATP binding sites. Three ATP binding motifs—the P-loop, switch I, switch II–are highly conserved among kinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sablin et al., 1996</xref>), myosin motors, and small GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vale, 1996</xref>). Kinesins also share a conserved mode of MT binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Woehlke et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso et al., 1998</xref>) such that MT binding, ATP binding, and hydrolysis are functionally coupled for efficient MT-based work.</p><p>A number of kinesins drive long distance transport of cellular cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hirokawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Soppina et al., 2014</xref>) with dimerisation allowing them to take multiple 8 nm ATP-driven steps toward MT plus ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Svoboda et al., 1993</xref>). Their processivity depends on communication between the two motor domains, which is achieved via the neck linker that connects each motor domain to the dimer-forming coiled-coil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hackney, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rice et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tomishige and Vale, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clancy et al., 2011</xref>). In the presence of MTs, ATP binding stimulates neck linker association (docking) with the motor domain towards the MT plus end, while ATP hydrolysis and MT release cause neck linker undocking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rice et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vale and Milligan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Skiniotis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asenjo et al., 2006</xref>); thus, the neck linker is required for both intra-dimer communication and directionality. However, even when the role of the motor N-terminus in reinforcing neck linker movement via cover neck bundle (CNB) formation is considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hwang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khalil et al., 2008</xref>), the contribution of neck linker docking to the force generating mechanism(s) of these kinesins remains uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rice et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vale and Milligan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rice et al., 2003</xref>). New insights into the conformational rearrangements of these motors when bound to MTs are essential to reveal how they produce force.</p><p>The high resolution X-ray structures of a range of kinesin motor domains have established a major communication route from the nucleotide binding site via helix-α4 (the so-called relay helix) to the neck linker, such that alternate conformations of helix-α4 either block or enable neck linker docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vale and Milligan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kikkawa et al., 2001</xref>). However, the neck linker conformation seen in these MT-free structures is not always correlated to the nucleotide bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vale and Milligan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grant et al., 2007</xref>). Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has played a major role in elucidating several aspects of MT-bound kinesin mechanochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sosa and Milligan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sosa et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rice et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Skiniotis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hirose et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kikkawa and Hirokawa, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sindelar and Downing, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goulet et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2014</xref>). Despite these contributions, and despite recent advances in the study of kinesin–tubulin complexes using X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gigant et al., 2013</xref>), several outstanding questions concerning kinesin mechanochemistry remain. Specifically, the mechanism by which MT binding stimulates the kinesin ATPase and in particular enhances Mg-ADP release by several orders of magnitude is not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hackney, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma and Taylor, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sindelar, 2011</xref>). Although several speculative models have been proposed, an unambiguously interpretable structure of nucleotide-free MT-bound kinesin is currently lacking and is clearly critical in establishing how such transitions are achieved. Such a structure would also provide key insights into how ATP binding is coupled to both neck linker docking and force generation.</p><p>To address these major questions, we describe the MT-bound mechanochemical cycles of two plus-end directed human kinesin motor domains, a kinesin-1 (Kif5A) and a kinesin-3 (Kif1A), using cryo-EM structure determination at subnanometer resolution. Kinesin-1s (Kin1) and kinesin-3s (Kin3) are both important neuronal plus-end directed transport motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hirokawa et al., 2009b</xref>), but recent data suggest that Kin3 rather than Kin1 motors specifically are involved in long distance transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Soppina et al., 2014</xref>). Their motor domains share 41% sequence identity, but profoundly different mechanochemistries—in which Kin1 dimers take processive steps and Kin3 monomers diffuse along MT tracks—have been proposed for these motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirokawa et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sindelar, 2011</xref>). Thus, we wanted to investigate these differences and compare the motors side by side. The high quality of our reconstructions, coupled to flexible fitting, enables new insights into the kinesin mechanism. In particular, nucleotide-free reconstructions for both motor domains reveal a conserved mechanism, whereby MT binding stimulates changes at the nucleotide-binding site favouring Mg-ADP release and conformationally primes the motor to receive Mg-ATP. We also show that relatively small structural transitions occur at the nucleotide-binding site on Mg-ATP binding, but that these lead to larger scale conformational changes and neck linker docking. Structural analysis of two different transport kinesins allows a direct comparison of their conserved mechanochemical features and identification of attributes that confer distinctive properties on each motor.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MT-bound Kin1 and Kin3 reconstructions: an overview</title><p>We calculated MT-bound Kin3 reconstructions and pseudo-atomic models in four different nucleotide states: (1) Mg-ADP; (2) no nucleotide (NN), using apyrase treatment; (3) Mg-AMPPNP (a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue); and (4) Mg-ADPAlFx (an ATP hydrolysis transition state mimic), consistent with the previously described tight association of the Kin3 motor domain with MTs throughout its ATPase cycle (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1 tbl2">Tables 1 and 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 1,2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Okada and Hirokawa, 2000</xref>).

Density corresponding to the rest of loop11 is now also fully visible, such that switch II is seen running from the β-sheet core past the P-loop. Loop9 has undergone a large conformational change: helix-α3 now terminates after four turns and the resulting elongated conformation of loop9 forms a finger-like extension that reaches towards the nucleotide pocket and the new helical turn in loop11. Density connects this extended form of loop9 and the N-terminus of helix-α4; density also connects the P-loop and loop9 (as previously described for Kif5B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sindelar and Downing, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sindelar, 2011</xref>). The Kin1-NN reconstruction shows a very similar configuration at the nucleotide-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This arrangement of the nucleotide–binding loops in both motors is striking because even in the absence of bound nucleotide, the loops adopt a conformation related (but not identical) to that formed when Mg-ATP is bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gigant et al., 2013</xref>). That is, MT-stimulated Mg-ADP release appears to conformationally prime the switch loops for Mg-ATP binding. The similarity of these reconstructions supports the idea of a conserved mechanism of: (1) MT-induced Mg-ADP release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) and (2) MT priming of the conformation of the nucleotide-binding pocket to receive Mg-ATP in both Kin1s and Kin3s.</p><p>Because of this conformational priming, structural changes in the nucleotide-binding site upon ATP-binding are comparatively small when the NN and Mg-ATP-reconstructions are compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In both Kin3 and Kin1, loop9 now reaches further into the nucleotide-binding pocket to cradle the Mg-ATP mimic, enclosing it in a catalytically competent conformation and forming continuous density with the nucleotide and P-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E</xref>). The C-terminus of loop11 retains a helical turn conformation similar to that observed in the nucleotide free reconstructions. Density for the N-terminus of loop11 runs from the core β-sheet past the P-loop and the γ-phosphate mimic. Importantly, however, in comparison to the nucleotide-free reconstruction, the loop11 helical turn shows reduced contact with tubulin and has moved toward loop9 and helix-α6 (see arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E</xref>). The ‘pincer-like’ movement of the switch loops is associated with formation of a prominent connection of density between them and is consistent with a ‘phosphate tube’ structure similar to that described recently for other kinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sindelar and Downing, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gigant et al., 2013</xref>). We note that, although the structure of the mammalian Kin1 Kif5A bound to MT has not previously been determined, our Kif5A reconstruction displays the major features seen in the recently published tubulin dimer-bound Kif5B Mg-ADPAlFx X-ray structure and to previous Mg-ATP analogue Kif5B cryo-EM reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sindelar and Downing, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gigant et al., 2013</xref>). Overall, in response to the presence of γ-phosphate, loop9 and loop11 draw closer to each other and to helix-α6 in both motors. This movement also reduces the density that connects loop11 with the MT.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Movement and extension of helix-α6 controls neck linker docking</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the N-terminus of helix-α6 is closely associated with elements of the nucleotide-binding site suggesting that its conformation alters in response to different nucleotide states.

The small β-sheet composed of strands-β1a,b,c (β-sheet1<sub>abc</sub>) lies on top of helix-α6 and above the MT surface; this β-sheet is situated roughly perpendicular to the core β-sheet of the motor domain and contains the characteristically extended Kin3 loop2. In the Kin3-Mg-ADP state, the orientation of helix-α6 with respect to helix-α4 ensures both that helix-α6 cannot fully extend and the neck linker is undocked; this is indicated, first, by a lack of density between helix-α4 and helix-α6, and second by a lack of density along the core β-sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The neck linker is mainly invisible and presumably disordered, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rice et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Skiniotis et al., 2003</xref>). However, some density that probably corresponds to the N-terminus of the neck linker is visible extending from the C-terminus of helix-α6, suggesting its flexible conformations are directed largely towards the MT minus end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, arrow and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>).

The relative orientation of these helices ensures that the neck linker remains undocked and flexible; this is again indicated by the gap separating these helices and by density extending from the C-terminus of helix-α6, similar to that described in the Mg-ADP state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The flexible distribution of the N-terminus is also unaltered. The Kin1-NN reconstruction shows an overall similar configuration in the region of helix-α6, with its neck linker undocked and flexible and its N-terminus disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E</xref>). However, some family specific differences are apparent, both within the motor domain structure and at the motor–MT interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). For example, in Kin1 β-sheet1<sub>abc</sub> appears more compact than in Kin3 because loop2 and loop3 are shorter. In Kin1 helix-α6, differences are present in the charged residues compared to Kin3 (described in more detail below) and, perhaps as a consequence, the C-terminus of Kin1 helix-α6 is connected by less density to the MT surface compared to Kin3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref>, arrowhead). Thus, relatively limited conformational changes appear to accompany Mg-ADP release in the vicinity of helix-α6 and the neck linker. This is despite the previously described significant rearrangement of the switch loops at the nucleotide-binding site on the other side of the domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>However on Mg-ATP binding, a major conformational change of helix-α6 is observed in both motors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Compared to the NN reconstructions, helix-α6 and β-sheet1<sub>abc</sub> have together lifted and rotated away from the MT surface. In the Mg-ATP-like reconstructions, a hydrophobic cavity forms above helix-α4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kikkawa et al., 2001</xref>) because the central β-sheet has peeled away from its C-terminal end (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,E</xref>; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2 fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 2 and 3C,D,F,G</xref>), helix-α6's C-terminus extends by a turn and inserts into this cavity. In the Kin3-Mg-ATP-like reconstruction, as a result of the repositioning of helix-α6, only a narrow bridge of density connects its N-terminal end with α–tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, arrowhead). This N-terminal end is more negatively charged than the C-terminal end of helix-α6 that was in contact with the MT surface prior to Mg-ATP binding. In Kin1, density for helix-α6 disconnects from the MT surface altogether (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, arrowhead). Importantly, in both motors, this structural reorganisation allows the neck linker to extend towards the MT plus end and dock along strand-β8 of the central β-sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C,D,F,G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rice et al., 1999</xref>). The N-termini of both motors are also directed towards the MT plus end, lying across the docked neck linker to form the CNB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C,D,F,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hwang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khalil et al., 2008</xref>).

One important aspect of transmission of this mechanochemical information is that a stable interaction with the MT is sustained. Our data show that several structural elements form apparently invariant contacts with the MT (primarily β-tubulin) in all the nucleotide states we examined. In the Kin3 reconstructions, density corresponding to helix-α4 runs across the whole motor domain–MT interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>).

However, density corresponding to the middle Kin3-characteristic Lys-rich portion of this loop (the so-called K-loop) is not visible in any nucleotide state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>, pink dotted line). This suggests that this highly basic middle section of loop12 remains mobile even while close to the MT surface (discussed below). The C-terminal end of Kin3 loop12, on the other hand, is visible and is stabilised by interaction with β-tubulin. Loop12 leads into an interconnected region of contacts between the MT surface and the motor, composed of helix-α5 along with loop8/strand-β5.

In both motors, subtle flexure of the central β-sheet itself is also apparent on Mg-ATP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) such that loop7 and the bottom of strand-β3 that connects to the P-loop are not superimposable. Differences in the β-sheet when comparing the Kin3-Mg-ADP and Kin3-NN models are even smaller in comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In myosin, the equivalent structural region undergoes substantial β-sheet flexure on nucleotide release (backbone RMSD &gt; 3.2 Å, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coureux et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reubold et al., 2003</xref>). However, our data provide no evidence of significant flexing in the kinesin β-sheet that has been proposed to accompany Mg-ADP release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kull and Endow, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, although the slight β-sheet bending that occurs when Mg-ATP binds may contribute to force generation as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gigant et al., 2013</xref>), it cannot, by itself, account for the peeling of the β-sheet that allows neck linker docking.</p><p>If motor domain tilt was sufficient to account for the mechanochemical transmission that takes place on Mg-ATP binding, superposition of the β-sheets of the NN and Mg-ATP structural states would be predicted to bring the motor domains into alignment (apart from helix-α4 and the nucleotide-invariant MT contacts). However, such a superposition shows large residual differences in multiple regions of the motor domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>; depicted as RMSDs between each pair of NN/Mg-ATP models). This clearly demonstrates that the β-sheet tilting that occurs in the transition from NN to Mg-ATP is not sufficient to describe the conformational changes in either Kin3 or Kin1. This is further emphasized when the Kin3 and Kin1 NN pseudo-atomic models are superimposed on the β-sheets of their respective ATP-like docked models and compared to the Mg-ATP-like cryo-EM reconstructions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Various parts of the NN models protrude from the density for the ATP-like reconstructions illustrating the poor fit, agreeing with the RMSD calculations, and further supporting their tilt-independent movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref> compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E</xref>). At the nucleotide-binding site, this analysis highlights that movement of loop9 around the bound Mg-ATP is large compared to motor domain tilting. Similarly, while loop11 retains a similar conformation before and after Mg-ATP binding, it does not tilt along with the core β-sheet but instead moves towards the motor domain core (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, helix-α2a and loop5 above the nucleotide-binding site, and helix-α0 below the nucleotide-binding site, accommodate Mg-ATP binding in both motors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Some structural changes are seen in helix-α1, whereas the β-sheet1<sub>abc</sub> shows clear conformational differences; family-specific loop insertions in loop2 and loop3 particularly exaggerate these movements in Kin3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The expected extension of helix-α6 and neck-linker docking is also highlighted by this analysis. However, it is also apparent that helix-α6 movement cannot be described purely by motor domain tilt, because it also undergoes a translational shift towards the MT plus end, as was recently proposed for Kin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gigant et al., 2013</xref>). The improved resolution of our reconstructions thus allows us to conclude that the conformational changes that underlie force generation in both Kin1 and Kin3 involve: (1) motor domain tilting relative to static MT contacts, but also (2) more complex sets of movements that accommodate Mg-ATP binding and bring about mechanical amplification.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03680.022</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Transmission of force generation across the motor domain on Mg-ATP binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Conformational changes relative to superposition of the core β-sheet of Kin3 (<bold>A</bold>) and Kin1 (<bold>B</bold>) showing the RMSDs due to Mg-ATP binding coloured from yellow (no change) to pink (large change), depicted on the Mg-ATP-like structures.

The K-loop may be intrinsically flexible due to its sequence, consistent with its role in mediating 1D diffusion. In addition, the lack of structural detail in this region could be due to the biochemical heterogeneity (different isoforms and post-translational modifications) of the CTTs of the bovine tubulin used in our experiments. Our structures imply that conformational flexibility of the K-loop persists throughout the motor's ATPase cycle but more information from future experiments is needed to clarify the contribution of this region to motor function.</p><p>However, the K-loop is reported to account for only a 10-fold enhancement of MT association of monomeric Kin3s over Kin1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Okada and Hirokawa, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2000</xref>), implying that other regions of the Kin3 motor domain also contribute. Our data show clear structural differences between Kin1 and Kin3 at the interface of the acidic tip of α-tubulin H12 with helix-α6, especially in the Mg-ADP/NN reconstructions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, more subtle differences in the distribution of charged residues in loop11 and helix α4's N-terminus would be predicted to influence MT affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Sequence divergence in loop8/strand-β5 was previously proposed to enable discrimination of post-translational modification in α-tubulin CTTs by Kin3 compared to Kin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Konishi and Setou, 2009</xref>). A direct role for recognition of the α-tubulin CTT is unlikely given its distance from loop8/strand-β5. However, differences in connectivity between this region of the motor domain and β-tubulin when comparing Kin1 and Kin3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) could contribute to differences in their apparent overall affinity. Intriguingly, recent data show that the K-loop does not contribute to the super-processive stepping properties of Kin3 dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Soppina and Verhey, 2014</xref>). Although a number of motor parameters could in principle contribute to processivity (e.g., coordination between dimer motor domains via the NL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clancy et al., 2011</xref>]), our structures suggest that other regions of the Kin3–MT interface may also influence functional differentiation of these motors including super-processivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Kinesin mechanochemistry and the extent of mechanistic conservation within the motor superfamily are open questions, critical to explain how MT binding, and ATP binding and hydrolysis drive motor activity.

In the NN conformation, both loop11 and loop9 are well ordered and primed to favour ATP binding, while helix-α6—which is required for mechanical amplification–is closely associated with the MT on the other side of the motor domain.

Full stabilisation of these elements is not achieved until Mg-ADP is released, and the additional contacts with the MT surface may in particular serve to nucleate the single turn helix in loop11. This is consistent with the well-documented role of loop11 in sensing MT attachment and triggering Mg-ADP release via interactions with α-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Woehlke et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ebbing et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Uchimura et al., 2010</xref>). Loop9 does not directly contact the MT before or after Mg-ADP release but dramatically changes conformation, unfurling, and extending around the nucleotide-binding site. The structured conformations of loop11 and the N-terminus of helix-α4 are sterically compatible with the conformations of loop9 before and after Mg-ADP release—that is, no clashes are seen in either case. However, the extended conformation of loop9 and the ordered conformations of helix-α4/loop11 are likely to be mutually stabilising due to formation of additional contacts, and thereby mediate communication between the nucleotide and MT-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Woehlke et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farrell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ebbing et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nitta et al., 2008</xref>). Critically, however, the water network coordinating Mg-ADP is stabilized exclusively by the retracted helical conformation of loop9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The transition towards the extended conformation of loop9 promotes Mg-ADP release by destabilisation of Mg coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nitta et al., 2008</xref>). These structural rearrangements therefore indicate that sequential conformational changes of the switch loops in the presence of MTs stimulate Mg-ADP release, the rate-limiting step of motors in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hackney, 1988</xref>). These rearrangements allow formation of a nucleotide-free motor that is strongly bound to its MT track (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nakata and Hirokawa, 1995</xref>), at least in part due to additional contacts formed between loop11 and the MT.</p><p>Conformational changes at the nucleotide-binding site that lead to Mg-ADP release also appear to prime the kinesin motor domain for Mg-ATP binding. However, the primed conformation clearly does not lead to neck linker docking in the absence of Mg-ATP, contrary to previous predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nitta et al., 2008</xref>). Multiple strands of evidence suggest that the neck linkers of transport kinesins in solution explore both docked and undocked conformations independent of the nucleotide state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rice et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nitta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scarabelli and Grant, 2013</xref>). Thus, tight MT binding is critical in strongly biasing neck linker conformation in the absence of nucleotide such that it will be undocked and, in our reconstructions, directed albeit flexibly towards the MT minus end. Interaction of helix-α6 with α-tubulin's H12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Uchimura et al., 2010</xref>) may therefore help to prevent neck linker docking in the absence of nucleotide, despite changes in the conformations of the switch loops at the active site.</p><p>Mg-ATP binding does not cause large rearrangements of the nucleotide-binding site of MT-bound motor domains. However, the presence of the pre-hydrolysis γ-phosphate of Mg-ATP is critical for the pincer-like movement of loop11 and loop9 towards each other. Along with formation of strong additional contacts between these loops, the helix-α4 N-terminus and the P-loop (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gigant et al., 2013</xref>), this new local connectivity induces the larger rearrangements that cause neck linker docking. The resulting conformational changes cannot be described only as a tilt of the motor domain relative to static contacts with the MT including helix-α4; in addition to β-sheet tilting, multiple changes across the domain reinforce mechanical amplification and neck linker docking when Mg-ATP binds. The resolution of our reconstructions also allows us to detect subtle distortion of the central β-sheet edges on Mg-ATP binding. However, arguably the most important consequences of Mg-ATP binding are the changes—extension, tilting, and translation—in helix-α6 that allow neck linker docking. This conformation is stabilised by contacts between its N-terminus and elements in the nucleotide-binding pocket (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gigant et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Neck linker docking is essential for both defining the directionality of kinesin motility and mediating head–head tension to ensure processive dimer stepping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rice et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tomishige and Vale, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vale and Milligan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Skiniotis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clancy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sindelar, 2011</xref>), but whether docking itself can generate the force required for kinesin stepping has been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rice et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, the structural basis of ATP-dependent force generation remains a matter of debate in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Visscher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cross and McAinsh, 2014</xref>). The conformational changes associated with helix-α6 during the ATPase cycle—in which contacts with the MT formed in the ADP/NN state are broken as Mg-ATP-dependent rotation pulls it away from the MT surface—reinforce neck linker movements and may also contribute to mechanical amplification and force generation. The translation/extension of helix-α6 into the hydrophobic cavity that is created by β-sheet tilting when Mg-ATP binds may ensure that this tilting is not reversed. Intriguingly, mutagenesis of residues at the helix-α6/neck linker junction has a profound effect on the activity of kinesin monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Case et al., 2000</xref>), pointing to the importance and likely conservation of structural transitions in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Case et al., 1997</xref>). Importantly, movement of helix-α6 also relieves steric blocking of neck linker docking and presumably biases the mobile neck linker trajectory. In collaboration with the motor N-terminus, formation of the CNB reinforces the plus end directionality of this bias. Thus, we propose that the helix-α6 is a key mechanical element within the kinesin motor domain, and that its Mg-ATP-dependent movement is essential to plus-end directed stepping.</p><p>Once the neck linker has docked, ATP hydrolysis occurs, ensuring efficient coupling between kinesin stepping, Mg-ATP binding and hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schnitzer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hahlen et al., 2006</xref>). A detailed reaction mechanism for hydrolysis has been proposed based on the conformations of loop9 and loop11 (a so-called ‘phosphate tube’) with Mg-ATP-analogue bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parke et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with MT binding being important in the catalytic enhancement of kinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma and Taylor, 1997</xref>), this hydrolysis competent configuration of the switch loops is rarely seen in Mg-ATP-analogue kinesin structures in the absence of MTs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kikkawa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nitta et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cochran et al., 2009</xref>, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2013</xref> being the notable exceptions); those in complex with tubulin always adopt this configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sindelar and Downing, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goulet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gigant et al., 2013</xref>). On Mg-ADP release, loop9 and loop11 are stabilized into conformations quite close to catalytically competent ones. This suggests that the conformational changes triggered by MT binding that lead to MT-stimulated ADP release also contribute to setting up the catalytic site for ATP hydrolysis. Thus, a subset of mutations in MT-sensing residues in loop11 or which decouple MT affinity and ADP-release also affect MT-stimulated ATP-hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Woehlke et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Song and Endow, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ebbing et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Uchimura et al., 2010</xref>). Following hydrolysis and phosphate release, we would predict that the Mg-ADP remaining in the catalytic site causes retraction of loop9, subsequent destabilization of loop11 and the helix-α4 N-terminus, leading to track detachment.</p><p>This model allows several previously proposed hypotheses, in particular concerning MT-stimulated Mg-ADP release, to be excluded. Mechanisms that involve MT-induced ‘opening’ of the nucleotide pocket, disordering of the switch loops around the nucleotide pocket to destabilise Mg-ADP coordination, or in which loop9 extends into the nucleotide pocket to perturb the P-loop and eject Mg-ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kikkawa and Hirokawa, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sindelar and Downing, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nitta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sindelar, 2011</xref>) are not supported by our observations that: (1) both loop9 and loop11 move towards the nucleotide-binding pocket on Mg-ADP release, (2) these loops adopt well-defined and conserved conformations that are clearly visualised after Mg-ADP release, and (3) the conformation of these loops does not sterically interfere with nucleotide binding or disrupt the P-loop. Another prominent idea is that a significant twist of the core β-sheet caused by MT attachment would promote Mg-ADP release analogous to the equivalent release step in myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coureux et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hirose et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kull and Endow, 2013</xref>). However, comparison of our Kin3-Mg-ADP and Kin3-NN reconstructions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) does not support β-sheet twist as a mechanism for Mg-ADP release in kinesins.</p><p>The structural elements involved in these mechanochemical transitions are extremely well conserved amongst kinesins, and it is likely that the mechanisms we describe are utilised by all superfamily members. We previously characterised the MT-bound ATPase cycle of human kinesin-5 (Kin5, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goulet et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2014</xref>). Although the resolutions of those cryo-EM reconstructions (∼10 Å) do not provide the level of detail of the current work, many of our current hypotheses are consistent with a conserved mechanochemistry, specifically conformational coupling of loops9 and 11 to bring about MT-induced Mg-ADP release and Mg-ATP induced neck linker docking. Superimposed on this conserved mechanochemistry, family-specific modifications were also detected; most strikingly for Kin5, these include the proposed role of the Kin5-extended loop5 in controlling nucleotide binding and the stiffer properties of the Kin5 neck linker that undergoes an order-to-order transition on Mg-ATP binding. Family-specific insertions elsewhere in the motor domain are likely to have other modifying roles, such as Kin3's loop12, which enhances the initial interaction between these highly processive motors and their tracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Soppina and Verhey, 2014</xref>). A tantalising hint of how insertions in loop2 may be coupled to MT depolymerisation in for example kinesin-13s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Desai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moores et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asenjo et al., 2013</xref>) and kinesin-8s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Varga et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Peters et al., 2010</xref>) is provided by its proximity to the MT surface and the mechanical amplifier helix-α6, and by its large displacement on Mg-ATP binding. Future studies at high resolution will provide further insights into the ways this conserved mechanochemistry is modified in diverse functional contexts within the kinesin superfamily.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein purification</title><p>A human kinesin-1 (Kin1) construct (Kif5A, residues 1–340, in pET151-D-TOPO [Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA with a TEV protease-cleavable N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag]) was expressed recombinantly in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified using cobalt affinity chromatography.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor), a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers are in agreement about the high technical quality of your study, and the interest of your conclusions. They all agree that the strong side of the manuscript is the convincing evidence for changes in the nucleotide pocket and associated movements of h4 and h6.</p><p>One of the reviewers pointed out that the weak side comprises parts dealing with the movements of the neck linker, and the role of charged interactions in KIF1A (K-loop) and after discussion; the other reviewers agree that you need to more convincingly support your hypothesis.</p><p>We would like to publish your manuscript. However, to convincingly support the hypotheses on the neck linker, we feel you have to address the following issues that are detailed below. There is potentially quite a lot of work here, and we are not asking you to spend more than a couple of months to answer them. If you have data to address these issues, you should include them. If not, some of the data can be quite easily obtained, or we would recommend toning down your conclusions, and being more careful with potential caveats.</p><p>Movement of h6 and neck linker:</p><p>In the Results section it is argued that 'the neck linker remains directed towards the MT minus end...' under no-nucleotide conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In the figure, however, it is hard see electron density supporting this statement. In fact, in none of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">figures (3C, D, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1A</xref>) can electron densities be unambiguously detected, corresponding to the neck linker. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1B</xref> might be an exception but the density extending from h6 could also be attributed to the N-terminal extension (yellow), as seemingly the case for KIF1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A</xref>). The data basis for interpretations on the position of the neck linker is too weak to allow such far-reaching conclusions. The neck linker orientation might be determined using label such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Skiniotis et al</xref>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Skiniotis et al</xref>, The EMBO Journal Vol. 22 No. 7 pp. 1518-1528, 2003).</p><p>The conclusion that 'the beta-sheet tilting ... is not sufficient to describe the conformational changes that accompany force generation...' is an important key conclusion, substantiated by the thorough analysis of alterations in the core motor domain (i.e. without neck linker).</p><p>You write (in the Results section) '... no density corresponding to [K-loop and CTT]..., nor ... any effect of motor domain nucleotide state...', and conclude: '... hard to reconcile with ... a specific role of L12 ... in the Mg-ADP state.' This logic is incorrect. The method used (cryo EM reconstruction) does not allow detection of any differences but it cannot be concluded that there ARE no differences (that might be detected by other methods). There may be differences in L12/CTT in dependence on the nucleotide state, just invisible to cryo EM.</p><p>Furthermore, in the Results section you state '[the ADP-dependent Kin3 motor and track] interaction is not important (or does not exist)...' As argued above, the kinetic data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> clearly hints at a tight, possibly ionic interaction. Likewise, a '10-fold affinity enhancement cannot [account for] super-processivity' is incorrect. If both heads of a dimeric motor were uncoupled (which they are not, but for the sake of the argument this is irrelevant) and each had a microtubule off-rate of 1/100 s-1, the probability for the dimer to have both heads in the weakly bound state would be (1/100)^2 = 1/10000, which would explain 'super-processivity'. In general, 'super-processive' is a concept that cannot be tested or substantiated in a study with monomeric kinesin motor domain constructs. Speculations on why KIF1A dimers show long run lengths based on structural studies on monomers are highly hypothetical. At least, one would have to know whether 8-nm steps occur, and whether they are coupled 1:1 to ATP hydrolysis.</p><p>In the Results section you also state '...the apparent affinity of Kin3 is ∼250x higher than Kin1', and refers to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>. This table, however, reports catalytic parameters, not affinities.</p><p>This issue is important for the interpretation of the role of the K-loop in KIF1A. Co-sedimentation assays at varying ionic strengths can reveal the relative importance of ionic and other interactions, possibly in combination with mutants.</p><p>That KIF1A's observed half-maximal activation constant for microtubules (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>) is heavily affected by ionic or unspecific interactions can be seen by calculating the kcat/K0.5MT ∼800 s-1 uM-1, which is unrealistically high for a diffusion-limited reaction. The authors have to clearly distinguish between affinity and half-maximal activation constant.</p><p>What is the evidence for the actual presence of Mg-ADP in the nucleotide binding pocket under ADP conditions? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows KIF1A under this condition but due to the projection into 2D it is not visible whether there is a clear density signal corresponding to the indicated position of Mg-ADP. In this respect, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> is much less clear than <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref> (ADP/AlFx).</p><p>Vice versa, what is the evidence for the actual absence of nucleotide under no-nucleotide conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B and D</xref>; densities marked with arrowheads)? Clarification of these points is essential for the conclusion '[that] Mg-ADP release ... primes the switch loops for Mg-ATP'</p><p>How much light can the data really shine on 'force generation'? Beyond acknowledging that neck linker docking does not provide enough energy for force generation, could the author speculate on where the force is coming from? How do the acquired data relate to the concept of 'electrostatically guided, biased diffusion' (see: Grant, Cross et. al, PLOS Biology 2011, Electrostatically Biased Binding of Kinesin to Microtubules)? Conformational changes could prime the biased binding, but the nucleotide state would merely gate the interactions (as opposed to provide the energy).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03680.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Movement of h6 and neck linker:</p><p><italic>In the Results section it is argued that 'the neck linker remains directed towards the MT minus end...' under no-nucleotide conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

The major point (which we have re-emphasised in the text) is that in the ADP/NN reconstructions it is clear that the neck linker is <italic>undocked</italic><bold>,</bold> as a result of the relative conformations of helicesα4/α6. Although we can also see that in these reconstructions, the neck linker <italic>emerges</italic> from the motor domain in the direction of the MT minus end, density corresponding to neck linker is only visible for a few amino acids at its N-terminus; the rest of the neck linker is invisible, presumably due to flexibility. The comparison between undocked and docked neck linker – which also emphasises the accompanying change in helix-α6 – is now shown more clearly in the alternative view in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>. We have truncated the neck linker in the relevant models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and the new figure to more accurately represent the EM density. To enable comparison of density corresponding to the N-terminus vs the neck linker in the AMPPNP/ADPAlFX states, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and its supplement provide useful alternative views and we now also refer to these figures. Our data are consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Skiniotis et al</xref> (to which we now refer). Even with their elegant approach of inserting a genetically encoded label (an engineered SH3 domain) onto the C-terminus of the Kin1 neck linker, in monomers this domain was invisible due to neck linker flexibility when undocked.</p><p><italic>The conclusion that 'the beta-sheet tilting ... is not sufficient to describe the conformational changes that accompany force generation...' is an important key conclusion, substantiated by the thorough analysis of alterations in the core motor domain (i.e. without neck linker)</italic>.</p><p><italic>You write (in the Results section) '... no density corresponding to [K-loop and CTT]..., nor ... any effect of motor domain nucleotide state...', and conclude: '... hard to reconcile with ... a specific role of L12 ... in the Mg-ADP state.' This logic is incorrect. The method used (cryo EM reconstruction) does not allow detection of any differences but it cannot be concluded that there ARE no differences (that might be detected by other methods). There may be differences in L12/CTT in dependence on the nucleotide state, just invisible to cryo EM</italic>.</p><p>We apologise for this incorrect wording. We have entirely rewritten this section of the text (in the Results section) to address this and the other comments relating to this aspect of our work, discussed further below.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, in the Results section you state '[the ADP-dependent Kin3 motor and track] interaction is not important (or does not exist)...' As argued above, the kinetic data in</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3"><italic>Table 3</italic></xref> <italic>clearly hints at a tight, possibly ionic interaction. Likewise, a '10-fold affinity enhancement cannot [account for] super-processivity' is incorrect. If both heads of a dimeric motor were uncoupled (which they are not, but for the sake of the argument this is irrelevant) and each had a microtubule off-rate of 1/100 s-1, the probability for the dimer to have both heads in the weakly bound state would be (1/100)^2 = 1/10000, which would explain 'super-processivity'. In general, 'super-processive' is a concept that cannot be tested or substantiated in a study with monomeric kinesin motor domain constructs. Speculations on why KIF1A dimers show long run lengths based on structural studies on monomers are highly hypothetical. At least, one would have to know whether 8-nm steps occur, and whether they are coupled 1:1 to ATP hydrolysis</italic>.</p><p>The rewritten text in the Results section more clearly and accurately places our structural work in the context of the literature concerning Kin3 biochemistry and mechanism. In brief, a series of landmark studies from the Hirokawa group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kikkawa et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Okada &amp; Hirokawa, 1999, 2000</xref>) established the importance of the K-loop in enhancing the interaction of Kin3 monomers with MTs using steady-state ATPase assays and measurement of MT affinity of specific nucleotide-bound states; they also showed that this interaction was ionic strength sensitive. However, they also demonstrated – using mutagenesis and protein engineering - that manipulations of the K-loop alone were not sufficient to account for the &gt;100-fold differences in MT association between Kin3 and Kin1: in these experiments, Kin1/Kin3 constructs ± K-loop showed only 10-fold differences in MT association. Subsequent studies including very recent work from the Verhey group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Soppina et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Soppina &amp; Verhey, 2014</xref>) have expanded on these conclusions. In particular, it has been shown that manipulation/deletion of the K-loop does not alter the “super-processivity” of Kin3 dimers in vitro or <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our data cannot provide direct information about the stepping mechanisms of kinesin dimers – and in particular, many factors can contribute to the extent of processivity. However, our work does highlight the structural differences that exist between transport kinesins due to intrinsic properties of the monomeric motor domains that are likely to contribute to differences in motor functionality.</p><p><italic>In the Results section you also state '...the apparent affinity of Kin3 is ∼250x higher than Kin1', and refers to</italic><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3"><italic>Table 3</italic></xref><italic>. This table, however, reports catalytic parameters, not affinities</italic>.</p><p><italic>This issue is important for the interpretation of the role of the K-loop in KIF1A. Co-sedimentation assays at varying ionic strengths can reveal the relative importance of ionic and other interactions, possibly in combination with mutants</italic>.</p><p>We apologise for the imprecision of this text and have rewritten the relevant section to address these and the related comments . We now use the correct KmMT nomenclature to describe our data. We have also responded by more accurately referencing the rich literature on monomer affinity (detailed above and which already includes binding assays), and the relationship between KmMT and monomer affinity (particularly in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Woelhke et al, 1997</xref>). In this context, we agree that dissection of residues that contribute to affinity differences using mutagenesis and cosedimentation assays is an interesting future direction but feel that this is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><p><italic>That KIF1A's observed half-maximal activation constant for microtubules (</italic><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3"><italic>Table 3</italic></xref><italic>) is heavily affected by ionic or unspecific interactions can be seen by calculating the kcat/K0.5MT ∼800 s-1 uM-1, which is unrealistically high for a diffusion-limited reaction. The authors have to clearly distinguish between affinity and half-maximal activation constant</italic>.</p><p>As described above, we have rewritten the text to correct this lack of clarity with respect to affinity and half-maximal activation constant. As we have also now clarified in the text, it is well described in the literature (in publications from the Hirokawa group in particular) that the interaction of Kif1A monomers with microtubules is heavily affected by ionic/non-specific interactions that lead to the high apparent kcat/K0.5MT values observed.</p><p><italic>What is the evidence for the actual presence of Mg-ADP in the nucleotide binding pocket under ADP conditions?</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref> <italic>shows KIF1A under this condition but due to the projection into 2D it is not visible whether there is a clear density signal corresponding to the indicated position of Mg-ADP. In this respect,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref> <italic>is much less clear than</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2C and D</italic></xref> <italic>(ADP/AlFx)</italic>.</p><p><italic>Vice versa, what is the evidence for the actual absence of nucleotide under no-nucleotide conditions (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2B and D</italic></xref><italic>; densities marked with arrowheads)? Clarification of these points is essential for the conclusion '[that] Mg-ADP release ... primes the switch loops for Mg-ATP'</italic></p><p>We agree that this is a critical point: 1) We have added additional, equivalent views of our reconstructions that demonstrate nucleotide occupancy in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2–figure supplement 5</xref>, which is now referred to in the Results text. 2) We have provided additional references in the Materials and methods section, reinforcing that our sample preparation was based on established protocols. 3) Overall motor domain conformations (including neck-linker orientation) are consistent with nucleotide assignment as expected from the literature.</p><p><italic>How much light can the data really shine on 'force generation'? Beyond acknowledging that neck linker docking does not provide enough energy for force generation, could the author speculate on where the force is coming from? How do the acquired data relate to the concept of 'electrostatically guided, biased diffusion' (see: Grant, Cross et. al, PLoS Biology 2011, Electrostatically Biased Binding of Kinesin to Microtubules)? Conformational changes could prime the biased binding, but the nucleotide state would merely gate the interactions (as opposed to provide the energy)</italic>.</p><p>The major contribution of our data to understanding force generation is to show that the nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in MT-bound Kin1 and Kin3 are conserved. This is particularly significant given that alternative and quite distinct models for Kin3 force generation have previously been proposed. The nucleotide-dependent conformations captured in our reconstructions presumably occur after any biased diffusion – as described in the interesting study of Grant et al – has ceased. By their nature, the structure(s) of the motors as they undergo biased diffusion would not be accessible using our averaging methods. In contrast, the conformational changes that we describe depend on the stereospecific interaction of the motors with the MT and are preferentially stabilised by the particular nucleotide bound. The point(s) in the MT-bound ATPase cycle where force is generated and how the neck linker contributes to this remain somewhat disputed in the field, and we have altered the text throughout the manuscript to more accurately reflect this. Our higher resolution structures provide snapshots of the motor domain and thus a mechanistic framework in which hypotheses concerning force generation can be considered. We have added some more speculative text on this point in the Results section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
