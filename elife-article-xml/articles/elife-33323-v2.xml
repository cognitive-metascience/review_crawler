Here, we show that several sensory patches arise by progressive segregation from a common prosensory domain in the embryonic chicken and mouse otocyst. This process is regulated by mutually antagonistic signals: Notch signalling and Lmx1a. Notch-mediated lateral induction promotes prosensory fate. Some of the early Notch-active cells, however, are normally diverted from this fate and increasing lateral induction produces misshapen or fused sensory organs in the chick. Conversely Lmx1a (or cLmx1b in the chick) allows sensory organ segregation by antagonizing lateral induction and promoting commitment to the non-sensory fate. Our findings highlight the dynamic nature of sensory patch formation and the labile character of the sensory-competent progenitors, which could have facilitated the emergence of new inner ear organs and their functional diversification in the course of evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>notch</kwd><kwd>inner ear</kwd><kwd>Lmx1a</kwd><kwd>lateral induction</kwd><kwd>compartment boundaries</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L003163/1 Project grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mann</surname><given-names>Zoe F</given-names></name><name><surname>Daudet</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000703</institution-id><institution>Action on Hearing Loss</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G76 Postdoc grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Daudet</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Erasmus Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gálvez</surname><given-names>Héctor</given-names></name><name><surname>Pedreno</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A dynamic confrontation between Notch signalling and the transcription factor Lmx1a at the borders of the developing inner ear sensory patches regulates their segregation and the positioning of their boundaries.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The morphogenesis of tissues with a complex three-dimensional architecture and a variety of specialized cell types requires the coordinated action of mechanisms that specify cell identity and position. The vertebrate inner ear is a formidable model system in which to investigate these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Groves and Fekete, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alsina and Whitfield, 2017</xref>). It hosts multiple specialised sensory organs responsible for hearing in the cochlea, and the perception of head movements and position in the vestibular system. Each sensory organ contains a sensory patch, composed of a regular mosaic of mechanosensory ‘hair’ cells, and their supporting cells. In between these sensory patches are non-sensory domains, forming a series of fluid-filled canals and constrictions essential for inner ear function.</p><p>The morphology of the inner ear, as well as the number, type, position and shape of sensory patches that it hosts, vary greatly across and within distinct classes of vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baird, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schulz-Mirbach and Ladich, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Manley and Clack, 2004</xref>). The inner ear of ancestral vertebrates was probably similar to that of hagfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jørgensen et al., 1998</xref>) and lampreys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lowenstein et al., 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Maklad et al., 2014</xref>), with a relatively small number of sensory patches (three in hagfish) and a rudimentary vestibular system. In the course of evolution, a gradual increase in the number of sensory patches (up to nine in some amphibians), possibly due to the duplication and modification of pre-existing structures, has led to the acquisition of new inner ear functionalities – in particular sound detection in terrestrial vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Manley and Clack, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fritzsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Manley, 2012</xref>). For example, the vestibular system of birds and mammals comprises three patches (the cristae) connected to the semi-circular canals, two large patches (the maculae) in the saccule and the utricle, and the smaller macula neglecta. In mammals, the auditory cochlea forms a coiled tube that contains one sensory epithelium called the organ of Corti. In birds, the ventral portion of the inner ear is formed by an elongated (uncoiled) recess containing an auditory epithelium, the basilar papilla, as well as one vestibular-like sensory patch at its distal end, the lagena. The monotremes (the platypus and echidnas), remarkably, exhibit intermediate characteristics: an elongated cochlear duct, containing an organ of Corti-like epithelium and a distal lagena, suggesting that the lagena was present in ancestral mammals, but lost in placental and marsupial mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schultz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ladhams and Pickles, 1996</xref>). The genetic changes that have led to such diversification of sensory organs during vertebrate evolution are still elusive, but are necessarily connected to the factors guiding their formation during embryonic development. Interestingly, it has been proposed that developing sensory patches could form progressively by segregation from a common ‘pan-sensory’ domain, a process that would recapitulate the evolutionary history of the inner ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fritzsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Knowlton, 1967</xref>). Whilst this hypothesis has received some experimental support from anatomical studies, in particular in amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fritzsch and Wake, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Norris, 1892</xref>), the precise molecular mechanisms regulating sensory patch number and position, or their segregation remain unclear.</p><p>All sensory patches are thought to derive from so-called ‘prosensory’ domains, found in the anterior and posterior domains of the otocyst, the epithelial vesicle giving rise to the inner ear. The prosensory domains are characterised by expression of the Notch ligand Jagged1 (Jag1, also known as Serrate1 in the chick) and of the transcription factor Sox2, which are both required for sensory domain formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kiernan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kiernan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kiernan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brooker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Neves et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cole et al., 2000</xref>). Notch activity, induced by Jag1, promotes Sox2 expression and commitment to the sensory fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daudet and Lewis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hartman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Neves et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, Jag1 is positively regulated by Notch, through a process known as ‘lateral induction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eddison et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lewis, 1998</xref>). Besides maintaining Notch activity within the prosensory domains, lateral induction could in theory lead to the propagation of Notch activity across interacting cells and play an important role in regulating the size, number and shape of inner ear sensory patches. However, uncharacterized signals must also act to counteract lateral induction and prevent excessive expansion of the developing sensory domains.</p><p>In this study, we set out to investigate the role of lateral induction during early sensory patch formation. We show that several sensory organs form by segregation from a common prosensory domain in the early developing chick otocyst, and found that some of the early Notch-active (and presumably sensory-competent) cells can change character and become non-sensory cells in the mature inner ear. We also show that a gain of lateral induction disrupts the normal positioning of sensory patch boundaries, and in extreme cases, induces fusion of adjacent sensory patches. This suggests that a dampening of lateral induction is required for the normal segregation of inner ear sensory patches. We next demonstrate that the LIM-homeodomain transcription factor Lmx1a (cLmx1b in the chicken), expressed in non-sensory domains, antagonizes lateral induction and promotes the non-sensory fate in a context-dependent manner. The expression of cLmx1b is negatively regulated by Notch activity, and analysis of an Lmx1a- GFP knock-in mouse model suggests that some sensory cells at the lateral border of sensory patches are derived from Lmx1a-expressing cells.</p><p>Altogether, these results suggest that the embryonic segregation of sensory patches and the positioning of their boundaries occur progressively during development and is regulated by the balance of mutually antagonistic signals promoting (e.g. lateral induction, Sox2) and antagonizing (Lmx1a, among others) commitment to the sensory fate. The labile character of the early sensory-competent progenitors could have facilitated the emergence of a wide variety of sensory organ types and morphologies in the course of vertebrate evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The anterior and lateral cristae form by segregation from a large prosensory domain during development of the chick inner ear</title><p>The Notch ligand Jag1 is one of the earliest markers of the prosensory domains of the inner ear. In the chicken otocyst at embryonic day (E) 2.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), Jag1 immunostaining is elevated in the neurosensory competent anterior domain and in the posterior domain. Over the subsequent days of development, Jag1 becomes elevated in defined prosensory domains, which increase in size and number as the inner ear matures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). However, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cole et al., 2000</xref>), low levels of Jag1 expression are transiently detected in a broad ventro-medial domain that extends along the antero-posterior domain of the otocyst between E2.5 and E3.5 (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). The proximity of the anterior and lateral crista to the prospective utricle at early stages of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>) prompted us to examine in greater detail, using whole-mount preparations, the relationship between Sox2 and Jag1 expression during their formation. In samples examined between HH21-23 (E3.5-E4), a distinct cluster of Sox2/Jag1-expressing cells (the presumptive anterior crista, based on its location and evolution at later stages) was located next to a larger prosensory domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–E’</xref>). The junctional domain between the two adjacent patches was slightly constricted, and contained Sox2-positive (Sox2+) but Jag1-negative (Jag1-) cells (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–E’</xref>). At HH25 (E4.5 -E5), there was a marked down-regulation in Sox2 expression between the anterior crista and the prosensory domain (double arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–F’</xref>), and an increase in the distance separating these patches. At the same time, a distinct cluster of Sox2+ cells (the presumptive lateral crista) became visible at the superior edge of the prosensory domain (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). At HH27 (E5-E5.5), a decrease in Sox2 expression was seen at the interface of the lateral crista and the prosensory domain, whilst Jag1 was almost extinguished in this domain (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–G’</xref>). The segregation of the lateral crista then proceeded in a similar manner to that of the anterior crista, with a progressive loss of Sox2 expression at the interface with the prospective utricle, followed by an increase in the distance separating these two patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Double-immunostaining for Sox2 and Prox1, a transcription factor highly expressed in the developing cristae compared to the utricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stone et al., 2003</xref>), provided further evidence that the prospective cristae are specified whilst they are still part of a larger prosensory domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, H-J’). Hence, both cristae appeared to form by progressive segregation from a larger prosensory domain (giving rise to the utricle), during which the down-regulation of Jag1 precedes that of Sox2 expression in prospective non-sensory regions. This suggests that Notch activity is dynamically regulated during the early stages of sensory patch specification and their segregation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33323.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of the Notch ligand Jag1,Sox2 and Prox1 during the formation and segregation of the chick inner ear sensory patches.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Jag1 expression in the developing chick inner ear (whole-mount preparations).

At HH25 (<bold>F–F’</bold>), the distance separating the anterior crista from the large prosensory domain increases (double arrowheads); a distinct cluster of Sox2-positive cells becomes visible at the upper edge of the large prosensory domain, which corresponds to the location of the prospective lateral crista (<bold>p–lc</bold>). At HH27 (<bold>G–G’</bold>), the lateral crista starts to segregate from the prospective utricle (pd/ut); the interface domain is Sox2-positive, but exhibits a marked down-regulation of Jag1 expression (arrowheads).

We first used a bicolor fluorescent reporter of Notch activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), Hes5::bicolor, to identify the Notch active (Notch-ON) cells and those in which Notch activity has been switched off, or Notch-OFF cells. This reporter uses the mouse Hes5 promoter, active in Notch-ON cells in the developing chick inner ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chrysostomou et al., 2012</xref>), to drive expression of two fluorescent proteins linked by a 2A peptide sequence (to ensure stoichiometric production): a stable tomato-fluorescent protein fused to Histone 2B (nTomato; persistent for at least 48 hr) and a destabilised and nuclear localized GFP, nd2eGFP, with a half-life of approximately 5 hr after Notch inhibition (data not shown and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chrysostomou et al., 2012</xref>]). The reporter cassette was cloned into a Tol2 transposon vector allowing stable integration into the genome of transfected cells after co-electroporation with the Tol2 transposase. We reasoned that cells transfected with this ‘molecular timer’ would fall into two categories: those in which Notch is active, or has been recently active, would exhibit red and green fluorescence in their nuclei; those in which Notch had been active previously but turned off Notch activity more than 10 hr previously should exhibit nTomato fluorescence only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–B”</xref>). Following in ovo electroporation at E2, the embryos were incubated until E5-E7, a stage at which distinct sensory domains are apparent. Analysis of successfully electroporated samples revealed that as expected, red/green nuclei belonged to cells located within the Sox2+ sensory domains. However, cells with red (but not green) nuclei were also present outside the sensory domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). These cells had lower levels of red fluorescence than those located within the sensory territories, as expected if these cells had been Notch-active at an earlier stage of development, but subsequently switched off Notch activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). An alternative interpretation, however, is that these cells were experiencing very low levels of Notch activity at the time of examination, sufficient to elicit an accumulation of the H2B-Tomato protein, but not the destabilised nd2eGFP. Hence, we next used a different strategy to irreversibly label the early Notch-active cells with a ‘red-to-green’ Tol2 construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hans et al., 2009</xref>). In this construct, a constitutively active promoter drives the expression of either DsRed2, or eGFP following Cre-mediated recombination. Chicken otocysts were electroporated at E2 with the Tol2 pT2K:red-to-green and a Hes5::Tomato-IRES-Cre plasmid (thereafter Hes5::Cre), driving transient Tomato and Cre expression in Notch-active cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Examination of otocysts 16 hr post-electroporation showed large numbers of red (DsRed2 and/or Tomato) fluorescent cells, but the eGFP+ cells were observed almost exclusively in the anterior and occasionally posterior regions of the otocyst (5 out of 8 samples; the remaining 3 not showing any eGFP+ cells). The presence of eGFP+ cells in domains where Notch is normally active at this stage confirmed successful recombination of the Tol2-red-to-green transgene in the early Notch-active cells. There were no eGFP+ cells in samples electroporated with the red-to-green construct alone, confirming that no spontaneous recombination occurs in the absence of Cre expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In ‘mild’ cases, that is those with moderate Hes5::Dll1-eGFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), the size of the vestibular system appeared slightly reduced (compare for example the width of the vestibular system in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>) but distinct patches of eGFP fluorescence corresponding to the normal location of the sensory organs were observed (6/21). In the remaining 15 samples, the morphogenesis of the vestibular system was more severely affected, with reduced overall size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and missing semi-circular canals (data not shown). Additionally, we observed abnormal eGFP fluorescence in the dorsal portion of the vestibular system and in canal-like, elongated domains (asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), contrasting with the normal appearance of segregated sensory domains in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We performed immunostaining for hair cell markers (HCA and otoferlin) and Jag1 to analyse sensory patch morphology in Hes5::Dll1 transfected samples in greater detail. In samples with relatively mild defects in ear morphology analysed at E8-E14, eGFP+ cells were few and observed within or in close proximity to easily recognizable sensory organs, such as the cristae of the vestibular system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–H</xref>). In these samples, groups of ectopic hair cells, intermingled with eGFP+ cells, were occasionally found at the lateral border of sensory organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>). Alternatively, when eGFP+ cells were in greater numbers, the pattern of hair cell differentiation and sensory organ shape were affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–G’</xref>). In samples with more severe defects in overall inner ear morphology, eGFP fluorescence was frequently detected in the dorsal-most region of the vestibular system.

On the lateral side there was a more progressive reduction in GFP fluorescence and some overlap in Sox2/GFP+ cells. Since this overlap was not seen in neonatal mice, this suggests a developmental down-regulation of Lmx1a expression in the lateral domain of the organ of Corti. In <italic>Lmx1a<sup>GFP</sup></italic><sup>/GFP</sup> cochlea, the size of the Sox2+ domain was occasionally expanded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E–E’’</xref>), and there were also striking differences in the pattern of GFP fluorescence: at the medial border of the organ of Corti, the abrupt boundary between GFP+ and GFP- cells was disrupted and GFP+ cells were intermingled with Sox2+ cells; at the lateral border, the gradient of GFP fluorescence (from high in lateral wall, to low in the Sox2+ domain) was irregular, with clusters of GFP+ cells surrounded by GFP- cells in the Sox2+ domain (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that the absence of Lmx1a function can lead, in a context-dependent manner, to the abnormal differentiation of cells from the Lmx1a lineage into sensory progenitors.

In this study, we explored the mechanisms that control the patterning of these sensory and non-sensory territories and position their boundaries in the chicken and mouse inner ear. Our results support the idea that at least some of the sensory organs and the non-sensory cells that separate them derive from a common pool of sensory-competent cells by segregation. This process is regulated by the balance of opposing signals that either promote (Notch) or prevent (Lmx1) their commitment to the sensory fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). We discuss the significance of our findings in relation to existing models for sensory organ specification and some of the implications of the labile character of the early otic sensory progenitors.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Antagonistic interactions between lateral induction and Lmx1a regulate sensory patch segregation</title><p>The morphology of the inner ear and the number of sensory patches it contains vary considerably across vertebrates. In fish and amphibians, it has long been proposed that sensory organs arise by segregation from one or several sensory-competent domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fritzsch et al., 2002</xref>). Histological studies led Knowlton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Knowlton, 1967</xref>) to suggest that a similar process might occur in the chicken inner ear, in which most sensory epithelia seem to arise from the ‘thickened’ ventromedial wall of the otocyst. Several studies have shown that the prosensory markers Sox2 and Jag1 are initially expressed in broad territories of the early mouse and chicken otocyst before they become restricted to distinct sensory patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Neves et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cole et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Neves et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nichols et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adam et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sánchez-Guardado et al., 2013</xref>), but whether these changes related to sensory patch segregation was unclear. Here, using whole-mount surface preparations of the chicken otocyst, we provide strong evidence that both the anterior and lateral cristae arise from the edge of a large antero-medial Sox2-positive ‘pan-sensory’ domain, which itself gives rise to the utricle. During this process, Jag1, then Sox2 expression is progressively downregulated at the interface of the cristae and the prospective utricle as the distance between these patches increase.</p><p>We propose that lateral induction mediated by Jag1/Notch signalling plays an important role in regulating sensory patch segregation. The defining feature of lateral induction is the intercellular positive feedback loop linking Notch activation to Jag1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lewis, 1998</xref>), which could in theory regulate the shape or size of the sensory patches by propagating Notch activity across interacting cells. We tested this hypothesis by increasing the levels of lateral induction in the early embryonic chick inner ear. In contrast to previous studies, which used overexpression of an active form of Notch (NICD) or Jag1 using constitutive or inducible promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daudet and Lewis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hartman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Neves et al., 2011</xref>), we used a conditional, Notch-responsive promoter (Hes5) to drive the expression of Dll1. By doing so, an additional Notch ligand, Dll1, was induced in the early Notch-active cells, which are the neural or sensory competent progenitors. The developmental defects resulting from Hes5::Dll1 transfection were complex and included: abnormal morphogenesis of the vestibular system, irregular sensory patch boundaries, hair cell patterning defects, smaller sensory epithelia, and induction of ectopic hair cells. Such variety of defects likely results from a combination of factors: the mosaicism and variability of transfection, the dynamic (Notch-regulated) mode of Dll1 overexpression, the differential response of transfected cells to Notch activation, and the inhibitory function of Dll1 on hair cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chrysostomou et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, the generation of patches with irregular boundaries and of fused sensory domains strongly suggests that lateral induction regulates the positioning and size of sensory organs. Moreover, the fact that Dll1 can promote ectopic sensory cell formation suggests that the early prosensory function of Notch is not specifically linked to Jagged ligands, but to the induction (or maintenance) of Notch activity. This is consistent with the fact that i) NICD overexpression is able to induce ectopic sensory patch formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daudet and Lewis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hartman et al., 2010</xref>), and ii) the absence of Dll1, expressed in the neurosensory competent domain during otic neurogenesis, induces defects in sensory patch morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brooker et al., 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, Dll1 and Jag1 could activate Notch receptors differently, and some evidence suggests that Dll1 induces stronger Notch signalling than Jag1 in the inner ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Petrovic et al., 2014</xref>), possibly due to modifications of the Notch receptor by Fringe proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basch et al., 2016</xref>). Whilst this is advantageous for our ‘gain of lateral induction’ experiments, it will be important to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms that fine-tune the signalling abilities of Notch ligands in the ear.</p><p>Another implication of these gain-of-function experiments is that lateral induction must be dampened in some of the prospective non-sensory cells to permit sensory patch segregation. This down-regulation of Notch activity seems to occur during normal development. In fact, our tracing experiments suggest that some of the early-Notch active cells can switch off Notch activity and develop into non-sensory cells into a wide range of locations. Furthermore, a study in the zebrafish otic vesicle showed that Jag1 is transiently expressed in cells that end up separating the anterior crista from the macula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ma and Zhang, 2015</xref>). We found that Lmx1a is one of the factors required for the attenuation of lateral induction: the absence of Lmx1a results in expanded Jag1+ territories in the <italic>Bsd</italic> mouse vestibular system, whilst the overexpression of cLmx1b in the chick inner ear reduces Jag1 expression and results in misplaced sensory patch borders.</p><p>Further studies are needed to decipher the interactions between Lmx1a and Notch signalling, and in particular the potential contribution of FGF signalling. In fact several FGF ligands are expressed within and at the boundary of sensory epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sánchez-Calderón et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Olaya-Sánchez et al., 2017</xref>) and the inhibition of FGF signalling can impair sensory patch segregation in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ma and Zhang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maier and Whitfield, 2014</xref>). In the chick otic vesicle, FGF inhibition leads to an up-regulation of Jag1 and the Notch effectors Hey1 and Hes5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Petrovic et al., 2015</xref>), which might explain the defects in sensory patch segregation observed after FGF blockade in zebrafish. Furthermore, normal inner ear morphology and positioning of the utricle and cristae are severely disrupted in FGF10 null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Domínguez-Frutos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kopecky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vendrell et al., 2015</xref>). Additional transcription factors such as Otx1/2 (47–50), FoxG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hwang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pauley et al., 2006</xref>), N-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Domínguez-Frutos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kopecky et al., 2011</xref>) and Hmx1/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2004</xref>) are also expressed in non-sensory domains and are required for normal sensory patch segregation. These transcription factors as well as components of the FGF pathway may therefore belong to a complex genetic network that interacts with Lmx1a and Notch signalling to allow sensory patch segregation. Besides their effects on cell differentiation, it would be important to elucidate how these signals impact on cell death or proliferation and the overall morphogenesis of the inner ear – in particular the formation of the tissue constrictions that separate adult sensory organs. In fact, the vestibular system of Lmx1a mutant mice lacks those constrictions and we noticed that the cells overexpressing cLmx1b could form dense aggregates with constricted apical surfaces. This suggests that besides its influence on lateral induction, Lmx1a could have a central role in initiating the complex morphogenetic program leading to the formation of separate chambers for distinct sensory organs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Sensory organ progenitors are labile: implications for the mechanisms of sensory organ formation</title><p>One influential theory for the formation of inner ear sensory organs is known as the ‘compartment boundary’ model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brigande et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fekete, 1996</xref>). It proposes that long-range patterning signals and cellular interactions could establish several lineage-restricted compartments in the otocyst, which would then develop into distinct structures of the adult inner ear. The boundaries of these compartments could in turn act as signalling centres, leading perhaps to the formation of new lineage-restricted compartments, giving rise for example to distinct sensory organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brigande et al., 2000a</xref>). This model was first supported by gene expression studies that revealed localized expression of transcription factors, potentially acting as ‘selectors’ capable of imposing a given identity to a given otic domain. Absence of some of these early regionalised genes causes loss of entire inner ear structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morsli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hammond and Whitfield, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brigande et al., 2000a</xref>), consistent with the notion that inner ear development is partly modular. Fate mapping experiments have also shown that cell mixing is restricted within certain regions of the chick otic placode, implying the existence of clonally-restricted compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brigande et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sánchez-Guardado et al., 2014</xref>). We also found that some boundaries of Lmx1a-GFP expression are very sharp in the developing otocyst, suggesting limited cell mixing between compartments of distinct identities. However other fate mapping and lineage-tracing studies have led to different conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kil and Collazo, 2002</xref>), and some of the early pro-sensory markers (as we also found in the present study) exhibit dynamic changes in their expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cole et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Neves et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sánchez-Guardado et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sánchez-Calderón et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, lineage tracing experiments in the mouse inner ear have shown that the derivatives of the neuro-sensory otic progenitors can be of different types. The Neurog1-expressing cells of the otic neurogenic domain, for example, give rise to neurons, sensory progenitors of the two maculae, but also to non-sensory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Raft et al., 2007</xref>). Likewise, the progeny of the early (E8.5 to E10.5 in mouse) Sox2-expressing cells can contribute to various non-sensory structures, including the roof of the sensory organs and the semi-circular canals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gu et al., 2016</xref>). In the present study, a similar mixture of sensory and non-sensory derivatives was observed among the progeny of the early Notch-active cells in the developing chick inner ear. In summary, it is possible that some strict boundaries do form at an early stage of otic development, but the early sensory-competent domains, at least as defined by Sox2 expression and Notch activity, are not lineage-restricted compartments of cells with a fixed identity. Instead, these domains contain labile, bi-potent cells, which are sensory competent but not necessarily committed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Slack, 1991</xref>) to the sensory fate. If Notch activity is maintained in these cells, they will eventually become sensory progenitors, as seen in the gain-of-function experiments demonstrating ectopic sensory patch formation after Notch induction at early developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daudet and Lewis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hartman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). However if Notch is downregulated, or if Lmx1a/cLmx1b expression is maintained or upregulated, they will be diverted towards a non-sensory fate and lead to sensory organ segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). An important question for future investigations is that of the exact transcriptional and epigenetic modifications that underlie the transition from sensory specification (i.e. the potential to become sensory) to the irreversible commitment to the prosensory fate.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Sensory patch boundary formation is a dynamic and regulated process</title><p>When do lineage-restricted boundaries form at the edge of sensory organs? We did not perform the time-controlled lineage tracing experiments that would be required to answer these questions unambiguously, but several observations suggest that this process occurs progressively and is not synchronous throughout the inner ear. The GFP is a relatively stable protein and its fluorescence (in the absence of antibody immunostaining) provides an indication about the present, as well as past expression of <italic>Lmx1a</italic> in the <italic>Lmx1a<sup>GFP/+</sup></italic> mice. In the organ of Corti, the medial boundary of GFP expression is very sharp, with cells exhibiting either high or low levels of fluorescence, suggesting the position and identity of these cells has been fixed for some time. In contrast, the lateral domain shows a smooth gradient of decreasing GFP fluorescence overlapping with Sox2 expression. This suggests that the sensory progenitors of the lateral domain could derive from Lmx1a-expressing cells that gradually, albeit in a relatively coordinated manner, adopt a sensory progenitor fate. At the border of the utricle facing the cristae, the so-called ‘transitional cells’ that express varying levels of GFP are intermingled with GFP- cells at late embryonic stages and up to at least P5, suggesting a relatively slow and asynchronous loss of Lmx1a expression in this domain. Some of the GFP+ cells in this mosaic domain also exhibit Sox2 expression, suggesting that they could represent cells at different stages of commitment towards a sensory fate. This is consistent with the results of a recent single-cell RNA-Seq study in the neonate mouse utricle, which identified a population of cells, presumably corresponding to the transitional cells, with a mixed sensory and non-sensory gene expression profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burns et al., 2015</xref>). The transitional cells of the neonatal (but not the adult) utricle are also capable of differentiating into hair cells after Atoh1 induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gao et al., 2016</xref>), indicating that these cells are not fully committed to a non-sensory cell fate at this stage. Our results suggest that the hair cells produced at the edge of the neonate mouse utricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burns et al., 2012</xref>) are not derived from early-specified and Sox2-expressing prosensory cells, but perhaps from cells of the Lmx1a-lineage that convert into sensory progenitors at later stages of development. Notch signalling could underlie this developmental switch: Notch activity inhibits cLmx1b expression in the chick otocyst (our data and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abello and Alsina, 2007</xref>), and a similar antagonism might persist at later stages in the utricle, or at the lateral border of the organ of Corti. As hair cells are being added to the sensory epithelia, both lateral induction (Jag1) and lateral inhibition (Dll1) could contribute to the elevation of Notch activity at the border of developing sensory patches. There is also a central to peripheral progression of hair cell differentiation in the cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Slowik and Bermingham-McDonogh, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Slowik and Bermingham-McDonogh, 2013</xref>) suggesting that this process might be a common feature in developing inner ear sensory epithelia. The adult sensory organs of fish and amphibians can add new hair cells at their periphery throughout their adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corwin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corwin, 1985</xref>), and it would be interesting to know if this is due to a persistence of the developmental processes proposed here: a production of new sensory cells by lateral recruitment of uncommitted progenitors, as opposed to a growth ‘from within’, consecutive to the proliferation of committed sensory progenitors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Tissue boundary formation in the inner ear: old genes, new tricks</title><p>The evolutionary conservation of the molecular players controlling mechanosensory cell formation in Drosophila sense organs and the inner ear has long been recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eddison et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adam et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jarman and Groves, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pierce et al., 2008</xref>). In the context of sensory patch segregation, some analogies with the fly exist yet again, but this time with the embryonic wing disc – the tissue in which embryonic compartments were first identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garcia-Bellido et al., 1973</xref>). In the wing disc, two lines of demarcation are established sequentially along the antero-porterior and dorso-ventral axis to create lineage-restricted compartments (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blair, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dahmann et al., 2011</xref>). At the dorso-ventral boundary, two players are essential for this process: Notch signalling and Apterous, the fly homologue of Lmx1a. Remarkably, in both the inner ear and the wing disc, Notch functions by lateral induction to position tissue boundaries. In the wing disc, the dorsal and ventral compartments express a different Notch ligand, respectively Serrate or Delta. However, Notch activity is elevated at the boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Celis et al., 1996</xref>) due to the activity of Fringe, which potentiates Delta/Notch signalling by glycosylation of the Notch receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Panin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fleming et al., 1997</xref>). In the inner ear, there is also differential Notch activity at the border of the sensory patches, but this is presumably due to the absence of Notch ligand expression in the non-sensory cells. The potential implication of Fringe proteins, which are expressed in the prosensory domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cole et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adam et al., 1998</xref>) and at the lateral border of the vestibular patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burns et al., 2015</xref>), remains unexplored in this context. In the wing disc, Apterous acts as a selector gene for the dorsal fate and in its absence, the prospective dorsal cells adopt a ventral fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diaz-Benjumea and Cohen, 1993</xref>). In the ear, Lmx1a may have a similar selector function: in its absence, some, but not all cells of the Lmx1a lineage develop as sensory cells; conversely, overexpression of cLmx1b can divert prospective sensory cells towards non-sensory fate. However, this effect was not consistent, suggesting the implication of additional factors in the commitment to a non-sensory fate. Another major difference lies in the fact that Lmx1a is itself subject to regulation by Notch in the inner ear: its expression does not necessarily predict a non-sensory cell fate, in particular at the borders of developing sensory patches, where Lmx1a is gradually down-regulated as sensory patches expand. In other words, Lmx1a does not define an early lineage-restricted compartment of cells committed to a non-sensory fate.</p><p>The analogies between patterning of the fly wing disc and the inner ear suggests an example of ‘deep homology’: the development of these morphologically divergent structures is regulated by similar molecular players (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carroll, 2008</xref>), belonging to an ancient genetic module that directs the formation of tissue boundaries. Yet, our data indicate that the inner ear sensory domains do not derive from lineage-restricted compartments specified at an early stage. Instead, their development is a regulated and gradual process, involving dynamic changes in gene expression and cell character.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The mechanisms that shape the inner ear sensory organs operate on otic progenitor cells that can remain uncommitted for a relatively long period of time, instructing them to switch their genetic program and differentiate along either a sensory or non-sensory lineage. Given the diversity of sensory organ configurations across and within different classes of vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schulz-Mirbach and Ladich, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Smotherman and Narins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Retzius, 1881</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">1884</xref>), one could imagine a scenario in which their evolutionary variations in size, number, position and shape might have been facilitated by the developmental lability of their otic progenitors. Gene mutations, duplications, or modifications of cis-regulatory elements targeting the molecular factors controlling the growth and developmental segregation of sensory organs could have contributed to the emergence of new sensory patches and their functional diversification in the course of evolution. Comparative genomic studies focused on the genes essential for prosensory specification and segregation could provide some insights into this question. Further work should also investigate the molecular signals that regulate cell differentiation and proliferation at the border of sensory patches, which could be very relevant to the fields of inner ear stem cell biology and hair cell regeneration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Transgenic animals and breeding</title><p><italic>Lmx1a<sup>GFP/GFP</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Griesel et al., 2011</xref>) were kindly provided by Dr Ahmed Mansouri (Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Gottingen, Germany).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work, &quot;Shaping of inner ear sensory organs by antagonistic interactions between Notch signalling and Lmx1a&quot;, for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your initial submission has been assessed by a Senior Editor in consultation with a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors. Although the work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, the reviewers thought that the paper had many interesting aspects but wanted to see a deeper characterization of the roles of Notch and Lmx1a given that both had established roles in in ear development. In particular, the reviewers requested a careful time course of <italic>Sox2</italic>, Jag1 and Lmx1 from early stages (invaginating otocyst to the appearance of individual sensory patches) be added to the paper. This would likely suggest roles in refinement and maintenance of these domains rather than exclusive involvement in induction. Although we cannot consider the present manuscript further, we would encourage you to submit a new manuscript that addresses the comments of all three reviewers below. If you feel you can address their concerns, we would make every effort to return the manuscript to the same reviewers.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript proposes that mutual antagonism between the Lmx1 transcription factor and Notch signaling allows the segregation of sensory regions of the amniote inner ear into distinct territories, and that when Lmx1 is reduced, sensory organs either fuse or develop imprecise boundaries.</p><p>The main issue with the paper is that although it demonstrates a direct involvement of Lmx1 activity in attenuating Notch signaling (and vice versa), and does so using new methods of visualizing Lmx1 and Notch activity, the main conclusions of the paper are not an enormous advance over several previously published studies of Lmx1 mutant mice.</p><p>My main concern with their interpretation is the fact that Jag1, <italic>Sox2</italic> and Notch target genes are expressed broadly in the early otic placode and otocyst, and although these genes later localize to prosensory regions of the ear, they initially mark future sensory and non-sensory domains. Although Notch activity can indeed induce Jag1, it is likely that, under normal circumstances, Notch signaling is preserving prosensory fate when other signals that regulate Lmx1 and other genes become active and down-regulate these genes from broad areas of the ear.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript addresses an active area of inquiry regarding sensory organ specification in the development of the vertebrate inner ear. Through a series of gain- and loss-of-function analyses in chicken or mouse inner ears, the authors conclude that mutually-inhibitory interactions between a Notch-mediated signaling cascade and the transcription factor, Lmx1b, will cause a common prosensory epithelium to split into separate organs. Cells retaining higher levels of Jag1 become sensory, and those retaining the highest levels of Lmx1b become non-sensory. Disruption of this network of mutual inhibition leads to disruptions at the borders of the sensory patches, formation of ectopic sensory patches, and in some cases foci of non-sensory patches within the sensory organs. The authors discuss their work in the context of two theoretical models of sensory organ specification that have been put forward: a &quot;boundary&quot; model and &quot;sensory segregation&quot; model. The discussion of how their work can inform these theoretical frameworks makes for an intellectually satisfying context for considering these new experimental data. The paper is supported by numerous experiments which have required the authors to generate new constructs, as well as further analysis of existing Lmx1 mouse mutants. This is an important paper that offers researchers new ways of thinking about the mechanisms involved in generating multiple distinct sensory organs in the inner ear during development and evolution. Specifically, it now connects Notch signaling and Lmx1, which had each individually been linked with sensory organ separation in either zebrafish or mouse models.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript, the authors often refer to &quot;lateral borders&quot; of sensory organs. It is not always clear if this refers to a lateral direction relative to the midline of the body, or if this is simply a way to describe any edge of any organ (excepting the cochlea, where the directionality is clear). Subsection “A gain of lateral induction leads to defects in the positioning of sensory patch boundaries and to sensory domain fusion.” states.…&quot;groups of ectopic hair cells…were found at the lateral border of sensory organs&quot;. Subsection “Sensory patch boundary formation is a dynamic and regulated process” discusses sharpening of the edge of the utricle at its &quot;lateral border&quot;. Is this the only edge for which this sharpening takes place? The reason this is of interest is that the boundary model offered a hypothesis in which sensory organs arise from within the broader sensory-competent region, but at the boundary with an adjacent compartment. But each sensory organ is not itself considered to be a lineage compartment. Rather, the edge of the organ that abuts an adjacent compartment is expected to be the true lineage boundary. As such, the other edges of the same organ need not be lineage-restricted, and thus could be dependent on the sort of Notch-mediated lateral induction described here to allow for enlargement over time. Moreover, the sensory segregation model leaves open the question of whether the boundary of the entire neurosensory domain might be a lineage boundary, even if it includes future non-sensory cells and neuroblasts that will emigrate away.</p><p>2) Can the authors state with any certainty, based on their available data, if EVERY edge of EVERY organ is labile and requires the expression of Lmx1 in its adjacent non-sensory cells to become sharp? The Lmx1a expression data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> do not show the gene completely surrounding each organ, but the timing of its expression might be a critical variable.</p><p>3) Given the working model presented by the authors, it would be valuable to perform a time course showing Lmx1 and Jag1 expressions side-by-side (preferably in double labeling) for either mouse or chicken. This could help to solidify the conclusion that Lmx1 is intimately associated with the separation of organs as they make their appearance.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Differentiating the developing otocyst into a complicated vertebrate ear requires the formation of sensory epithelia separated by non-sensory epithelium. How this process is regulated at a molecular and cellular level has only been partially elucidated by previous work of the senior author and by work of others showing that loss of certain transcription factors causes fusion of some sensory epithelia, notably the loss of Lmx1a. Building on this existing data, the current work demonstrates that a balance of Notch signal regulation may be at the basis for this sensory epithelium segregation. The paper makes very intelligent use of several new reagents such as bicolor fluorescent reporter for Notch activity and others in chicken.

Anatomical studies of inner ear development in fish and amphibians have led to the proposition that sensory organs are formed by segregation from a common pan-sensory domain, but this process has not been conclusively demonstrated in amniotes. Furthermore, the nature of the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are unclear. In this study, using a whole-mount preparation method for visualizing the expression of <italic>Sox2</italic> and Jag1 in the embryonic chicken otocyst, we provide strong evidence that segregation leads to the formation of the anterior and lateral cristae. We show that sensory patch segregation is regulated by the mutually antagonistic relationship between signals promoting (Notch) or antagonizing (Lmx1) commitment to the sensory fate. This study provides a molecular explanation for the sensory patch patterning defects found in the Lmx1a mouse mutant ear, and clarifies the role of Notch activity in promoting commitment of the sensory-competent cells of the early otocyst to a sensory fate. Our findings emphasize the labile character of the early sensory progenitors of the inner ear, in particular at sensory patch borders, which is a conceptual shift from the somehow deterministic view of sensory organ specification that tends to dominate the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My main concern with their interpretation is the fact that Jag1, Sox2 and Notch target genes are expressed broadly in the early otic placode and otocyst, and although these genes later localize to prosensory regions of the ear, they initially mark future sensory and non-sensory domains. Although Notch activity can indeed induce Jag1, it is likely that, under normal circumstances, Notch signaling is preserving prosensory fate when other signals that regulate Lmx1 and other genes become active and down-regulate these genes from broad areas of the ear.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not disagree with this comment. It is well known that expression of Jag1, Lmx1a, and a number of other genes is very dynamic in the otic placode and early otocyst, but there is, as this referee points out, a progressive stabilization of their spatial pattern of expression. In this study, we focused on those dynamic changes and how they contribute to the regulation of sensory patch segregation and the positioning of their boundaries at relatively late stages of inner ear development. We believe that the duration and significance of these changes were not fully appreciated in previous studies.</p><p>We also agree with the notion that Jag1 (lateral induction) functions predominantly to promote sensory commitment, as opposed to sensory specification – this is one of the conclusions of this study. What we show here is that the formation of multiple sensory patches is critically dependent on the down-regulation of lateral induction, which was not previously known. Lmx1a is probably one of the important factors in opposing lateral induction, but not the only one. We have now emphasized these points in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript addresses an active area of inquiry regarding sensory organ specification in the development of the vertebrate inner ear. Through a series of gain- and loss-of-function analyses in chicken or mouse inner ears, the authors conclude that mutually-inhibitory interactions between a Notch-mediated signaling cascade and the transcription factor, Lmx1b, will cause a common prosensory epithelium to split into separate organs. Cells retaining higher levels of Jag1 become sensory, and those retaining the highest levels of Lmx1b become non-sensory. Disruption of this network of mutual inhibition leads to disruptions at the borders of the sensory patches, formation of ectopic sensory patches, and in some cases foci of non-sensory patches within the sensory organs. The authors discuss their work in the context of two theoretical models of sensory organ specification that have been put forward: a &quot;boundary&quot; model and &quot;sensory segregation&quot; model. The discussion of how their work can inform these theoretical frameworks makes for an intellectually satisfying context for considering these new experimental data. The paper is supported by numerous experiments which have required the authors to generate new constructs, as well as further analysis of existing Lmx1 mouse mutants. This is an important paper that offers researchers new ways of thinking about the mechanisms involved in generating multiple distinct sensory organs in the inner ear during development and evolution. Specifically, it now connects Notch signaling and Lmx1, which had each individually been linked with sensory organ separation in either zebrafish or mouse models.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript, the authors often refer to &quot;lateral borders&quot; of sensory organs. It is not always clear if this refers to a lateral direction relative to the midline of the body, or if this is simply a way to describe any edge of any organ (excepting the cochlea, where the directionality is clear). Subsection “A gain of lateral induction leads to defects in the positioning of sensory patch boundaries and to sensory domain fusion.” states.…&quot;groups of ectopic hair cells…were found at the lateral border of sensory organs&quot;. Subsection “Sensory patch boundary formation is a dynamic and regulated process” discusses sharpening of the edge of the utricle at its &quot;lateral border&quot;. Is this the only edge for which this sharpening takes place? The reason this is of interest is that the boundary model offered a hypothesis in which sensory organs arise from within the broader sensory-competent region, but at the boundary with an adjacent compartment. But each sensory organ is not itself considered to be a lineage compartment. Rather, the edge of the organ that abuts an adjacent compartment is expected to be the true lineage boundary. As such, the other edges of the same organ need not be lineage-restricted, and thus could be dependent on the sort of Notch-mediated lateral induction described here to allow for enlargement over time. Moreover, the sensory segregation model leaves open the question of whether the boundary of the entire neurosensory domain might be a lineage boundary, even if it includes future non-sensory cells and neuroblasts that will emigrate away.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this referee for these very insightful comments.</p><p>The terminology used for the ‘lateral border’ of the utricle was not clear enough and has been changed throughout the manuscript. There are indeed some region-specific differences in the pattern of Lmx1a-GFP fluorescence at the edge of the developing utricle (and the prosensory domain from which it derives), which we now describe in the text (see also new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>This referee is right in pointing out that the compartment-boundary model does not necessarily imply that sensory organs represent themselves lineage-restricted compartments. Explaining in detail the ‘compartment-boundary’ model would unnecessarily complicate the Introduction and we have now decided to address this topic in the Discussion (Sensory organ progenitors are labile: implications for the mechanisms of sensory organ formation). Our results indeed suggest that the prosensory domains could have different types of boundaries (lineage-restricted and not) at their periphery, and this is now summarized as follows in the Discussion section:</p><p>“One could therefore combine the two models for sensory organ formation by proposing that the boundary model (regionalised expression of ‘selector’ genes, regulated by long-range and local cell-cell interactions) operates in the context of a labile, ‘pan-sensory’ domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). […] This process would be regulated by regionalised signals (Notch, Lmx1a, and any factor capable of regulating their expression or activity) that commit sensory-competent cells to a prosensory fate, or divert them from this fate to form non-sensory cells in between sensory patches.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Can the authors state with any certainty, based on their available data, if EVERY edge of EVERY organ is labile and requires the expression of Lmx1 in its adjacent non-sensory cells to become sharp?

We now put more emphasis on these differences in the result section and have provided new images that illustrate these differences during the development of the inner ear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nevertheless, the mosaicism in Lmx1a-GFP expression is more pronounced and long-lasting at the edge of the utricle (in particular in the region facing the anterior and lateral cristae) than in any other organ we examined, suggesting an enhanced degree of plasticity in this domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Given the working model presented by the authors, it would be valuable to perform a time course showing Lmx1 and Jag1 expressions side-by-side (preferably in double labeling) for either mouse or chicken.
