continues to learn and can recover from injury, but the elements and operation of the neural circuits responsible for this plasticity are not known. In previous work, we have shown that locomotion dramatically enhances neural activity in the visual cortex (V1) of the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>), identified the cortical circuit responsible for this enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2014</xref>), and shown that locomotion also dramatically enhances adult plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaneko and Stryker, 2014</xref>). The circuit that is responsible for enhancing neural activity in the visual cortex contains both vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and somatostatin (SST) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we ask whether this VIP-SST circuit enhances plasticity directly, independent of locomotion and aerobic activity. Optogenetic activation or genetic blockade of this circuit reveals that it is both necessary and sufficient for rapidly increasing V1 cortical responses following manipulation of visual experience in adult mice. These findings reveal a disinhibitory circuit that regulates adult cortical plasticity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05558.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05558.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>visual cortex</kwd><kwd>neural plasticity</kwd><kwd>VIP cell</kwd><kwd>somatostatin cell</kwd><kwd>critical period</kwd><kwd>adult plasticty</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY02874</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stryker</surname><given-names>Michael P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32MH089920</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaneko</surname><given-names>Megumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32EY007120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fu</surname><given-names>Yu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (Kaneko and Stryker, 2014), we report that the specific population of inhibitory neurons that increases the responses of neurons in the visual cortex during locomotion will also, when activated or blocked artificially, dramatically alter adult cortical plasticity, revealing that the aerobic exercise of locomotion is not necessary.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Cortical plasticity declines with aging, accounting for decreased learning and memory, as well as reduced neural rehabilitation in aging brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Singer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Park and Reuter-Lorenz, 2009</xref>). Running or other physical exercise has been suggested to improve many aspects of brain function in aging human beings, including brain plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Voss et al., 2013</xref>). In aged animals, environmental enrichment has also been shown to improve learning and memory, as well as cortical plasticity; but the underlying circuit mechanisms are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vivar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Greifzu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our laboratory recently showed that running enhances both visual cortical responses and plasticity in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaneko and Stryker, 2014</xref>). We also found that running potently activates VIP neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1), which in turn inhibit SST inhibitory neurons, thereby disinhibiting the excitatory pyramidal neurons and allowing them to respond more strongly to the visual stimuli for which they are selective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). We also showed that activating VIP neurons is both sufficient and necessary for enhancing visual responses during running (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2014</xref>).

To test the requirement of VIP-cell synaptic transmission in this model, we first sutured closed one eyelid of VIP-Cre mice at ∼P24, before the peak of critical period, and then after 4 months injected 1 µl of AAV-DIO-TeTx or PBS (the vehicle solution for virus) into the binocular zone of V1. After an additional month, we re-opened the closed eye and allowed the animals to run on Styrofoam balls floating on air while viewing a visual stimulus 4 hr per day for 21 days, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaneko and Stryker, 2014</xref>). Cortical responses through two eyes were measured by an experimenter blind to the treatment with intrinsic signal imaging immediately after eye opening and every 7 days during the recovery period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Intrinsic signal imaging provides a reliable and non-invasive measurement of visual cortical responses to the two eyes, permitting long-term repeated measurement of the same animal to assess plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaneko et al., 2008</xref>). Its results have been extensively validated by electrophysiological recordings in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaneko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaneko and Stryker, 2014</xref>). As expected, the deprived-eye visual responses recovered well in the control PBS-injected VIP-Cre mice, and the ocular dominance index (ODI) reached a level that is similar to non-deprived animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, black traces, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaneko and Stryker (2014)</xref>). In contrast, V1 responses to the deprived eye in the AAV-DIO-TeTx injected animals recovered only modestly, even after 21 days (PBS: 1.82 ± 0.26, TeTx: 1.40 ± 0.20, p = 0.006), with an ODI significantly smaller than in the control animals (PBS: 0.249 ± 0.07, TeTx: 0.083 ± 0.02, p = 0.0004; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, green traces). Indeed, the poor recovery of AAV-DIO-TeTx injected animals was similar to that of animals that did not run in our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaneko and Stryker, 2014</xref>), despite the fact that they ran as much as PBS-injected animals (% of running time: TeTx, 67.88 ± 23.6 vs PBS, 68.14 ± 17.57; average running velocity in cm/s: TeTx, 10.78 ± 3.142 vs PBS, 9.43 ± 5.29; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In these animals, as in all of the TeTx-treated animals described below, we noted no obvious changes in temperament or visual behavior; experimental and control animals appeared indistinguishable. Responses of the open-eye were not significantly changed in either group of animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Silencing the transmission of VIP neurons thus abolished the effect of running on adult plasticity in this mouse model of amblyopia by reducing the potentiation of deprived-eye responses during recovery.</p><p>During the critical period, 3 days of monocular deprivation (MD) is always sufficient to shift the ocular dominance by reducing the deprived-eye response. In adult mice (&gt;3 months old), 7 days of MD is required for a reliable shift of the ocular dominance, and this shift is produced by increasing the open-eye responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sato and Stryker, 2008</xref>). Ocular dominance plasticity in adult mice is thus not only much slower but is also qualitatively different from that during the critical period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sato and Stryker, 2008</xref>). To determine whether locomotion would enhance another measure of adult plasticity, we examined changes in visual responses after short-term MD in adult mice that had been reared normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As expected, 4-day MD did not significantly change the ODI or the response of either eye in adult animals housed in standard conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, ‘B6 Home cage’ group). However, 4-day MD combined with daily visual stimulation and running led to enhanced plasticity, including both increases in open-eye responses and decreases in deprived-eye responses (ODI before and after MD: 0.25 ± 0.03 vs 0.09 ± 0.08, p &lt; 0.001; closed-eye response before and after MD: 2.37 ± 0.28 vs 1.95 ± 0.34, p &lt; 0.01; open-eye response before and after MD: 1.41 ± 0.18 vs 1.69 ± 0.25, p &lt; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, ‘B6 VS + run’ group). To examine the role of VIP-cell synaptic transmission in the effect of running on this measure of adult plasticity, we injected AAV-DIO-TeTx into the binocular V1 of adult VIP-Cre mice that had been reared normally and measured the changes in visual responses after 4-day MD combined with daily visual stimulation and running (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). After silencing the synaptic transmission of VIP neurons, running in conjunction with visual stimulation still led to significant depression of the closed-eye response (2.51 ± 0.31 vs 2.23 ± 0.29, p &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, ‘VIP-TeTx VS + run’ group) but failed to potentiate the open-eye response (1.51 ± 0.20 vs 1.53 ± 0.18, p &gt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, ‘VIP-TeTx VS + run’ group), resulting in a much smaller change of ODI after 4D-MD (0.25 ± 0.03 vs 0.18 ± 0.05, p &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, ‘VIP-TeTx VS + run’ group).

We expressed a variant of channelrhodopsin, ChETA, in VIP neurons of binocular V1 by infecting VIP-Cre mice with AAV-DIO-ChETA-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>); we had previously shown this treatment to enhance visual responses of excitatory cells in stationary mice upon stimulation with blue light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). We imaged baseline visual responses ∼2 weeks after viral injection. After implanting the fiber optic cannula in the binocular zone of V1, we sutured one eyelid and connected the cannula to a blue LED light source (20 Hz pulses, 2 s on, 1 s off, 4 hr each day) while the mice were housed in their home cages. No behavioral response to the optogenetic stimulus was evident during delivery. After 5-day MD in conjunction with optogenetic stimulation, we found that the visual response of the open-eye was dramatically potentiated (1.39 ± 0.19 vs 2.28 ± 0.81, p &lt; 0.05; 64 ± 53% fold increase; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, blue traces), significantly shifting ODI (0.22 ± 0.03 vs 0.05 ± 0.08, p &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, blue traces), with no significant change in the visual response of the closed eye (2.08 ± 0.12 vs 2.10 ± 0.55, p &gt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, blue traces). To rule out the possibility that the surgery procedure itself leads to enhanced plasticity, we injected VIP-Cre mice with AAV-DIO-TdTomato and subjected these control animals to the same procedure of optogenetic stimulation and 5-day MD (VIP-Tdtm group); no change was found in the open-eye response (1.77 ± 0.37 vs 1.62 ± 0.31, p &gt; 0.05) and ODI (0.19 ± 0.06 vs 0.21 ± 0.05, p &gt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>, red traces). Because AAV-DIO-ChETA may have labeled a small number of non-VIP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pi et al., 2013</xref>), we also examined whether stimulating non-specifically labeled, mostly pyramidal neurons would enhance adult plasticity.

The present study reveals a new function of this disinhibitory circuit in regulating cortical plasticity.</p><p>Enhancing adult plasticity has long been a topic of great interest on account of its implications for human wellbeing. Inhibitory circuits have been implicated in regulating cortical plasticity. For example, both reducing GABA production and antagonizing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors have been found to enhance adult plasticity in rat visual cortex, possibly by facilitating the potentiation of the input from the open eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harauzov et al., 2010</xref>). Chronic treatment using the antidepressant drug fluoxetine enhances adult plasticity, accompanied by reduced GABA levels in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maya Vetencourt et al., 2008</xref>). Our results are consistent with the idea that reduced inhibition is permissive for enhancing adult plasticity.</p><p>Removing extracellular perineuronal nets is also reported to enhance adult plasticity in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pizzorusso et al., 2002</xref>; but see; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vorobyov et al., 2013</xref>). This and other findings suggest that simply destabilizing synaptic connections may enhance cortical plasticity, because reduced GABA transmission de-stabilizes GABAergic synaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). Transplanted GABAergic progenitor cells may create another form of instability of inhibitory circuits by making widespread new connections with host neurons and causing a second critical period of plasticity in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Southwell et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Extensive evidence has accumulated indicating that parvalbumin (PV)-positive fast-spiking cells play an important role in cortical plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hensch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kuhlman et al., 2013</xref>). Our study reveals that disinhibiting pyramidal neurons by either activating VIP neurons or silencing SST neurons also enhances adult plasticity and allows potentiation of open-eye responses in V1, revealing an important role for at least these other major types of inhibitory neurons in cortical plasticity. Recent findings using transplantation of embryonic inhibitory neurons also support a role for SST neurons in cortical plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tang et al., 2014</xref>). It should be noted that there are multiple classes of SST neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Markram et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2013</xref>), only some of which are suppressed during locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>). In the present experiments, TeTx was presumably not selective in silencing the different subgroups of SST neurons.</p><p>Enhancing serotonin signaling by chronic fluoxetine treatment has also been shown to enhance adult plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maya Vetencourt et al., 2008</xref>). Exposure to an enriched environment was reported to enhance serotonin levels in rat visual cortex as well as to enhance adult plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baroncelli et al., 2010</xref>). Unlike PV and SST neurons, VIP neurons express the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> serotonin receptor, a channel that allows fast depolarization of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). VIP neurons also receive a direct nicotinic cholinergic input from the basal forebrain, which modulates cortical state and sensory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee and Dan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the VIP-SST disinhibitory circuit is well poised as a target for manipulation of cortical plasticity by these two neuromodulators.</p><p>Adult ocular dominance plasticity in V1 consists of a potentiation of the open-eye response following MD; while critical period plasticity features an initial depression of the deprived-eye response followed by potentiation of the response to the open eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sato and Stryker, 2008</xref>). A number of manipulations in older animals mimic critical period plasticity in their effects on responses to the two eyes: transplantation of embryonic inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Southwell et al., 2010</xref>) or acute suppression of the activity of PV neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kuhlman et al., 2013</xref>) in mice, or chronic fluoxetine treatment in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maya Vetencourt et al., 2008</xref>). Other manipulations, such as brief dark exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stodieck et al., 2014</xref>), repeated MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hofer et al., 2006</xref>), visuomotor experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tschetter et al., 2013</xref>), or activation of Rho GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cerri et al., 2011</xref>), lead to a potentiation of open-eye responses that resembles normal adult plasticity following more prolonged MD. The present findings reveal that activation of the VIP-SST disinhibitory pathway is both necessary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figure 1, 2</xref>) and sufficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3, 4</xref>) for cortical plasticity that potentiates visual responses, and that aerobic exercise is neither necessary nor sufficient. Running, on the other hand, produces both potentiation of open eye responses and depression of responses to the closed eye. Running is associated not only with activation of cortical VIP neurons, but also with increases in multiple neuromodulators including serotonin and noradrenalin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meeusen and De Meirleir, 1995</xref>), both of which have been implicated in modulating adult plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gu, 2002</xref>). It is, therefore, not surprising that enhancement of adult plasticity by locomotion is more complex than simply activating VIP-SST disinhibitory circuit, even though silencing VIP transmission abolished the effect of running on enhancing visual response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). More importantly, the present results also suggest that the potentiation of open-eye response and the depression of closed-eye response are separable from each other and are mediated by distinct mechanisms.</p><p>The difference between the plasticity produced by reducing the activity of PV- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kuhlman et al., 2013</xref>) or SST- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) neurons during MD suggests that different inhibitory circuits are engaged in gating distinct aspects of cortical plasticity. PV- and SST-cells innervate different compartments of pyramidal neurons and exert distinct physiological effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Markram et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hu et al., 2014</xref>). For example, inhibitory synapses on dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van Versendaal et al., 2012</xref>), which are preferentially innervated by SST neurons, are specifically lost during potentiation of the open-eye response in adult plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chiu et al., 2013</xref>). The different responses to reduced inhibition of distinct elements of the cortical circuit may be fundamental to understanding the differences between critical period and adult plasticity.</p><sec id="s1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>Animals and monocular deprivation</title><p>VIP-Cre (stock No. 010908), SST-Cre (stock No. 013044), and C57B/L6 mice were from Jackson Lab.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Sacha Nelson, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors and colleagues have previously shown that exercise (running) enhances visual responses through a disinhibitory circuit involving VIP and SST interneurons and that exercise enhances the recovery from amblyopia produced by monocular deprivation (prior <italic>eLife</italic> paper). The present study tests the idea that the activation of the disinhibitory circuit is necessary and sufficient for the enhanced plasticity during recovery from monocular deprivation, and finds convincingly that the two sets of phenomena are causally related. Other aspects of exercise (e.g. stimulation of neurogenesis, activation of other neuromodulatory pathways etc.) have previously been implicated in the effect of exercise on plasticity, so the present results were not a foregone conclusion.</p><p>The authors first show that VIP activity is necessary for the increased ocular dominance plasticity that is observed in adult animals that are running while viewing stimuli. They also show that activating these VIP neurons intensifies ocular dominance plasticity in normally-reared mice that have been monocularly deprived as adults. The authors then show that VIP activity is sufficient to enhance ocular dominance plasticity in adult mice, using optogenetics. Finally, the authors hypothesize that these VIP neurons are acting to inhibit SST neurons; therefore, inactivating SST neurons should also enhance plasticity. The authors perform this experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and show that this enhances plasticity in adult mice.</p><p>This represents a significant advance, but one which is tightly linked to the prior paper and so is quite appropriate for a Research Advance. The experiments appear to have been carefully carried out and convincingly controlled and both reviewers had no major concerns.</p><p>Both reviewers also felt that the function of different classes of interneurons in visual cortical plasticity are of great general interest, and expect that this paper will be widely read.</p><p><italic>Minor comments:</italic></p><p>1) Were there any acute behavioral effects of the silencing and activating reagents used? The control for amount of running is convincing but it would also be helpful to note the presence or absence of any obvious changes in visual behavior, anxiety, etc. and if present, why these are unlikely to have contributed to the observed effects.</p><p>2) The removal of perineuronal nets is relatively controversial (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vorobyov et al., 2013</xref>, J Neurosci, Jan 2;33(1):234–43.). “Some reports suggest that removing extracellular perineuronal…”</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05558.010</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>In the revised manuscript, we have addressed all the reviewers’ comments and performed more experiments to further strengthen our conclusions. We showed in the original manuscript that running enhanced the shift of ocular dominance index after 4-day monocular deprivation in adult mice, by both depressing the closed-eye response and potentiating the open-eye response. Our new results show that the synaptic transmission of VIP neurons is specifically involved in potentiating the open-eye response (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, respectively), which is the feature characteristic of normal adult ocular dominance plasticity after more prolonged periods of deprivation. Furthermore, in another group of mice, we did longitudinal intrinsic signal imaging, studying individual animals before and after deprivation, to confirm that the open-eye response is potentiated after 5-day monocular deprivation when SST neurons are silenced (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>). We also revised our manuscript accordingly to include these new findings.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p><italic>1) Were there any acute behavioral effects of the silencing and activating reagents used?

In the revised manuscript, we added the following sentences: “In these animals, as in all of the TeTx-treated animals described below, we noted no obvious changes in temperament or visual behavior; experimental and control animals appeared indistinguishable” (paragraph five), and “No behavioral response to the optogenetic stimulus was evident during delivery” (paragraph seven).</p><p><italic>2) The removal of perineuronal nets is relatively controversial (see</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42"><italic>Vorobyov et al., 2013</italic></xref><italic>, J Neurosci, Jan 2;33(1):234–43.). “Some reports suggest that removing extracellular perineuronal…</italic>”</p><p>We revised the related text to be “Removing extracellular perineuronal nets is also reported to enhance adult plasticity in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pizzorusso et al., 2002</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vorobyov et al., 2013</xref>).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
