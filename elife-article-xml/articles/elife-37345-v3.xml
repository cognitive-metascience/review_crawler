However, what controls the timing of viral DNA ejection events was not understood. This in vitro study reveals that DNA ejection dynamics for phages can be synchronized (occurring within seconds) or desynchronized (displaying minutes-long delays in initiation) based on mobility of encapsidated DNA, which in turn is regulated by environmental factors, such as temperature and extra-cellular ionic conditions. This mechano-regulation of ejection dynamics is suggested to influence viral replication where the cell’s decision between lytic and latent infection is associated with synchronized or desynchronized delayed ejection events from phage population adsorbed to a cell. Our findings are of significant importance for understanding regulatory mechanisms of latency in phage and Herpesviruses, where encapsidated DNA undergoes a similar mechanical transition.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37345.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses are tiny ‘parasites’ that smuggle their genetic material inside a cell and then hijack its resources for their own benefit. A viral infection can either be lytic or latent. In a lytic cycle, viruses make their host produce many copies of themselves, ultimately killing the cell. In contrast, during a latent infection, the viruses go ‘dormant’: for instance, some of them can insert their genetic material into the DNA of their host, which then gets passed on as the cell divides.</p><p>Certain viruses are capable of both lytic and latent infections. One example is the lambda phage, which targets <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> bacteria. In the first stage of infection, the genetic material ‘shoots out’ of the virus and gets injected inside the bacterium. The dynamics of the ejection process determine the type of infection that will follow. If multiple phages release their genomes quickly and within seconds of each other into the same cell, the bacterium tends to incorporate the viral DNA into its own genome, leading to a latent cycle. If the infections take place more slowly and not all at the same time, the cell is more likely to go through a lytic phase. However, the mechanism behind the different injection behaviors is still unknown; in particular, it is unclear which factors control the specificities of the ejection process in the first place.</p><p>Here, Alex Evilevitch demonstrates that the mechanical state of the phage DNA just before ejection dictates how the genetic material will then be injected in the bacteria. The experiments measured the stiffness of the DNA and the amount of heat given off during infection. Like fluid toothpaste, if the DNA is more liquid and flexible, it gets ejected quickly and simultaneously from several phages. Then, the genetic information of these viruses can be incorporated in the genome of the bacteria. On the other hand, if the DNA is more solid, it is likely to ‘stick’ and take time before it can be squeezed out: the injections become unsynchronised, which leads to a lytic phase.</p><p>Evilevitch then shows that the environment can influence the properties of the phages’ genome. A little more heat, or certain chemicals, can make the DNA more fluid inside the viruses, and change the way it can be injected inside the bacteria.</p><p>Many viruses that cause diseases in humans – from cold sores to glandular fever – can switch between the lytic and latent cycles. For the first time, these results show that the mechanical properties of the DNA inside a virus influence the ‘decision’ between the two types of infection. This knowledge could help us prevent infections from becoming lytic and ultimately allow us to control the spread of disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA ejection dynamics</kwd><kwd>calorimetry</kwd><kwd>latent and lytic infection</kwd><kwd>phage</kwd><kwd>DNA pressure</kwd><kwd>DNA transition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CHE-1744061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evilevitch</surname><given-names>Alex</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>62120145537</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evilevitch</surname><given-names>Alex</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>34920143962</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evilevitch</surname><given-names>Alex</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Funding for this work was provided by the National Science Foundation CHE-1744061 (to AE) and Swedish Research Council (VR) grants 621-2014-5537 and 349-2014-3962 (to AE).</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Temperature and ionic conditions control the mechanical properties of virally encapsidated DNA and act as a switch between synchronized and desynchronized genome ejection dynamics in a phage population.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gaining insight into the dynamics of viral gene delivery into a host cell during infection is critical for understanding the virus replication dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ellis and Delbrück, 1939</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">You and Yin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gallet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 1997</xref>) and viral fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burch and Chao, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abedon and Culler, 2007</xref>). A central method for studying virus replication dynamics is the ‘one-step growth cycle’ method, which was developed for an ex vivo model of phage growth in <italic>E. coli</italic> by Ellis and Delbruck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ellis and Delbrück, 1939</xref>). This quantitative method measures the rate of one cycle of phage replication. For accurate quantification of the infectious cycle rate, it is critical that the infection is synchronized so that cells are infected at the same time. This is achieved by incubating bacterial culture with phage, diluting the solution after phage has adsorbed to cells so that no more adsorption occurs, and then measuring virus growth at different time intervals using a plaque assay. Modified versions of the one-step and multi-step replication assays remain central today for monitoring the growth and evolution of viruses as they mutate to evade antiviral drugs, the immune system or environmental factors inhibiting viral spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coffin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perelson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nowak, 1992</xref>). The one-step growth cycle method builds on an assumption that initiation of infection through phage DNA injection into cells occurs rapidly and simultaneously after phage adsorbs to cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ellis and Delbrück, 1939</xref>). Although the dynamics of the phage adsorption step has been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moldovan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mackay and Bode, 1976</xref>), the dynamics of the initiation of phage injection is poorly understood even though it has critical importance for virus growth rate studies.</p><p>The one-step growth cycle method focuses on the lytic infection pathway (where a virus replicates immediately, leading to cell lysis). However, the cell decision between a lytic or lysogenic infection (latent state where phage DNA is integrated into a cell chromosome without killing the cell) may depend on the dynamics of DNA injection from multiple phages adsorbed to a single bacterial cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trinh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kourilsky, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kourilsky, 1973</xref>). Some studies claimed that DNA ejection from such a phage population occurs in a stochastic manner and is solely attributed to the opening dynamics of the portal-tail connector channel through which DNA is being ejected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raspaud et al., 2007</xref>). This description fits the generalized picture of biochemical stochasticity proposed in the past for many cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arkin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Singh and Weinberger, 2009</xref>). However, as shown below, our data does not support these claims. Furthermore, biochemical stochasticity may not play as much of a role in virus-cell interactions as previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">St-Pierre and Endy, 2008</xref>), specifically concerning the process of cell-fate decision making between lysogenic and lytic pathways in <italic>E. coli</italic> following phage λ infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trinh et al., 2017</xref>). While host functions can influence this decision process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casjens and Hendrix, 2015</xref>), the initial choice is made at the individual phage level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trinh et al., 2017</xref>). This, in turn, determines how phages interact with one another during cell infection, where the central interaction parameter is replication dynamics of multiple viral genomes being injected into a cell. Interestingly, replication dynamics occurs on the timescale of the genome injection process, varying from seconds to minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mackay and Bode, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Van Valen et al., 2012</xref>). This is also evidenced by an important role that the order of phage genome injection is playing in CRISPR sequence acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Modell et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, timing of phage DNA injections into a cell has been shown to affect the decision between lysogeny and cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trinh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cortes et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, it was proposed that simultaneous, instant injection events from all phages infecting one cell lead to a lack of competition for replication of phage genomes, which results in higher lysogenizaton frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trinh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kourilsky, 1973</xref>). It was indeed observed that probability of lysogeny increases with the number of simultaneously infecting phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trinh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kourilsky, 1973</xref>). On the contrary, delayed asynchronous injections lead to competitive interactions between phage genomes observed during lytic infection. Consistently, infection delays were shown to decrease the chance of lysogeny by also lowering CII levels in the cell, where CII is a viral DNA-binding transcription factor governing postinfection decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cortes et al., 2017</xref>). Lytic phage that delivers its genome first overrides cell’s lysogeny decision and uses cell’s limited resources to replicate its own progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trinh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kourilsky, 1973</xref>).</p><p>A pioneering study demonstrated that DNA injection from phage λ, after preadsorption to <italic>E. coli</italic>, occurred instantaneously at 37°C, but at lower temperatures the heterogeneous injection dynamics with minutes-long lag times was observed, with injections completely inhibited at 4°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mackay and Bode, 1976</xref>). The mechanism behind this injection behavior remained unknown. Thus, understanding the mechanism and environmental factors determining the switch between synchronized and desynchronized injection dynamics from a phage population is of key importance for studies of the infectious cycle where the cell decision between lytic and lysogenic infection plays a crucial role. As shown here, the main factor influencing injection dynamics is the structural state of DNA inside the viral capsid. DNA is tightly packaged inside phage λ capsid with DNA-DNA surface separation of only 7 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lander et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Earnshaw and Harrison, 1977</xref>). This leads to high interstrand repulsive forces that, along with DNA bending stress, result in internal genome pressure of tens of atmospheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evilevitch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tzlil et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Purohit et al., 2003</xref>). This pressure powers DNA ejection into a bacterial cell. However, the small interstrand distance also generates electrostatic and hydration sliding friction between neighboring DNA strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gabashvili and Grosberg, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berndsen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), which limits the packaged genome’s mobility (or fluidity). Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) combined with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we have recently shown that restricted intra-capsid DNA mobility can be characterized by a solid-like mechanical response to nano-indentation of a DNA-filled capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sae-Ueng et al., 2014</xref>). At the same time, DNA packaged in the capsid can undergo a mechano-structural transition from a solid- to a fluid-like state. This transition is induced by increasing the temperature (which affects DNA bending stress and packing defects) or by varying external ionic conditions (which affects DNA-DNA repulsive interactions and overall genome stress in the capsid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2015</xref>). In the fluid-like state, the interstrand DNA-DNA friction of the encapsidated genome is significantly reduced due to an increase in distance between packaged DNA strands occurring with local DNA disordering. These observations suggest that dynamics of DNA ejection can be affected by a transition in mobility of the encapsidated genome. To investigate the effect of this mechano-structural DNA transition on DNA ejection dynamics from phage λ, we designed a new ITC assay that provides ultra-sensitive detection of ejection dynamics from a phage population triggered by instant mixing with LamB λ-receptor in vitro. We also used time-resolved small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to further support our findings. We discovered striking bimodal dynamics of coexisting phage populations displaying fast synchronized and slow desynchronized ejection events. Here, we show that this complex ejection dynamics is directly linked to the two mechano-structural states of DNA—solid- and fluid-like—inside the λ capsid.</p><p>This remarkable observation of mechano-regulation of phage genome ejection dynamics can be compared to gene expression regulation in meters-long, tightly packaged chromosomal DNA in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eslami-Mossallam et al., 2016</xref>), where gene expression is controlled not only by genetic regulation but also by mechanical properties of DNA in nucleosomes. Environmental stress factors, such as an abrupt change in temperature or in ionic conditions, were demonstrated to play a major role in the mechano-regulated gene activation process, turning certain genes on and off, in a process termed epigenetics. Similarly, we show that temperature and ionic conditions control the mechanical properties of virally encapsidated DNA and act as an on-off switch between synchronized and desynchronized ejection dynamics. This can influence timing of viral replication and the lytic-lysogenic cell decision process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trinh et al., 2017</xref>). These in vitro ejection dyamics results are in agreement with earlier in vivo observations of temperature’s effect on DNA injection dynamics from phage λ preadsorbed to <italic>E. coli </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mackay and Bode, 1976</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dynamics of DNA ejection from phage measured by ITC</title><p>Dynamics of DNA ejection from phage has been previously investigated using single particle fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grayson et al., 2007</xref>) as well as bulk light scattering analysis (LS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raspaud et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freeman et al., 2016</xref>). Single particle fluorescence studies have been mainly focused on determining DNA translocation rates from a phage capsid, rather than population ejection dynamics, due to limited statistics as well as uneven timing for delivery of phage receptors to trigger ejection (because of flow cell geometry). LS measurements, on the other hand, record a decrease in total scattering intensity, <italic>I(0)</italic>, from a phage population. This decrease is associated with a change in DNA scattering density inside capsids, reflecting the number of DNA-filled phage particles remaining as ejection events occur. When DNA is ejected and relaxed in solution to a micron-size coil, it no longer contributes to the scattering intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freeman et al., 2016</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows our LS-measured decay of normalized scattering intensity versus time, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, for DNA ejection from wild-type (wt) DNA length phage λ (corresponding to 48,500 bp) when it is mixed with LamB solution at 22°C in TM-buffer (10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5). As observed in the figure, the overall time for the ejection process is much slower (here &gt; 1000 s) than the ejection time for DNA translocation from a single phage (≤10 s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grayson et al., 2007</xref>) because ejection events at these conditions occur in a stochastic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freeman et al., 2016</xref>) (if ejections were synchronized, the overall ejection time would be equivalent to DNA translocation time from a capsid). Thus, LS-measured scattering intensity decay reflects dynamics of ejection events versus time, discerning only between DNA-filled and empty capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freeman et al., 2016</xref>). However, this observation does not exclude that a fraction of phages can eject DNA synchronously. As DNA ejection is progressing, each ejecting particle is given the same weight in the total scattering intensity signal change. Therefore, the signal from a phage population with fast synchronized ejection events occurring within seconds will be dominated by much slower desynchronized ejections occurring in parallel but on a much longer timescale of minutes. Something similar occurs in reaction kinetics measurements where resolution is determined by the slowest rate-limiting step. In our case, this will prevent differentiation between phage populations with synchronized and desynchronized ejection dynamics. Therefore, in order to be able to distinguish between synchronized and desynchronized ejection populations, a heavier weight must be assigned to the readout signal from the phage population with synchronized ejection dynamics. Such a measurement is possible with ITC-measured heat flow (i.e. rate of heat production measured in µJ/s or µcal/s or W) for the DNA ejection process when phage is titrated into LamB solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jeembaeva et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37345.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Direct comparison between LS, SAXS and ITC data for phage λ DNA ejection dynamics.</title><p>The derivative with respect to time of the LS-measured normalized forward scattering curve yields the instantaneous change in the number of ejecting phages versus time (<italic>dΔI/dt</italic>).

However, it was recently demonstrated that it can be successfully used to measure reaction kinetics reflected by heat flow (so-called kinITC) due to the very short response time of modern ITC instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burnouf et al., 2012</xref>). We designed a new assay using ultra-sensitive micro-ITC to determine ejection dynamics from phage λ with the aim to differentiate between populations with synchronized and desynchronized ejection events. We have previously shown that DNA ejection from phage λ is associated with an exothermic heat release, which can be accurately measured by ITC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jeembaeva et al., 2010</xref>). Synchronized genome ejections will result in a significantly higher heat flow due to additive energy contributions from multiple ejecting λ-particles in one time instant, compared to that of desynchronized ejections where heat flow from single ejection events is spread over a longer period of time. Here, phage λsolution is titrated in LamB receptor solution with LamB present in a large excess (10<sup>4</sup>:1 LamB:phage which ensures that ejection dynamics is not limited by receptor concentration). The instrument records differential power (DP) versus time (DP is equivalent to heat flow, measured in μcal/s) between the reference cell (containing buffer) and the sample cell (containing phage-LamB reaction mixture). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> inset shows heat flow (µcal/s) versus time for the DNA ejection process occurring when wt-DNA length phage λ particles are titrated into LamB receptor solution at 22°C (all conditions remained identical to LS measurement for direct comparison). Heat flow contributions associated with enthalpy of mixing and pressure-volume work arising from titrating phage into buffer, buffer into LamB solution, and buffer into buffer are measured separately for each set of parameters and subtracted from the raw DP curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jeembaeva et al., 2010</xref>). All titration curves shown in this work (including <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> inset) are shown with background DP contributions subtracted.</p><p>The response time of our ITC instrument (Malvern iTC<sub>200</sub>, see Materials and methods Section) is only ∼3.5 s, which is significantly shorter than equilibration time for the DNA ejection process (e.g. it took ∼250 s for the DP curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> inset to return to baseline after titrating phage into LamB solution). This allows analysis of DNA ejection dynamics by directly evaluating the equilibration times of exothermic DP-peaks from phage-into-LamB titrations. (All separately-measured background DP contributions subtracted from the raw DP signal occur on a timescale of &lt;10 s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jeembaeva et al., 2010</xref>]) Here, we demonstrate how ITC provides information on population dynamics of synchronized and desynchronized ejection events not distinguishable by LS. As explained above, LS-measured scattering intensity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> reflects the total number of DNA-filled phage particles remaining over time as DNA ejections are progressing. On the contrary, ITC-measured heat flow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> inset corresponds to the instantaneous change in the heat released from a population of ejecting phage particles versus time. Thus, in order to compare the ejection dynamics from LS and ITC measurements, we need to take the derivative with respect to time of the LS-measured normalized forward scattering curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. This yields the instantaneous change in the number of ejecting phages versus time (<italic>dΔI/dt</italic>). The resulting <italic>dΔI/dt(t)</italic> curve is scaled to correspond to the phage concentration used in an ITC measurement and multiplied by the heat amount (enthalpy) released by one phage during ejection at a given temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> inset shows the resulting LS scattering intensity derivative (blue curve) compared to the ITC titration curve (green curve). The derivate of LS data displays a slower decay than ITC data. As we have previously shown, LS overestimates the total ejection time since it also records the scattering intensity contributions from DNA condensates formed immediately after rapid DNA ejection (due to DNA ejection occurring faster than DNA diffusion in the bulk solution once DNA is ejected from the capsid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freeman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Löf et al., 2007</xref>). Ejected DNA condensates will relax in solution through diffusion, forming larger random coil aggregates with negligible contribution to the LS signal. This diffusive DNA coil relaxation process is masking the DNA ejection dynamics, making it appear slower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freeman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Löf et al., 2007</xref>). The most marked difference, however, between LS derivative and ITC data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> inset is in the two exothermic peaks on the DP titration curve, which correspond to bimodal phage ejection dynamics from synchronized and desynchronized ejection events (in order to accommodate both slower LS data and ITC data on the time scale in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> inset, the two ITC peaks are not clearly visible but they are well resolved when plotted on a shorter time scale as shown in the next section). This is not observed in the LS derivate displaying only averaged unimodal ejection dynamics. Thus, unlike LS scattering intensity, ITC heat flow data does not obscure the contribution from rapidly occurring synchronized ejections with slower decay from desynchronized ejections. This makes ITC a suitable method to investigate the effect of solid-to-fluid-like intra-capsid DNA transition on phage ejection population dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Solid-to-fluid like DNA transition in the capsid controls phage ejection dynamics</title><p>As described above, we have recently found, using ITC (and supported by other methods), that DNA packaged in phage λ capsid undergoes a mechano-structural transition as a function of temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>.

However, the DP curve is not symmetrical and shows a right shoulder suggesting an unresolved second peak. Indeed, when the temperature was decreased below the transition temperature, the DP curve splits into two modes corresponding to two phage populations with different heat flow dynamics. At both 22° and 32°C, the first peak returns to baseline after ∼20 s when phage is titrated into LamB, corresponding to a phage population with fast ejection dynamics. The second DP peak lasts for ∼250 s at 22°C before returning to baseline value, corresponding to a phage population with slow ejection dynamics (the blue titration curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> is truncated at 150 s for clarity of presentation, however full ITC titration curve at 22°C returning to baseline after ∼250 is shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> inset). Since these two exothermic peaks on a DP curve are not completely resolved, we have deconvoluted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodman and Brenna, 1994</xref>) the DP curves into two asymmetric Gaussian functions with an exponential damping term, using a precise deconvolution method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodman and Brenna, 1994</xref>) (see details in Supplemental Material Section). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows fitting of two exothermic DP peaks (dashed curves) for the DNA ejection process at 32°C. The same deconvolution fitting procedure was applied to the single asymmetric exothermic peaks with right skewed shoulder on the DP curves above the DNA transition temperature in order to make a consistent comparison of DNA ejection dynamics at all measured temperatures. However, above the DNA transition temperature, two deconvoluted peaks derived from the fitting essentially converge into a single Gaussian, suggesting that there is mainly one dominant population of phage λ particles with faster ejection dynamics. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, which shows a DP curve for DNA ejection process at 37°C with deconvoluted bimodal and unimodal Gaussian fittings. Since most fitted Gaussian peaks on the DP curve are right skewed, we use the median value (instead of mode value) to estimate the central tendency time corresponding to average time for the overall DNA ejection process from a phage population. (In Supplemental Material Section we explain why the DP exothermic peaks are right skewed for DNA ejection process). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> summarizes median time values obtained from the Gaussian fits for DNA ejection from phage populations with fast and slow ejection dynamics at temperatures 22–42°C. The error bars are derived from the width of the Gaussian fits at the median value. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> shows that a phage population with fast ejection dynamics (corresponding to the first exothermic peak and referred to as ‘fast population’ in the plots) has an average ejection time of ∼10 s at all temperatures. This ejection time corresponds to the time of DNA translocation from a single phage λ capsid under similar buffer conditions previously measured by single particle fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grayson et al., 2007</xref>). This observation suggests that phage particles in the fast population eject their genomes immediately after receptor addition in a synchronized manner, which results in high heat flow (additive from many phage particles) and a sharp exothermic peak. On the other hand, the phage population with slow ejection dynamics (corresponding to the second exothermic peak and referred to as ‘slow population’ in all plots) is present only below the DNA transition temperature, where the slow ejection population coexists with the fast ejection population. Below the transition temperature, the average ejection time for the slow population is ∼30 s at 22°C and ∼45 s at 32°C (while DP peak equilibration to the baseline takes ∼100 and ∼250 s, respectively); see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>.

Below ∼33°C, the temperature of intracapsid DNA transition, two exothermic peaks on the DP curve indicate ejection dynamics corresponding to two virus populations with synchronized and desynchronized ejections. The presence of synchronized and desynchronized populations suggests the co-existence of phage particles with packaged DNA in both fluid-like and solid-like states. This is supported by the fact that DNA is trapped in a metastable state while it is being packaged into the capsid due to high DNA-DNA electrostatic sliding friction, which leads to different non-equilibrium DNA conformations in the capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berndsen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keller et al., 2016</xref>). When temperature is increased above that of DNA transition (at <italic>T</italic> &gt; 33°C), most of the phage population with slow desynchronized ejection dynamics is converted into a population with fast synchronized dynamics; the DP curve displays only one exothermic peak. The fast population corresponds to phage with DNA in a fluid-like state, where DNA-DNA electrostatic sliding friction is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2014</xref>) and genome ejection occurs immediately after phage is titrated into LamB solution.</p><p>In many dsDNA phages, there is a portal ‘plug’ protein at the portal-tail vertex that seals the portal opening through which DNA is ejected, facilitating retention of the packaged genome. For example, in phage P22, a homotrimer of the tail needle protein (gp26) acts as a portal plug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly in phage λ, protein gpW (the gp26 homolog) has been suggested to have a similar portal sealing function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gaussier et al., 2006</xref>). Adsorption of phage particles to cell receptors (LamB for phage λ) leads to portal plug opening, resulting in DNA ejection. As we have shown above, when DNA in the capsid is in a fluid-like pressurized state, phage-to-receptor adsorption results in immediate synchronized DNA ejections from all virions. By using time-resolved SAXS, we estimate the energy of activation for synchronized and desynchronized ejection processes by analyzing Arrhenius' dependence of DNA ejection rates on temperature (see data and method description in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and Materials and methods Section). The ejection rates are determined by measuring encapsidated DNA diffraction peak area versus time when phage λ is instantly mixed with LamB in a stopped-flow SAXS chamber. This reflects the number of remaining DNA-filled phage particles over time. We found that the energy of activation required to initiate the synchronized DNA ejection process from phage population with DNA in a fluid-like state is small, with ejection rates essentially not influenced by temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). On the contrary, the rates of DNA ejection events from phage with intracapsid DNA in a solid-like state show a strong dependence on temperature with relatively high activation energy (∼20 times higher than molecular thermal energy) required to initiate ejection by overcoming a significant DNA-DNA sliding friction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berndsen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). This leads to stochastic delays in ejection events or even complete arrest of the ejection process at lower temperatures, as has been previously observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mackay and Bode, 1976</xref>) (e.g. no ejection occurs when phage λ is preadsorbed to <italic>E. coli</italic> cells at 4°C). These observations suggest that measured activation energy for phage DNA ejection is associated with interstrand DNA sliding friction and mechano-strucutral transition of encapsidated genome, which further supports the ITC data above.</p><p>As we previously found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2015</xref>), the temperature at which the solid-to-fluid like DNA transition in phage λ occurs is strongly influenced by ionic conditions, since small polyvalent ions freely diffuse through the capsid pores and directly affect the DNA-DNA sliding friction and genome stress. Specifically, we had shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2015</xref>) that, at physiologic temperature for phage infection (37°C), varying ionic conditions will affect mobility of packaged DNA. As shown above, the transition from solid- and fluid-like DNA state in phage capsids results in desynchronized or synchronized DNA ejection dynamics, which in turn has been proposed to affect the cell decision between lysogenic and lytic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trinh et al., 2017</xref>). This raises an important biological question of how the extra- and intra-cellular ionic environment of a bacterial host affects ejection dynamics and consequentially the viral replication pathway.

Structural virology has been instrumental in providing a detailed morphological description and classification of viruses and their receptors required for studies of traits influencing virus-host interaction dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gallet et al., 2011</xref>). However, most of the structural studies have been focused on viral capsids due to their symmetry, rather than on the encapsidated genome where the lack of symmetry prevents high-resolution analysis. Recent findings of pressure-driven viral DNA ejection into cells from phage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evilevitch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castelnovo and Evilevitch, 2007</xref>), Archaeal viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanhijärvi et al., 2013</xref>) and Herpesviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bauer et al., 2013</xref>), have raised strong interest in understanding the role that packaged dsDNA structure plays in dynamics of genome ejection and viral replication. However, the structure of the encapsidated genome and its mechanical properties have until now not been sufficiently investigated nor considered as a trait influencing viral population dynamics. While this work is an in vitro study, it suggests a novel mechanism affecting viral replication dynamics that can influence the cell’s decision between lytic and lysogenic infection, prompting further investigations in vivo.</p><p>In this work, we discovered, for the first time, a direct link between the structure (and its associated mobility) of the encapsidated dsDNA in phage λ and dynamics of initiation of its release from the capsid. We demonstrate that the solid-to-fluid-like intracapsid DNA transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), is a determining factor for either rapid synchronized or slow desynchronized ejection dynamics from a phage population. We show that at optimum temperature for infection (i.e. ∼37°C) and Mg-concentration ≤ 10 mM, the encapsidated DNA is in a fluid-like state and ejection events from the majority of the phage population are synchronized with DNA ejections occurring within ∼10 s directly after phage adsorption to <italic>E. coli</italic> receptors (this time corresponds to DNA translocation time from a capsid). However, deviations from these conditions for infection (e.g. low temperature, high Mg-concentration) result in intracapsid DNA being in a solid-like state where DNA is arrested in different conformations due to high interstrand sliding friction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berndsen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). This leads to a striking heterogeneity in phage ejection dynamics, displaying coexistence of populations with synchronized ejection events (where DNA is in a fluid-like state) and desynchronized stochastically occurring ejection events (where DNA is in a solid-like state). The latter presents one to two orders-of-magnitude slower ejection dynamics, ranging from minutes to tens of minutes, depending on salt conditions and temperature, compared to DNA translocation time from a capsid. This ejection dynamics behavior is in good agreement with earlier observations of temperature’s effect on DNA injection dynamics from phage λ after preadsorption to <italic>E. coli</italic> culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mackay and Bode, 1976</xref>). Our findings also dismiss an earlier claim that stochasticity of DNA ejections from phage is solely controlled by capsid portal opening dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raspaud et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frutos et al., 2016</xref>). These assumptions were based on earlier LS measurements of phage ejection dynamics that could not distinguish between synchronized and desynchronized ejection events, as we have demonstrated above. (The same reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frutos et al., 2016</xref>]) also incorrectly concludes that there is no intracapsid DNA transition in phageλ with increasing temperature. As described above, we have clearly demonstrated that solid-to-fluid like DNA transition occurs as a function of salt and temperature, signified by an abrupt change in mobility (measured with AFM nanoindentation) and internal energy (measured with ITC) of the packaged λ-genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>As discussed above, it was recently proposed that the lysogeny-lytic cell decision initially occurs at the phage level through the timing of DNA delivery from multiple phages into a cell during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trinh et al., 2017</xref>). The timing of DNA injection from phage is what determines the onset of viral genome replication because both phage DNA injection and DNA replication processes occur on comparable timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mackay and Bode, 1976</xref>). In turn, replication dynamics of injected phage genomes determines how phages interact with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trinh et al., 2017</xref>) when multiple phage particles are infecting a single cell. It was shown that lysogeny is more likely to occur when infecting phages interact cooperatively during cell infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kourilsky, 1973</xref>). Synchronized injections result in immediate presence of DNA from multiple phages in a cell that can be integrated into cell’s chromosome without competition for the progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trinh et al., 2017</xref>). Lysogeny results in the absence of selection, which allows various mutants to integrate and persist in the lysogenic state, leading to diversification of phage genes and adaptation to poor or new growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trinh et al., 2017</xref>). On the contrary, when DNA injections are desynchronized, few phage particles are delivering their genes faster than the rest of the phage population, resulting in competitive interactions. If first phage to deliver its genome is lytic, it will override lysogeny, rapidly replicate itself using the cell’s limited resources and therefore take a larger share of phage progeny. As mentioned above, the asynchronous infection delays decrease the chance of lysogeny by also lowering CII viral transcription factor levels in the cell, where CII controls cell’s decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cortes et al., 2017</xref>). It was shown that the cutoff time, where delayed phage infections of one cell no longer affect the lytic-lysogenic cell decision varies from few minutes to tens of minutes, depending on the MOI (higher MOI results in shorter cutoff time) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cortes et al., 2017</xref>), comparable to timescales for overall ejection delays observed in our measurements. This suggests that ejection delays resulting from solid-like DNA state in the capsid will incease cell lysis probability.</p><p>The lytic-lysogenic decision is one of the most crucial factors determining virus population dynamics. In general, it was observed that limited conditions for phage replication favor lysogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kourilsky, 1973</xref>). This is explained by the fact that lysis is metabolically more ‘expensive’ and therefore would not be successful if the cells are not sufficiently healthy. Here, we found that ionic composition in the surrounding medium of bacterial cells acts as an on-off switch for DNA structural transition in λ-capsids leading to either synchronized or desynchronized ejection events at the optimum temperature for infection (37°C). It was previously shown that starvation of Mg<sup>2+</sup> stimulates lysogenization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kourilsky, 1973</xref>). Our study shows that, at low Mg-concentration, intracapsid DNA stress is high, leading to a DNA transition from solid- to fluid-like at temperatures well below that of infection temperature (37°C). This DNA transition results in synchronized ejections at 37°C, which indeed stimulate lysogenization, as we have discussed immediately above. Remarkably, both of these in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kourilsky, 1973</xref>) observations are in good agreement, suggesting that DNA injection dynamics from phage into cells may play a significant role in the cell fate decision. However, while the probability of lysogeny depends inversely on phage infection delays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cortes et al., 2017</xref>), the infection timings alone cannot be used to predict the outcome of either lysogenic or lytic behavior since other factors (e.g. cell volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">St-Pierre and Endy, 2008</xref>]) have also been shown to play a role. Furthermore, we have limited understanding of how many host functions (e.g. HflKC, cAMP, etc) feed into the decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casjens and Hendrix, 2015</xref>). Mapping all host functions into a single axis of rich/poor conditions is not supported by experiments. Thus, further interpretation of the effect of desynchronized and synchronized infections on the cell decision process would require a new model for circuit dynamics.</p><p>In conclusion, these in vitro findings suggest a new paradigm affecting virus population dynamics—mechano-signaling mediated by packaged DNA structure in phage λ. The environmental factors regulating the mechanical transition between solid- and fluid-like intracapsid DNA states strongly influence the timing of genome ejections. In vivo, desynchronized ejections from a phage population lead to competition between phage genomes, affecting the rate of phage gene replication and transcription as well as the lysogeny-lytic cell decision. Given similarities between phageλ and Herpesviruses in their mechanism of pressure-driven DNA ejection (where a temperature-induced solid-to-fluid like DNA transition was observed in both viral systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sae-Ueng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bauer et al., 2013</xref>]), the new insights into the lysogeny-lytic decision process for phage provide intriguing prospects for understanding of latency mechanism in Herpesviruses.

A 12KeV x-ray beam was used to illuminate the sample with a short sample-to-detector distance (1 m) and an overall q range from 0.013 to 1.90 Å<sup>−1</sup>. To monitor the DNA ejection process, we mixed 60 µL of phage solution with 120 µL of LamB solution in a three-way static mixing tee, the mixture was then sent to a flow-through glass capillary perpendicular to the incident x-ray. The mixing ratio between phage and LamB was kept as 1 to 200. To reduce photon damage, the sample solution was oscillating during the SAXS measurement with a flow rate of 10 μL/s. The SAXS pattern was recorded every 2 to 10 s with an x-ray exposure time of 1 s. After converting the 2D SAXS pattern to 1D Intensity versus q plot, the DNA peak between 0.18 to 0.32 Å<sup>−1</sup> was truncated and analyzed. Since LamB and 1% oPOE micelles also contribute to the overall scattering intensity, it is important to properly subtract their intensity before analyzing the DNA peak. The SAXS profiles for TM buffer, 1% oPOE in TM buffer, undiluted LamB in 1% oPOE TM buffer were collected at different temperatures.

As discussed above, DNA ejection dynamics was previously evaluated by measuring total forward scattering intensity over time, <italic>I(0)</italic>, using LS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> in the main text) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freeman et al., 2016</xref>) since <italic>I(0)</italic> depends on density of DNA packaged in the capsid. However, the measured decay in <italic>I(0)</italic> versus time also depends on diffusive relaxation time of DNA coils that initially remain condensed in solution immediately after ejection (due to DNA ejection rate being faster than DNA diffusive relaxation in bulk solution) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freeman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Löf et al., 2007</xref>). One of the advantages of following genome ejection dynamics by using SAXS to measure the decrease in DNA diffraction peak area (instead of measuring change in forward scattering intensity), is in the reduced signal contribution from this secondary process of slow diffusion-relaxation dynamics of ejected DNA coils. This is due to the fact that DNA diffraction peak area depends mainly on bp ordering with defined DNA-DNA spacing inside the capsid (bp ordering is mainly lost once DNA is ejected), as opposed to forward scattering intensity reflecting condensed DNA density (rather than ordering) both inside and outside the capsid. The difference in measured DNA ejection dynamics determined by LS (forward scattering <italic>I(0)</italic>), SAXS (forward scattering <italic>I(0)</italic>) and decay in SAXS-measured DNA diffraction area is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in the main text (a comparison is also made for derivatives of these three types of data compared with ITC DP curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> inset). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> shows time-resolved DNA diffraction peak for the DNA ejection process from wt DNA length phageλ in TM-buffer at 25°C (below the DNA transition temperature of ∼33°C). When the majority of phage particles have ejected their genomes, the DNA diffraction peak disappears due to lack of ordered DNA. As we observed with ITC-measured dynamics above, the decay time for DNA diffraction peak area at 25°C is much longer than the time for DNA translocation from a single phage particle (∼10 s), suggesting that DNA ejection events are occurring in both a synchronized and desynchronized manner. Thus, on the timescale of this measurement, the positon of DNA diffraction peak remains essentially unchanged with time since it mainly shows the decay in number of completely DNA-filled phage capsids.</p><p>In order to estimate the energy of activation for phage populations with synchronized and desynchronized ejections, we analyzed the Arrhenius’ dependence of the rate of ejection events on temperature. The natural log of DNA diffraction peak area was plotted versus time in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref> for the DNA ejection process at 25, 30, and 37°C. Interestingly, inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref> shows that, during the first ∼20 s, the ejection rate has almost no temperature dependence. However, at longer times, strong temperature dependence is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As we found with ITC in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in the main text, the first 20 s of the DNA ejection process are dominated by synchronized ejection dynamics from a phage population with intracapsid DNA in a fluid-like state. The lack of SAXS-measured ejection rate dependence on temperature during the first 20 s suggests that ejection dynamics initially does not display a measurable activation energy barrier for DNA ejection once the capsid portal is opened through receptor adsorption. Such a scenario is plausible, since packaged DNA is in a fluid-like state, where it has low interstrand friction leading to low activation energy required to initiate ejection. This also suggests that activation energy for portal plug opening in the capsid is relatively small, being strongly reduced when LamB binds to the phage tail, as we previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freeman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2015</xref>). However, at time &gt; 20 s, strong temperature dependence is observed in SAXS-measured DNA ejection rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting measurable energy of activation is required for initiation of DNA ejection from phage. In agreement with this observation, we found with ITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in the main text) that, at &gt; 20 s, DNA ejection events are desynchronized below DNA transition temperature (∼33°C), corresponding to the second exothermic DP peak originating from a phage population with DNA packaged in a solid-like state. These observations suggest that measured activation energy is mainly associated with DNA-DNA friction that must be overcome to initiate genome ejection from the capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gabashvili and Grosberg, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berndsen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To quantify energies of activation for a phage population with DNA in solid-like and fluid-like states, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref> we plotted natural logarithms of the ejection rate constants (<italic>k</italic>) (corresponding to the slopes of the linear fits in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) as a function of inverse temperature. In order to separate the rates for synchronized and desynchronized ejection dynamics, the rate constants in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref> are plotted separately for the fast population at time interval &lt; 20 s, and for the slow population at times &gt; 20 s. The ejection rates for the slow population ejection dynamics (&gt; 20 s) show exponential rate dependence on inverse temperature (i.e. Arrhenius dependence), evidenced by the linearity of the fits in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>. Energy of activation derived from the linear fit for the slow population is ∼1.2 × 10<sup>−19</sup> J/virion corresponding to ∼29 kT at 25°C. Thus, activation energy to initiate ejection from phage λ with intracapsid DNA in a solid-like state is relatively high (∼20 times higher than molecular thermal energy) due to a significant DNA-DNA sliding friction during initiation of the ejection process when interstrand separation is small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berndsen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). This in turn leads to stochastic delays in ejection events or even complete arrest of the ejection process at lower temperatures, as has been previously observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mackay and Bode, 1976</xref>) (e.g. no ejection occurs when phage λ is preadsorbed to <italic>E. coli</italic> cells at 4°C). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref> also shows that, for a fast population with synchronized ejection dynamics and intracapsid DNA in a fluid-like state (at times &lt; 20 s), the ejection rate dependence on inverse of temperature shows essentially no or little temperature dependence. It can be noted here that slight temperature dependence of DNA ejection rate below 20 s can be attributed to activation energy associated with portal opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freeman et al., 2016</xref>). However, for a slow population with desynchronized ejection dynamics (where intracapsid DNA is in a solid-like state), this is not the dominant component of activation energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer and Evilevitch, 2015</xref>), since the main contribution comes from DNA-DNA sliding friction, as suggested by this data.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Gaussian peak deconvolution</title><p>Some ITC titration curves (DP versus time) in our study exhibit bimodal population dynamics with not fully resolved exothermic titration peaks.

As explained in the manuscript, the first exothermic DP peak results from synchronized DNA ejections for a phage population. The shape of this peak will depend on enthalpy change associated with simultaneous DNA translocation from multiple phage particles. It has been shown that DNA translocation speed increases with ejection time at the beginning due to a decrease in the DNA-DNA frictional force as DNA packing density decreases in the capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grayson et al., 2007</xref>). However, the translocation speed starts to decrease towards the end of the ejection process due to decrease in the DNA pressure driving its ejection from the capsid. This variation in DNA translocation rate is reflected by the rate of internal energy dissipation (heat flow measured by ITC) during the ejection process which in turn is fitted by an asymmetric Gaussian function. The asymmetric Gaussian shape of the second exothermic DP peak on the titration curves, corresponding to stochastic DNA ejection events results likely from both distribution of delayed particle ejection modes and non-uniform rates of DNA translocation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Ting Liu is greatly acknowledged for help with data analysis.

The mobility of packaged phage genome controls ejection dynamics&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Arup Chakraborty as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Michael Feiss (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>A great deal of work has been done, over several decades, on the issue of what determines the lytic versus lysogenic pathway of an infecting bacterial virus. Most recently, experiments have correlated asynchrony versus synchrony of infection by multiple phages with lysis versus lysogeny, suggesting that phages compete for replication resources in the former case and cooperate in bacterial-chromosome-integrated coexistence in the latter case. Earlier experiments had suggested that the time scale associated with genome ejection/initiation of infection, following the binding of phages, is controlled predominantly by temperature (but also by ionic strength), being essentially immediate at, say, 37°C (for λ and <italic>E. coli</italic>), but involving time lags of 5-10 minutes at 25°C, and being completely blocked at 15°C.</p><p>The present paper makes a new and important contribution to our understanding of the factors determining the kinetics of DNA genome infection by phage. Earlier work by the group of the author had established – for phage λ – that the strongly-confined DNA genome of the virus undergoes a first-order (&quot;solid&quot;-to-&quot;fluid&quot;) phase transition at a temperature (around 33°C) that depends on local ionic strength. Now, in the present work, it is shown that this phase transition is the &quot;switch&quot; that determines whether the phage, upon binding to its receptor, will eject its DNA immediately – on a time scale of seconds – or do so only over the course of many minutes. Above the transition temperature the &quot;fluid&quot; state of the packaged genome, with relatively low friction associated with the DNA sliding past its neighboring duplex portions, is argued to facilitate fast ejection; conversely, in the low-temperature &quot;solid&quot; state, the high state of stress impedes this dynamical process. Correspondingly, at high multiplicity of infection, as can be guaranteed in vitro by a large excess of phage, the large number of phages bound at the same time will – at temperatures above the solid-fluid phase transition – also eject at the same time, i.e., the ejection will be fast and synchronous. Conversely, if the temperature is below the transition value, the ejection will be slow and asynchronous.</p><p>The work uses analyses of a convincing combination of careful and high-quality time-resolved microcalorimetry, time-resolved small-angle-Xray-scattering, and atomic-force-microscopy measurements to conclude that the cross-over from asynchrony to synchrony is indeed determined by the phase transition from &quot;solid&quot; to &quot;fluid&quot; of the phage DNA.</p><p>The paper will stimulate important new studies and conclusions concerning the factors involved in the kinetics of phage ejection and its relationship to the choice of lytic versus lysogenic pathways, and all of the reviewers are in agreement about recommending this manuscript for publication without any substantive further work being necessary.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>The reviewers are also in agreement that – while the manuscript <italic>does</italic> demonstrate convincingly that short-time/synchronous versus longer-time asynchronous injection is correlated with fluid-like versus solid-like organization of the packaged DNA genomes in λ phage – the work does <italic>not</italic> demonstrate correlation of these alternative scenarios with lysogenic versus lytic pathways for the infection. Indeed, all of the experiments reported here are purely in vitro – bacteria-free – ones involving only purified phage and receptor protein under different temperature and salt conditions. As such the work cannot say anything directly about the lysogenic and lytic pathways that ensue upon infection of bacterial hosts by phage. This is not a problem for the paper, however, because the purely in vitro results reported do shed important light on our mechanistic understanding of ejection kinetics as a function of temperature and salt conditions. But we do strongly urge that the Abstract, impact statement, Introduction and conclusions be rewritten to avoid claims about the work contributing directly to the in vivo question of lysogeny versus lysis pathways. The title, as well, should drop the question &quot;Do phages infect in unison?&quot; to read simply &quot;The mobility of packaged phage genome controls ejection dynamics&quot;, to reflect the fact that the work presented does not involve any in vivo infection studies (and also to be consistent with the journal policy of avoiding two-part titles).</p><p>Minor points</p><p>Apart from this point, the reviewers have raised several questions and made several suggestions for correcting and clarifying various minor points throughout the manuscript, to which the authors are requested to respond.</p><p>1) There are enough abbreviations that the paper would be easier to read if there were an abbreviations footnote at the beginning.</p><p>2) The author should acknowledge that it is not intuitively obvious that when DNA from many phage are delivered simultaneously into the cell the predisposition is for lysogenic infection while when there is asynchronous DNA delivery the infection is lytic. More explicitly, it is argued that in the first situation there is &quot;lack of competition for replication of phage genomes&quot; leading to lysogeny while in the second situation &quot;competitive interactions between phage genomes&quot; leads to lysis. Could the author help the reader better understand this argument?</p><p>3) In the Introduction, second paragraph, there is the statement &quot;Tens to hundreds of phage particles adsorb to a single bacterial cell.&quot; While this prepares the reader for Figure 1 (where clearly a huge excess of phages has been added to the bacterial host), it is misleading because in the lab the number of phages infecting a cell is determined by the experimenter and can vary by orders of magnitude. For this reason, and because its relevance to what happens in nature is problematic, the figure should probably be dropped altogether.</p><p>4) In the fourth-from-last sentence in that same paragraph in the Introduction, &quot;injection events from phage has&quot; should read &quot;injection events from phage have&quot;.</p><p>5) In the Results section, paragraph starting &quot;To investigate&quot; there is a sentence reading &quot;The second DP peak lasts for ~250 seconds&quot;, but none of the Figure 4 curves show results out to 250 sec. Also in this section there's a typo: &quot;encaspdiated&quot; should read &quot;encapsidated&quot;.</p><p>6) Could the author comment on the significance of the signs of the slopes measured in the calorimetry experiments for enthalpy versus temperature, below and above the transition?</p><p>7) The third paragraph of the Conclusions refers to the &quot;genetic switch&quot; and cites the Ptashne book of the same name. This genetic switch refers to the switch that a repressed prophage makes when transitioning to the lytic pathway, upon inactivation of the immunity repressor; it does NOT involve the initial choice made by infecting phage in deciding between the lysogenic and lytic pathways. It is confusing to conflate the two.</p><p>8) Can the author say anything about the time scale associated with transition from constrained to fluid states of the packaged genome, upon change in temperature? This would be helpful for allowing the reader to appreciate the connection between the present work and the earlier in vivo studies by Kourilsky in which bacteria are incubated with phages at low temperature and then warmed up to initiate infection and induce choices between lysogenic and lytic options.

Indeed, all of the experiments reported here are purely</italic> in vitro <italic>– bacteria-free – ones involving only purified phage and receptor protein under different temperature and salt conditions. As such the work cannot say anything directly about the lysogenic and lytic pathways that ensue upon infection of bacterial hosts by phage. This is not a problem for the paper, however, because the purely in vitro results reported do shed important light on our mechanistic understanding of ejection kinetics as a function of temperature and salt conditions. But we do strongly urge that the Abstract, impact statement, Introduction and conclusions be rewritten to avoid claims about the work contributing directly to the in vivo question of lysogeny versus lysis pathways. The title, as well, should drop the question &quot;Do phages infect in unison?&quot; to read simply &quot;The mobility of packaged phage genome controls ejection dynamics&quot;, to reflect the fact that the work presented does not involve any in vivo infection studies (and also to be consistent with the journal policy of avoiding two-part titles).</italic></p><p>I agree with reviewers and have now re-written parts of the Abstract, Impact Statement, Introduction and Conclusion sections to clarify the distinction between our in vitro measurements and other observations made in vivo. The title has also been changed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points</p><p>Apart from this point, the reviewers have raised several questions and made several suggestions for correcting and clarifying various minor points throughout the manuscript, to which the authors are requested to respond.</p><p>1) There are enough abbreviations that the paper would be easier to read if there were an abbreviations footnote at the beginning.</p></disp-quote><p>Footnote with abbreviations has now been added on the first page.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The author should acknowledge that it is not intuitively obvious that when DNA from many phage are delivered simultaneously into the cell the predisposition is for lysogenic infection while when there is asynchronous DNA delivery the infection is lytic. More explicitly, it is argued that in the first situation there is &quot;lack of competition for replication of phage genomes&quot; leading to lysogeny while in the second situation &quot;competitive interactions between phage genomes&quot; leads to lysis. Could the author help the reader better understand this argument?</p></disp-quote><p>I agree, this needed to be further clarified in the text. It has been observed that higher number of simultaneously infecting phages leads to higher lysogenization frequency (Kourilsky P (1973) Lysogenization by bacteriophage lambda. I. Multiple infection and the lysogenic response. Mol Gen Genet 122(2):183-195). Synchronized injections result in immediate presence of DNA from multiple phages in a cell that can be integrated into cell’s chromosome without competition for the progeny. Lysogeny results in the absence of selection, which allows various mutants to integrate and persist in the lysogenic state, leading to diversification of phage genes and adaptation to poor or new growth conditions. On the other hand, if DNA injections from phage are unsynchronized, the first lytic phage to inject its DNA can override the lysogeny decision, so that phages that deliver their genomes with delay will not affect cell’s decision. The early ejected phage will therefore use limited resources to replicate its own progeny. Specifically, it has been shown in ref. (Cortes et a, Biophys J 113, 2110–2120, 2017) that infection delays decrease the chance of lysogeny leading to lytic infection by also lowering CII levels in the cell, where CII is viral protein governing decision-making soon after infection. This has been now more thoroughly explained in the text in both Introduction and Conclusions sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the Introduction, second paragraph, there is the statement &quot;Tens to hundreds of phage particles adsorb to a single bacterial cell.&quot; While this prepares the reader for Figure 1 (where clearly a huge excess of phages has been added to the bacterial host), it is misleading because in the lab the number of phages infecting a cell is determined by the experimenter and can vary by orders of magnitude. For this reason, and because its relevance to what happens in nature is problematic, the figure should probably be dropped altogether.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1 has been dropped along with this sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the fourth-from-last sentence in that same paragraph in the Introduction, &quot;injection events from phage has&quot; should read &quot;injection events from phage have&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the Results section, paragraph starting &quot;To investigate&quot; there is a sentence reading &quot;The second DP peak lasts for ~250 seconds&quot;, but none of the Figure 4 curves show results out to 250 sec. Also in this section there's a typo: &quot;encaspdiated&quot; should read &quot;encapsidated&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The blue ITC titration curve at 22°C in Figure 3A is truncated at 150 s for clarity of presentation, however full ITC titration curve with the same data at 22°C returning to baseline after ~250 is shown in Figure 1 inset. This has been clarified in the text. The typo in word &quot;encapsidated&quot; has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Could the author comment on the significance of the signs of the slopes measured in the calorimetry experiments for enthalpy versus temperature, below and above the transition?</p></disp-quote><p>The slopes in the linear regions of <italic>ΔH<sub>ej</sub>(T)</italic> in Figure 2B, correspond to specific heat capacity <italic>ΔCp(T)</italic> for DNA ejection process [<italic>ΔCp(T)</italic> = <italic>Cp(ejected DNA) – Cp(packaged DNA)</italic>]. Since change in <italic>Cp(ejected DNA)</italic> (i.e., free DNA in solution) is relatively small in the measured temperature interval (22° - 43°C)(Lof et al. 2007), the inversion of <italic>ΔH<sub>ej</sub>(T)</italic> slope at transition temperature (T*~33°C) suggests a change in <italic>Cp(packaged DNA)</italic> value for DNA inside the capsid. This Cp change is in turn associated with transition in ordering and hydration of the packaged genome, which we previously analyzed with ITC (Jeembaeva et al, JMB 2009). This has now been explained in the subsection “Solid-to-fluid like DNA transition in the capsid controls phage ejection dynamics”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The third paragraph of the Conclusions refers to the &quot;genetic switch&quot; and cites the Ptashne book of the same name. This genetic switch refers to the switch that a repressed prophage makes when transitioning to the lytic pathway, upon inactivation of the immunity repressor; it does NOT involve the initial choice made by infecting phage in deciding between the lysogenic and lytic pathways. It is confusing to conflate the two.</p></disp-quote><p>This comparison has now been removed and “genetic switch” reference dropped.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Can the author say anything about the time scale associated with transition from constrained to fluid states of the packaged genome, upon change in temperature? This would be helpful for allowing the reader to appreciate the connection between the present work and the earlier in vivo studies by Kourilsky in which bacteria are incubated with phages at low temperature and then warmed up to initiate infection and induce choices between lysogenic and lytic options. For example, how does the time needed for the solid-to-fluid transition compare to the time course of the in vivo experiment and to how quickly phage need to eject in order for cooperative (lysogenic) versus competitive (lytic) behavior to ensue?</p></disp-quote><p>These are very interesting and relevant points. The ITC instrument used in this study for DNA ejection dynamics, requires at least 15 minutes to equilibrate at a given temperature. This time interval is sufficient for DNA transition to occur. We have also previously observed with time-resolved SAXS measurement that 10 min incubation is also sufficient for intra-capsid DNA transition to take place. In order to investigate the effect of even shorter time scales on DNA transition dynamics, a different set of measurements involving other techniques would need to be designed due to technical limitations of temperature equilibration of sample cell in ITC and SAXS systems. Regardless, Kourilsky experiments involve at least 10 min long incubations (or longer), which indeed provides sufficient time for intracapsid DNA transition to occur.</p><p>To address the second part of the question: “how quickly phage need to eject in order for cooperative (lysogenic) versus competitive (lytic) behavior to ensue?” As explained in the manuscript, the translocation time for DNA from a single phage is very rapid and occurs on a time scale of seconds (approximately 10 seconds). It is however the ejection delays from multiple phages infecting a cell that lead to higher lytic infection probability. It was shown (Cortes et a, Biophys J 113, 2110– 2120, 2017) that the cutoff time where delayed phage DNA injection no longer affects the lytic/lysogenic cell decision is on the time scale of few minutes to tens of minutes depending on the MOI (the higher MOI the shorter is the cutoff time). Comparable timescales for overall ejection delays are observed in our measurements which suggests that DNA ejection delays due to solid- to-fluid like DNA transition will affect the lytic/lysogenic decision. However, while it has been shown that probability of lysogeny depends inversely on phage infection delays, the infection timings alone cannot be used to exactly predict the outcome of either lysogenic or lytic behavior since other factors such as cell volume and host-cell physiology have also been shown to play a role (Francois St-Pierre et al PNAS, 2008, vol. 105, no. 52). This has now been further clarified in the Conclusions section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Throughout the manuscript, the bacterium is Escherichia coli, abbreviated E. coli, and should always be italicized.
