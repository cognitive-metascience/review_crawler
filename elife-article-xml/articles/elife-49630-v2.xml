data accessible and shareable, contributing to replicability to accelerate and disseminate knowledge. However, for rodent cognitive studies the availability of tools to share and disseminate data is scarce. Automated touchscreen-based tests enable systematic cognitive assessment with easily standardised outputs that can facilitate data dissemination. Here we present an integration of touchscreen cognitive testing with an open-access database public repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mousebytes.ca/">mousebytes.ca</ext-link>), as well as a Web platform for knowledge dissemination (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://touchscreencognition.org">https://touchscreencognition.org</ext-link>). We complement these resources with the largest dataset of age-dependent high-level cognitive assessment of mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease, expanding knowledge of affected cognitive domains from male and female mice of three strains. We envision that these new platforms will enhance sharing of protocols, data availability and transparency, allowing meta-analysis and reuse of mouse cognitive data to increase the replicability/reproducibility of datasets.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>amyloid-beta plaques</kwd><kwd>open-access

applied to research outputs have encouraged new approaches to enhance transparency, data sharing, and reproducibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Button et al., 2013</xref>). Over the past 10 years, Open Science initiatives featuring increased data sharing and high-throughput automated data collection have increased the efficiency, quality, integrity and reproducibility of data gathering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson and O'Donnell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rahman and Watabe, 2018</xref>). In genomics, for example, researchers have made major progress in understanding the genetic basis of diseases by establishing multi-research site consortia and by providing access to these data through different open repositories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boucas, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diehl and Boyle, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerstein, 2012</xref>). In neuroimaging, data sharing and large open-access databases have enabled the development of new analytic tools allowing researchers to address questions that could not be answered using single data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biswal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Poldrack and Gorgolewski, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Recently, there have been several attempts to build databases of rodent behaviour data. The Jackson Laboratory has developed the Mouse Phenome Database, a repository of mouse data taken from several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grubb et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, resources such as the International Mouse Phenotyping Resource of Standardised Screens provide different pipelines for the characterisation of mouse lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koscielny et al., 2014</xref>). Although these databases represent a necessary and fundamental shift in the availability of data, these repositories provide only limited information on high-level cognitive testing in mouse models.</p><p>Conventional cognitive assessments in mouse models are subject to large variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kafkafi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wahlsten et al., 2003</xref>), which may be in part the result of lack of automation. Additionally, the methodology used for cognitive assessments can significantly vary among research groups. For example, a recent analysis focusing on transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease found a significant amount of variation in the parameters used in the Morris Water Maze, including pool size, pool temperature, number of trials per day, and number of acquisition days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Egan et al., 2016</xref>). Further evidence shows that even when protocol parameters are controlled for, different experimenters can still obtain different behavioural results in conventional behavioural tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chesler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crabbe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kafkafi et al., 2018</xref>). Overall, there are converging domains of evidence to suggest that non-automated and non-standardised conventional behavioural assessments may be prone to several sources of bias.</p><p>Efforts to address these important gaps in data collection, automation, and translational research led to the development of the rodent touchscreen testing method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Horner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oomen et al., 2013</xref>). This technology allows the use of tests in rodents that are highly similar, and in some cases identical, to human cognitive tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heath et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nilsson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nithianantharajah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Romberg et al., 2013a</xref>). Touchscreen testing systems have standardised behavioural protocols that are under the control of a computer system, allowing for increased standardisation of outcomes. Furthermore, the automation of high-level cognitive testing can provide significant reductions in experimenter and environmental influence, by providing a standard operant environment and standardised output file formats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Horner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mar et al., 2013</xref>). This feature makes results generated amenable to storage in a central repository, allowing for data categorisation, searching and comparison between multiple laboratories.</p><p>Here we used data obtained with male and female mice from three distinct mouse lines commonly used in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research to highlight the use of a new repository and Web-based software, MouseBytes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mousebytes.ca/">mousebytes.ca</ext-link>). We reveal longitudinal heterogeneity as well as commonalities in cognitive function between the various strains modelling AD. For example, 3xTG-AD mice, males and females, present early attention deficits (at 3–6 months of age) when compared to their age matched controls, demonstrating reproducibility of earlier results. Overall, our cognitive assessment suggests which mouse models can be used to model cognitive phenotypes consistent with Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>MouseBytes is available to researchers worldwide (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mousebytes.ca/">mousebytes.ca</ext-link>), so they can pre-process, run automated quality control scripts, store, visualise, and analyse their data alone or alongside other researchers’ stored data. Moreover, researchers can use a knowledge sharing tool <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://touchscreencognition.org">https://touchscreencognition.org</ext-link> to disseminate community-driven information, including standard operating procedures (SOPs) and protocols. We foresee this repository for touchscreen data as a major step towards increasing the availability of datasets, including negative results, that can serve to evaluate reproducibility, decrease publication bias and to bring high-level cognitive assessment into the Open Science era.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Open-access database and repository</title><p>To highlight the potential strengths of MouseBytes, we acquired data from male and female mice from three commonly used transgenic mouse models that have pathological similarities to AD at three ages in two different laboratories on three clinically-relevant touchscreen-based cognitive tests: attention [5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beraldo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Romberg et al., 2011</xref>), behavioural flexibility [pairwise visual discrimination reversal (PD)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bussey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kolisnyk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mar et al., 2013</xref>) and long-term learning and memory [paired-associates learning (PAL)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Onaizi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Horner et al., 2013</xref>).

The use of automated and standardized testing can help decrease variability, although a wide range of factors including colony genetic drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zeldovich, 2017</xref>), light-dark cycle, types of cages and housing (single housed or group-housed), source of food, type and amount of reward, different types of environmental enrichment and colony room temperature/humidity conditions can still potentially contribute to variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, even though touchscreen tasks are automated and standardised, there is some level of flexibility in these tasks. We are aware that researchers, depending on the scientific question, may modify the experimental design (set of images, length of inter-trial intervals, number of trials and sessions per day, type and or amount of reward, etc.), which can increase the number of variables for analysis. To control these variables, we included in MouseBytes features that allow the users to describe these variables as Metadata. For example, when uploading XML files, the user must check boxes indicating the light-cycle and whether mice were single or group housed. In addition, in experimental description users can describe how mice were tested (e.g. number of trials and sessions per day). Furthermore, users can also link the digital object identifier (DOI) of their published article to datasets. With these additional sources of metadata information, one can begin to determine which variables can influence behavioural performance within the touchscreen environment.</p><p>To directly assess potential site variability in the current dataset stored in MouseBytes, we included site as a factor in our 5-CSRTT analyses. The 5-CSRTT task was chosen due to the larger cohorts of mice used in these experiments at the two sites. Throughout the analyses of 5-CSRTT measurements (see Materials and methods), no consistent pattern of main effects or interactions emerged for site between age, sex, genotype, strain, or measure (stimulus length) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, tabs 1, 2 and 3). For example, for interactions between test site, genotype, sex, age and stimulus length, only APP/PS1 mice presented a statistical difference in accuracy, whereas all other parameters (% correct, number of premature responses, number of perseverative responses, reward collection latency and correct touch latency) for the three strains were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, tabs 1, 2 and 3, lines 28 <bold>#<italic>a</italic></bold>). Interactions with test site that were significant typically had a small effect size and lacked consistency across behavioural domains and mouse strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, tabs 1, 2 and 3, <bold>#<italic>a</italic></bold>). Overall, the evidence suggests low site-to-site variability and high replicability for touchscreen test performance. For example, low variability was observed between sites when we compared longitudinally the performance of wild-type female mice (B6129SF2/J) and their AD-mouse model counterpart, 3xTG-AD, in the 5-CSRTT task (attention). We observed a difference in accuracy (0.6 s stimulus duration) in wild-type females at 3–6 months of age between the two sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mousebytes.ca/data-link?linkguid=01f2ae7f-edf4-47aa-a036-4c6f954cb75a">dataset 1</ext-link>).

We also examined vigilance (the ability to maintain concentrated attention over a prolonged period of time), which was also previously reported to be affected in this mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Romberg et al., 2011</xref>), by characterising performance across blocks of 10 trials. A complete breakdown of all the vigilance analyses can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref> (Tab 1). Reduced vigilance across trials was reflected in a deficit in accuracy in 3xTG-AD males (10–11 month-old mice used as example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>- Tab 1, <bold>#<italic>c</italic></bold>) or 3xTG- AD female mice (3–6 -month-old mice used as example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref> - Tab 1, <bold>#<italic>c</italic></bold>).

These experiments support the replicability we observed between sites and suggest that 3xTG-AD mice present robust attentional deficits that can be observed across several laboratories even when a different genetic background is used. Because genetic drifting can potentially affect reproducibility in mouse behaviour testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zeldovich, 2017</xref>), identification of robust deficits of high-level cognition resulting from AD-related pathology is important to develop drug treatments.

Replication experiments are the gold standard to validate scientific discoveries, but particularly in conventional rodent cognitive testing, variability of results is an issue. For example, different mouse models of AD present behavioural changes that are quite variable between laboratories when using conventional behaviour testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arendash et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clinton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Holcomb et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ostapchenko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stevens and Brown, 2015</xref>). The combination of touchscreen cognitive testing and MouseBytes may help to identify sources of variability to overcome issues of replication in rodent high-level cognitive analysis.</p><p>In order to expand and further refine our understanding of the cognitive deficits in 3xTG-AD mice, we conducted two additional touchscreen-based cognitive assessments. Of particular interest was the PAL task, a relevant test for AD progression as the CANTAB version of PAL has been found to be predictive of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Junkkila et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, forebrain cholinergic dysfunction, which is found in AD, impairs performance of mice in the PAL test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Onaizi et al., 2016</xref>). We observed a small but significant deficit in the PAL task for 3xTG-AD male mice at four months of age (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref> - Tab 1, <bold>#<italic>d</italic></bold>). 3xTG-AD mice did not show any sign of deficits in visual discrimination learning or behavioural flexibility in PD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref> - Tab 1). Overall, the cognitive phenotype of these mice resembled patients with early AD, presenting early deficits in sustained attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perry et al., 2000</xref>) and visual-spatial learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackwell et al., 2004</xref>), but not in behavioural flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sahakian et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>In addition to testing 3xTG-AD mice, we also tested APP/PS1 and the widely used 5xFAD mouse line. We chose to use the 5xFAD mice in a mixed genetic background (C57Bl6 and Swiss Jim Lambert -SJL), as this was the original background in which this mouse line was generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oakley et al., 2006</xref>), and it is the most commonly used background across several laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Qosa and Kaddoumi, 2016</xref>). However, the SJL genetic background presents the <italic>Pdeb<sup>rd1</sup></italic> mutation that can lead to retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clapcote et al., 2005</xref>) (see Materials and methods), which causes severe visual impairment in homozygosis. Given that some of the 5xFAD mice could be heterozygous for the <italic>Pdeb<sup>rd1</sup></italic> mutation, we evaluated whether carrying one <italic>Pdeb<sup>rd</sup></italic> allele affected the performance of mice in touchscreens using the PD task, which directly measures visual discrimination. The performance of mice carrying one <italic>Pdeb<sup>rd</sup></italic> allele did not differ from those who did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B and C</xref>). Moreover, as touchscreen testing requires food restriction for motivation, we also assessed whether the food restriction protocols used for touchscreen cognitive testing affected amyloid production in 3xTG-AD and 5xFAD mice. Ultimately, we failed to find any differences in amyloid production and deposition between food restricted and non-food restricted animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>The 5xFAD transgenic mouse line displayed a complex cognitive phenotype. Female 5xFAD mice displayed deficits in sustained attention that begin at 7 months in the 5-CSRTT task, while males show deficits by 11 months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> - Tab 2, #<bold><italic>e</italic></bold>). Initial training on the PAL task did not generate robust results as both 5xFAD and their controls (both male and female) were poor performers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref> – Tab 2). This highlights the utility of MouseBytes in assessing cognitive testing of a given mouse line by comparing with other lines in the database. However, a simplified version of the test revealed significant visual-spatial deficits at 10 months of age for both male and female 5xFAD mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref> – Tab 2<bold><italic>, #f</italic></bold>). No deficits in behavioural flexibility or visual discrimination learning were observed for 5xFAD mice when compared to their respective controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref> – Tab 2). The 5xFAD mouse line displays a subtler behavioural phenotype than the 3xTG-AD, but is still consistent with the impairments observed in AD. Interestingly, amyloidosis has been reported to start earlier and to be more aggressive in the 5XFAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oakley et al., 2006</xref>) compared to the 3xTG-AD line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oddo et al., 2003</xref>). However, our results showed earlier deficits development in 3xTG-AD mice compared to the 5xFAD line, suggesting that this could be related to abnormal Tau function in the 3xTG-AD mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oddo et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>APP/PS1 mice (male or female) did not show any sign of attentional deficits in the 5-CSRTT task at any age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> – Tab 3) similar to what was observed independently in a different background for this strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shepherd et al., 2019</xref>). However, APP/PS1 male mice presented with an early deficit in visual-spatial integration learning in the PAL task, which is consistent with the 3xTG-AD mouse phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref> – Tab 3, <bold><italic>#g</italic></bold>). Furthermore, an early deficit in behavioural flexibility was observed for female APP/PS1 mice at four months of age in the PD reversal task, which is interesting from the point of the translational utility of this mouse model, as behavioural flexibility deficits are not typically associated with AD at early stages of the disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sahakian et al., 1989</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref> – Tab 3, <bold>#<italic>h</italic></bold>).</p><p>Although each touchscreen task is generally run across labs using the same set of task-specific stimuli, task stimuli are being optimised continuously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Horner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mar et al., 2013</xref> ). Furthermore, some researchers have run tasks multiple times within a cohort of mice using different stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartko et al., 2011</xref>) and have found that the performance of animals may vary with the stimulus set used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bussey et al., 2008</xref>). We extracted cross-site data from mice using different stimulus sets to show that indeed, depending on the image set used in PD or PAL, mice can reach higher or lower levels of discrimination accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our data indicate that, for PAL and PD or other touchscreen tasks using complex visual stimuli, longitudinal testing should be preceded by appropriate control experiments to avoid potential bias with image sets. We anticipate that when more data are available in MouseBytes, the touchscreen community will be able to compare a larger number of images sets and identify optimal stimulus combinations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Genetic background and touchscreen performance</title><p>The choice of background strain for mouse models of disease can have major implications for cognitive assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sittig et al., 2016</xref>).

Moreover, both male and female B6SJLF1/J mice (3–6 and 11–13 months of age) were found to engage in more premature responses than the B6129SF2/J and C57BL6/j lines (4E-H, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mousebytes.ca/data-link?linkguid=7d9e0f65-c6b8-4baf-860e-97690b65e8b7">datasets 21</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mousebytes.ca/data-link?linkguid=9b6a93a6-9a5c-461c-bdfe-c5f5b95f92f4">22</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mousebytes.ca/data-link?linkguid=df7a3d73-a959-46d9-8638-5379d175de46">23</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mousebytes.ca/data-link?linkguid=33af153f-b1b1-4fa0-b826-35a161273c5f">24</ext-link>).

We envision that with multiple users depositing their data in MouseBytes, it will be relatively easy to make comparisons of performance for thousands of mice from different strains. Ultimately, these overarching analyses could help to inform the background strains to be used for new mouse lines to investigate specific high-level cognitive domains, for example, models that can now be generated using new genome-editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Performance and response measures of male and female mice during the 5-CSRTT probe trials.</title><p>(<bold>A-D</bold>) Strain/mouse background comparison (accuracy) of female and male Wild-type controls (B6129SF2/J, B6SJLF1/J, C57Bl6/J) at 3–6 and 11–13 months of age; (<bold>E-H</bold>) Strain/mouse background comparison (premature responses) of female and male Wild-type controls (B6129SF2/J, B6SJLF1/J, C57Bl6/J) at 3–6 and 11–13 months of age; (<bold>I-L</bold>) Sex comparison (accuracy) of B6129SF2/J and 3xTG-AD females and males at 3–6 and 11–13 months of age.

In order to address these challenges, alternative types of analyses may be necessary. One potential solution is to employ machine learning algorithms or artificial intelligence systems. To provide an example of these high-level analyses to describe large behavioural datasets that can be extracted easily from MouseBytes, we generated a summary of the touchscreen behavioural data utilising a k-mean classification approach. This approach represents a class of unsupervised learning algorithms that can identify group clustering without any bias towards the behavioural measures or the sample identification such as of the genotype, age, sex, or test site. Recently, researchers have used longitudinal k-mean algorithms to subcategorise different cohorts of AD patient populations that had been previously classified in one large group based on disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Genolini et al., 2016</xref>). We used the R package <italic>kml3d</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Genolini et al., 2013</xref>) to conduct longitudinal k-mean unsupervised grouping of all the data for the three mouse lines. For all tasks, data were grouped into three categories loaded onto a similar progression of behavioural metrics of high performance, moderate performance, and low performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We decided to choose three groups across all of our tasks in order to be consistent across domains, as well as to try and capture more subtlety in the clustering of behavioural characteristics. Because we tested animals at two or three temporally separated intervals during our cognitive testing, we decided to treat each animal’s observations for each testing interval as independent. This was done to allow for mice to change membership across our K-mean groups. We expected that changes in k-mean group membership would likely indicate cognitive decline in our animal populations. Following k-mean grouping, we then used Fisher’s exact test to determine if significant differences existed in the k-mean group membership between transgenic mice and their respective control strains. In order to separate out potential sex effects from genotype variation, we conducted comparisons separately between male and female mice for these analyses. Because animals were considered independent across age, we also conducted the analyses separately for each testing period. In order to account for multiple comparisons with Fisher’s Exact Test, the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for false discovery rate was applied (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Visualisation of the k-mean group memberships by strain, task, age, and sex can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Heatmap visualisations of k-mean group membership across experiments.</title><p>The percentage of group representation per strain is shown by the cell color.

The number of mice belonging to each cluster can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>. No significant differences in k-mean group membership were found for the 3xTG-AD mice at any age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Differences in membership were found to be significant for 5xFAD mice at 10–11 months of age, as more males 5xFAD transgenic were found to be in the low performing group, while more females 5xFAD transgenic were found to be in the mid performing group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Interestingly, at four months of age, most 5xFAD wild-type and transgenic mice were low performers, suggesting the background strain may affect performance on this task, confirming our observation with traditional analysis. Significant group membership differences were observed for APP/PS1 mice at four months of age, and more female transgenic mice were found in the high performing group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), while male APP/PS1 transgenic mice were in the low performing group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). These data suggest that while the PAL task might be a good behavioural predictor in human AD, further studies should be conducted to ensure that this effect is consistently observed across multiple AD mouse models. This is consistent with the small effect sizes in PAL, except for 10-month-old 5xFAD mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>, Tab 2).</p><p>In the PD tasks, behaviour of high performing mice was characterized by high response accuracy (% correct) and low number of correction trials (errors) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>).

No significant group composition differences were observed for 3xTG-AD mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).

Only a significant difference in group composition for APP/PS1 females was observed at four months, as there was a larger group of transgenic mice in the low performing group compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Overall, the different pattern of results in PD suggests it was not particularly sensitive to AD-related pathological changes.

The low performing mice showed low accuracy, high omission, slow response times and slow reward collection latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1K, L, O and P</xref>). The number of mice belonging to each cluster can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1Q</xref>.

Fisher’s exact test analysis revealed significant k-mean membership differences for 5xFAD transgenic mice and their respective control mice across all ages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), and the 5xFAD mice presented consistently low performance. These results suggest that both 5xFAD and 3xTG-AD transgenic mice consistently are lower performers (shifted to the lower performance group) than their WT counterparts (shifted to the higher and moderate performers) in the 5-CSRTT, suggesting that this test might be a good candidate for screening cognitive symptoms in these two mouse models of AD. Interestingly, these differences were not observed for the APP/PS1 mice. In fact, there was no difference in the performance of females APP/PS1 mice (3–6, 7–10 or 11–13). However, surprisingly, APP/PS1 male mice tended to shift their performance to the higher and moderate performers while the WT shifted to the lower performers.</p><p>Curiously, across all touchscreen paradigms, male and female 5xFAD mice had a consistent phenotype displaying increases in reward collection latency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">7</xref> – Tab 2, #<bold><italic>i</italic></bold>), suggesting the potential that these mice present lack of motivation or abnormal motor function at the ages tested, which has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O'Leary et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, the data show different patterns of cognition abnormalities between the three AD models, which may be related to different human AD mutations and the pathophysiology associated with them, including the tau mutation in the 3xTG-AD mouse line.

Ultimately, the integration of current and new touchscreen tests with the use of MouseBytes will change how cognitive function is evaluated in rodents facilitating the discovery of new therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or Resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>Information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">6E10 Primary Antibody (Human Monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Covance</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2564652">AB_2564652</ext-link> <break/>Lot#: D13EF01399 <break/>Cat#: SIG-39320</td><td valign="top">IF (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">488 Goat Anti-Mouse Secondary Antibody (Mouse Polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2534069">AB_2534069</ext-link> <break/>Cat#: A-11001</td><td valign="top">IF(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial Assay Kit</td><td valign="top">Amyloid Beta 42 Human ELISA Kit – Ultrasensitive</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">Cat#:KHB3544</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain</td><td valign="top">B6.Cg-Tg[APPswe,PSEN1dE9]85Dbo/Mmja (Mouse, Male, Female)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratories</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:034832-JAX">MGI:034832-JAX</ext-link> <break/>Stock#: 034832-JAX</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain</td><td valign="top">(B6;129-Psen1<sup>tm1Mpm</sup>Tg[APPSwe,tauP301L-1Lfa 0 (Mouse, Male, Female)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratories</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:101045-JAX">MGI:101045-JAX</ext-link> <break/>Stock#: 101045-JAX</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain</td><td valign="top">B6SJL-Tg(APPSwFlLon,PSEN1*M146L*L286V)6799Vas/Mmja (Mouse, Male, Female)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratories</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:034840-JAX">MGI:034840-JAX</ext-link> <break/>Stock#: 034840-JAX</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6 (Mouse, Male, Female)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratorie</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:000664-JAX">MGI:000664-JAX</ext-link> <break/>Stock#: 000664</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain</td><td valign="top">B6129SF1/J(Mouse, Male, Female)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratorie</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:101043">MGI:101043</ext-link> <break/>Stock#: 101043</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain</td><td valign="top">B6SJLF1/J(Mouse, Male, Female)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratorie</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:100012">MGI:100012</ext-link> <break/>Stock#: 100012</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software</td><td valign="top">ABET II Touch</td><td valign="top">Lafayette Neuroscience</td><td valign="top">Model#: 89505</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software</td><td valign="top">Spotfire</td><td valign="top">TIBCO</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.tibco.com/products/tibco-spotfir">https://www.tibco.com/products/tibco-spotfir</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software</td><td valign="top">Touchscreen Quality Control Syste</td><td valign="top">BrainsCAN</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/srmemar/Mousebytes-QualityControl">https://github.com/srmemar/Mousebytes-QualityControl</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Contact for reagent and resource sharing</title><p>All cognitive data are deposited in MouseBytes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mousebytes.ca">www.mousebytes.ca</ext-link>).

Half of the mice used in this study were shipped by Jackson Laboratory and housed at the University of Guelph, (Guelph, ON, Canada), while the other half was housed at The University of Western Ontario (London, ON, Canada). For all the 5-CSRTT experiments, an equal distribution of male and female mice was kept at both sites, allowing for comparison and reproducibility studies. For PD and PAL experiments, all male mice were tested at The University of Western Ontario and all the females were tested at the University of Guelph. At each site, mice were housed in a single colony room maintained on a standard 12 hr light cycle (8 am lights on, 8 pm lights off). All the experiments were conducted during the light phase of the cycle. The colony rooms were typically maintained at a temperature of 22–26°C. Mice were initially housed in groups of two mice per cage (16 cm x12cm x 26 cm) and they had their tail tattooed with a unique animal identification number. During each experiment, mice were maintained on a restricted food diet to ensure adequate levels of motivation and to maintain their body weight at 85% of their original weight. Male mice were fed on average 2.5 g of chow, while female mice were given 2.0 g per day (Tekland Chow – Harlan). We set a maximum initial weight of 25 g and if a mouse was over that weight we slowly decreased its weight to 25 g and then set this as a 100% (initial weight). Mice were weighed every other day to ensure maintenance of body weight at 85% of original weight and water was available ad libitum throughout the course of the experiment. After each session, mice received food according to their body weight. Mice are social animals, but it has been described previously that group housed mice can exhibit aggressive behaviour towards their cage mates and establish social hierarchy. This can also affect, in the non-dominant mouse, gene expression and induces depression and anxiety-like behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Horii et al., 2017</xref>). After few weeks on food restriction, all the mice in the study (for all three strains) had to be separated and singly housed due to fighting.</p><sec id="s3-3-1"><title>3xTG-AD mice</title><p>3xTG-AD mice present three mutations associated with familial AD forms: human familial AD amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP<sup>SWE</sup>), microtubule-associated protein tau (P301L) and presenilin1 (M146V) (PSEN1, APP<sup>SWE</sup>, and tau<sup>P301L</sup> as previously described) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oddo et al., 2003</xref>).

Briefly, 5xFAD mice overexpress three familial AD mutations in human APP(695); the K670N/M671L (Swedish - APP<sup>SWE</sup>), I716V (Florida - APP<sup>FL</sup>), and V717I (London - APP<sup>LON</sup>) mutations. In addition, these mice express the M146L and L286V mutations in human PSEN1. Transgene expression is driven by the mouse neuron specific Thy1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oakley et al., 2006</xref>). These five familial, AD mutations are additive in driving Aβ overproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oakley et al., 2006</xref>). 5xFAD mice present intraneuronal Aβ starting at 1.5 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oakley et al., 2006</xref>). 5xFAD mice and wild-type control males and females were twelve weeks of age at the start of behavioural testing. 5xFAD mice have a mixed background: C57Bl6 and Swiss Jim Lambert (SJL). SJL mice are homozygous for the recessive <italic>Pdeb<sup>rd1</sup></italic> allele, which codes for the β-subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase on mouse chromosome 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clapcote et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Giménez and Montoliu, 2001</xref>). Thus, F1 5xFAD mice should be heterozygous for the mutation. The mutated allele is a nonsense mutation that decreases the transcription of the phosphodiesterase, leading to retinal degeneration and blindness by wean age at approximately 3 weeks and rendering mice homozygous for the <italic>Pdeb<sup>rd1</sup></italic> allele unsuitable for use in some experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Giménez and Montoliu, 2001</xref>). This same mutation is seen in FVB/NJ (Friend Virus B/National Health Institute Jackson) mice as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Giménez and Montoliu, 2001</xref>). To confirm the absence of homozygous mice for the <italic>Pdeb<sup>rd1</sup></italic> allele we genotyped samples of 5xFAD mice and controls. Briefly, DNA was extracted from mouse ear tissue and amplified using the REDExtract-N-Amp Tissue PCR Kit Protocol (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Ontario). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was done using the Bio-Rad T100 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California) with a 500 bp x 40 cycle schedule (94°C x 3 min followed by 40 x [94°C x 30 s] + 60°C x 30 s + 72°C x 30 s then 72°C x 2 min). The tubes were held at 10°C until use. The following reagents were used for each sample: 5 μl of 2x premix, 0.5 μl of retinal degeneration (RD) three oligonucleotide primer (concentration: 0.5 μM; 28-mer, 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TGACAATTACTCCTTTTCCCTCAGTCTG</named-content>-3’, accession number L02109, nucleotides 84 to 111), 0.1 μl of RD4 oligonucleotide primer (concentration: 0.02 μM; 28-mer, 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GTAAACAGCAAGAGGCTTTATTGGGAAC</named-content>-3’, accession number L02109, nucleotides 644 to 617) and 2.9 μl of RD6 oligonucleotide primer (concentration: 14.5 μM; 28-mer, 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TACCCACCCTTCCTAATTTTTCTCAGC</named-content>-3’, accession number L02110, nucleotides 2539 to 2512). RD3 and RD4 amplify a 0.55 kb PCR product from the <italic>Pdeb<sup>rd1</sup></italic> mutant allele, while RD3 and RD6 amplifiy a 0.40 kb PCR product from the WT allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Giménez and Montoliu, 2001</xref>). The PCR products are then run on an agarose gel along with a 100 bp ladder (Gene DireX, Frogga Bio, Toronto, Ontario) and imaged with FluorChem Q (Alpha Innotec Corp., San Leandro, California). The positive control for <italic>Pdeb<sup>rd1</sup></italic> was ear tissue from a Friend Virus B NIH Jackson mouse (FVB/NJ; Jax stock #001800), an inbred strain of mouse known to be homozygous for the <italic>Pdeb<sup>rd1</sup></italic> mutation.

Mice were trained to operate the touchscreens by a series of shaping procedures for PD, 5-CSRTT and PAL. The screens in the touchscreen chamber were blocked with barriers during the experiment. For the 5-CSRTT, the screen was divided into five partitions (132 pixels x 132 pixesl) that were 50 pixels above the screen. For the PAL task, the screen was divided into three partitions (228 pixels x 228 pixels) that were 50 pixels above the screen. For the PD task, the screen was divided into two partitions (240 pixels x 240 pixels) that were 50 pixels above the screen. All the schedules were designed and pre-installed and the data were collected using the ABET II Touch software v.2.20.3 as previously described (Lafayette Instruments, Lafayette) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Horner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oomen et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4-2"><title>Behavioural Pre-Training</title><p>Mice (10–12 weeks of age) experienced several pre-training stages (shaping) prior to probes in each task. For the first four days of pre-training, the mice were habituated to the testing chambers (Habituation schedules). On <italic>Day 1 (Habituation 1)</italic>, the mice were placed in the testing chambers for 10 min with the house lights off, with no stimuli displayed and no reward presented. On <italic>Days 2–4 (Habituation 2)</italic>, the mice were placed into the testing chambers for 20 min (Days 2 and 3) and for 40 min (Day 4). On Days 2–4, the reward tray light was turned on and the reward (strawberry milkshake; Saputo Dairy Products, Canada) was presented and paired with a sound (tone) for 280 ms every 10 s. During this phase, the mice should strengthen the association between the reward tray light and tone with the reward; however, no performance criteria were in place at the habituation phase.</p><p>Following habituation, the mice were subjected to the ‘Initial Touch’ schedule (Phase I), which involves pairing the reward with the presentation of stimuli (random images for PAL and PD and a white square for 5-CSRTT) on the touchscreen. In this phase, a single stimulus appears randomly in one of the windows. After 30 s the stimulus is turned off and the illumination of the reward tray light is paired with a tone and delivery of the reward (7 μl of strawberry milkshake). If the mouse touches the screen during the time that the image is displayed, a reward is immediately presented with a tone. A new trial starts when the mouse collects the reward, and Initial Touch sessions are repeated daily until the subject completes 30 trials within 60 min.</p><p>The next stage of pre-training, ‘Must Touch’ (Phase II) involves displaying a stimulus randomly in one of the windows, as before. However, in this phase, differently from Phase I, the mouse is required to touch the stimulus on the screen in order to receive the reward paired with a tone. If the mouse touches any window other than the one in which the stimulus is present, it receives no reward. Daily sessions are repeated until the mouse completes 30 trials in 60 min. The next phase of shaping introduces the animals to the initiation procedure, a schedule called ‘Must Initiate’ (Phase III). At the beginning of each trial, the reward tray is illuminated, and the mouse is required to initiate the stimulus delivery by a nose poke into the reward tray. Successful initiation extinguishes the tray light, and a stimulus is presented in one of the windows on the screen. After touching the stimulus and collecting the reward, the mouse is subjected to a 5 s inter-trial interval (ITI – houselights off, reward tray inactive and no stimulus presented) before the illumination of the reward tray light signals the beginning of the next trial. A criterion of 30 correct trials within 60 min must be met in order for the mouse to proceed to the next phase. The last pre-training phase (Phase IV) is called ‘Punish Incorrect’ and requires the mouse to both initiate and touch the stimulus but if an incorrect choice is made, it receives a 5 s timeout, during which the lights are turned on and no reward is delivered. The mice continue performing this phase of shaping until they are able to obtain at least 80% of trials correct within 60 min for two consecutive days. Intertrial intervals of 5 s for 5-CSRTT and 20 s for PD and PAL were used in all the phases.

In this task, mice must initiate the trials by poking their head into the reward tray after a light signal is displayed. Immediately after exiting the reward tray, two different images appear on the screen. Mice are required to learn that a rewarded response is determined by the correct visual image (S<sup>+</sup> correct image and S<sup>-</sup> incorrect image) (S4A). If a correct response is made, reward is delivered, but if an incorrect response is made, a 5 s time-out is initiated with activation of the house light. Following the time-out period, mice are required to complete the same trial repeatedly until a correct response is made. These correction trials do not count towards the overall trial count. To move to the next phase a criterion of 24 correct out of 30 trials (2 days in a row) is required.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4-4"><title>Pairwise visual discrimination (PD) baseline</title><p>Following the achievement of acquisition criteria, each mouse was subjected to two baseline sessions according to the same schedule used for the acquisition sessions.

All mice, at both sites (The University of Western Ontario and University of Guelph), were tested 5–6 days per week for 50 trials or 60 min per day, whichever occurred first. Each trial started with the illumination of the reward tray where the mouse was required to poke its head. After a 5–10 s variable delay, one of the windows was illuminated and the mouse had up to five extra seconds (limited hold) following stimulus presentation to respond on the screen in order to make a correct response. If a mouse touched the screen during the variable delay prior to stimulus presentation, the response was recorded as a ‘premature response’ and the mouse was punished with a 5 s time-out followed by a 5 s ITI. The touchscreen stimulus duration (i.e., the duration for which the window is lit) was initially set to 4 s. The first response to a window during the stimulus presentation or the limited holding period was recorded and initiated the next phase of the trial. If a correct choice was made the reward was presented and any incorrect response was punished with a 5 s time-out followed by a 5 s ITI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mar et al., 2013</xref>). Failure to respond to any window by the end of the limited hold period was recorded as an ‘omission’ and punished with a 5 s time out, followed by the 5 s ITI before the start of the next trial. The mice continued on the 4 s stimulus duration until performance was stabilised at greater than 80% accuracy, less than 20% omissions, and 30–50 trials completed for three consecutive days. Once mice reached criteria, training continued on the same task, but with a 2 s stimulus duration; criteria for this phase were the same as for the 4 s version. If mice failed to reach criteria within 30 sessions, they were eliminated from the study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4-8"><title>Five choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) probe sessions</title><p>Once mice reached criterion on the 2 s variation of the 5-CSRTT, they were exposed to a series of probe sessions. During each probe session, one of four test stimulus durations was used: 1.5 s, 1.0 s, 0.8 s, and 0.6 s. Each mouse completed two consecutive days of probe trials with each of the stimulus durations. Following each probe session, mice were returned to the 2 s stimulus duration version for two consecutive baseline days before beginning the next probe session (two days with a different stimulus duration). The order of presentation for probe sessions was counterbalanced across all mice. In order to assess attentional performance longitudinally (which to the best of our knowledge has not been performed in AD mice), the same mice were tested on probe sessions at 4, 7, and 10–11 months of age. To ensure maintenance of sufficient baseline performance on the task between probe sessions, mice were given a single day of training with the 2 s stimulus duration each week until the next set of probe sessions. Prior to the start of the 7 month and 10–11 month probe sessions, mice were given 5 days of 2 s 5-CSRTT sessions in order to re-baseline them on the task. The same reduced stimulus durations (1.5 s, 1.0 s, 0.8 s, and 0.6 s) were used for probe sessions at each testing age, and the order of stimulus duration sessions was counterbalanced between mice at each age as well as for each mouse across each of the testing ages.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4-9"><title>Paired associate learning (PAL) training</title><p>After reaching the criteria on Punish Incorrect schedules (Phase IV of pre-training), mice were trained on PAL Acquisition sessions. In this task, mice must initiate the trials by poking their head into the reward tray when the light on the feeder turns on. Immediately after exiting the reward tray, two different images appear in two of three positions on the screen. Mice must learn that each specific visual image is associated with only one correct spatial location on the touchscreen, and only one image per trial is presented in the correct location. If a correct response is made a reward is delivered (7 μL of strawberry milkshake), but if an incorrect response is made, a 5 s time-out is implemented with activation of the house light. Following the time-out period, mice are required to complete the same trial repeatedly until a correct response is made. These correction trials were not counted towards the overall trial count. The criterion for this training phase is the completion of 36 trials in 60 min (per day). All the mice from both groups and all the time points were able to reach this criterion in the first session.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4-10"><title>Paired associate learning (PAL) probe sessions</title><p>After successfully completing the training phase, mice were tested either on <italic>different</italic> PAL (dPAL) or on <italic>same</italic> PAL (sPAL) tasks. 3xTG-AD and APP-PS1 were tested in dPAL at 4 and 11 months of age. Due to a poor performance in dPAL at 4 months of age, 5xFAD mice (10–11 months of age) were tested in sPAL, which is relatively easier test when compared to dPAL. In both tasks, a mouse initiates the task by touching the reward tray, which triggers the display of both S<sup>+</sup> and S<sup>-</sup> on the screen. As described above, S<sup>+</sup> refers to the stimulus presented in the correct location and S<sup>-</sup> refers to a stimulus presented in the incorrect location. In this task, the mice are required to learn to associate a stimulus with its correct location. Similar to the PAL Acquisition phase, if a correct response is made (S<sup>+</sup>), the reward is delivered. However, touching the S<sup>-</sup> stimulus results in a 10 s time-out and illumination of the light in the chamber (10 s). Following the punishment period, mice are required to initiate the same trial repeatedly until a correct response is made; these correction trials did not count towards the overall trial count. The only difference between dPAL and sPAL is the fact that on dPAL S<sup>+</sup> and S<sup>-</sup> stimuli are different images and on sPAL S<sup>+</sup> and S<sup>-</sup> are the same image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Horner et al., 2013</xref>). Mice were tested on 45 sessions for dPAL or sPAL tasks regardless of performance.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4-11"><title>Longitudinal behavioural testing protocol</title><p>Mice were tested longitudinally as they aged at different time points. Different cohorts of 3xTG-AD, 5xFAD and APP/PS1 mice were tested longitudinally starting at approximately 4, 7 and 10–11 months of age on 5-CSRTT and PD and at 4 and 10–11 months of age on PAL. The first time points of testing, for each experiment, were completed when the mice were 5–6 months of age. After the completion of the first set of experiments, all mice were kept on a maintenance schedule (2 s stimulus duration for 5-CSRTT and random images for PD and PAL) once a week until the commencement of the second set of probe trials that started at 7 months of age. The images used for the training and maintenance were removed from the probe trial database and were not displayed to the mice during the probes for PAL or PD tasks. This was done to ensure that the mice did not forget the basic aspects of touchscreen task performance and hence would not require retraining prior to the subsequent 7- and 11 month trials. Upon completion of the second set of trials, mice were put back on a weekly maintenance schedule until the commencement of the third set of trials at 11 months of age.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4-12"><title>Image set control experiments</title><p>For PD and PAL, different sets of images were used at each testing age. All the images were randomly selected from the ABET II imaging databank and, according to the manufacturer, the images present the same number of pixels. Image sets I, II and III were used for testing mice on PD at 4, 7 and 10–11 months of age, respectively (S4). Image sets IV, V and VI were used to test mice on dPAL or sPAL at 4 and 10–11 months of age (S4). It is well known that rodents prefer some stimuli over others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bussey et al., 2008</xref>). To evaluate the potential stimulus biases, we tested different cohorts of wild-type male mice (B6129SF2/J MMRCC stock number 101045), at 4 months of age, with three different images sets used for testing the WT and transgenic mice on PD (Image sets I, II, and III) and PAL (Image sets IV, V, and VI). (S4). PD testing for image biases was done at The University of Western Ontario, and the PAL testing was done at the University of Guelph.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4-13"><title>Tissue preparation</title><p>Mice were anaesthetized using ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (25 mg/kg) in 0.9% sodium chloride solution, and then transcardially perfused with 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH = 7.4) for 5 min.

All the procedures (schedules, images, food restriction, database and animal identification nomenclatures, etc.) were standardised between the two sites before the start of experimentation and the SOPs can be found in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://touchscreencognition.org/">touchscreencognition.org</ext-link>. Monthly conference calls were made, and reports were exchanged between the researchers to assure the maximum standardisation of the procedures across the sites. After automated collection, the data were automatically saved and backed-up onto two different servers at The University of Western Ontario and the University of Guelph. For data protection, the database and back-up were strictly controlled and logged. ABETT II files were converted to XML files (each XML file corresponds to the data from a unique mouse ID session/day of training or testing) and uploaded into mousebytes.ca. The XML files were then automatically checked by automated quality control (QC) algorithm and the codes are available for free download and modification in GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/srmemar/Mousebytes-QualityControl">https://github.com/srmemar/Mousebytes-QualityControl</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Memar et al., 2019</xref>) Files with potential errors, due to human input and/or machine/software failure, were automatically flagged by the QC procedure. The discrepancies, flagged by the QC, were fixed manually when possible and corrupted files were discarded and not used for data analysis. For example, in most of cases the flagged files were due to a software failure at the beginning of the session or wrong animal ID number input. If there was a software failure at the beginning, a new session was started in the same day. This generates two XML files for the same mouse ID in the same day and the incomplete running session file is flagged and not transferred to the database based on the QC rules. If there is a wrong mouse ID input, MouseBytes will flag the XML file related to the wrong ID and the user is able to enter the right ID so the file can be transferred to MouseBytes. The Interquartile ranges (IQRs) method was used to filter out outliers from the temporal features for each cognitive task. So, any feature value beyond the sum of third quartile (Q3) and 3*IQRs (i.e. Q3 + 3*IQRs) was considered as extreme outlier and automatically removed from the dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parrinello et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The processed data were transferred to the open-access application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parrinello et al., 2016</xref>).

A similar analysis was performed for both 4 s and 2 s stages of 5-CSRTT training. For the probe sessions, several parameters were analysed as an average between each set of two probe sessions with each stimulus duration: <italic>Accuracy –</italic> percentage of correct trials; <italic>Omissions</italic> – percentage of trials on which no response is made; <italic>Correct Response Latency</italic> – reaction time for correct response; <italic>Reward Collection</italic> Latency – reaction time to collect the reward on correct trials; Premature responses – number of responses made prior to the stimulus presentation; Perseverations – number repeated responses at a previously rewarded window before onset of the next trial. Omissions and Premature responses did not count towards Accuracy. Analysis of the probe trial data was conducted using a 3 (age) x 4 (stimulus duration) x 2 (research site) x 2 (genotype) x 2 (sex) split-plot ANOVA. In addition, vigilance in the 5-CSRTT was analysed with a 4 (stimulus duration) x 5 (block) x 2 (genotype) split-plot ANOVA. To characterise genotype-specific effects, we a priori decided to conduct 4 (stimulus duration) x 2 (genotype) split-plot ANOVA analysis between wildtype and transgenic mice for each sex, strain, and age.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5-3"><title>PD analysis</title><p>For the pre-training stages for the PD task (Phases I-IV) and acquisition sessions, the number of sessions to reach criterion were analysed to determine any differences in task learning.

To analyse PD reversal data, a 10 (session) x 2 (genotype) x 2 (sex) split-plot ANOVA was conducted.

Data from the 45 sessions (days) of dPAL/sPAL were binned in intervals of 5 sessions or one week of testing (e.g. sessions 1–5 is binned as week 1, session 6–10 is binned as week 2, etc.). Data for the PAL training was analysed with a 9 (bin) x 2 (sex) x 2 (genotype) split-plot ANOVA. All data were analysed separately at 4 months and 11 months of age and for males and females.

Given the longitudinal nature of the behavioural tasks, repeated performances across multiple trials, a three-dimensional version of the analysis is required. To do so, we used the kml3d R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Genolini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Genolini et al., 2013</xref>). This allows for clustering analysis to be performed across trials. The clusters were renamed post-hoc based on the overall performance of the mice on key metrics in the task, which resulted in a high, mid, and low performing cluster. In order to determine if differences in k-mean group composition existed between wildtype and transgenic mice, Fisher’s exact test was conducted.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5-6"><title>Aβ immunofluorescence</title><p>For all immunofluoresecence studies, a total of 8 B6SJLF/1 (4 female, four male) and 8 5xFAD (four female, four male) mice were used.

technological advances that enable the monitoring and manipulation of neural systems and circuits with unprecedented power. However, progress in designing novel approaches to measure, collate and analyze behavioral correlates of neural function has lagged these developments. Here, the authors introduce an open-access online platform and data repository to facilitate the analysis and sharing of large-scale datasets obtained from an increasingly widely-used computerized, touchscreen-based, apparatus for assaying a range of cognitive processes in rodents. They go on illustrate the utility of this resource for revealing novel sex- and genetic-background related cognitive domains in a multi-site cohort of Alzheimer's disease model mice. This publication serves as a timely example of the potential for open-science in an era in which establishing effective networks connecting investigators and their growing repositories of ('big') data is becoming increasingly important.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;An open-access high-throughput pipeline and database for rodent touchscreen-based cognitive assessment&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: John G Howland (Reviewer #2); Yogita Chudasama (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary and Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers expressed enthusiasm for efforts to standardize and share data generated by this increasingly popular behavioral testing paradigm. The major concerns raised at this stage for the authors to address relate to: 1) the ease of 'adoptability' of the analysis across laboratories that are not working in collaboration with the authors, and 2) the strength of the narrative justifying the collation of the analysis methods with the example empirical data in this one paper. In my opinion, these issues should be addressable in a compelling rebuttal to the reviewers and a carefully revised version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>With more and more researchers adopting touchscreen systems for high-level cognitive assessment, there is certainly a need for a well maintained repository to allow for sharing of published datasets, large meta-analysis, and importantly, but not mentioned, the dissemination of null datasets. Co-authors and institutions involved in the current effort are leaders in the field of using this technology and these tools have the potential to lead to advancements in the field. However, the structure of the manuscript, and in particular the lack of mention of major difficulties in comparing datasets across labs, make the current results unclear, and the tools, such as the K-mean classification approach, difficult to assess.</p><p>- The authors repeatedly stress the strength of the touchscreen systems is the standardization of outcomes. However, even within the 3 tasks the authors use here, there are an incredibly amount of variables, including stimulus choices, inter-trial intervals, trials and sessions per day, reward type and amount, stimulus durations for 5-CSRTT etc. that can vary across experiments and labs. Much more discussion and description needs to be given to how these factors can be controlled for, or at least noted in order for Mousebytes users to make well-designed comparisons across datasets.</p><p>- The current study stresses the high-degree of collaboration and communication across sites including pre-standardization, use of the same systems and software, monthly conference calls and collaboration on QC. This can't possibly be expected to happen with an open access database. How will the system account for data collected on behavioral systems from other providers, or open source built systems? Gurley, J. Exp Analysis of Beh 2019; Butler and Kennerly, Behav. Res. Methods 2018 A discussion of how the system can or cannot deal with files using different category labels, different orders of variables, etc. needs to be added.</p><p>- The authors state both in the Introduction and Materials and methods that during QC &quot;files&quot; with potential errors are flagged by the procedure, fixed manually, or discarded and not used for analysis if not fixable. What is a &quot;file&quot;? Is this a daily data file for an individual animal? If so, how does the software account for the &quot;hole&quot; in the data? Are those data points simply ignored, wouldn't this decrease the total errors, alter the percent correct for that animal?</p><p>- While the authors correctly note the huge number of graphs and figures that can be generated from this dataset, the data included in Figure 2 seem arbitrary. Site comparison is included for 3-6 M/Males but not 11-13. Strain is shown for males and not females. Given only 4 figures are included in the main document, there is room to add these panels and aid the reader in the logical assessment of the variables.</p><p>- Application of unbiased assessment via machine learning is exciting and potentially important, but the approach is not clear. If the authors wish to unbias the approach, why were sex and age specifically conducted separately? Does this analysis require the assumption of independent samples? Inclusion of each animal as a separate data point at each age would violate this.</p><p>- The data presented in Figure 3 (or 4?) do not seem to support the authors' conclusions in the text. The statement &quot;5xFAD and 3xTG-AD transgenic mice consistently are lower performers than their WT counterparts in the 5-CSRTT&quot; is confusing, Based on the figure, it seems that WT 3xFAD males and females are consistently worse at most ages. APP/PS1 results are not discussed, although females show almost no differences (except at 7 months) and in males, WT seem to be consistently worse than TG.</p><p>- Follow up motor testing on the 5xFAD males is potentially interesting but detracts from the main point of the manuscript. It is unconvincing that increased reward collection latency &quot;uncover(ed) unexpected phenotypes in mouse models&quot; as 1) general phenotyping of mouse models for characteristics (motor, sight, motivation) that would alter touchscreen results should be done prior to testing and 2) this phenotype was previously reported as the authors note.</p><p>- Similarly, the inclusion of the lack of effect of AB burden based on ad lib vs. food restriction is potentially interesting, but here just adds more density to an already overpacked manuscript</p><p>- The longitudinal analysis is potentially powerful, but also raises questions. Some discussion of how previous training might alter later performance needs to be included. There is a strong case to be made that touchscreen testing could be considered enrichment. How does previous experience alter later cognitive performance in these models versus standard housed non-tested mice?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Beraldo and colleagues present a novel open source analysis pipeline for data coming from a suite of tasks used in touchscreen-equipped operant conditioning chambers. They use this pipeline to analyze the behaviour of 3 mouse lines used to study Alzheimer's disease. The pipeline and on-line interface provide an exciting opportunity for combining research from different laboratories to increase understanding of cognition using touchscreen-equipped operant conditioning chambers. Results from the mice tested in the present experiments show results related to the reliability of touchscreen-based assessments, the effects of genetic background, sex, and age on cognition, and also provide an example of using K-mean clustering to analyze behaviour of hundreds of mice in the 3 tasks. Overall, the study is important, exciting, and will provide a useful resource for behavioural neuroscientists studying cognition in rodents. Below are a series of queries for the attention of the authors.</p><p>The title of the paper indicates that the pipeline will be used to study &quot;rodent touchscreen-based cognitive assessment&quot;. However, the manuscript deals exclusively with mice. The absence of discussion of rats (or other species) appears to be a missed opportunity in this regard. Will the MouseBytes site support datasets from researchers studying rats, or other species?</p><p>The Introduction of the manuscript provides a compelling case for the importance of open science and the researchers should be lauded for pushing forward with this pipeline related to cognitive assessment. However, a more detailed discussion of the hardware used to collect the data should be provided. As the hardware used at both sites was the Bussey-Saksida Mouse Systems, it would of considerable interest for other open source hardware options were discussed (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://labrigger.com/blog/2018/03/09/custom-touchscreen-behavior-systems-for-rodents/">https://labrigger.com/blog/2018/03/09/custom-touchscreen-behavior-systems-for-rodents/</ext-link>). Will the data coming from these systems be compatible with the MouseBytes pipeline?</p><p>There are two important components to this study: 1) the introduction of MouseBytes; and 2) the results of assessing the AD-related mice. I found that the specifics of the findings related to the AD-mice were lost in places, particularly the summary and end of the Introduction. How do the authors' experimental results advance our understanding of the 3 mouse models and what specific future research questions can/should be answered with them?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper is essentially a methods paper. The authors have taken a bold step in putting together a much warranted open-access database that enables transparency, collaboration and potential likelihood of reproducibility. The paper is well written with clear detail of the database repository, mousebytes.ca.</p><p>I have only two comments which are essentially suggestions that I think might help make the paper stronger.</p><p>1) The question is how far can mice carry Alzheimer Disease research or any other disease related research, and is data sharing and transparency the answer to translation? The growing disillusionment with murine models of human disease especially in drug discovery, have questioned mouse models constructed with highly penetrant alleles of human disease because of the large number of compounds which apparently 'cure' the mouse but not the human. This discrepancy is repeatedly argued to be due to failure in data/experimental reproducibility causing journals to emphasize more statistical details as if statistics will provide greater translation. Seems to me that the mousebyte.ca database is one approach that could feasibly enable a better mouse to human translation or at least work in this direction. The truth of the matter is that it is virtually impossible to replicate data even in the same lab, let alone between labs for a multitude of reasons. Can mousebytes.ca facilitate translation?</p><p>2) At the moment, the paper focuses on three mouse lines thought to model Alzheimers disease (AD) to highlight the strength of the database. The database is also specific to data acquired using the operant touchscreen platform because non-automated methods, the authors argue, are subject to large variations. Are their plans to expand the database to a much larger cohort of mice that are not necessarily tested for cognitive behaviors tested on a touchscreen platform? The large array of autistic mouse models come to mind for which social communication and interaction, motor, cognitive and emotional behaviors are all variable leaving a very confused state in the field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49630.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary and Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers expressed enthusiasm for efforts to standardize and share data generated by this increasingly popular behavioral testing paradigm.

We have addressed these two concerns below in the response to reviewers.</p><p>Regarding point 1, the intrinsic features of MouseBytes, and particularly those now added in response to the reviewers’ comments, are specifically designed to promote ease of use for all touchscreen users, especially those with whom we do not collaborate directly. MouseBytes allows users to enter Metadata that facilitates comparison and combination of data from different sites and also different touchscreen apparatuses (see reply to reviewers’ comments below). It is also important to emphasize that MouseBytes is by no means immutable; it will continue to evolve based on user’s feedback.</p><p>Thanks to the feedback provided by the reviewers, we made substantial changes to the manuscript, and also to the software. We now can collect even more Metadata on, e.g., experimental conditions. We have also developed codes to easily convert output files from any touchscreen apparatus to the MouseBytes format.</p><p>Regarding point 2, we improved the narrative concerning the empirical data, and in particular made it clearer how the data illustrate the advantages of MouseBytes. This is now explained more clearly in the Abstract and Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>With more and more researchers adopting touchscreen systems for high-level cognitive assessment, there is certainly a need for a well maintained repository to allow for sharing of published datasets, large meta-analysis, and importantly, but not mentioned, the dissemination of null datasets.

We have now mentioned throughout the manuscript the potential difficulties in comparing datasets. In particular, we now emphasize collection of Metadata by MouseBytes as a way to greatly facilitate comparison of datasets. Users depositing data can now specify in detail all conditions of the experiments, and further are able to link datasets to published manuscripts which yield further details. Examples include added fields in the repository to account for potential variations in conditions between different laboratories such as light-dark cycle, and group v single housing. The greater availability of these details will increase the power of meta-analysis using MouseBytes.</p><p>We have also improved the discussion and explanation about the k-mean analysis. We clearly state now in the manuscript both in the Introduction and Discussion the utility for depositing null-datasets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors repeatedly stress the strength of the touchscreen systems is the standardization of outcomes.

At the moment, major variations in these parameters are identified by the QC codes, and therefore experiments that deviate from standard operating parameters are flagged and can only be uploaded after communication between the user and administrator (subsections “Open-Access Database and repository” and “Touchscreen operant platform” describe these procedures). When experiments deviate from standard parameters, users are requested to provide information in the experiment field and also link the datasets to the published manuscript or preprint providing further details regarding the experimental conditions. Datasets that differ from standard protocols will still be uploadable in MouseBytes and can then be identified and curated for meta-analysis by using the information provided by the experimenter and the QC codes can be also modified by users. This is mentioned in the Results and Discussion and Materials and methods (all new information labelled).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The current study stresses the high-degree of collaboration and communication across sites including pre-standardization, use of the same systems and software, monthly conference calls and collaboration on QC.

It has always been our intention to allow Mousebytes to incorporate data not only from Bussey-Saksida touchscreens systems, but from any variant of touchscreen operant chambers as long the output data can be made to match the Mousebytes specifications. We have now developed codes to do just that, and have added this MouseBytes feature to the manuscript. These codes can be downloaded and modified by different users to convert XML files from any touchscreen system output to files that can be readable by MouseBytes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/srmemar/Mousebytes-An-open-access-high-throughput-pipeline-and-database-for-rodent-touchscreen-based-data/blob/master/XML_Output.ipynb">https://github.com/srmemar/Mousebytes-An-open-access-high-throughput-pipeline-and-database-for-rodent-touchscreen-based-data/blob/master/XML_Output.ipynb</ext-link>). This is now described in the Results and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors state both in the Introduction and Materials and methods that during QC &quot;files&quot; with potential errors are flagged by the procedure, fixed manually, or discarded and not used for analysis if not fixable. What is a &quot;file&quot;? Is this a daily data file for an individual animal? If so, how does the software account for the &quot;hole&quot; in the data? Are those data points simply ignored, wouldn't this decrease the total errors, alter the percent correct for that animal?</p></disp-quote><p>Files are XML outputs generated from a unique session (day) from a unique mouse ID. We have now addressed this point in the subsections “Open-Access Database and repository” and “Touchscreen operant platform”. If a file is flagged and cannot be fixed for some reason, these data are not transferred to MouseBytes and will not be part of the downloadable dataset or used for visualization. In the specific datasets already in MouseBytes, it is unlikely that the discarded files would affect the final results reported in the manuscript. For example, for the 5-choice data less than 0.6% of files were terminally flagged and not used to compose the datasets, and only 0.09% were from probe trials (26 probe trial files flagged files out of 27,440 total files from 5 choice). Hence, the system will not use these data, but it should not have affected the final analysis in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- While the authors correctly note the huge number of graphs and figures that can be generated from this dataset, the data included in Figure 2 seem arbitrary. Site comparison is included for 3-6 M/Males but not 11-13. Strain is shown for males and not females. Given only 4 figures are included in the main document, there is room to add these panels and aid the reader in the logical assessment of the variables.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We now provide several new panels comparing the performance of mice longitudinally, between sites, sex and strains. (Figures 2 and 4) to the current version of the manuscript which is now described in the Results and Discussion</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Application of unbiased assessment via machine learning is exciting and potentially important, but the approach is not clear. If the authors wish to unbias the approach, why were sex and age specifically conducted separately? Does this analysis require the assumption of independent samples? Inclusion of each animal as a separate data point at each age would violate this.</p></disp-quote><p>In the k-mean clustering approach that we present in the manuscript, we did not separate sex in the primary clustering algorithm to define Low, Mid and High performers. However, following the k-mean analysis, we determined if group memberships were significantly different by utilizing Fisher’s test. In this secondary analysis, we did separate the data by age and sex. We did this to prioritize looking at group membership and genotype in the Fisher’s Exact Test. In order to address the multiple tests created by separating age and sex, we used a False Discovery Rate correction analyses.</p><p>In the k-mean analysis, we assumed that performance could change with age, so age was treated as an independent between factor, where each animal had two or three cluster points for each of the ages of assessment. The k-mean clustering algorithm does not require independence for the initial clustering. The Fisher’s exact test we conducted had independent data points as part of our statistical analysis.</p><p>The decision to treat animals at different ages as separate data points was done in order to allow for mice to switch k-mean categories, based on the assumption that performance would change with age. In a given experiment, wildtype mice may naturally have reductions in performance on cognitive tasks related to age. We were interested in detecting if transgenic mice would shift from a category of “high performers” into a category of “low performers” or vice-versa as they were assessed at later time points. More specifically, we were interested in if this shift from high to low performers was larger for transgenic mice than wildtype mice.</p><p>Future efforts with the MouseBytes data system will certainly take advantage of other unbiased classification systems (e.g. Mean Shift, DBSCAN, etc.) with larger datasets to begin to better determine how to classify behavioural data from mouse models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The data presented in Figure 3 (or 4?) do not seem to support the authors' conclusions in the text. The statement &quot;5xFAD and 3xTG-AD transgenic mice consistently are lower performers than their WT counterparts in the 5-CSRTT&quot; is confusing, Based on the figure, it seems that WT 3xFAD males and females are consistently worse at most ages. APP/PS1 results are not discussed, although females show almost no differences (except at 7 months) and in males, WT seem to be consistently worse than TG.</p></disp-quote><p>These data are presented now in Figure 5. Analysis of the dataset shows that indeed, the 3xTG AD and 5xFAD AD mice are shifted to the lower performance group in the 5-Choice Task. Otherwise, their WT counterpart mice are shifted to the higher and moderate performers. For the APP/PS1 mice we did not observed any difference in the performance of females (comparing WT with the TG) in 5 choice. However, interestingly, APP/PS1 male mice shifted their performance to the high and moderate performers while WT shifted to lower performers in the 5-Choice Task. The presentation and discussion of this information are in the Results and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Follow up motor testing on the 5xFAD males is potentially interesting but detracts from the main point of the manuscript. It is unconvincing that increased reward collection latency &quot;uncover(ed) unexpected phenotypes in mouse models&quot; as 1) general phenotyping of mouse models for characteristics (motor, sight, motivation) that would alter touchscreen results should be done prior to testing and 2) this phenotype was previously reported as the authors note.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and accordingly removed the dataset from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Similarly, the inclusion of the lack of effect of AB burden based on ad lib vs. food restriction is potentially interesting, but here just adds more density to an already overpacked manuscript</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. However, given that environmental enrichment and decreased food consumption could affect pathology in mouse models, we find these results important for readers to understand that lack of change in cognitive domains is not related to changes in pathology. We have decreased as much as possible the discussion on these issues and only provide information for readers to get the main message.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The longitudinal analysis is potentially powerful, but also raises questions. Some discussion of how previous training might alter later performance needs to be included. There is a strong case to be made that touchscreen testing could be considered enrichment. How does previous experience alter later cognitive performance in these models versus standard housed non-tested mice?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point raised by the reviewer. We elaborated on this point in the manuscript (Results and Discussion), but the present work did not directly address this question.</p><p>However, one possible source of insight into this question might be in the data from mice performing the 5-Choice serial reaction time task. In our manuscript, we present data from the same mice tested at 3 ages, with final timepoint at 11-13 months, when mice would have been probed twice in this task. Romberg and colleagues, 2011, also tested a 3xTG-AD mice previously with the 5-Choice task at 10 months of age, however, these mice were naïve when tested at this age. The data and results between these two experiments are very similar, suggesting that prior cognitive training may not have a dramatic effect on subsequent touchscreen behavior in the 5-Choice test. Moreover, comparison of performance of mice longitudinally in the 5-Choice task suggests that accuracy does not change with age, although omission is improved after repeated training (See datasets from Figure 2 and Figure 4 and compare 2-6- and 11-13-month-old mice).</p><p>We have also analyzed the performance in pairwise visual discrimination and reversal with distinct images in different ages and found that depending on the image mouse performance varied, but previous training did not seem to affect the performance. This is now discussed in the Results and Discussion. We anticipate that with increased datasets being deposited, this important question will be addressed in the future for multiple tasks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Below are a series of queries for the attention of the authors.</p><p>The title of the paper indicates that the pipeline will be used to study &quot;rodent touchscreen-based cognitive assessment&quot;. However, the manuscript deals exclusively with mice. The absence of discussion of rats (or other species) appears to be a missed opportunity in this regard. Will the MouseBytes site support datasets from researchers studying rats, or other species?</p><p>The Introduction of the manuscript provides a compelling case for the importance of open science and the researchers should be lauded for pushing forward with this pipeline related to cognitive assessment. However, a more detailed discussion of the hardware used to collect the data should be provided. As the hardware used at both sites was the Bussey-Saksida Mouse Systems, it would of considerable interest for other open source hardware options were discussed (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://labrigger.com/blog/2018/03/09/custom-touchscreen-behavior-systems-for-rodents/">https://labrigger.com/blog/2018/03/09/custom-touchscreen-behavior-systems-for-rodents/</ext-link>). Will the data coming from these systems be compatible with the MouseBytes pipeline?</p></disp-quote><p>As described in response to reviewer 1, we have created a way for Mousebytes to incorporate data not only from Bussey-Saksida touchscreens systems, but from any variant of touchscreen operant chambers. To do that, we have developed codes that can be downloaded and modified by different users to convert XML files from any touchscreen system output to files that can be readable by MouseBytes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/srmemar/Mousebytes-An-open-access-high-throughput-pipeline-and-database-for-rodent-touchscreen-based-data/blob/master/XML_Output.ipynb">https://github.com/srmemar/Mousebytes-An-open-access-high-throughput-pipeline-and-database-for-rodent-touchscreen-based-data/blob/master/XML_Output.ipynb</ext-link>). These codes can be easily adapted by users with data obtained in other touchscreen systems. This is now mentioned in the Results and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are two important components to this study: 1) the Introduction of MouseBytes; and 2) the results of assessing the AD-related mice. I found that the specifics of the findings related to the AD-mice were lost in places, particularly the summary and end of the Introduction. How do the authors' experimental results advance our understanding of the 3 mouse models and what specific future research questions can/should be answered with them?</p></disp-quote><p>These issues have now been addressed in the Introduction and the Discussion. We identify common age-dependent attentional deficits in 3xTG-AD and 5xFAD mice. We also found that behavioral flexibility did not seem to be consistently affected in most mouse lines tested. This dataset provides the foundation to test new drugs to correct attentional deficits, which were consistently reproduced in 2 out of 3 mouse lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] I have only two comments, which are essentially suggestions that I think might help make the paper stronger.</p><p>1) The question is how far can mice carry Alzheimer Disease research or any other disease related research, and is data sharing and transparency the answer to translation? The growing disillusionment with murine models of human disease especially in drug discovery, have questioned mouse models constructed with highly penetrant alleles of human disease because of the large number of compounds which apparently 'cure' the mouse but not the human. This discrepancy is repeatedly argued to be due to failure in data/experimental reproducibility causing journals to emphasize more statistical details as if statistics will provide greater translation. Seems to me that the mousebyte.ca database is one approach that could feasibly enable a better mouse to human translation or at least work in this direction. The truth of the matter is that it is virtually impossible to replicate data even in the same lab, let alone between labs for a multitude of reasons. Can mousebytes.ca facilitate translation?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer summarizes one of our motivations to create a repository for touchscreen datasets. Databases such as MouseBytes can provide more transparency, to allow others to analyze datasets and confirm experiments. We hope that our database can serve as an interface for researchers interested in studying replication and reproducibility.</p><p>Additionally, we are hoping to provide a platform for researchers to identify critical features in the lab environment that may contribute to behavioural variation. We have recently begun to address this by incorporation of new meta-data into the MouseBytes experiment records for factors such as colony light cycle, visual stimuli selection, and type of animal housing. We plan on expanding our meta-data system to include several more factors, but these can also be informed in manuscripts that are linked to datasets via their DOI. Eventually, with enough labs and experiments in the system, we can begin to systematically identify which factors may be contributing to experimental variation, and address the issues of translation and reproducibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) At the moment, the paper focuses on three mouse lines thought to model Alzheimers disease (AD) to highlight the strength of the database. The database is also specific to data acquired using the operant touchscreen platform because non-automated methods, the authors argue, are subject to large variations. Are their plans to expand the database to a much larger cohort of mice that are not necessarily tested for cognitive behaviors tested on a touchscreen platform? The large array of autistic mouse models come to mind for which social communication and interaction, motor, cognitive and emotional behaviors are all variable leaving a very confused state in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>: We appreciate the desire and need to expand open platforms of behavioural sharing to non-touchscreen behaviour. At this time, we are not considering expanding our system to non-touchscreen behavior, because most of these conventional methods are not automated and have no standardized outputs. We have chosen to focus on touchscreen behaviour with the MouseBytes data, due to the inherent benefits of these systems for replication, experimental control, and translational validity. We are however interested in expanding the touchscreen repertoire to include tasks that are more emotional/social in nature and could probe different types of deficits in other mouse models. Indeed, we are aware of other researchers who are using videos in touchscreens to assess murine social behaviour. We also anticipate the contribution of datasets by the community of researchers using touchscreens using mouse models of developmental disorders.</p><p>Our view would be that although touchscreens are ideally suited for databasing applications, the hope is that other behaviours will eventually join the open science/datasharing movement. We think that MouseBytes could help to lead the way.</p></body></sub-article></article>
