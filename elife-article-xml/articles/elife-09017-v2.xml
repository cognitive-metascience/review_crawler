Using a <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> vaccination model, we delineate the sequence of events that naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells undergo to become terminal effectors and the differentiation steps controlled by IL-12. We demonstrate that direct IL-12 signaling on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is essential for the induction of KLRG1 and IFN-γ, but the subsequent downregulation of CXCR3 is controlled by IL-12 indirectly through the actions of IFN-γ and IFN-γ-inducible chemokines. Differentiation of nascent effectors occurs in an extrafollicular splenic compartment and is driven by late IL-12 production by DCs distinct from the classical CD8α<sup>+</sup> DC. Unexpectedly, we also found extensive proliferation of both KLRG1<sup>−</sup> and KLRG1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the marginal zone and red pulp, which ceases prior to the final KLRG1<sup>Hi</sup> CXCR3<sup>Lo</sup> stage. Our findings highlight the notion of an extrafollicular pathway for effector T cell generation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09017.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09017.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09017.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The immune system helps to protect us from cancer, infection by microbes and other diseases. There are several different types of immune cells that each have particular roles. For example, cytotoxic T cells can kill other cells in the body that are damaged or infected. These cells are found in various locations around the body—including a region of the spleen known as the white pulp—where they wait in an inactive state until they detect signals from a damaged or infected cell. These T cells divide and mature to produce populations of active T cells known as effector cytotoxic lymphoid cells (or CTLs for short), a process which is thought to occur within the white pulp.</p><p>A small protein called cytokine IL-12 is involved in the production of CTLs. The cytokine is released from other immune cells and causes the activated T cells to divide and mature. It has long been believed that IL-12 produced in the white pulp early on in the process is sufficient to drive this process, but more recent work suggests that sustained production of IL-12 in other areas of the spleen that are accessible to the bloodstream may be needed.</p><p>Here, Shah et al. studied the generation of cytotoxic T cells in mice that had been exposed to a vaccine against a disease called Toxoplasmosis. Their experiments show that IL-12 drives both the early and late stages of CTL production. In the early stages, the T cells respond to IL-12 that is secreted by a group of ‘lymphoid dendritic’ cells in the white pulp. However, in the later stages, the T cells move away from the white pulp to other parts of the spleen known as the marginal zone and red pulp, where a distinct group of ‘myeloid dendritic’ cells also produce IL-12 and direct the final maturation of the CTLs.</p><p>Shah et al.'s findings also show that the process in which cytotoxic T cells divide and later mature to produce CTLs involves a series of tightly controlled events that mostly occur outside of the white pulp. These observations provide a new perspective on how to develop vaccines and other treatments that more efficiently generate the CTLs needed to protect against infections and cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09017.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09017.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Toxoplasma</italic></kwd><kwd>CD8 T cell</kwd><kwd>interleukin-12</kwd><kwd>extrafollicular</kwd><kwd>effector cell</kwd><kwd>myeloid DC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 AI083405</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yap</surname><given-names>George S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proliferation and differentiation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells into terminal effectors occurs in the marginal zone and red pulp, and is promoted by IL-12 through direct and indirect mechanisms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The activation of naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells occurs in the T cell areas of secondary lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mempel et al., 2004</xref>). Once activated, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are thought to undergo rapid clonal expansion and differentiate into IFN-γ-producing effector cytotoxic lymphoid cells (CTLs) through an ‘autopilot’ mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mercado et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bevan and Fink, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaech and Ahmed, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Stipdonk et al., 2001</xref>). Consistent with this paradigm, CD8α<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (DCs), which are resident in the splenic white pulp, are critical for both antigen cross-presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">den Haan et al., 2000</xref>) and production of a key pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reis e Sousa et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mashayekhi et al., 2011</xref>). IL-12 is an important signal 3 cytokine that drives clonal proliferation of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Curtsinger et al., 1999</xref>) as well as their effector cytokine production in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schmidt and Mescher, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Valenzuela et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilson et al., 2008</xref>). However, following their activation and migration into the inner PALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reis e Sousa et al., 1997</xref>), CD8α<sup>+</sup> DCs become hyporesponsive and cease IL-12 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reis e Sousa et al., 1999</xref>), raising the question of whether this initial early burst of IL-12 is sufficient to drive end-stage effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation to completion.</p><p>Recently, there has been mounting evidence that additional events occurring outside the T cell area are critical for primary T<sub>H</sub>1 and CTL effector differentiation. CXCR3 deficiency results in an inefficient generation of cytokine-producing effector cells and instead favors a response skewed towards memory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kohlmeier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kurachi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Groom et al., 2012</xref>). CXCR3-mediated outmigration of T cells into the splenic marginal zone (MZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kurachi et al., 2011</xref>) or the peripheral medullary areas of lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Groom et al., 2012</xref>) enables interactions with IL-12 producing myeloid cells. The role of CXCR3 in lymphocyte peripheralization also extends to the memory response and is essential for secondary effector T cell generation from central memory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kastenmuller et al., 2013</xref>). These recent findings argue that an initial exposure to IL-12 and other signal 3 cytokines during the early stages of T cell activation may not be sufficient for effector T cell differentiation. Instead, a subsequent exposure to IL-12 at extrafollicular sites appears to drive effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation to completion. It is also possible that this requirement may stem from the initial lack of a robust CD8α<sup>+</sup> DC- derived IL-12 during viral and bacterial immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalod et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edelson et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>During CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell priming, the inflammatory milieu governs effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell generation. In particular, the cytokine IL-12 potently promotes CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell effector differentiation and function, through T-bet-dependent induction of KLRG1 expression and IFN-γ production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joshi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilson et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2010</xref>). In addition to these effects, IL-12 appears to also control the migratory potential of primary and effector T cells, by negatively regulating CXCR3 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Slutter et al., 2013</xref>). Given the possibility of IL-12 being produced both within the T cell area and at extrafollicular sites, it remains unclear how IL-12 temporarily and spatially controls these key facets of the primary effector CTL response. Furthermore, although it is assumed that these IL-12 effects are CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-autonomous, the possibility exists that regulation may be indirectly mediated through the actions of this cytokine on other IL-12 responsive immune cells.</p><p>In order to address these questions, we used a <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> vaccination model to conduct a detailed analysis of the role of IL-12 in the generation, function and migratory potential of parasite-specific effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We had previously identified this <italic>tgd057-</italic>reactive H-2K<sup>b</sup>-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response in mice vaccinated with an attenuated, uracil auxotrophic strain of <italic>T. gondii</italic> (CPS), known to elicit CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-dependent protective immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fox and Bzik, 2002</xref>) and have demonstrated a strict in vivo requirement for IL-12 to generate KLRG1<sup>+</sup> effector CTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilson et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2010</xref>). Our results reveal that the sequence of differentiative events that culminate in the production of primary end-stage effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells occurs over a protracted period and that IL-12 exerts regulatory functions at both early and late phases of effector cell generation. The effects of IL-12 in upregulating KLRG1 expression and priming for IFN-γ production require CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell intrinsic cytokine signaling. In contrast, we found that the belated downregulation of CXCR3 on effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is indirectly regulated by IL-12 and is instead controlled by a pathway in which IFN-γ and IFN-γ-inducible chemokines mediate this downmodulation. Using an in vivo intravascular staining method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Olson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2014</xref>), we were able to reveal that these later stages of effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation occur extrafollicularly, involving DCs as cellular sources of both non-CD8α<sup>+</sup> DC-derived IL-12 and CXCR3-ligands. Surprisingly, we also found extensive proliferation of both KLRG1<sup>−</sup> and KLRG1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the MZ and red pulp (RP). Taken together with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lauvau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cockburn et al., 2010</xref>), our findings argue against the notion that effector CTL generation occurs through an ‘autopilot’ sequence and, instead, involves a multi-leveled progression of effector T cell precursors through distinct splenic microenvironments, where their differentiation is controlled by a complex interplay with locally positioned activated immune cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferative response is IL-12 independent while effector cell differentiation is IL-12 dependent</title><p>To determine the early effects of IL-12 on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation and differentiation during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, we used a tetramer-based enrichment method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klenerman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moon et al., 2007</xref>) to enumerate H-2K<sup>b</sup>-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for the <italic>T. gondii</italic> antigen <italic>tgd057</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilson et al., 2010</xref>) in wild-type (WT) and IL-12p35 deficient hosts following CPS vaccination.

Indeed, previous studies in our laboratory and others have shown that IL-12 is crucial for the differentiation of KLRG1<sup>+</sup> effector CTLs through T-bet dependent induction of effector genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joshi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilson et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2010</xref>). To determine how IL-12 signals affect the early differentiation of <italic>tgd057</italic>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we monitored the expression of CD62L and KLRG1 following <italic>T. gondii</italic> vaccination. We have previously used these cell surface markers to define four specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell stages: F1 (T<sub>CM</sub>: CD62L<sup>+</sup>, KLRG1<sup>−</sup>), F2 (T<sub>EM</sub>: CD62L<sup>−</sup>, KLRG1<sup>−</sup>), F3 (T<sub>EFF</sub>: CD62L<sup>−</sup>, KLRG1<sup>+</sup>) and F4 (CD62L<sup>+</sup>, KLRG1<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilson et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2010</xref>). While F1 and F2 are determined to be central and effector memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, respectively; F3 are the late stage highly IFN-γ-producing effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, little is still known about the phenotype and function of the F4 stage CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We do not observe consistent changes in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell stage distribution until day 3 in either WT or IL-12 deficient hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, by day 3, ∼7–8% of the <italic>tgd057</italic>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells start to commit to putative T<sub>EM</sub> and T<sub>EFF</sub> cells by downregulating CD62L and increasing KLRG1 expression in the WT hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In IL-12p35 deficient hosts, L-selectin downregulation is also observed starting on day 3, however KLRG1 upregulation is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). On day 4, there is a dramatic increase in the frequency of <italic>tgd057</italic>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that have downregulated CD62L, a third of which also acquire KLRG1 in WT mice. However, in the absence of IL-12, there is an attenuation of KLRG1 expression resulting in an even larger frequency of F2 <italic>tgd057</italic>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The frequency of KLRG1<sup>+</sup> <italic>tgd057</italic>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells continues to increase through day 7 post-vaccination in WT hosts; yet, in IL-12 deficient mice, KLRG1 upregulation remains attenuated and the frequencies of F3 stage <italic>tgd057</italic>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells do not reach levels seen WT hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results indicate that IL-12 signaling has an important role on the differentiation of KLRG1<sup>+</sup> effector <italic>tgd057</italic>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and that this occurs earlier than the proliferative burst seen after day 4. In contrast, downregulation of CD62L and subsequent clonal expansion are IL-12 independent.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>During effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation, expression of CXCR3 is downregulated in an IL-12 dependent manner</title><p>In spite of the fact that IL-12 signals did not play a crucial role in proliferation of <italic>tgd057</italic>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleen, we observed that case to be different at the site of infection.

Thus, the early upregulation of KLRG1 expression on <italic>tgd057</italic>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells occurs mainly in the RP, where they may be encountering a secondary signal of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-12, for later differentiation into end-stage effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.

IL-12 may be produced only early during vaccine priming and programs the entire effector differentiation pathway over time. Alternatively, IL-12 may be produced at both early and late time points, potentially by distinct APCs. To address the latter scenario, we neutralized IL-12 late (D3) and compared its effects on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation to early (D0) and continuous neutralization (D0 and D3) following CPS vaccination. Consistent with our earlier results, the blockade of IL-12 at early, late or both time points did not affect absolute <italic>tgd057</italic>-specific CTL numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

In addition, CXCR3 downregulation on KLRG1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells occurs in the RP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>), where IL-12 producing cell types other than CD8α<sup>+</sup> DCs may be involved. Specifically, the late-acting IL-12 may be secreted by inflammatory-monocyte derived DCs, and has been shown to require NK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldszmid et al., 2012</xref>) or T<sub>H</sub>1-CXCR3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell -derived IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen et al., 2013</xref>) for DC activation. This scenario raises the possibility that other cells besides the developing effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells may be the targets of IL-12 signaling. In order to determine if IL-12 mediates CXCR3 downregulation directly, we adoptively transferred a 1:1 mixture of naïve WT and IL-12rβ2 deficient monoclonal <italic>tgd057</italic>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (derived via SCNT cloning) into a CD45.1<sup>+</sup> WT B6 host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). 7 days after CPS-vaccination, we observe that the lack of IL-12 signaling does not alter the frequency of IL-12rβ2 deficient donor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), but CXCR3 downregulation is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These results confirm earlier conclusions that IL-12 is not essential for T cell expansion in vivo and are consistent with the notion that IL-12 directly signals the downregulation of CXCR3 expression. However, when we further compared CXCR3 expression between KLRG1<sup>−</sup> vs KLRG1<sup>+</sup> stages, we found that the F3 stage KLRG1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells had downregulated CXCR3 regardless of their ability to signal IL-12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We conclude that CXCR3 is downregulated in a non-CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell autonomous manner, which is not consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Slutter et al., 2013</xref>). The apparent lack of CXCR3 downregulation is due to the predominant deficiency in KLRG1 expression on the IL-12Rβ2 deficient CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

We exploited the fact that IL-12 deficient F3 stage KLRG1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells fail to decrease CXCR3 and used these cells as an in vitro model system to directly interrogate what factors can cause CXCR3 downregulation. Upon exposure and binding to its chemokine ligands, surface expressed CXCR3 is rapidly downregulated, endocytosed and degraded, but is quickly replenished by newly synthesized protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meiser et al., 2008</xref>). We therefore used CXCL10 exposure to ‘strip’ pre-existing CXCR3 from D7 CPS vaccinated IL-12p35 deficient splenocytes and determined whether IFN-γ or IL-12 can maintain the expression of CXCR3 on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at a low level. As expected, the addition of IP-10 rapidly decreases the expression of CXCR3 on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells lacking IL-12 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, left), but importantly, the addition of IFN-γ and not the addition of CXCL10 alone, maintains the low levels of CXCR3 on these CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, to a similar extent as the addition of IL-12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, right).

CD11c<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs (myeloid DCs [mDCs]), but not CD8α<sup>+</sup> DCs produced IL-12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, D3).

Indeed, nearly all of the IL-12/chemokine -positive DCs on D3 are CCR2<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To evaluate the role of this late IL-12 producing APC population, we transiently depleted CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes/derivatives on D2.5 by administering diptheria toxin to CCR2-DTR mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hohl et al., 2009</xref>). Transient ablation resulted in markedly diminished KLRG1<sup>+</sup> (F3 and F4) subpopulations and attenuation in CXCR3 downregulation in the KLRG1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Although our data shows that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are major IFN-γ producers at day 3, this response is probably not parasite antigen specific because, as indicated by the data above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), clonal bursting does not occur until after day 4. Taken together, our data suggests a three-cell model for how IL-12 indirectly leads to CXCR3 downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). In the RP, bystander T<sub>H</sub>1 CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are the cellular targets of the IL-12 produced by inflammatory monocyte-derived mDCs, which in response produce IFN-γ. IFN-γ then can directly target both mDCs to produce chemokines and the developing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The downregulation of CXCR3 on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is driven by both chemokine-induced receptor downmodulation and by IFN-γ-mediated suppression of further CXCR3 expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Generation of KLRG1<sup>+</sup> effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells occurs after cessation of proliferation within the splenic RP</title><p>Taken together, our data suggest that most of the differentiative steps effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells undergo occur extrafollicularly, raising the question of where their effector precursor proliferation takes place. A predominant view is that activation and proliferation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells occurs at the outer zone of the T cell area bordering B cell follicles and subsequently exits via bridging channels to the splenic RP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khanna et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, we sought to determine whether CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation occurs mainly in the white pulp and completes their differentiation in the RP as post-mitotic cells. We combined EdU labeling with intravascular staining during day 5 CPS-vaccination to localize where CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation occurs in the context of the sequence of their differentiation. We found that a significantly greater proportion of proliferating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (labeled within a narrow 2 hr period) were localized to the RP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, left) and comprised predominantly of CD62L<sup>−</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (F2 and F3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, right). In fact, on a per cell basis, the proliferative rate increases as cells progress from F1 to F3 stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, left) and exhibit the same skewed extrafollicular localization of cycling CD62L<sup>−</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, right). A similar pattern of increased EdU labeling of CD62L<sup>−</sup> fractions (F2 and F3) and a skewing towards RP localization of proliferative cells were evident in <italic>tgd057</italic>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,D</xref>). These results indicate that, unlike the predominant view, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation is not restricted to the T cell area. To more precisely localize the extrafollicular sites of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation, we performed immunohistochemistry of D5.5 spleens immediately after IV injection of FITC-labeled anti-CD8α. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, EdU-positive cells double-labeled with IV injected anti-CD8α and ex vivo stained anti-CD8α antibodies are readily observed in the MZ (marked with yellow arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>) and in bridging channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Extrafollicular proliferative CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are also observed in the RP, many of which are also KLRG1<sup>+</sup> (marked with pink arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Interestingly, these data also indicate that clonal proliferation does not cease when CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells acquire the effector cell marker, KLRG1. This raises the question of whether CXCR3 downregulation occurs concomitantly or subsequent to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation in the KLRG1<sup>+</sup> (F3) compartment.

We further delineate the steps where the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-12, is required for effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation. Upon activation, CD44, a surface receptor necessary for T cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteoglycans, is rapidly upregulated and then L-selectin (CD62L) is downregulated in an IL-12-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). CXCR3 is expressed early in the CD44<sup>Hi</sup>, CD62L<sup>+</sup> (F1) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell stage, and remains highly expressed through the CD44<sup>Hi</sup>, CD62L<sup>−</sup> (F2) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This early expression of CXCR3 is T-bet dependent but IL-12 independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). While still in the white pulp and even prior to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3">Figures 1, 3</xref>), a few CD44<sup>Hi</sup>, CD62L<sup>−</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells begin to acquire KLRG1 surface expression in an IL-12 dependent manner. As CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell numbers increase and outmigrate to the RP, KLRG1 expression escalates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> we are able to reveal, for the first time, that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation does not only occur exclusively in the white pulp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–D</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found that most of the proliferating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are CD62L<sup>−</sup> (F2 and F3 stage CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells) and many of these cycling effector precursors are observed to be outmigrating into the MZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) via bridging channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khanna et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, these extrafollicular KLRG1<sup>+</sup> precursor effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells downregulate CXCR3 expression in an IL-12 dependent fashion. CXCR3 downregulation by IL-12 is indirectly mediated by IFN-γ and IFN-γ-dependent chemokines, which are produced by other T lymphocytes and mDCs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), in the MZ where the extrafollicular CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have been shown to cluster and interact with inflammatory myeloid cells producing IL-12 in a CXCR3 dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kurachi et al., 2011</xref>).

While IL-12 has been thought to be the major signal 3 cytokine needed for in vitro proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Curtsinger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Valenzuela et al., 2002</xref>) and augmentation of the immune synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Markiewicz et al., 2009</xref>), we found that IL-12 does not provide an obligatory signal for <italic>T. gondii</italic>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clonal expansion in vivo, but rather is critical for the early KLRG1 expression on precursor effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Although KLRG1, IFN-γ and CXCR3 are under transcriptional control of T-bet, the expression pattern of CXCR3 is opposite to the expression patterns of KLRG1 and IFN-γ, such that CXCR3 expression is increased early during CD62L<sup>+</sup> F1 and CD62L<sup>−</sup> F2 stages of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation, while KLRG1 is expressed during the later stages of effector differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). While CXCR3 is expressed early and its upregulation is IL-12 independent, we show that that once precursor effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells upregulate KLRG1, CXCR3 expression is downregulated in an IL-12 dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2, 4</xref>). Even though IL-12 is required for both the upregulation of KLRG1 and the downregulation of CXCR3, these two effects can be temporally and spatially dissociated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3, 4</xref>). Furthermore, while the IL-12 effects on KLRG1 and IFN-γ are acting on the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells themselves, we found, surprisingly, that downregulation of CXCR3 is regulated by IL-12 in a non-CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell autonomous fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This latter finding seems to be at odds with a previous report that IL-12 directly regulates the suppression of CXCR3 expression of effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Slutter et al., 2013</xref>). In this previous study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Slutter et al. (2013)</xref> also used a chimeric approach with IL-12rβ1 deficient and WT OT-1 cells to demonstrate that IL-12 receptor signaling has negative regulatory effects on CXCR3 expression during influenza priming and that this control is CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-intrinsic. Our results indicate a similar conclusion when we analyzed CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells without regard for KLRG1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, when we analyze CXCR3 expression on KLRG1<sup>−</sup> vs KLRG1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expression, we arrive at a different conclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In the absence of IL-12 receptor signaling, we show that KLRG1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells maintain low CXCR3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The appearance of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell autonomous control can be explained by population skewing at the expense of KLRG1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which is the only stage where CXCR3 is decreased. Thus, even in the influenza system, IL-12 probably indirectly downregulates CXCR3.</p><p>The data from both our chimeric transfer and late in vivo IFN-γ neutralization experiments indicate that IL-12 does not directly regulate CXCR3 downmodulation during precursor effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6, 7</xref>), but instead acts through an indirect pathway by which IFN-γ suppresses CXCR3 expression. In support of this model, we find that there is production of IFN-γ by bystander T<sub>H</sub>1 T cells and that IFN-γ maintains CXCR3 suppression in vitro. Thus, we propose a three-cell model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) for CXCR3 downregulation, in which the developing effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell is the direct target of IFN-γ derived from bystander T<sub>H</sub>1 T cells and IFN-γ-induced chemokines produced by mDCs. In this model, IL-12 acts by inducing IFN-γ production from bystander T<sub>H</sub>1 T cells rather than the developing effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells themselves. The mechanism of CXCR3 suppression by IFN-γ is currently not clear, but it will be interesting to find out whether it uses the same ID2-mediated pathway described for IL-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knell et al., 2013</xref>). It is also unclear what signals drive the production of IL-12 by mDCs at later time points after the initial IL-12 production by CD8α<sup>+</sup> DCs has waned. It is possible that residual non-replicating <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites persist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dupont et al., 2014</xref>) and, in addition, IFN-γ itself acting together with accessory signals from bystander lymphocytes provides inductive signals for mDC production of IL-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ariotti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Slutter and Harty, 2014</xref>). Regardless of these uncertainties, our identification of IFN-γ as the critical mediator for CXCR3 downregulation provides a common mechanism for how multiple proinflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2011</xref>) can redundantly downmodulate CXCR3 on developing effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>Our report highlights that the expression pattern of CXCR3 is highly complex as CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells progress through distinct stages of differentiation. Although CXCR3 expression has been classically associated with IL-12 driven type-1 effector adaptive immune responses, we show that CXCR3 is expressed very early in the CD62L<sup>+</sup> KLRG1<sup>−</sup> F1 stage and thus allowing CD62L<sup>−</sup> KLRG1<sup>−</sup> F2 stage effector precursor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to outmigrate to the MZ and the RP, where they are further exposed to proinflammatory signals and differentiate into effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The same CXCR3 mediated outmigration has been reported for primary CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and central memory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kurachi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Groom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kastenmuller et al., 2013</xref>), arguing for the existence of a common extrafollicular pathway for type-1 effector cell generation. Following proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine exposure KLRG1<sup>+</sup> CXCR3<sup>Hi</sup> precursor effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells gain the ability to produce high levels of IFN-γ while downregulating CXCR3 expression. The observation that outmigrating differentiated effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells found in the splenic RP are CXCR3<sup>Lo</sup> while published studies have clearly shown that tissue associated effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are mostly CXCR3<sup>Hi</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kohlmeier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Slutter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ochiai et al., 2015</xref>) raises the question of whether they reacquire CXCR3 once they reach infected tissue sites. A recent study of Mtb-infected lung tissues has demonstrated the existence of two distinct subpopulations of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>1 cells that differ in their accessibility to an intravenous fluorescent antibody tracer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sakai et al., 2014</xref>). The tracer-accessible subpopulation resembled our F3 stage effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells being KLRG1<sup>+</sup> CXCR3<sup>Lo</sup> CX3CR1<sup>Hi</sup> and was IFN-γ<sup>Hi</sup>. In contrast, the other subpopulation more deeply localized in the tissue parenchyma were CXCR3<sup>Hi</sup> and exhibited a highly activated phenotype with expression of CD69 and PD-1, but lower in KLRG1 expression and IFN-γ production. Therefore, one interesting scenario is by virtue of their CX3CR1 expression, the F3 stage effector cell circulates in the blood and serves a patrolling function similar to CX3CR1<sup>Hi</sup> monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auffray et al., 2007</xref>). They could then regain CXCR3 expression and function as effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in parasite-infected tissues. Future studies should investigate the reciprocal patterns of expression of CXCR3 and CX3CR1 and their counter regulation.</p><p>Using immunohistochemistry methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khanna et al.

(2011)</xref> further reported that CXCR3 enabled CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to cluster with IL-12 producing CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs in the MZ and RP. Now, we show that precursor effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the bridging channels and MZ are, in fact, actively proliferating and that they receive IL-12 signals to complete their differentiation in the RP. Collectively, these findings highlight a previously unrecognized extrafollicular pathway for the generation and maturation of primary effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Interestingly, in the B cell response, there is an analogous and well-recognized extrafollicular differentiation pathway of IgG class switched plasma cells producing the primary antibody response to T cell-dependent antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacLennan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kurosaki et al., 2015</xref>). By analogy to the way that the non-germinal center plasma cell response is favored by strong B cell receptor signaling and antigen presentation by MZ localized DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Phan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chappell et al., 2012</xref>), the extrafollicular generation of effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is also likely regulated by differential T cell receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernhard et al., 2015</xref>) and local cytokine and chemokine milieu created by specialized pathogen-engaged APCs interacting with bystander lymphocytes in the MZ and RP. The exposure of effector precursors to this extrafollicular tissue niche could provide major extrinsic factors that determine the observed interclonal and, perhaps, intraclonal variability in effector lymphocyte fates that is independent of their intrinsic TCR-peptide:MHC affinity and dwell time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Plumlee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tubo et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>WT C57BL/6J, <italic>IL-12rβ2</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> (B6.129S1<italic>-Il12rb2</italic><sup><italic>tm1Jm</italic></sup>/J) male, CD45.1<sup>+</sup> recipients (B6.SJL-<italic>Ptprc</italic><sup><italic>a</italic></sup><italic>Pep</italic><sup><italic>c</italic></sup>/BoyJ) and <italic>T-bet</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> (B6.129S6-<italic>Tbx21</italic><sup><italic>tm1Glm</italic></sup>/J) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). <italic>IL12p35</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (B6.129S1-<italic>Il12a</italic><sup><italic>tm1Jm</italic></sup>/J) were bred in house.

Specifically, using tetramers and parasite-specific TCR transgenic T cells, the authors examine the regulation of KLRG1 and CXCR3 on effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations and the role of IL-12, an inflammatory cytokine, that appears to direct the differentiation process intrinsically and extrinsically in regulating KLRG1/IFN-γ and CXCR3 expression on maturing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. One of the highlights of the study is the extra-follicular pathway for the generation and maturation of effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. This is a well thought out and experimentally well executed manuscript, which addresses a timely matter in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell biology.</p><p>2) Although the reviewers find the results quite interesting, they also indicate that the study lacks a certain degree of rigor that weakens the conclusions. A few key experiments as proposed in the reviews from each individual reviewer might significantly enhance the quality of this manuscript and strengthen the author's conclusions. Specifically, the authors need to address the issue of IL-12 production and CXCL0/10 expression by myeloid DCs. Importantly, if the authors plan to resubmit the manuscript, it is strongly suggested that the hypothesis are stated with clarity, that the Results section is organized and written without ambiguity and that the Discussion is less repetitions of the Results. A point worth considering would be to streamline the whole manuscript and in particular the Results section. Comments from each reviewer are included as a guide for an acceptable resubmission of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors describe their investigation of the relationship between IL-12 inflammatory cytokine and early differentiation stages of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells; one of the highlights of the study is the extra-follicular pathway for the generation and maturation of effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. I must say that I found the Results section of this paper rather challenging to read and thus it was difficult to understand the reasons for performing certain experiments. Simply said, I got lost in their KLRG1 cum CXCR3 cum IL-12 story.</p><p>One of the key results that prompted them to start this investigation was the observation that Tg T cell appear to have attenuated migration from the spleen to the peritoneum in IL-12p35-/- mice. This phenomenon appears only on about day 6 after infection, the height of adoptive immune response. They decided then to investigate if the expression of CXCR3 might be related to the attenuated migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In my view, the reduced numbers of the Tgd057 cells could be attributed to many other factors, e.g. cell death in this mouse knockout.</p><p>The authors then assert that while the early expression of CXCR3 is IL-12 independent, it is T-bet dependent. Yet, in my reading of the data in 2B, it seems that WT KLRG1+ cells have the same profiles of CXCR3 as KLRG1+ cells in T-bet -/- mice. In addition, the reference to early vs. late events, is a bit confusing when the analysis that is performed reflects only day 7 post infection. Wouldn't it be more precise to address the different stage of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation instead?</p><p>Although the observations reported here depart from the accepted notion about CXCR3 expression on effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, these results may be significant for responses generated by protozoan parasites. Therefore, it may be worth asking for resubmission of this manuscript but with that clearly stated hypothesis, logically arranged and clearly written Results section and a Discussion that is much less repetitious of the Results. A point worth considering would be to streamline the Results section. For example, the first two paragraphs in the Results section could be expressed succinctly in one paragraph. In short, I find this to be a very complex study and it shouldn't be. I believe that the unduly complex nature stems from the disorganization of the Results section, which obviates the clarity of the intended story.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting and important study that probes the sequence of events occurring during CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell priming and differentiation after vaccination with <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>. The authors focus on antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells through use of tetramers and parasite-specific TCR transgenic T cells, based upon previous studies by this group that identified an immunodominant CD8<sup>+</sup> epitope. They use a really nice method of transferring a defined number of marked antigen-specific “calibrator” cells to accurately quantify what is happening to the endogenous population of parasite-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> cells. These results are highly interesting, and they get to a level of depth that few or no other studies reach. However, there is a certain lack of rigor that weakens the conclusions and the events presented in the schematic figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>A major point of the paper is that IL-12 mediated CXCR3 downregulation can be dissociated temporally from its effects on KLRG1 upregulation. However, this doesn't really come through in the data presented. A kinetic study of CXCR3 expression on the F1-F4 CD8<sup>+</sup> cells (as they do for KLRG1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) would be helpful.</p><p>Another important focus of the paper is defining the CD8 differentiative events occurring in the red pulp. Whether a given cell is present or not in the red pulp is based largely upon whether the cell binds anti-CD8 Ab after brief in vivo pulse. The immunohistochemistry shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> which would validate these results is unclear and needs improvement.</p><p>In the authors' model, they speculate that early IL-12 is provided by CD8α<sup>+</sup> DC, and later on in the red pulp region by other myeloid cell types. This would be important to establish. Similarly, they suggest several candidate cell types that could supply IFN-γ for IL-12 independent cell autonomous effects based upon observational data, without actually identifying the functionally important cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Shah et al. examine the regulation of KLRG1 and CXCR3 on effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations following T. gondii vaccination. Interestingly, they find CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell intrinsic and extrinsic roles for IL-12 in regulating KLRG1/IFN-γ and CXCR3 expression, respectively. Moreover, they correlate the activity of IL-12 to the red pulp area of the spleen largely and this was also the location they observed the most cell proliferation (as determined by EdU incorporation). This is a well thought out and experimentally well executed manuscript, which addresses a timely matter in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell biology. A few key experiments might significantly enhance the quality of this manuscript and strengthen the author's conclusions.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: After the tetramer-enrichment, especially at the early time-points (prior to day 3), have the authors included other activation markers such as CD44, CD11a, CD25, and/or CD69 to ensure that the F1 population (CD62L+ KLRG1-) is truly a ‘Tcm’ population and not the naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell population, which would have the same CD62L and KLRG1 expression pattern?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: The expression of CXCR3 early by activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell being IL12-independent but Tbx21(T-bet)-dependent is very interesting? Have the authors looked at other factors that drive T-bet, such as IL-27? This would be very interesting to examine. But definitely should be discussed more thoroughly in the manuscript.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>: In vivo do IFN-γ receptor deficient CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have altered CXCR3 regulation like is suggested by the in vitro experiments present in this figure.

Because of these advantages, the usage and acceptance for this technique is on the rise, as reflected by the recent review in Nature Protocols (9:209, 2014) by David Masopust, Dan Barber and colleagues. The immunohistochemistry images we provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1</xref> simply confirm that extrafollicular proliferation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells does in fact occur, and further provide anatomical detail on in which subregions of the spleen these proliferative events occur. To improve the visualization, we increased the image brightness while decreasing contrast. An unwanted effect is the increase in “background” iv anti-CD8 staining in the white pulp, which we can readily distinguish from the true signal emanating from anti-CD8 staining of extrafollicular T cells because the distinctive punctate staining pattern on the cell surface. This punctate pattern may arise from capping during the intervening time between injection, sacrifice and processing for immunohistochemistry. (Should this reviewer desire, we can provide a panel showing the individual channels for the IHC staining we used to produce the merged image we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.)</p><p>It is important to note that our manuscript is the first direct evidence of T cell proliferation occurring outside of the white pulp. Mostly immunologists have been taught and think that T cell activation and proliferation occur within the periarteriolar region. Clearly, additional efforts have to made in future studies to further document and understand this phenomenon.</p><p><italic>In the authors' model, they speculate that early IL-12 is provided by CD8a DC, and later on in the red pulp region by other myeloid cell types. This would be important to establish. Similarly, they suggest several candidate cell types that could supply IFN-g for IL-12 independent cell autonomous effects based upon observational data, without actually identifying the functionally important cells</italic>.</p><p>In response to this, we have further characterized the IL-12 producing myeloid DCs as being CCR2+, suggesting inflammatory monocytes are their origin. We further transiently depleted CCR2+ cells and show that such treatment recapitulates many facets of late IL-12 depletion, including loss of KLRG1+ cells and an attenuation in the down-regulation of CXCR3 expression.
