In the zebrafish, mutation of <italic>adgrg6</italic> also results in defects in the inner ear: otic tissue fails to down-regulate <italic>versican</italic> gene expression and morphogenesis is disrupted. We have designed a whole-animal screen that tests for rescue of both up- and down-regulated gene expression in mutant embryos, together with analysis of weak and strong alleles. From a screen of 3120 structurally diverse compounds, we have identified 68 that reduce <italic>versican b</italic> expression in the <italic>adgrg6</italic> mutant ear, 41 of which also restore <italic>myelin basic protein</italic> gene expression in Schwann cells of mutant embryos. Nineteen compounds unable to rescue a strong <italic>adgrg6</italic> allele provide candidates for molecules that may interact directly with the Adgrg6 receptor. Our pipeline provides a powerful approach for identifying compounds that modulate GPCR activity, with potential impact for future drug design.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adgrg6 (Gpr126) is an adhesion (B2) class G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) with conserved roles in myelination of the vertebrate peripheral nervous system (PNS) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Langenhan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Patra et al., 2014</xref>). In homozygous loss-of-function <italic>adgrg6</italic> zebrafish and mouse mutants, peripheral myelination is severely impaired: Schwann cells associate with axons, but are unable to generate the myelin sheath, and show reduced expression of the <italic>myelin basic protein</italic> (<italic>mbp</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glenn and Talbot, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mogha et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Monk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Monk et al., 2011</xref>). Targeted disruption of <italic>Adgrg6</italic> in the mouse results in additional abnormal phenotypes, including limb and cardiac abnormalities, axon degeneration and embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Monk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Patra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Waller-Evans et al., 2010</xref>). In humans, mutations in <italic>ADGRG6</italic> are causative for congenital contracture syndrome 9, a severe type of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ravenscroft et al., 2015</xref>). Peripheral nerves from affected individuals have reduced expression of myelin basic protein, suggesting that the function of ADGRG6 in myelination is evolutionarily conserved from teleosts to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ravenscroft et al., 2015</xref>). Human <italic>ADGRG6</italic> variants have also been proposed to underlie some paediatric musculoskeletal disorders, including adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karner et al., 2015</xref>) (and references within).</p><p>In zebrafish, homozygous loss-of-function <italic>adgrg6</italic> mutants exhibit an inner ear defect in addition to deficiencies in myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Monk et al., 2009</xref>). In the otic vesicle, the epithelial projections that prefigure formation of the semicircular canal ducts overgrow and fail to fuse, resulting in morphological defects and ear swelling. Analysis of the zebrafish <italic>adgrg6</italic> mutant ear shows a dramatic alteration in the expression of genes coding for several extracellular matrix (ECM) components and ECM-modifying enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geng et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Notably, transcripts coding for core proteins of the chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan Versican, normally transiently expressed in the outgrowing projections and then down-regulated once projection fusion has occurred, remain highly expressed in the overgrown and unfused projections of <italic>adgrg6</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geng et al., 2013</xref>). Although <italic>Adgrg6</italic> (<italic>Gpr126</italic>) mRNA is known to be expressed in the mouse ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Patra et al., 2013</xref>), a role in otic development in the mammal has yet to be determined.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44889.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of <italic>adgrg6</italic> mutant allele phenotypes in the inner ear and peripheral nervous system.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (i–iii) Live images of 4 dpf otic vesicles, lateral view.

The ECD includes a GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, which incorporates the GPCR proteolytic site (GPS) and the conserved Stachel sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liebscher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Patra et al., 2014</xref>). Proteolysis at the GPS results in two fragments, an N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a C-terminal fragment (CTF), which can remain associated with one another, or may dissociate, the NTF binding to cell surface or extracellular matrix ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Patra et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Petersen et al., 2015</xref>). Dissociation of the NTF triggers binding of the Stachel sequence to the 7TM domain, thereby activating the CTF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liebscher et al., 2014</xref>). This feature provides a variety of CTF-dependent or -independent signalling capabilities that orchestrate cell adhesion and other cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. For example, during Schwann cell development and terminal differentiation, the Adgrg6 NTF promotes radial sorting of axons, whereas the CTF is thought to signal through a stimulatory Gα subunit (Gα<sub>s</sub>), leading to elevated cAMP levels and activated protein kinase A (PKA) to induce transcription of downstream target genes, such as <italic>egr2</italic> and <italic>oct6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Petersen et al., 2015</xref>). Compounds that act to raise intracellular cAMP levels, such as the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin, can rescue phenotypic defects in both the inner ear and PNS in <italic>adgrg6</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Monk et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Despite the enormous importance of GPCRs as drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hauser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sriram and Insel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wootten et al., 2018</xref>), adhesion class GPCRs remain poorly characterised, representing a valuable untapped resource as targets of future therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Monk et al., 2015</xref>). The identification of specific modulators of aGPCR activity is an essential step for understanding the mechanism of aGPCR function and to inform the design of new drugs. Recent successful approaches include the use of Stachel sequence peptides as aGPCR agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Demberg et al., 2017</xref>), or synthetic monobodies directed against domains within the NTF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Salzman et al., 2017</xref>). A promising alternative approach lies in the potential of unbiased whole-animal screening of small molecules. In recent years, zebrafish have emerged as an important tool for in vivo phenotypic screening for new therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brady et al., 2016</xref>) and for understanding biological mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baxendale et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Richter et al., 2017</xref>). Zebrafish have many advantages for drug discovery: they are a vertebrate species whose embryos can fit into individual wells of a multiwell plate, facilitating high-throughput analysis; they generate large numbers of offspring; they can absorb compounds directly added to the water, and whole-organism screening enables toxicity, absorption, metabolism and excretion of compounds to be assayed early in the screening pipeline.</p><p>To date, over one hundred drug screens using different zebrafish disease models have been conducted, some identifying lead compounds that have subsequently been tested in mammalian model systems or entered clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chowdhury et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Griffin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">North et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Owens et al., 2008</xref>) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baxendale et al., 2017</xref>). Two screens have been performed to identify compounds that promote myelination in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buckley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Early et al., 2018</xref>). These studies used live imaging of <italic>Tg(olig2:GFP)</italic> or <italic>Tg(mbp:eGFP)</italic> fluorescent transgenic lines to screen for small molecules that increase progenitor or myelinating oligodendrocyte cell number. While elegant in design, and successful in identifying hit compounds, these screens required the use of sophisticated and costly high-resolution imaging platforms and relied on detailed quantitative assays for cell number, techniques that are not available to all labs and are potentially limiting in scalability and throughput.</p><p>In this study, we have developed an in vivo drug screening assay based on semi-automated in situ hybridisation (ISH) to identify modulators of the Adgrg6 pathway. We have used the otic expression of <italic>versican b (vcanb)</italic> as an easily-scored qualitative readout to identify compounds that can reduce <italic>vcanb</italic> overexpression back to normal levels in a hypomorphic mutant allele for <italic>adgrg6</italic>, <italic>tb233c</italic>. We used expression of <italic>mbp</italic> in the posterior lateral line ganglion of <italic>adgrg6<sup>tb233c</sup></italic> mutants as a secondary screening assay, with the aim of identifying chemical classes capable of rescuing the expression of both genes, which may thus represent agonists of the Adgrg6 signalling pathway. To identify ligands that potentially bind directly to Adgrg6, we then tested hit compounds for their ability to rescue a strong loss-of-function <italic>adgrg6</italic> allele, <italic>fr24</italic>, which predicts a severely truncated protein. Several compounds were unable to rescue <italic>adgrg6<sup>fr24</sup></italic> mutants, including a group with similar structures from the gedunin family of compounds. Compounds able to rescue both alleles include colforsin, a known activator of adenylyl cyclase, demonstrating proof-of-principle that our screen can identify compounds that restore GPCR pathway activity downstream of the receptor. These alternative assays for both down-regulation and up-regulation of gene expression, combined with a comparison of rescue in both weak and strong alleles, have facilitated selection of a strong cohort of hit compounds that can be differentiated by the different screens used. Our approach is scalable and can be used to screen additional compound collections. In parallel, chemoinformatics analysis of the compound libraries and identified hits has enabled classification and prioritisation of selected hit compounds.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Choice of markers for an in situ hybridisation-based screen: otic <italic>vcanb</italic> expression as a robust readout</title><p>We set out to develop a simple assay to identify small molecule modifiers of the Adgrg6 pathway that can be used both to understand Adgrg6 function and to identify compounds that could inform the design of therapeutics. To this end, we chose to perform a drug screen based on in situ hybridisation (ISH), which has the advantage of being a simple, reproducible assay that can be semi-automated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baxendale et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">North et al., 2007</xref>). We selected <italic>vcanb</italic> expression in the <italic>adgrg6</italic> mutant ear for our primary screen. <italic>vcanb</italic> has a number of advantages for screening, including highly localised expression in the otic vesicle, very strong and reproducible staining intensity in <italic>adgrg6</italic> mutant embryos, and a clear difference between staining in mutant and wild-type embryos at the stage chosen, making it ideal for manual scoring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We therefore developed a primary screen seeking compounds that can reduce <italic>vcanb</italic> levels in <italic>adgrg6</italic> mutant embryos and rescue the mutant phenotype. We reasoned that, in addition to yielding information for the ear phenotype, compounds that can rescue <italic>vcanb</italic> expression may also rescue myelination defects in the PNS, where expression patterns of genetic markers are more complex and defects are harder to score.</p><p>We first made a careful comparison of the otic and PNS defects in weak (<italic>tb233c</italic>) and strong (<italic>fr24</italic>) alleles for the <italic>adgrg6</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The <italic>tb233c</italic> allele is a missense mutation (I963N) in the fourth transmembrane domain of the receptor, whereas the <italic>fr24</italic> allele is a nonsense mutation (L463X), predicting a severely truncated protein lacking the hormone-binding, GAIN, 7TM and C-terminal domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geng et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Mutants for both <italic>tb233c</italic> and <italic>fr24</italic> alleles have the same defect in semicircular canal formation: otic epithelial projections are enlarged, overgrow, and fail to fuse to form the three pillars that create the hubs of the semicircular canal ducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geng et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Time-lapse imaging using light-sheet microscopy reveals the dynamics of this process: even when projections make contact with each other, they fail to adhere as in the wild type. Instead, projections in the mutant ear continue to grow, roll around one another as they find space with least resistance, and fill the otic vesicle with semicircular canal projection tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). In wild-type ears, <italic>vcanb</italic> is expressed in the growing semicircular canal projections between 44 and 72 hr post fertilisation (hpf), but is then strongly down-regulated after fusion; by 4 days post fertilisation (dpf), very little expression is detectable in the ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geng et al., 2013</xref>). By contrast, in <italic>adgrg6</italic> mutants, the overgrown and unfused projections in the developing ear continue to express <italic>vcanb</italic> at high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geng et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both alleles show a dramatically increased level of expression over wild-type embryos, but the increase is stronger in the <italic>fr24</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). mRNA for <italic>adgrg6</italic> itself is expressed in the otic vesicle of mutant embryos for both alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geng et al., 2013</xref>) (and unpublished data), but it is not known whether a truncated protein including the CUB and PTX domains is produced in the <italic>fr24</italic> allele.

The Tocriscreen Total library (‘Tocris’) consists of 1120 compounds representing known bioactive compounds with diverse structures. The Spectrum Collection (‘Spectrum’; Microsource Discovery Systems) comprises 2000 compounds, including FDA-approved drugs for repurposing, bioactive compounds and natural products. Scaffold analysis of the two libraries highlights the structural diversity present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on Bemis-Murcko scaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bemis and Murcko, 1996</xref>), the Tocris library of 1120 compounds has 693 (62%) scaffolds representing a single compound and only two scaffolds representing more than 10 compounds. The Spectrum library has 682 scaffolds representing unique chemical structures, but as the library consists of 2000 compounds, the proportion of scaffolds represented by a single molecule (30%) is lower than for the Tocris library. Together, the two libraries cover a wide range of chemical space, with a total of 1540 scaffolds, of which 1134 represent unique compounds. Scaffold analysis not only provides a broad overview of the chemical diversity of each library, but can also be used to select and analyse groups of similar compounds with interesting structure-activity relationships. Compounds were also clustered based on their fingerprint similarity using Ward’s method of hierarchical agglomerative clustering, which was useful for visualisation purposes (for dendrograms, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Results of the primary screen for reduction of otic <italic>vcanb</italic> expression levels</title><p>To score the efficacy of the compounds in down-regulating <italic>vcanb</italic> mRNA levels, we used a scoring system from 0 to 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; for details, see the Materials and methods). In the primary screen, each compound was tested against three embryos and the score for each embryo was added to give a final score out of 9. The final scores were classified into different groups according to the thresholds shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, with the highest degree of rescue in Category A, representing a combined score no greater than 2. Completion of the primary <italic>vcanb</italic> screen for all 3120 compounds identified 92 (8%) compounds from the Tocris library and 205 (10%) from the Spectrum library that scored in categories A–C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,E</xref>). 5% of the compounds from each library were found to be either toxic (category F; dead embryos or severe developmental abnormalities) or potentially corrosive (category G; no embryos present), whereas 99 (9%) compounds from Tocris and 269 (13%) from Spectrum were found to cause incomplete or partial suppression of <italic>vcanb</italic> expression (category D). The largest category (E; 2282 compounds from both libraries, 73%), as expected, represented compounds that had no rescuing or other effect at the concentration used (25 µM). To visualise the complete set of screening results and to identify any clusters of hit compounds with similar structures, compounds were displayed as individual data points on a polar scatterplot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; interactive version at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://adlvdl.github.io/visualizations/polar_scatterplot_whitfield_vcanb.html">https://adlvdl.github.io/visualizations/polar_scatterplot_whitfield_vcanb.html</ext-link>). Compound position along the circumference of the plot for each library is based on position on the respective similarity dendrogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Data points that are clustered along radii of the plot are thus more likely to be structurally similar, although note that the juxtaposition of different branches of the dendrogram can also place compounds that differ in structure adjacent to one other. Due to the wide diversity of scaffolds found in the Tocris library, less clustering of hit compounds (A–C) can be observed compared with the molecules in the Spectrum library, where more clusters of compounds in the A–C categories are evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44889.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>A primary drug screen identified 92 (Tocris) and 205 (Spectrum) putative hit compounds able to down-regulate <italic>vcanb</italic> mRNA expression in <italic>adgrg6<sup>tb233c</sup></italic> mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scoring system used to assess <italic>vcanb</italic> mRNA expression levels in the inner ear of <italic>adgrg6<sup>tb233c</sup></italic> embryos after treatment.

A third class of compounds down-regulated both <italic>vcanb</italic> and <italic>mbp</italic> (score 0–1.5) and were not followed further.

Wedges on the scatter plot delineate the two clusters of compounds with similar structures for which some hits were followed up in further analysis (see text). The positions of IBMX (I) and colforsin (C) are indicated (red arrowheads). (<bold>G</bold>) Overview of the hit selection process. The length of the horizontal bars is proportional to the number of hit compounds taken through to each stage. Data for the Tocris library are on the left-hand side; data for the Spectrum library are on the right-hand side. The proportion of compounds in hit categories A, B and C are shown using the same colour scheme as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, with the top bar representing the number of hits from the primary screen listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. The second bar shows the number of compounds that were cherry-picked. The average scores from nine embryos (after retests) is shown in the third bar. Note that some compounds will change category after the retests and the number of category C compounds is increased. Any compounds that failed to rescue in any single retest were also not taken forward (fourth bar). The <italic>mbp</italic> data (<bold>E</bold>) are represented in the fifth and sixth bars. The final bar represents the compounds that were unable to rescue the strong <italic>fr24</italic> allele. The total number of compounds at each stage is shown in the centre. Asterisks denote numbers that do not include duplicate compounds.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig4sdata1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44889.014</object-id><label>Figure 4—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Source data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>.</title><p>Dendrogram representing structural similarity between library compounds (Combined). Dendrogram of the combined Spectrum and Tocriscreen Total library compounds based on the similarity matrix between all pairs of compounds.

These included all the top hit compounds that scored A or B, and a selection of compounds from the lower-scoring C category (see Materials and methods). Specifically, 83 out of the 92 possible hit compounds from the Tocris library and 145 of the 205 possible hits from the Spectrum library were retested twice, again with three embryos per well. By increasing the number of embryos screened to a total of nine per compound, we aimed to eliminate any false-positive hits that had an increased average score over these two retests or did not show a clear rescue (score &gt;7) in any individual test. In total, 91 compounds from the combined list of hits (29 from Tocris, 62 from Spectrum) that showed consistent rescue of <italic>vcanb</italic> expression across the retests were taken forward for secondary assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p>To provide further validation for the hits identified in the primary screen, we used two approaches. Firstly, we compared the results of our control compounds to those of similar compounds present in the screened compound libraries. The control compound IBMX, a non-selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, is present in the Spectrum library and was identified as a hit in the primary screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The most similar compound to IBMX from both libraries is 8-methoxymethyl-3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (MMPX), a selective PDE-1 inhibitor. MMPX is present in the Tocris library, but was not identified as a hit in our screen, most likely due to its selectivity. In previous work we also used forskolin to raise cAMP levels and rescue the <italic>adgrg6</italic> ear phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geng et al., 2013</xref>), but forskolin requires different assay conditions with short drug incubation times to avoid toxicity. Forskolin is represented in the Tocris library, but was toxic in our screening assay. The Spectrum Collection contains two forskolin-related compounds, colforsin and desacetylcolforsin. Colforsin, a water-soluble derivative of forskolin, was identified as a hit in the primary screen, and retested positive in all subsequent tests (see also below); it appeared to be less toxic than forskolin, whereas desacetylcolforsin was toxic at the concentration used. The identification of both IBMX and colforsin as hits in the primary screen confirmed that the assay conditions used were efficient at detecting expected hit compounds.</p><p>Secondly, we compared the scores for all compounds that were duplicated in both compound libraries. Chemoinformatics analysis of the Tocris and Spectrum libraries identified 155 compounds represented in both libraries, 65% of which (100/155) had exactly the same <italic>vcanb</italic> score average from the two individual screens. 39 (25%) of the 155 duplicate compounds yielded a <italic>vcanb</italic> score average that differed by 1–2 units between the two libraries; 12 (8%) of the compounds yielded a <italic>vcanb</italic> score average that differed by 3–6 units, whereas only 4 (3%) compounds had a score average that differed by 7–9 units. In summary, 90% (139/155) of the compounds common to both libraries showed similar scores for the <italic>vcanb</italic> assay from each library (scores differing by ≤2 units), whereas 10% (16/155) of the compounds resulted in differing levels of <italic>vcanb</italic> down-regulation between the two different libraries. After retesting, the difference between the two <italic>vcanb</italic> score averages for nine of these compounds was reduced; however, for seven compounds, the scores between the two libraries remained significantly different. These discrepancies could be either due to differences in compound purity between the two suppliers, or could be due to experimental error (e.g. in the concentration used, or during the ISH protocol). In cases where the same compound was scored as toxic in one assay and not in another, the health condition of the embryos in a particular well could be the underlying reason. Duplicated compounds have been included in the data for each library in the polar scatter plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).</p><p>The top 91 hit compounds from both libraries (29 from Tocris, 62 from Spectrum) that scored A–C in all three <italic>vcanb</italic> assays were combined to give a complete list of 89 unique compounds, with baicalein and gedunin present in both libraries. The list covers a wide spectrum of naturally-derived and synthetic molecules, with known and unknown functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The hit compounds with known functions include calcium channel blockers, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antihyperlipidemic, antibacterial and anthelmintic agents, as well as compounds with known antineoplastic and vasodilatory properties.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Secondary screen for rescue of <italic>mbp</italic> expression, and identification of false positives</title><p>The two retests for <italic>vcanb</italic> expression significantly reduced the possibility of false-positive results due to experimental error (e.g. in the ISH protocol), but the list of hits could still contain false-positive compounds that may generally inhibit transcription. In order to eliminate such compounds, we exploited the expression of <italic>mbp</italic> as a secondary screening assay, scoring for rescue of expression around the posterior lateral line ganglion (PLLg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; Materials and methods). This counter screen has the advantage of assessing for up-regulation (restoration) of <italic>mbp</italic> expression in mutant embryos, in contrast to the down-regulation of <italic>vcanb</italic> expression in the primary screen. All compounds that passed the first retest for <italic>vcanb</italic> (89 compounds in total) were subjected to this secondary assay for <italic>mbp</italic> expression. We used the same assay format and treatment time window as for <italic>vcanb</italic>, as we had previously found that treatment with IBMX between 60 and 90 hpf was also able to rescue <italic>mbp</italic> expression in <italic>adgrg6</italic> mutants (not shown).</p><p>Following two experimental repeats (<italic>n</italic> = 6 fish tested per drug), compounds were categorised into groups based on their average <italic>mbp</italic> score. These included groups of compounds that showed rescue of the mutant phenotype (an increase of <italic>mbp</italic> expression, specifically around the PLLg); no rescue (<italic>mbp</italic> expression equivalent to that in untreated <italic>adgrg6<sup>tb233c</sup></italic> mutants), and those that resulted in a decrease in <italic>mbp</italic> expression, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. We identified 41 compounds (12 from Tocris, 29 from Spectrum) that rescued <italic>mbp</italic> expression and thus represent possible modulators of Adgrg6 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Twenty-eight hit compounds (15 from Tocris, 13 from Spectrum) strongly down-regulated <italic>vcanb</italic> expression but did not affect <italic>mbp</italic> expression in <italic>adgrg6<sup>tb233c</sup></italic> mutants. These could represent compounds that can rescue <italic>vcanb</italic> expression in an inner ear-specific or Adgrg6-independent manner. Alternatively, as all the assays were carried out at a single concentration (25 μM), it is possible that some or all of these compounds could rescue <italic>mbp</italic> expression at a higher concentration (as is the case for IBMX with the <italic>fr24</italic> allele). The 28 members of this group are structurally and functionally diverse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Finally, 22 compounds (two from Tocris, 20 from Spectrum) reduced the expression of both <italic>vcanb</italic> and <italic>mbp.</italic> This latter group—potential false positives in the <italic>vcanb</italic> assay—could represent general inhibitors of transcription or development, and were excluded from further analysis, resulting in a final list of 68 hit compounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Two dihydropyridines, nifedipine and cilnidipine, were chosen from cluster 1.

Nilvadipine, nemadipine-A, felodipine and lercanidipine are all dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers of the type used to treat hypertension. Nilvadipine is structurally closely related to nifedipine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>); as predicted, it gave a dose-responsive rescue of otic <italic>vcanb</italic>, with full rescue at 50.6 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Cvii</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), and a strong rescue of <italic>mbp</italic> expression at 22.5 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Cxiv</xref>).

All compounds tested from cluster one share a large common substructure composed of a pyridine ring and its five substitutions (one phenyl ring, two ester groups, and two methyl groups). Felodipine and nemadipine-A both have several halogen atoms bound to the phenyl ring, whereas on most of the other compounds a nitro group is bound to the phenyl ring. The main difference between the dihydropyridine structures comes from the variety of different esters attached to the pyridine ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Nifedipine, cilnidipine, tracazolate hydrochloride and FPL 64176 rescue otic defects in <italic>adgrg6<sup>tb233c</sup></italic> mutants in a dose-dependent manner</title><p>The four compounds shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> were also selected for dose-response assessment, by exposing <italic>adgrg6<sup>tb233c</sup></italic> embryos to concentrations ranging from 0.3 μM to 222.2 μM between 60–110 hpf.

On the other hand, hits that rescued <italic>tb233c</italic>, but were not able to rescue <italic>fr24,</italic> could potentially act as putative agonistic ligands for the Adgrg6 receptor. Of the 41 hit compounds able to rescue both <italic>vcanb</italic> and <italic>mbp</italic> in the <italic>tb233c</italic> allele, we identified 10 compounds that also rescued <italic>vcanb</italic> expression in the <italic>fr24</italic> screen (score sum 0–7 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, yellow), 12 compounds that gave a partial or inconclusive rescue (white), and 19 compounds that did not affect <italic>vcanb</italic> expression in the <italic>fr24</italic> screen (score sum nine in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, grey). The first group (yellow) are presumed to act downstream of the Adgrg6 receptor, and include colforsin, which tested positive in all assays and is a known activator of adenylyl cyclase, supporting this interpretation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The last class (grey) are of particular interest as they represent candidates for molecules that may interact directly with the receptor. Examples of the difference in ability to rescue the two <italic>adgrg6</italic> alleles between the two classes can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>.</p><p>Interestingly, four of the 19 compounds in the last group are in the cluster of gedunin derivatives identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (cluster 2), with deoxygedunin being one of the top ten most potent drugs able to rescue the <italic>tb233c</italic> allele. The compound network shows that 38 compounds with structural similarity to the gedunins are represented in the two libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). In the primary screens, 25/38 (66%) gedunin-related compounds affected <italic>vcanb</italic> expression to some extent (18 compounds in categories A–C and seven in D), nine compounds were inactive and four were toxic. The majority of the gedunin-related compounds that passed both rounds of retesting were later found also to rescue <italic>mbp</italic> expression (8/10, 80%). The shared structural characteristics of the gedunin group may give useful clues for candidate structures of agonistic ligands for Adgrg6. In summary, our study demonstrates a novel screening approach which, when combined with chemoinformatics analysis, is able to delineate both expected downstream rescuers of the Adgrg6 pathway and several candidates for drugs that may interact directly with the Adgrg6 receptor.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Adhesion GPCRs are critical regulators of development and disease, driving cell-cell and cell-ECM communications to elicit internal responses to extrinsic cues. This study set out to identify positive modulators of the Adgrg6 signalling pathway, a key regulator of myelination and inner ear development in the zebrafish embryo. Use of a whole-animal phenotypic (mutant rescue) screen gave the potential to identify compounds affecting the entire Adgrg6 pathway in the correct cellular context. We have used a simple in situ hybridisation approach to assay <italic>vcanb</italic> expression in the inner ear of <italic>adgrg6</italic> mutants, exploiting an easily identifiable phenotype that could be scored manually. Following our primary screen of 3120 small molecules, we tested 89 hit compounds in a counter screen for rescue of the myelination defect in <italic>adgrg6</italic> mutant embryos. We identified 41 compounds that can both rescue <italic>vcanb</italic> expression in the inner ear and <italic>mbp</italic> expression in Schwann cells of <italic>adgrg6</italic> hypomorphic mutants, suggesting these are Adgrg6 pathway-specific modulators. Further analysis of a strong <italic>adgrg6</italic> allele, <italic>fr24</italic>, identified a subset of 19 compounds that are potential direct interactors of the Adgrg6 receptor. This analysis, combined with chemoinformatics analysis of the identified hit compounds, has identified clusters of compounds acting at different levels of the Adgrg6 pathway.</p><p>An optimal drug screening assay design identifies the maximum number of hit compounds with the minimum number of false positives and false negatives. Chemical screening assays using zebrafish range from simple morphology screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yu et al., 2008</xref>) through to high-tech, automated methods for quantitative image analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Early et al., 2018</xref>) or behavioural analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bruni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rennekamp et al., 2016</xref>) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kalueff et al., 2016</xref>). We used an in situ hybridisation screen to analyse gene expression changes, as this has the advantages of being scalable to different sized projects and relatively inexpensive to perform—with results that are stable and reproducible. Spatial resolution of staining patterns can be accurately scored: expression pattern screens have recently been used to identify small molecules that can induce subtle differences in gene expression domains along the pronephros (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Poureetezadi et al., 2016</xref>) and in the somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Richter et al., 2017</xref>). Although quantification of gene expression levels is less reliable with an enzymatic reaction compared with a fluorescent signal, we utilised the strong contrast between the high <italic>vcanb</italic> expression in the ear of <italic>adgrg6</italic> mutant fish compared with the low expression in a small dorsal region of the wild-type ear at four dpf to produce a robust scoring system for our phenotype rescue.</p><p>Relatively few zebrafish screens have been undertaken to identify compounds that can increase myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buckley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Early et al., 2018</xref>) or restore myelination in neuropathy models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zada et al., 2016</xref>), which is in part due to the complex distribution of glial cells in both the CNS and PNS. Performing the primary screen using an ear marker, <italic>vcanb</italic>, enabled us to bypass the difficulties of scoring and quantification of <italic>mbp</italic> staining on a large scale; instead, <italic>mbp</italic> expression was used as a counter screen on a limited number of cherry-picked hits. Contrary to the primary assays, which screened for down-regulation of <italic>vcanb</italic> expression, the counter screen assayed for up-regulation of <italic>mbp</italic> expression, enabling the identification of 21 false-positive compounds that down-regulate the expression of both genes (presumably by inhibiting transcription).</p><p>Determining the false-negative rate for any screen is difficult. In our assay we used only one concentration of compound (25 µM), so it is likely that some of the compounds that were toxic or showed no effect at 25 µM—and thus eliminated from our screen—would be effective at lower or higher concentrations, respectively. One possibility would be to run a parallel screen at a lower or higher concentration or use an alternative protocol with shorter incubation times, an approach that has recently proved successful at identifying different compounds influencing segmentation in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Richter et al., 2017</xref>). Here, the compounds were found to be most active in the range of 10–50 µM, supporting our choice of 25 µM for the primary screen. However, increasing the number of replicates with different drug concentrations or assay conditions has significant implications on the cost and time taken to complete the screen, reducing the number of compounds analysed and the potential hits identified. An alternative method is to use a structural network to select and prioritise candidate compounds that have a similar structure to hit compounds and test these at different concentrations. Using this approach, we identified (±)-Bay K 8644 as an additional hit from the pyridine cluster when tested at a higher concentration. Our minimum estimate for the false-negative rate is 5%, based on the seven compounds (out of a total of 155) that were duplicated in both libraries and had a significantly different score after retesting, being classified as a hit in one library but not in the other. It is possible that this is due to differences in chemical purity from the different suppliers. Other false-negative compounds could include those that are unable to penetrate into the ear. Neomycin, for example, is toxic to the superficial hair cells of the lateral line system, but is ineffective on inner ear hair cells unless microinjected into the ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buck et al., 2012</xref>). Other compounds that we will have missed could include myelination-specific compounds, as the primary assay scored for the ear phenotype only. Given that several compounds were positive hits for the rescue of <italic>vcanb</italic> in the ear and negative for <italic>mbp</italic>, it is likely that tissue-specific functions of Adgrg6 are mediated through different downstream pathways or are stimulated by different ligands.</p><p>Our positive control compound, IBMX, was identified independently through our screen as a category A hit. The hit compound colforsin was found to be more potent and less toxic than the related control compound forskolin, and had the highest score in every assay, showing full rescue of the strong <italic>fr24</italic> allele. Both these observations highlight the robustness of the assay and the consistency of the scoring process. In total, the final number of hit compounds identified was similar in both the compound libraries screened, with 42 compounds identified from the Spectrum library (2.1%) and 27 compounds from the Tocris library (2.4%). These hit rates are comparable to those found in other similar screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baxendale et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vettori et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wiley et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Chemoinformatics analysis and visualisation of the results provided additional context to the identified hit compounds. The polar scatter plot displayed an initial overview of the results and allowed the identification of six different structurally-related clusters of active compounds with similar structure. The compound network focused the analysis on highly detailed similarity relationships inside each compound cluster, yielding a wealth of structure-activity relationship information that could prove very useful for any future optimisation of the identified hit compounds. Seven of the 41 hit compounds that rescued <italic>vcanb</italic> and <italic>mbp</italic> expression are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel modulators. Six of these (nifedipine, cilnidipine, nitrendipine, nimodipine, efonidipine, niguldipine) belong to the chemical group of dihydropyridines (cluster 1), and initial investigations into compounds with similar structures identified four additional compounds in this class. Several dihydropyridines are known to have neuroprotective effects in mammalian models. Nimodipine, for example, has been shown to trigger remyelination in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis and to improve repair in peripheral nerve crush injuries in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schampel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tang et al., 2015</xref>), and some compounds have shown promise at clearing toxic proteins in animal models of neurodegeneration, including felodipine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Siddiqi et al., 2019</xref>) and nilvadipine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Paris et al., 2011</xref>). As dihydropyridines have been reported to inhibit cAMP phosphodiesterases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sharma et al., 1997</xref>), protection of cAMP from degradation might be another mechanism whereby these molecules exert their ameliorating action on the <italic>adgrg6</italic> mutant phenotype.</p><p>Phenotypic screens are advantageous for assessing models of multifactorial pathological conditions, such as hereditary neuropathies and cancer (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baxendale et al., 2017</xref>). However, one of the challenges for phenotypic screening is the identification of the specific target for any hit compound, as multiple pathways and different cell types can contribute to a positive read-out in the screening assay. Our aim was to identify compounds that could potentially interact directly with the Adgrg6 receptor. We were able to separate hit compounds into different groups based on their ability to rescue otic phenotypes caused by missense (<italic>tb233c</italic>) and nonsense (<italic>fr24</italic>) mutations. In total, we found 19 hits that could rescue <italic>vcanb</italic> expression and <italic>mbp</italic> expression in the <italic>tb233c</italic> allele, but were unable to rescue the <italic>fr24</italic> allele. We hypothesise that the <italic>fr24</italic> allele is unable to produce the full-length Adgrg6 protein including the CTF, and therefore any compounds that interact directly with the receptor would not be able to rescue any CTF-dependent function in this strong allele. Further analysis will be needed to determine whether any of these compounds can bind directly to the Adgrg6 receptor, for example by assessing stimulation of cAMP and direct binding in in vitro assays. However, this approach of using a combination of null and hypomorphic alleles in zebrafish whole-organism screening with the aim of identifying target-specific compounds is particularly exciting and one that the advent of CRISPR/Cas9 technology is placed to take full advantage of, since it is now possible to generate designer mutations in the zebrafish through homology-directed repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hruscha et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hwang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Komor et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>It is of interest to note that one of the main groups of compounds identified as potential interactors of the receptor in the <italic>fr24</italic> screen is a cluster of gedunin derivatives (cluster 2). One of these compounds, deoxygedunin, has previously been identified as a TrkB agonist that has neuroprotective properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nie et al., 2015</xref>), can promote axon regeneration after nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">English et al., 2013</xref>), and, interestingly, has been found to protect the vestibular ganglion from degeneration in mice mutant for <italic>BDNF</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jang et al., 2010</xref>). More recently, gedunin derivatives, including 3-α-DOG, have been shown to act as partial agonists for the closely related aGPCR, ADGRG1 (formerly GPR56) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stoveken et al., 2018</xref>), a key regulator of myelination in both the CNS and PNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackerman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ackerman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giera et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Salzman et al., 2016</xref>). While further work will be necessary to determine if gedunin-type molecules can also bind and activate zebrafish Adgrg6 by interacting directly, these studies set a precedent for this type of interaction.</p><p>GPCRs can be modulated by the membrane lipid cholesterol, where interactions with the 7TM domain can provide plasticity for the receptors by altering their stability and structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prasanna et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, cholesterol can activate the hedgehog signalling pathway directly by binding to the extracellular domain of the GPCR Smoothened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Luchetti et al., 2016</xref>). Although cholesterol was not identified as a hit in our primary screen, we did identify two cholesterol-lowering drugs, ezetimibe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altmann et al., 2004</xref>) and rosuvastatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Istvan and Deisenhofer, 2001</xref>), as putative modulators of the Adgrg6 pathway. Whether these act by altering the activity of Adgrg6 through altering cholesterol levels remains to be determined.</p><p>In addition to the dihydropyridines (cluster 1) and the tetranortriterpenoid (gedunin-derived) compounds (cluster 2), there are also clusters of steroid hormones (danazol, hydroxyprogesterone, pregnenalone succinate, hydrocortisone hemisuccinate) and flavonoid compounds (baicalein, tangeritin, nobiletin, dimethylnobiletin, hexamethylquercetagetin). The flavonoids are a group of molecules with wide ranging activities, including anti-cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ma et al., 2015</xref>) and neuroprotective properties (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braidy et al., 2017</xref>). All four <italic>O</italic>-methylated flavonoids that rescued <italic>vcanb</italic> and <italic>mbp</italic> expression in <italic>tb233c</italic> mutants were also able to rescue <italic>fr24</italic> allele in our assay, suggesting that they act downstream of the Adgrg6 receptor.</p><p>Our screen identified 28 compounds that down-regulated <italic>vcanb</italic> expression, but did not rescue <italic>mbp</italic> expression, which may provide useful tools to manipulate semicircular canal formation in vivo. Versican and other chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are associated with a number of human pathologies; Versican overexpression has been shown to be strongly involved in inflammation, cancer progression and the development of lung disorders (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson-Sjöland et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ricciardelli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wight et al., 2017</xref>). CSPGs and hyaluronan are components of the inhibitory scar that forms at the site of injury after CNS damage, preventing axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Silver and Miller, 2004</xref>). In addition, CSPGs have been shown to inhibit the ability of oligodendrocytes to remyelinate axons, a process that is reversed by reduction of CSPG levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Keough et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pendleton et al., 2013</xref>). Whether the down-regulation of CSPGs to promote remyelination occurs via a similar mechanism to that involved in Adgrg6-regulated projection fusion remains to be determined. However, it is of interest that a key regulator of myelination, Adgrg1, has also been recently shown to reduce fibronectin deposition and inhibit cell-ECM signalling to prevent metastatic melanoma growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Millar et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our data show that <italic>vcanb</italic> expression in the <italic>adgrg6<sup>tb233c</sup></italic> mutant ear provides a robust, easy-to-use screening tool to identify drugs that target the Adgrg6 pathway. In combination with the different alleles available for <italic>adgrg6</italic> in zebrafish, this in vivo platform provides an excellent opportunity to find hit compounds that may be specific for Adgrg6 in counter screens. These may provide a starting point for the development of therapeutic approaches towards human diseases where <italic>ADGRG6</italic> or myelination is affected. We have identified groups of structurally-related compounds that can rescue <italic>adgrg6</italic> mutant defects, including those that are likely to act downstream of the Adgrg6 pathway, and others that are candidates for interacting with the Adgrg6 receptor. The chemical analysis and structural comparison of the compounds shown to be putative Adgrg6 receptor agonists will contribute to the elucidation of the physical properties responsible for ligand binding and will provide further insight on the underlying mechanism of Adgrg6 signalling.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Standard zebrafish husbandry methods were employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Westerfield, 2000</xref>).

To avoid cross-contamination from dead embryos, each wild-type (LWT) embryo was kept in a separate well of a 96-well plate. At the end of each treatment, the number of dead embryos (no heartbeat for 10 s) was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Microscopy and photography</title><p>Still images of live embryos were taken using an Olympus BX51 microscope, C3030ZOOM camera and CELLB software, and assembled with Adobe Photoshop. All micrographs are lateral views with anterior towards the left and dorsal towards the top, unless otherwise stated. For archiving, fixed and stained embryos were imaged in MultiScreen-Mesh plates containing 50% glycerol, using a Nikon AZ100 microscope with an automated stage (Prior Scientific). A compressed in-focus image was generated using the NIS-Elements Extended Depth of Focus software (Nikon).</p><p>Time-lapse imaging of live embryos was performed on a Zeiss Z.1 light-sheet microscope. <italic>adgrg6<sup>fr24</sup></italic> homozygous mutant embryos in a transgenic background (see Animals) were mounted at 60 hpf in 0.7% agarose with anaesthetic (MS-222; 160 µg/ml) and 0.003% PTU (to prevent pigment formation). Images were taken of a dorsal view of the ear every 5 min (200 <italic>z</italic>-slices, 1 µm sections). A control time-lapse of a wild-type sibling embryo (images taken at 10 min intervals) was taken on a separate day. Images were cropped and a subset of <italic>z-</italic>slices through the anterior (<italic>adgrg6<sup>fr24</sup></italic>) and posterior (phenotypically wild-type sibling) projections were used to make Maximum Intensity Projection videos of projection fusion in the wild-type sibling and the swollen projections in <italic>adgrg6<sup>fr24</sup></italic> mutant embryo. The two videos do not correspond exactly to the same developmental stage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Chemoinformatics analysis and data visualisation</title><p>Chemical structures of the library compounds represented as SMILES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Weininger, 1988</xref>) were obtained from vendor catalogues. Molecules were standardised using the wash procedure of MOE (Chemical Computing Group Inc, Molecular Operating Environment (MOE), Montréal, QC, 2011), accessed through KNIME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berthold et al., 2009</xref>). Standardised molecules were analysed using RDKit (RDKit: Open-Source Cheminformatics, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rdkit.org/">http://www.rdkit.org/</ext-link>, accessed 06 Nov. 2018) in Python (Python Software Foundation: Python language reference, version 3, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</ext-link>, accessed 06 Nov. 2018). Morgan fingerprints of radius 2 (equivalent to ECFP4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rogers and Hahn, 2010</xref>]) were computed for each compound. Compound similarity was calculated using the Tanimoto coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Willett et al., 1998</xref>) of the fingerprints using the scikit-learn library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pedregosa et al., 2011</xref>). Based on the similarity matrix between all compound pairs, a dendrogram was obtained using the SciPy library (SciPy: Open Source Scientific Tools for Python, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scipy.org/">http://www.scipy.org/</ext-link>, accessed 06 Nov. 2018). The polar scatterplot was created using the matplotlib library (printed version) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hunter, 2007</xref>) and plotly (interactive version) (Plotly Technologies Inc, Collaborative data science, Plotly, Montréal, QC, 2015). To identify duplicated molecules, the InChIKey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heller et al., 2015</xref>) was computed for each compound and all pairs of compounds were checked for identical InChIKeys. To create the compound network, the similarity matrix computed for the dendrogram was transformed into an adjacency matrix using a threshold value of 0.5; that is, compounds with a similarity value over 0.5 are connected with an edge. The network visualisation was created using Cytoscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 7 for Mac, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com">www.graphpad.com</ext-link>.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: David W Raible (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In &quot;Identification of compounds that rescue otic and myelination defects in the zebrafish <italic>adgrg6 (gpr126</italic>) mutant,&quot; Diamantopoulou, Baxendale et al., present the results of a set of screening and validation protocols that identify classes of compounds that rescue phenotypes associated with disruption to the adhesion gpcr <italic>adgrg6</italic>, aka <italic>gpr126</italic>. Disruption to <italic>gpr126</italic> in zebrafish leads to defects in inner ear morphogenesis and peripheral nerve myelination by Schwann cells. The availability of <italic>gpr126</italic> mutant alleles (missense and nonsense mutations) has allowed construction of a clever primary screen to identify regulators of mutant-related <italic>vcanb</italic> expression in the ear), and a secondary screen to identify compounds that do/don't also affect myelination. Extensive follow-up validation and categorisation has been carried out, culminating in the identification of compounds that may represent direct agonists of the aGPCR itself, which would be of great interest. In general the data are of a very high standard, the manuscript is well written, and all major claims are well substantiated by observations.</p><p>The reviewers and handling editor agreed that the major strength of this current work is as an excellent exemplar of how to execute and follow-up chemical genetic screens in zebrafish, rather than in the provision of specific insights into mechanisms of ear/glial cell biology. As such, we would encourage a revision in the Tools and Resources format. All reviewers and the handling editor agree that essential revisions outlined below should strengthen the manuscript and be achievable within the standard revision period.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Additional analyses are required related to the screen and follow-up analyses</p><p>1) The network analysis is a nice way to categorize and display the different compounds and reveal possible commonalities. A good test of whether these commonalities are related to function would be to test additional related compounds not in the original panels. This is the principal request for new experimental data.</p><p>2) The identification of 90 compounds out of 3000 (3%) seems rather high, suggesting that either the assays have a potentially high rate of false positive hits or there is the potential for nonspecific action revealed by the assays. Could the authors please comment on this?</p><p>Similarly, it would be nice if the authors provided a summary of the reproducibility of the <italic>mbp</italic> staining assay. These data are in Figure 5A, but the results appear more variable than the <italic>vcanb</italic> assay. Are there possible false-positives here?</p><p>3) The dose-response functions provide a good measure of concentration dependent activity. It would have been nice if the controls were repeated with each dose-response function (they appear to be the same data across all graphs in Figure 7C), as these would give a better representation of the reliability of the assay. It would be good if the z-prime was calculated for this assay.</p><p>4) The authors describe the similarities in results between 155 compounds found between the two libraries. It would be useful to report the statistical correlation between the two sets of scores as a measure of reliability.</p><p>A little more clarity in presentation/ writing is required in a few places throughout the manuscript.</p><p>5) Following how compounds advanced through the testing funnel is a little hard to follow. It would be good if there were a way to easily represent this such as a flow chart or other graphic. For example it is not clear how the 91 compounds were identified by the secondary screen (Figure 4). Why were only some compounds advanced for retesting (227/297 compounds)? What criteria advanced them into secondary screening? I can't see an easy way to get 91 compounds from categories in Figure 4A (I get 88 compounds from retest categories A and B).</p><p>6) The flow of paragraphs (subsection “Compounds that can rescue both inner ear and myelination defects”) is not quite right in that the first paragraph talks about selecting two groups for further analysis and then the next paragraph also mentions compounds chosen for further study. This second announcement sounds independent of the first one. Perhaps in the second paragraph the authors could state, &quot;An additional selection…&quot; or a 'third group'.</p><p>7) The authors mention that the <italic>fr24</italic> allele encodes a highly truncated protein, but I am not sure I see any evidence of this, or in the previous cited paper. One might expect, instead, that this allele would lead to nonsense mediated mRNA decay, but even if this did not occur, it is rather hard to see how the predicted protein/ peptide fragment could be presented in a physiological manner. The authors should either remove, qualify, or amend this statement.</p><p>8) It is not clear why the one screening concentration was selected? Can the authors explain, and discuss further in the context of screen design and execution.</p><p>9) In Figure 8B the use of gray lines makes it difficult to visualize the gray circles.</p><p>10) What is the significance of the yellow colors in the table shown in Figure 4A?</p><p>11) For dose-response curves, were measurements done blinded?</p><p>12) It is not clear what the two sets of graphs are in Figure 7A – are these replicates?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44889.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Additional analyses are required related to the screen and follow-up analyses</p><p>1) The network analysis is a nice way to categorize and display the different compounds and reveal possible commonalities.

To test additional related compounds, we have taken the dihydropyridine network analysed in Figure 6 as a starting point and have selected four additional dihydropyridines that are structurally related to nifedipine, but which were not represented in the Spectrum or Tocris libraries. The new compounds tested are nilvadipine, nemadipine A, felodipine and lercanidipine, which are all drugs of the type used to treat hypertension and are available from Sigma. We have tested these additional compounds in <italic>adgrg6</italic> rescue assays; encouragingly, all four can also rescue the down-regulation of otic <italic>vcanb</italic> expression in <italic>adgrg6<sup>tb233c</sup></italic> mutant embryos.</p><p>Nilvaldipine has a high structural similarity to nifedipine (Tanimoto similarity coefficient &gt;0.5), and we have modified the network in Figure 6B to show this (green circle). Nilvadipine was initially tested at 22.5 µM and showed a partial rescue of otic <italic>vcanb</italic> expression and a strong rescue of <italic>mbp</italic> expression around the posterior lateral line ganglion (new panels, Figure 6C vii, xiv). We also demonstrated a dose-dependent rescue of otic <italic>vcanb</italic> expression with higher concentrations of nilvadipine, with a reduction of expression to wild-type levels after treatment with 50.6 µM (new Figure 7—figure supplement 1).</p><p>The additional three new compounds showed a range of effects at 25 µM. Nemadipine A fully rescued otic <italic>vcanb</italic> expression, felodipine partially rescued and lercanidipine failed to rescue <italic>vcanb</italic> expression (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). We next tested if a higher drug concentration was effective for the latter two compounds. At 40 µM, felodipine still showed partial rescue of <italic>vcanb</italic> , but lercanidipine was able to rescue <italic>vcanb</italic> expression at 50 µM (Figure 7—figure supplement 1).</p><p>We also tested the Tocris compound (±)-Bay K 8644, which is included in the same network as nifedipine but did not score as a hit in the primary screen (25 µM). At a higher concentration (40 µM), we found that (±)-Bay K 8644 was now able to rescue otic <italic>vcanb</italic> expression (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). The testing of (±)-Bay K 8644 highlights how the network analysis can aid in prioritising compounds to test at alternative doses. These data are also relevant for our response to point 8 (see below).</p><p>We have described these new data in the Results (subsection “Compounds that can rescue both inner ear and myelination defects”, last two paragraphs) and have also modified the Discussion (fourth and sixth paragraphs). See also modified Figure 6, and new Figure 7—figure supplement 1. Information on the source for the additional compounds is included in the Materials and methods (subsection “Compound storage, aliquoting and administration to embryos”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The identification of 90 compounds out of 3000 (3%) seems rather high, suggesting that either the assays have a potentially high rate of false positive hits or there is the potential for nonspecific action revealed by the assays. Could the authors please comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>This point also relates to point 5 asking for further explanation of the screening funnel for how compounds were selected. To address this, we have included a new graphical summary in Figure 4G, which we hope will clarify the screening results and outline our strategy to remove false positives and those compounds with non-specific action.</p><p>To summarise, the list of 91 hit compounds included two compounds that were present in both the Spectrum and the Tocris libraries, and therefore the total number of unique compounds was 89 out of a total of 3120 compounds (or 2965 excluding all duplicates). The counter screen for up-regulation of <italic>mbp</italic> expression also identified compounds that reduced transcription of both <italic>vcanb</italic> and <italic>mbp</italic>—potential false positives—and this reduced the number of verified hits with <italic>vcanb</italic> to 68 (2.3% of 2965). This counter screen also used two independent phenotypes (ear and myelination) to identify any hits that were not specific for the Adgrg6 pathway, and this reduced the number of hit compounds that could rescue both <italic>vcanb</italic> and <italic>mbp</italic> expression to 41 (1.4%). We further tested whether compounds were unable to rescue the strong allele as potential interactors with the Adgrg6 protein and identified 19 compounds (0.6%) in this final assay.</p><p>We therefore feel that the overall hit rate for Adgrg6 modulators of (1.4%) is not higher than we would expect in comparison to published phenotypic screens. Wiley, Redfield and Zon (2017) reviewed the percentage of hits identified from a variety of drug screens in zebrafish and our hit rate is well within the range seen in other phenotypic screens (Discussion, fifth paragraph). We have now cited this study in the Discussion (fifth paragraph). It should also be taken into account that the Tocris and Spectrum libraries include known bioactives and FDA-approved drugs, which are more likely to have activity in an in vivo screen than a completely novel synthetic compound library, where the hit rate would be expected to be lower. We expect the list of hits will include compounds, like colforsin and our control compound IBMX, acting downstream of Adgrg6 signalling by increasing cAMP levels, and we would expect there to be a number of compounds with similar activity in these two libraries.</p><p>We therefore prefer to retain the higher rate of false positives after the primary screen and then use the retests and counter screens to validate hits. The screening design could be made more robust by increasing the number of embryos screened or performing multiple repeats; however, in our experience, the time and financial cost of screening in duplicate or triplicate at the primary screen stage in order to identify fewer primary hits is not cost effective and would reduce the number of compounds screened overall. This is already discussed in the text (Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, it would be nice if the authors provided a summary of the reproducibility of the mbp staining assay. These data are in Figure 5A, but the results appear more variable than the vcanb assay. Are there possible false-positives here?</p></disp-quote><p>The difference in <italic>mbp</italic> staining between wild-type and mutant embryos is highly reproducible, even when using the hypomorphic allele. Although expression in the PNS as a whole in the <italic>adgrg6<sup>tb233c</sup></italic> mutant is variable, expression around the posterior lateral line ganglion is one of the few regions that is consistently absent, as discussed in the Results (subsection “Choice of markers for an in situ hybridisation-based screen: otic <italic>vcanb</italic> expression as a robust readout”, last paragraph). To quantify this, and to illustrate the variability of <italic>mbp</italic> staining intensity around the posterior ganglion between individual wild-type embryos and <italic>adgrg6</italic> mutants, we have mounted individual embryos for imaging. In dorsally mounted embryos, it is possible to distinguish the peripheral <italic>mbp</italic> staining (decreased in mutants) from the CNS staining (unaffected in mutants). We have taken 10 <italic>adgrg6<sup>tb233c</sup></italic> mutant embryos and 10 siblings from the same in situ hybridisation experiment and analysed the left and right posterior lateral line ganglion region from each embryo. After thresholding for colour using the HSB settings in Fiji we have plotted the percentage area of <italic>mbp</italic> staining. The results show a statistically significant reduction in staining area in mutant embryos. We have included these data in a new supplementary figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><p>In the screen, some of the <italic>mbp</italic> staining results show variability between individual embryos treated with a given concentration of drug (Figure 5A), but as we are looking for up-regulation of gene expression in this assay, we would expect to have more false-negatives than false-positives at this stage. Note also that the individual mounting required for the quantitative analysis described above is not practicable for a large-scale primary screen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The dose-response functions provide a good measure of concentration dependent activity. It would have been nice if the controls were repeated with each dose-response function (they appear to be the same data across all graphs in Figure 7C), as these would give a better representation of the reliability of the assay.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify, two different dose response assays were performed in separate 96-well plates and each plate included a set of controls. One plate screened increasing doses of FPL 64176 using an optimised assay window of 60-90 hpf and the second plate had increasing doses of nifedipine, tracazolate and cilnidipine using the time window of 60-110 hpf. There are therefore two sets of controls, one for the 60-90 hpf assay and another set for the 60-110 hpf assay. The experiment was repeated for both assay plates, and so the controls contain data points from two replicates. To make this information clearer we have rearranged this figure and legend so that the FPL 64176 data including controls is on one graph (Figure 7Di) and the other three compounds, with their controls, are on a second graph (Figure 7Dii).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be good if the z-prime was calculated for this assay.</p></disp-quote><p>In general, z-prime scores are not suitable for in vivo phenotypic screens, such as this one, where the results are initially qualitative and then assigned to an arbitrary numerical scoring system, or where the sample size (<italic>n</italic>) is low. In order to have a significant z-prime score it is necessary to have well-separated distributions (large difference between the means, small standard deviations) between the positive and negative control.</p><p>Thus, instead of a z-prime score, we have used our quantitative data from the dose response assay to determine the SSMD (Strictly Standardised Mean Difference, β) for assessing assay quality. This method has been used in RNAi screens (Zhang, 2007). We used the data from Figure 7D (ear width measurements) and the SSMD formula for two independent groups,</p><p>β=μ1-μ2σ12+σ22</p><p>where µ<sub>1</sub> is the mean ear width distance of the <italic>adgrg6<sup>tb233c</sup></italic> mutants treated with DMSO (negative control) and µ<sub>2</sub> is the mean ear width distance of the <italic>adgrg6<sup>tb233c</sup></italic> mutants treated with IBMX (positive control), σ12is the variance of the negative control and σ22 is the variance of the positive control. This generated an SSMD score of 2.811 for the controls on the plate with nifedipine, cilnidipine and tracazolate, which demonstrates that this assay has a strong threshold for hit detection. Scores for the hit compounds, compared to the negative control, were also strong at the higher concentrations (nifedipine score 2.48 at 33.7 μM, cilnidipine score 4.19 at 22.5 μM and tracazolate score 3.5 at 22.5 μM). The controls for the FPL 64176 plate have a slightly lower score of 2.03 after a 24-hour treatment, compared with the 48-hour treatment on the other plate. FPL 64176 had a similar score of 2.04 at 6.7 μM. We have included all the scores in a modified Figure 7—figure supplement 2 and included the method in the statistics section of the Materials and methods (subsection “Statistical analysis”) (see also revised Figure 7—figure supplement 2—source data 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors describe the similarities in results between 155 compounds found between the two libraries. It would be useful to report the statistical correlation between the two sets of scores as a measure of reliability.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in response to point 3, our primary assay scores are not suited to statistical correlation as they are not quantitative. We had analysed the duplicated compounds in detail and had already discussed the few differences we found in the text (subsection “Validation of the primary screen: retesting, comparison with control compounds and analysis of duplicates”, third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A little more clarity in presentation/ writing is required in a few places throughout the manuscript.</p><p>5) Following how compounds advanced through the testing funnel is a little hard to follow. It would be good if there were a way to easily represent this such as a flow chart or other graphic. For example it is not clear how the 91 compounds were identified by the secondary screen (Figure 4). Why were only some compounds advanced for retesting (227/297 compounds)? What criteria advanced them into secondary screening? I can't see an easy way to get 91 compounds from categories in Figure 4A (I get 88 compounds from retest categories A and B).</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in response to point 2, we have now added further clarification of our screening funnel in the Materials and methods section and also made a new panel summarising the hit selection steps for Figure 4G. Briefly, from the primary screen, the list of hits included those in categories A–C. While we were interested in those that had the strongest rescue (A, B categories) we also wanted to determine how many compounds in category C would come through the retests as a hit. We therefore made up the cherry-pick ‘hit’ plates with extra compounds from the C category, although not all of category C compounds were retested. In addition, 10 compounds from the B category were not followed up due to a lack of compound availability in the cherry-pick plates—this is mentioned in the Materials and methods (subsection “Hit selection”). The table in the original Figure 4A confirmed that the majority of compounds from category C retested as category D (non-hit). However, we have taken the reviewers’ comments on board and have removed this table and replaced it with a schematic of the hit selection process, which we hope will be clearer for the reader. We have moved some of the details of the screening process from the Results section to the Materials and methods section. The revised text can be found in the Results (subsection “Validation of the primary screen: retesting, comparison with control compounds and 286 analysis of duplicates”, first paragraph) and Materials and methods (subsection “Hit selection”). See also the new Figure 4G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The flow of paragraphs (subsection “Compounds that can rescue both inner ear and myelination defects”) is not quite right in that the first paragraph talks about selecting two groups for further analysis and then the next paragraph also mentions compounds chosen for further study. This second announcement sounds independent of the first one. Perhaps in the second paragraph the authors could state, &quot;An additional selection…&quot; or a 'third group'.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now amended this section and moved the discussion of the heatmap to the previous section (subsection “Secondary screen for rescue of <italic>mbp</italic> expression, and identification of false positives”, last paragraph). We have also clarified which of the selected compounds were from the two groups that correspond to the clusters in Figure 4D and Figure 5B and which were chosen separately and hopefully this is now clearer (subsection “Compounds that can rescue both inner ear and myelination defects”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors mention that the fr24 allele encodes a highly truncated protein, but I am not sure I see any evidence of this, or in the previous cited paper. One might expect, instead, that this allele would lead to nonsense mediated mRNA decay, but even if this did not occur, it is rather hard to see how the predicted protein/ peptide fragment could be presented in a physiological manner. The authors should either remove, qualify, or amend this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct that we do not have any experimental evidence for the presence or absence of a truncated protein product in the <italic>fr24</italic> allele. We have been careful to explain this in the text (subsection “Choice of markers for an in situ hybridisation-based screen: otic <italic>vcanb</italic> expression as a robust readout”, second paragraph) and have checked all other references in the manuscript to <italic>fr24</italic> to remove any ambiguity. As shown in Figure 1 and in our previous study (Geng et al., 2013), the <italic>fr24</italic> allele predicts a stop codon L463X which is within the extracellular domain of the protein, N-terminal to the hormone-binding domain and GAIN domain.</p><p>Although nonsense-mediated mRNA decay is a possibility, we have previously tested the presence of the <italic>adgrg6</italic> transcript in <italic>adgrg6<sup>fr24</sup></italic> mutants by in situ hybridisation. In some regions expression is weaker, but expression in the swollen projections in the ear is strong (Geng et al., 2013). Given that some transcript is produced, it is possible that it is translated into protein. If the truncated N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–462) is expressed as protein it would contain the signal peptide needed to export the peptide and also the CUB and PTX domains. We note that another truncating <italic>adgrg6</italic> allele, <italic>st49</italic>, is known to produce a slightly larger peptide, which retains the hormone binding domain and is biologically active in vivo, being able to restore radial sorting of axons in <italic>adgrg6</italic> mutants, so there is precedent for the production of truncated Adgrg6 peptides (Petersen et al., 2015). This is now discussed in the aforementioned paragraph.</p><p>However, the purpose of using the <italic>fr24</italic> allele in the current study is to distinguish between compounds that can activate downstream signalling of the Adgrg6 pathway (which are active whether the Adgrg6 protein is present or not) and those that potentially interact with the Adgrg6 protein (active in the weaker <italic>adgrg6<sup>tb233c</sup></italic> allele; inactive in <italic>fr24</italic>). In the latter case, even if an N-terminal peptide is produced and is active in <italic>fr24</italic> mutants, the mutation predicts that the transmembrane domain necessary for G protein coupling to activate downstream signalling will be missing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It is not clear why the one screening concentration was selected? Can the authors explain, and discuss further in the context of screen design and execution.</p></disp-quote><p>The choice of compound concentration for screening is always a compromise between efficacy and toxicity. The concentration 25 μM was chosen empirically after analysing results from previous screens performed at both 10 μM (Baxendale et al., 2012) and 25 μM (pilot data from another screen, unpublished). These data suggested that the number of toxic compounds did not increase significantly at the higher concentration. 25 μM is within the range frequently used in zebrafish assays (Richter et al., 2017; Wiley et al., 2017). This is discussed in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>As highlighted in our response to point 1, the new Figure 7—figure supplement 1 now includes a panel of dihydropyridine compounds that were only partially active in the assay at 25 μM, but were active at higher concentrations of 40 or 50 μM. Lowering the concentration in the primary screen to 10 μM would have resulted in more hit compounds being missed, including nifedipine, based on our dose-response data in Figure 7B. Screening the compounds in duplicate with two different concentrations would have reduced the overall number of compounds we could screen, taking in to account the number of embryos available and the cost of other reagents. One potential compromise would be to take all the compounds that proved to be toxic at 25 μM and re-screen these cherry-picked compounds at a lower concentration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In Figure 8B the use of gray lines makes it difficult to visualize the gray circles.</p></disp-quote><p>The colour of the lines has been modified to make the network easier to visualise in Figures 6, 8 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1. The entire network is also available as an interactive version, where individual networks can be enlarged to aid visualisation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) What is the significance of the yellow colors in the table shown in Figure 4A?</p></disp-quote><p>The yellow colours in the previous Figure 4A highlighted the categories with the highest numbers of hit compounds after retesting. However, after consideration of the reviewers’ points 2 and 5 we have decided to remove this table and have replaced it with a schematic of the hit selection process that also still includes the numbers of compounds in each category at each stage (Figure 4G). See also our response to point 5 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) For dose-response curves, were measurements done blinded?</p></disp-quote><p>The ear measurements from the ear swelling dose response assays were not done blinded. In general, all plates were scored twice and by two different scorers. For the dose-response assay the reviewer refers to, the in situ hybridisation results for the <italic>vcanb</italic> staining were still available; we went back to the original plates and re-ordered them to do a retrospective blinded score. Here, we found the same overall trends as shown in Figure 7, with only a marginal difference between the intermediate dose scores, while the scores for the ‘rescued’ and ‘not rescued’ were the same in both cases. We have not amended the data in Figure 7B but have mentioned our method of scoring in the Materials and methods (subsection “Whole-mount in situ hybridisation analysis of gene expression”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) It is not clear what the two sets of graphs are in Figure 7A – are these replicates?</p></disp-quote><p>The two sets of graphs record different measurements, but were scored on the same set of embryos. We have now made these two panels separate to make this clearer. The first panel (Figure 7A) is scored for the number of projections that have fused to form a pillar (i.e. morphological rescue of the inner ear defect, not just reduced <italic>vcanb</italic> expression). Figure 7B shows the overall score of the <italic>vcanb</italic> staining as defined in Figure 3A. We have modified the figure legend to make this clearer and explanation in the text is found in the first paragraph of the subsection “Nifedipine, cilnidipine, tracazolate hydrochloride and FPL 64176 rescue otic defects in <italic>adgrg6<sup>tb233c</sup></italic>mutants in a dose-dependent manner”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
