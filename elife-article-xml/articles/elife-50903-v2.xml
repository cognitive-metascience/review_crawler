endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are retrotranslocated into the cytosol and polyubiquitinated before being degraded by the proteasome. The multi-spanning ubiquitin ligase Hrd1 forms the retrotranslocation channel and associates with three other membrane proteins (Hrd3, Usa1, Der1) of poorly defined function. The Hrd1 channel is gated by autoubiquitination, but how Hrd1 escapes degradation by the proteasome and returns to its inactive ground state is unknown. Here, we show that autoubiquitination of Hrd1 is counteracted by Ubp1, a deubiquitinating enzyme that requires its N-terminal transmembrane segment for activity towards Hrd1. The Hrd1 partner Hrd3 serves as a brake for autoubiquitination, while Usa1 attenuates Ubp1’s deubiquitination activity through an inhibitory effect of its UBL domain. These results lead to a model in which the Hrd1 channel is regulated by cycles of autoubiquitination and deubiquitination, reactions that are modulated by the other components of the Hrd1 complex.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Just like factories make mistakes when producing products, cells make mistakes when producing proteins. In cells, a compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum is where about one third of all proteins are produced, and where new proteins undergo quality control. Damaged or misfolded proteins are removed by a process called endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD for short), because if damaged proteins accumulate, cells become stressed.</p><p>One type of ERAD is driven by a protein called Hrd1. Together with other components, Hrd1 labels damaged proteins with a ubiquitin tag that acts as a flag for degradation. Hrd1 has a paradoxical feature, however. To be active, Hrd1 tags itself with ubiquitin but this also makes it more prone to becoming degraded. How does Hrd1 remain active while avoiding its own degradation?</p><p>To address this question, Peterson et al. forced budding yeast cells to produce high levels of 23 different enzymes that remove ubiquitin tags. One of these enzymes, called Ubp1, was able remove the ubiquitin tag from Hrd1, though it had not been seen in the ERAD pathway before. Further experiments also showed that Ubp1 was able to regulate Hrd1 activity, making Ubp1 a regulator of Hrd1 dependent protein quality control.</p><p>Without protein quality control, damaged proteins can contribute to various diseases. ERAD is a common quality control system for proteins, present in many different species, ranging from yeast to animals. Therefore, understanding how ERAD works in budding yeast may also increase understanding of how human cells deal with damaged proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ERAD</kwd><kwd>protein quality control</kwd><kwd>regulation</kwd><kwd>protein degradation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM128592</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baldridge</surname><given-names>Ryan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM052586</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rapoport</surname><given-names>Tom A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG-2184-14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baldridge</surname><given-names>Ryan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFS-26-18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baldridge</surname><given-names>Ryan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008455</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Biological Sciences Scholars Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baldridge</surname><given-names>Ryan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rapoport</surname><given-names>Tom A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Michigan Predoctoral Training in Genetics (T32GM007544)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peterson</surname><given-names>Brian G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Hrd1-centric endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation system is regulated by interplay between the system's components.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteins translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) undergo quality control, such that only folded proteins are moved through the secretory pathway. If a protein does not reach its native folded state, it is eventually retrotranslocated across the ER membrane, polyubiquitinated, extracted from the membrane, and degraded by the proteasome, a pathway called ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) (for recent reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Preston and Brodsky, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu and Rapoport, 2018</xref>). Work in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> showed that substrates use four distinct ERAD pathways, depending on the localization of their misfolded domains. ERAD-L substrates contain misfolded domains in the ER lumen, ERAD-M substrates are misfolded within the membrane, ERAD-C substrates are membrane proteins with misfolded cytosolic domains, and ERAD-INM handles misfolded proteins in the inner nuclear membrane. These pathways use different ubiquitin ligases: ERAD-L and -M use the Hrd1 ligase, ERAD-C the Doa10 ligase, and ERAD-INM the Asi ligase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvalho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Foresti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huyer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khmelinskii et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vashist and Ng, 2004</xref>). These ligases are multi-spanning membrane proteins with cytosolic RING finger domains. Following polyubiquitination, all pathways converge at the Cdc48 ATPase (p97 or VCP in mammals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bays et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jarosch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rabinovich et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ye et al., 2001</xref>). This ATPase cooperates with a cofactor (Ufd1/Npl4) to extract polyubiquitinated substrates from the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stein et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Among the ubiquitin ligases, the function of Hrd1 is best understood. Hrd1 forms a complex with three other membrane proteins (Hrd3, Usa1, Der1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvalho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gardner et al., 2000</xref>). Hrd3 is a single-spanning membrane protein with a large lumenal domain that interacts with substrates and Hrd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gauss et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gauss et al., 2006b</xref>). In the absence of Hrd3, Hrd1 is strongly autoubiquitinated and rapidly degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gardner et al., 2000</xref>). Usa1 is a double-spanning membrane protein that serves as a linker between Hrd1 and Der1 and facilitates the oligomerization of Hrd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horn et al., 2009</xref>). It also has a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain of poorly defined function; the UBL domain is dispensable for the degradation of ERAD substrates, but is required for the efficient degradation of Hrd1 in a <italic>hrd3Δ</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carroll and Hampton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vashistha et al., 2016</xref>). Der1 is a multi-spanning protein required for ERAD-L, but not ERAD-M; it probably recognizes misfolded substrates in the ER lumen and facilitates their insertion into Hrd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knop et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mehnert et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Recent results suggest that the Hrd1 ligase forms a protein-conducting channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldridge and Rapoport, 2016</xref>). Overexpression of Hrd1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells bypasses the requirement for the other components of the complex, while all downstream components, such as the ubiquitination machinery and Cdc48 ATPase complex, are still needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho et al., 2010</xref>). These results suggest that Hrd1 is the only essential membrane protein for a basic ERAD-L process. A cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure shows that the membrane-spanning segments of Hrd1 surround a deep aqueous cavity, supporting the idea that Hrd1 can form a channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schoebel et al., 2017</xref>). In vitro experiments further demonstrate that Hrd1 reconstituted into proteoliposomes allows a misfolded substrate domain to retrotranslocate across the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldridge and Rapoport, 2016</xref>). This process requires autoubiquitination of Hrd1, leading to the suggestion that Hrd1 forms a ubiquitin-gated channel. The important autoubiquitination event occurs in the RING finger domain, as mutation of crucial lysines in this domain blocks retrotranslocation in vitro and ERAD-L in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldridge and Rapoport, 2016</xref>).</p><p>If the Hrd1 channel is activated by autoubiquitination, how is Hrd1 spared from degradation and returned to its inactive ground state? Here, we identify Ubp1 as a membrane-bound deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that reverses the polyubiquitin modification of Hrd1 and allows Hrd1 to escape uncontrolled degradation. The Hrd1 partner Hrd3 serves as a brake for autoubiquitination, while the UBL domain of Usa1 attenuates Ubp1’s activity, allowing Hrd1 autoubiquitination and activation. This delicate balance allows Hrd1 to undergo cycles of autoubiquitination and deubiquitination during ERAD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ubp1 overexpression stabilizes Hrd1</title><p>Our previous experiments indicated that Hrd1 is autoubiquitinated in wild-type yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldridge and Rapoport, 2016</xref>). The protein is moderately stable, with a half-life of about 100 min. We therefore reasoned that overexpression of a DUB that reverses the modification of Hrd1 would increase the steady state levels of the ligase. We overexpressed 23 different DUBs in yeast cells that also express Flag-tagged Hrd1. The levels of Hrd1 were determined by immunoblotting with anti-Flag antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The strongest increase of Hrd1 levels was seen with Ubp1, even though several other DUBs were expressed at a higher level than Ubp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

An increase of Hrd1 was also seen when Ubp1 was overexpressed in cells lacking Usa1 or Der1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; lanes 9 versus 4 and lane 10 versus 5).</p><p>Cycloheximide-chase experiments confirmed that Hrd1 is rapidly degraded in <italic>hrd3Δ</italic> cells and becomes more stable in cells overexpressing Ubp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Overexpression of Ubp1 also inhibited Hrd1 degradation in cells lacking Der1 or Usa1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Enzymatically inactive Ubp1 (C110S) had no effect on Hrd1 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Furthermore, wild-type Ubp1 had no effect when co-expressed with an enzymatically inactive Hrd1 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that Ubp1 reverses autoubiquitination of Hrd1. Consistent with this conclusion, the deletion of Ubp1, which should increase ubiquitination of Hrd1, decreased the levels of Hrd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; lanes 9–12 versus 1–4). As expected, the additional deletion of the stabilizing Hrd1-partner Hrd3 further reduced Hrd1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; lanes 13–16). To further test whether Ubp1 reverses autoubiquitination of Hrd1, we purified His-tagged Hrd1 under denaturing conditions and subjected the material to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Indeed, the level of polyubiquitinated Hrd1 was reduced in wild-type or <italic>hrd3Δ</italic> cells overexpressing Ubp1, even though the levels of unmodified Hrd1 were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and the total level of ubiquitinated proteins in the cell remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). It is important to note that these samples were not treated with proteasomal inhibitors as in previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carroll and Hampton, 2010</xref>) to prevent the accumulation of ubiquitinated Hrd1 in <italic>hrd3Δ</italic> cells.</p><p>To determine whether Hrd1 and Ubp1 interact in vivo, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments from yeast cells expressing Hrd1-Flag and Ubp1-V5. Indeed, a small, but reproducible amount of Hrd1-Flag was precipitated with antibodies to the V5 epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The low level of co-precipitation may be explained by the fact that Ubp1 is 20-fold more abundant than Hrd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The specificity of the interaction is supported by control experiments with Orm2, another integral membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum that is approximately 20 times more abundant than Hrd1: Ubp1-V5 did not precipitate Orm2-Flag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The interaction of Hrd1 with Ubp1 was maintained in the absence of Hrd3 or Usa1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p><p>To test whether Ubp1 affects the function of Hrd1 in ERAD, we tested the degradation of the ERAD-L substrate carboxypeptidase Y* (CPY*) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finger et al., 1993</xref>) in cycloheximide-chase experiments. In the absence of Ubp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, solid square with dashed black line), CPY* degradation was slower than in cells expressing Ubp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, circles with solid black line). Importantly, overexpression of Ubp1 did not prevent degradation of CPY* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, triangles with red line) or the steady-state levels of CPY* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The degradation of the overexpressed ERAD-L substrate, GFP-CPY* was also promoted by Ubp1 expression (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Surprisingly, Ubp1 was not required for ERAD-M and overexpression of Ubp1 only slightly slowed degradation of ERAD-M substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>). These data support the idea the Ubp1 is promoting optimal ERAD-L, but not ERAD-M. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Hrd1 and Ubp1 interact with one another, and that Ubp1 counteracts the autoubiquitination activity of Hrd1 thereby inhibiting Hrd1 degradation and regulating Hrd1 function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ubp1 function requires its anchoring to the ER membrane</title><p>Ubp1 contains an N-terminal transmembrane segment followed by a cytosolic linker and catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Ubp1 has been reported to be expressed as two distinct polypeptides; one with the transmembrane segment and the other lacking it (called ΔTM in the scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), generated from an internal translation start site (Met67) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schmitz et al., 2005</xref>). When Ubp1 lacking the transmembrane segment was overexpressed in <italic>hrd3Δ</italic> cells, no Hrd1 stabilization was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, the transmembrane segment of full-length Ubp1 could be replaced by the unrelated transmembrane segment of the Cue4 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Even when the entire N-terminal segment preceding the catalytic domain was replaced by a segment derived from Cue4, Ubp1 retained activity in stabilizing Hrd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results demonstrate that the role of the Ubp1 transmembrane segment is primarily to anchor Ubp1 at the ER membrane, which likely facilitates its interaction with the multi-spanning membrane protein Hrd1. In fact, the membrane anchor of Ubp1 could be replaced by the Hrd1-interacting H-domain of Usa1; this soluble fusion protein was able to completely stabilize Hrd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The enzymatically inactive version of this construct (H-domain Ubp1 (C110S)) had a small effect on Hrd1 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), perhaps due to its overexpression. Together, these results suggest that Hrd1 stabilization is primarily achieved by H domain-dependent recruitment of the catalytic domain of Ubp1.

Thus, there is a general correlation between Ubp1’s Hrd1 interaction and its effect on Hrd1 stabilization. Together, these results suggest that wild-type Ubp1 is targeted to Hrd1 by both its transmembrane segment and the USP domain. They also provide further support for the idea that Ubp1 acts on polyubiquitinated Hrd1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ubp1 overexpression bypasses the requirement for Hrd3 in ERAD</title><p>Next, we analyzed the effect of Ubp1 overexpression on substrate degradation in yeast strains lacking various ERAD components.

Because Ubp1 does not accelerate the degradation of CPY* in the presence of retrotranslocation-deficient Hrd1 KRK or inactive Hrd1(C399S) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I and K</xref>), we conclude that Ubp1 overexpression does not bypass normal Hrd1 function.</p><p>Stabilization of wild-type Hrd1 by Ubp1 overexpression also resulted in the accelerated degradation of the ERAD-M substrate Erg3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christiano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jaenicke et al., 2011</xref>).

Previous experiments had shown that Hrd1 is activated for ERAD by autoubiquitination; polyubiquitinated Hrd1 allowed a polypeptide segment of the substrate to move across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldridge and Rapoport, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stein et al., 2014</xref>). This mechanism, however, raised the question of how polyubiquitinated Hrd1 escapes degradation and returns to its inactive ground state. Our results now indicate that Ubp1, a membrane-bound DUB, is responsible for resetting Hrd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Ubp1 counteracts Hrd1’s autoubiquitination and therefore reduces its degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–F</xref>), while also regulating Hrd1’s activity in ERAD-L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). Ubp1 is an unusual DUB because it has an N-terminal transmembrane segment that is required for its activity towards Hrd1. However, there seem to be additional, so far unidentified, determinants of specificity within the catalytic domain of Ubp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The activity of Ubp1 must be tightly regulated, as excessive deubiquitination would prevent Hrd1 autoubiquitination and activation, and inadequate deubiquitination would result in Hrd1 degradation. Our results show that Usa1, a component associated with Hrd1, regulates Ubp1 activity; Usa1’s UBL domain attenuates the activity of Ubp1 and thereby allows autoubiquitination of Hrd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Autoubiquitination is also regulated by Hrd3, a lumenal binding partner of Hrd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gardner et al., 2000</xref>). Hrd3 serves as a brake of Hrd1’s ubiquitination activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We propose that substrate binding to Hrd3 releases this brake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), allowing autoubiquitination of Hrd1, which in turn opens the channel for retrotranslocation of the substrate. Hrd3 is not absolutely required for a basic ERAD process, as substrates are still degraded in its absence when Hrd1 is stabilized by Ubp1 overexpression. Taken together, our results indicate that Hrd1 undergoes cycles of autoubiquitination and deubiquitination, which are regulated by Hrd1-interacting components.</p><p>Surprisingly, we found that the ERAD-M substrate Erg3 does not require Hrd1 autoubiquitination or deubiquitination for its degradation. It is therefore possible that the model depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> is only applicable to ERAD-L substrates. ERAD-M substrates might enter Hrd1 laterally with their transmembrane segments and perhaps this does not require autoubiquitination of Hrd1. Alternatively, and more likely, ERAD-M (and ERAD-C) substrates may use the Der1 homolog Dfm1 for their extraction into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neal et al., 2018</xref>). Dfm1 seems to mediate the cytosolic extraction of these ERAD substrates even in the absence of Hrd1 (or Doa10), which would explain why autoubiquitination and deubiquitination of Hrd1 is not required.</p><p>The presence of Ubp1 is required for optimal performance of ERAD-L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The decreased degradation rate in the absence of Ubp1 can be explained by decreased Hrd1 activity. Or alternately, decreased ERAD-L degradation could be explained by enhanced Hrd1 degradation caused by its insufficient deubiquitination. The effect of Ubp1 deletion is relatively small, perhaps because a combination of other DUBs can replace Ubp1. The overexpression of Ubp1 has no effect on the degradation of ERAD-L substrates and slightly slows the degradation of ERAD-M substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Perhaps, ERAD-M substrates are affected because they are accessible to Ubp1 on the cytosolic side of the membrane prior to their extraction from the membrane by Dfm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neal et al., 2018</xref>). An alternate possibility is that deubiquitination of Hrd1 reduces its activity towards ERAD-M substrates. While Ubp1 does slow down the degradation rate of ERAD-M substrates, this balance could be advantageous for substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our results explain several puzzling observations in the literature. It has long been known that the deletion of Hrd3, which interacts with Hrd1 on the ER lumenal side, results in excessive Hrd1 autoubiquitination and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gardner et al., 2000</xref>). These reactions were attenuated when Usa1 or Usa1’s UBL domain were also deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carroll and Hampton, 2010</xref>). Our results now explain these results by the demonstration that the UBL domain inhibits Ubp1. In the absence of this domain, Ubp1 is hyperactive and reduces polyubiquitination of Hrd1 and thus its subsequent degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This model also explains why the UBL domain of Usa1 has no direct effect on the degradation of ERAD substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carroll and Hampton, 2010</xref>). Whether the UBL domain of Usa1 inhibits Ubp1 by a physical interaction or indirectly remains to be determined. However, functional interactions between UBL domains and DUBs have been reported, with DUBs being allosterically regulated or competitively inhibited by specific UBL domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faesen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although the absence of the UBL domain of Usa1 restored wild-type levels of Hrd1 in <italic>hrd3Δ</italic> cells, substrate degradation was still defective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vashistha et al., 2016</xref>). Our experiments show that both Hrd1 levels and ERAD can be restored in a <italic>hrd3Δ</italic> strain when Ubp1 is overexpressed. Thus, while Hrd3 is normally involved in ERAD, we suggest it primarily performs a supporting role for Hrd1 through regulating Hrd1’s autoubiquitination activity and helping to recruit ERAD substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gardner et al., 2001</xref>). Clearly, Hrd1 regulation is complex and one explanation for the previously published results is that Hrd1 autoubiquitination was reduced to a level at which channel opening was severely inhibited. In contrast, Ubp1 overexpression (in the presence of Usa1) might still allow a low level of autoubiquitination that is sufficient for retrotranslocation, but not for efficient Hrd1 degradation. This interpretation implies that Ubp1 overexpression does not completely overcome the inhibitory function of the UBL domain, perhaps because the interaction between Hrd1 and Ubp1 is weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) while that between Hrd1 and Usa1 is strong, or because Usa1 sterically prevents the access of Ubp1 to Hrd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvalho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horn et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>At this point, it is unclear exactly how Ubp1 is recruited to Hrd1. Deletion of either Hrd3 or Usa1 doesn’t have a strong effect on the Hrd1/Ubp1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). This could mean Hrd1 and Ubp1 interact directly, or that Ubp1 is recruited through the Hrd1-attached ubiquitin chain. Another possibility is that the interaction is mediated by another, unidentified protein, which might explain the low level of co-precipitation of Ubp1 and Hrd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p><p>While Hrd1 polyubiquitinates both itself and ERAD substrates, deubiquitination of these components occurs by separate mechanisms. It is somewhat surprising that CPY* degradation is not accelerated by the increased Hrd1 levels caused by Ubp1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>). However, Hrd1 functions in a complex with other components, including Hrd3, Usa1, and Der1, the levels of which remain unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, overexpression of Ubp1 does not prevent the degradation of CPY* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>), indicating that Ubp1 does not act on polyubiquitinated ERAD-L substrate. In fact, an ERAD substrate needs to retain its polyubiquitin chain until it has been extracted from the membrane by the Cdc48/p97 ATPase complex, because the polyubiquitin chain serves as a recognition signal for the Ufd1/Npl4 cofactor of Cdc48. Substrate deubiquitination occurs by cytosolic DUBs, one of which is Otu1 (Yod1 in mammals), an enzyme that binds to the Cdc48 ATPase through its UBX-like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stein et al., 2014</xref>). As long as the ATPase complex is bound to the membrane, Cdc48 interacts with Ubx2, which prevents access of Otu1. Once the ATPase has pulled the substrate out of the membrane and has moved into the cytosol, Otu1 can trim the ubiquitin chain, the substrate is released from Cdc48/p97, and then transferred to the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodnar and Rapoport, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ernst et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neal et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, ERAD involves two distinct deubiquitination reactions, one catalyzed by Ubp1 at the ER membrane to reset Hrd1, and another catalyzed by Otu1 in the cytosol to release substrate from Cdc48/p97.</p><p>Integral membrane DUBs are relatively rare. In both yeast and mammals, there are only two DUBs that are integral membrane proteins (out of 24 and 90 enzymes, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Komander et al., 2009</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Ubp1 is the only known DUB in the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schmitz et al., 2005</xref>). Our results show that the N-terminal membrane anchor is required for reversing the ubiquitin-modification of Hrd1 but that it can be replaced by a transmembrane segment from a different protein. The apparent 20-fold excess of Ubp1 over Hrd1 makes it is likely that Ubp1 has additional substrates which could contribute indirectly to Hrd1 stability. A shorter version of Ubp1, which lacks the transmembrane segment, has been reported to have a role in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schmitz et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Although one would expect the function of Ubp1 to be evolutionarily conserved, there is no obvious homolog in higher organisms. However, Usp19 has been reported to serve as a DUB for polyubiquitinated Hrd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harada et al., 2016</xref>). Usp19 is present at the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hassink et al., 2009</xref>), is proposed to play a role in ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2014</xref>), and is one of two mammalian DUBs with transmembrane segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Komander et al., 2009</xref>). Mammalian Hrd1 is associated with HERP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schulze et al., 2005</xref>), a putative Usa1 homolog with a UBL domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kokame et al., 2000</xref>), but whether Usp19 functions in a similar way as Ubp1 in yeast remains to be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Cells were grown to mid-log phase (0.4–0.7 OD<sub>600</sub>/mL) in synthetic dropout media. The cells were pelleted at 2000 x g for 5 min and resuspended to 2.5 OD<sub>600</sub>/mL in fresh media. At time ‘0 min’ the culture was supplemented with 50 μg/mL cycloheximide and an aliquot was taken and centrifuged as above. The cell pellet was either flash frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> or resuspended in lysis buffer. The remaining culture was incubated at 30°C with samples taken as indicated.</p><p>Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mM MOPS, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 8M urea, 10 mM EDTA, fresh protease inhibitors) at 25 OD<sub>600</sub>/mL with an equivalent volume of acid-washed glass beads (0.1 mm, Bio-Spec). After vortexing for 2 min, an equal volume of urea sample buffer (125 mM Tris pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 8M urea, 10% β-mercaptoethanol) was added and mixed. The samples were incubated at 65°C for 5 min before SDS-PAGE, transfer to PVDF membrane and immunoblotting (THE Anti-DYKDDDK Antibody, Genscript; HA clone 3F10, Roche) and detection by chemiluminescence with Western Lightning Plus-ECL (Perkin-Elmer) on a ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad). For quantification of the immunoblot band intensities, band intensities were normalized based upon total protein in the sample quantified within the same gels using Bio-Rad Stain-Free Dye Imaging Technology or by normalization to the intensity of PGK1 (clone 22C5D8, Thermo Scientific).</p><p>Cells expressing GPD-driven Hmg2-GFP or Hmg2-NR1-GFP with the indicated plasmids were grown to mid-log phase in synthetic dropout media. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in synthetic medium and transferred into a 96-well round bottom plate. To follow degradation of Hmg2-NR1-GFP, the medium was supplemented with 50 μg/mL cycloheximide. To induce degradation of Hmg2-GFP, the media was supplemented with 10 μg/mL zaragozic acid (Cayman Chemical). The cells were grown for 4 hr, then pelleted and washed with ice-cold PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1.8 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4). The washed cells were resuspended at 1 OD<sub>600</sub>/mL in PBS containing the viability dye Sytox Blue (Invitrogen) at 1 μM. Cells were kept at 4°C prior to flow cytometry using a Bio-Rad ZE5 Cell Analyzer with Everest software. At least ten thousand events were analyzed using forward/side scatter to identify single cells and Sytox Blue fluorescence was used to exclude dead cells. GFP fluorescence was measured from the 488 nm laser with a 509 nm/24 nm bandpass filter set, while Sytox Blue fluorescence was measured from the 405 nm laser with a 460 nm/22 nm bandpass filter set. Data were analyzed and figures were generated using FlowJo V10.6 (FlowJo LLC.). The low-expressing GFP population is present in all traces and is indicated under the dashed lines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Detection of Hrd1 ubiquitination in vivo</title><p>Denaturing pulldowns of Hrd1 were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldridge and Rapoport, 2016</xref>) with the following modifications. Cells with a centromeric plasmid bearing an endogenous Hrd1 promoter and a Hrd1-His10 were grown to mid-log phase and lysed in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 300 mM KCl, protease inhibitors, 1 mM PMSF, 1.5 µM pepstatin, 8M urea (to prevent additional Hrd1 autoubiquitination), and 5 mM NEM (to inhibit deubiquitinating enzymes). The lysates were centrifuged at 2000 x g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected and re-centrifuged for 30 min in a Ti45 rotor at 42,000 rpm (RCF<sub>avg</sub> 138,001). The membranes were solubilized in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 300 mM KCl, protease inhibitors, 1 mM PMSF, 6M urea, 1.5% Triton X-100 final and 25 mM imidazole) for 1 hr at 4°C. His-tag Dynabeads (Life Technologies) were added (0.25 mL per 1,500 OD cells) and incubated for an additional 1 hr. The beads were washed three times with a 30-fold excess buffer. Hrd1-His10 was eluted with buffer including 400 mM imidazole. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Hrd1 and anti-ubiquitin antibodies (clone P4D1, Santa Cruz). Unbound IMAC flow-through was used for a loading control to demonstrate equal material input.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunoprecipitation of Hrd1 and interacting partners</title><p>Cells with a centromeric plasmids bearing a combination of Hrd1-3xFlag, Orm2-3xFlag, and endogenous or GPD driven Ubp1-3xHA,Ubp1-3xV5, or Ubp1-3xV5 variants were grown to mid-log phase, pelleted, washed once with water and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were thawed on ice and treated for 10 min with spheroplasting buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1M sorbitol) supplemented with 10 mM DTT. Cells were pelleted and washed once with spheroplasting buffer before resuspending in spheroplasting buffer supplemented with 20 µg zymolyase 100T (per 5 OD). Cells were incubated at 30°C for 60 min, then pelleted at 3200 x g for 5 min. The spheroplasts were resuspended in IP buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl with freshly added 1 mM PMSF and 3 µM pepstatin A) and lysed with 7–10 strokes of a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer. Lysed cells were pelleted at 20,000 x g for 20 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet (microsome fraction) was resuspended in IP buffer supplemented with 1% Decyl Maltose Neopentyl Glycol (DMNG). Microsomes were solubilized for 1 hr at 4°C, before input samples were taken and 7.5 ODs of solubilized proteins were mixed with 20 µL (40 µL slurry) Anti-V5 Agarose Affinity Gel (Millipore, A7345) and rolled for 2 hr at 4°C. The bound proteins were washed seven times with a 35-fold excess of IP buffer containing 0.1% DMNG and eluted with 2x SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Flag (THE DYKDDDDK Tag antibody, Genscript) and anti-V5 antibodies (THE V5 Tag Antibody, GenScript) with the inputs loaded at 2%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Replication</title><p>All experiments in this submission were repeated at least three times with biological replicates from independent yeast transformations.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Pedro Carvalho, Jiwon Hwang, Alex Stein, and Xudong Wu for critical reading of the manuscript.

process of ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Earlier work had shown that a central component of ERAD, the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase, not only ubiquitinates substrates to be degraded, but also itself. This autoubiquitination was found to be important for activating Hrd1 for transport of ERAD substrates. What happens to Hrd1 that has become autoubiquitinated was not known. The authors now provide convincing evidence that in yeast, the deubiquitinase Ubp1 contributes to Hrd1 deubiquitination, thereby preventing its promiscuous degradation. The authors go on to provide additional details of how Ubp1 activity is regulated and the types of substrates that seem to rely on its activity for optimal degradation. The findings support a model in which the ubiquitination state of Hrd1 is carefully balanced by Hrd3 regulation of Hrd1 autoubiquitination and by Ubp1-mediated deubiquitination, which is in turn tempered by Usa1. The identification of a new factor in ERAD is an important advance that should be of interest to a range of readers of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cycles of autoubiquitination and deubiquitination regulate the ERAD ubiquitin ligase Hrd1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Ramanujan Hegde as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Ron as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors previously discovered that Hrd1 autoubiquitination is required for substrate retrotranslocation (Baldridge and Rapoport, 2016), suggesting a model in which Hrd1 functions as a ubiquitin-gated channel. The fate of poly-ubiquitinated Hrd1 was unclear, but was presumed to be de-ubiquitinated so it can be re-used for additional cycles of ERAD. The mechanism by which ubiquitinated Hrd1 is de-ubiquitinated to evade degradation was unknown. Here, Peterson and co-authors find that the membrane-tethered DUB Ubp1 deubiquitinates Hrd1, resulting in stabilization of Hrd1, but not Hrd1 substrates. Furthermore, Ubp1 is inhibited by the UBL domain of Usa1. The experiments are rigorously designed and interpreted carefully for the most part. The findings support an intriguing model in which the ubiquitination state of Hrd1 is carefully balanced by Hrd3 regulation of Hrd1 autoubiquitination and by Ubp1-mediated deubiquitination, which is in turn tempered by Usa1.</p><p>The major strength of the study is the identification of a factor that regulates Hrd1 abundance and/or activity. The quality of the data that are presented are excellent and convincing. The major drawback however is that nearly all of the experiments are performed in an over-expression paradigm under conditions with one or more Hrd1 accessory factors are deleted. Indeed, pretty much all effects of Ubp1 are really only seen when Hrd3, an integral component of the Hrd1 complex, is deleted. It was difficult to glean from the study what the actual consequence of Ubp1 deletion, mutation, or overexpression is for ERAD under otherwise unperturbed conditions, raising some doubt about whether it really plays a central role in regulating Hrd1 activity (as opposed to solely its abundance) as proposed by the authors.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The first point below was judged by the reviewers to be essential to the study and where the priority for revisions should be focused. The second and third points are also important, but less central. It is suggested that the authors try to address these experimentally, but if that is not possible, they should adjust their interpretations accordingly.</p><p>1) Nearly all of the effects that are observed on substrate degradation are seen in the context of <italic>hrd3</italic> with <italic>ubp1</italic> overexpression. While it is certainly clear that Ubp1 protects Hrd1 from degradation in this context, the evidence for a crucial role in the ERAD activity cycle is far less compelling. One of the very few experiments where Ubp1 is deleted or over-expressed in otherwise normal cells is Figure 1G. Based on what is shown, it is hard to see any effects on CPY* degradation. To the extent any effect is seen (hard to know without quantification of multiple experiments), it would appear that CPY* is degraded more effectively in <italic>ubp1∆</italic> cells given that there is less CPY* to start with (e.g., lane 1 vs. 5). In short, the authors only see a key role for Ubp1 under the artificial condition where Hrd3 is removed. The study requires a more thorough analysis of the Hrd1 complex and several key ERAD substrates in cells lacking or overexpressing Ubp1 in otherwise unperturbed cells. This would allow a reader to clearly judge what effect Ubp1 is having on levels of Hrd complex components, Hrd1 ubiquitination, and most importantly, rates of degradation of key ERAD substrates. If it turns out that there are essentially no obvious effects on ERAD, the central claim that Ubp1 is a key regulator of the putative ubiquitination cycle that control Hrd1 activity would seem to be overstated. In this case, a more cautious interpretation should be presented.</p><p>2) Usa1, via its UBL domain, inhibits Ubp1. It is unclear if this effect is direct or indirect. Is there an interaction between Usa1 and Ubp1? Measurement of Ubp1 activity in vitro in the presence and absence of the Usa1 UBL could be useful to support the proposed model.</p><p>3) The co-immunoprecipitation experiment shown in Figure 1H is marginal. The significance of Ubp1-Hrd1 binding could be strengthened by measuring the interaction between Hrd1 and variants of Ubp1 examined in Figure 2. Does binding of these Ubp1 variants to Hrd1 correlate with their ability to stabilize the ubiquitin ligase in the absence of Hrd3?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50903.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The first point below was judged by the reviewers to be essential to the study and where the priority for revisions should be focused.

We have introduced several new figure panels to address these comments. These experiments were all performed in a <italic>hrd1Δubp1Δ</italic> strain so we can clearly follow both Hrd1 and ERAD substrates either without Ubp1, with Ubp1, or with overexpressed Ubp1.</p><p>We have updated Figure 1G to a new figure that is the quantification of 5 biological replicates in this strain (and repositioned it to Figure 1H). In the absence of Ubp1 (Figure 1H, solid square with dashed black line), CPY* degradation is slower than with Ubp1 expressed, or overexpressed (solid black line and red line). Overexpression of Ubp1 (relative to endogenous levels of Ubp1) did not increase the degradation rates of the CPY* substrate. These data support the idea that Ubp1 is promoting optimal ERAD-L degradation. Hrd1 autoubiquitination is the primary driver of ERAD-L degradation, but deubiquitination is required for optimal efficiency (Figure 1H).</p><p>With an overexpressed, GFP-tagged version of CPY*, expression of Ubp1 improves degradation (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A, panel 3 vs. panel 2). Compared to the <italic>ubp1Δ</italic>, overexpression of Ubp1 also improves degradation of GFP-CPY* (panels 4 vs. 2).</p><p>With ERAD-M substrates, Ubp1 is not required for degradation beyond Hrd1 stabilization (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B, panel 2 vs. 3). In fact, expression or overexpression of Ubp1 seems to reduce the degradation of both Hmg2-GFP (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B panel 2 vs. 4) and Erg3 (Figure 1—figure supplement 3C). This is likely because ERAD-M substrates are accessible to Ubp1 on the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane and are transferred to Dfm1 for extraction from the membrane.</p><p>Because we have now included data that support a role for Ubp1 beyond simply stabilizing Hrd1, we feel that the original interpretations are well supported. We have shown that Ubp1 helps to regulate Hrd1’s activity (primarily for ERAD-L). However, we agree there is a relatively small effect on ERAD function and have adjusted our interpretations to be more cautious and have indicated that other DUBs might be performing a similar function in the absence of Ubp1 (Discussion, fourth paragraph and model in Figure 4E)</p><p> <italic>2) Usa1, via its UBL domain, inhibits Ubp1. It is unclear if this effect is direct or indirect. Is there an interaction between Usa1 and Ubp1? Measurement of Ubp1 activity</italic> in vitro <italic>in the presence and absence of the Usa1 UBL could be useful to support the proposed model.</italic></p><p>We agree that these experiments would be helpful to support our model. We used recombinantly expressed and purified Hrd1, Usa1, and Ubp1 and were unable to detect direct interactions (perhaps unsurprisingly). Regrettably, we do not have additional data to address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The co-immunoprecipitation experiment shown in Figure 1H is marginal.

We tested new Ubp1 chimeras for co-immunoprecipitation with Hrd1. Both wild-type Ubp1 and Ubp1, in which the TM segment was replaced by that of Cue4 (TM(Cue4)Ubp1 in Figure 2E) interacted weakly with Hrd1. In contrast, Ubp1 missing its transmembrane segment (Ubp1 ΔTM) did not interact with Hrd1. As expected, a soluble version of Ubp1 carrying the H-domain of Usa1 showed strong interaction with Hrd1 (Figure 2E). These data support a general correlation between Ubp1’s Hrd1 interaction and its effect on Hrd1 stabilization.</p></body></sub-article></article>
