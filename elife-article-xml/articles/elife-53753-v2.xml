conserved mRNA deadenylase regulating posttranscriptional gene expression. However, regulation of CCR4 in virus infections is less understood. Here, we characterized a pro-viral role of CCR4 in replication of a plant cytorhabdovirus<italic>, Barley yellow striate mosaic virus</italic> (BYSMV). The barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>) CCR4 protein (HvCCR4) was identified to interact with the BYSMV phosphoprotein (P). The BYSMV P protein recruited HvCCR4 from processing bodies (PBs) into viroplasm-like bodies. Overexpression of HvCCR4 promoted BYSMV replication in plants. Conversely, knockdown of the small brown planthopper CCR4 inhibited viral accumulation in the insect vector. Biochemistry experiments revealed that HvCCR4 was recruited into N–RNA complexes by the BYSMV P protein and triggered turnover of N-bound cellular mRNAs, thereby releasing RNA-free N protein to bind viral genomic RNA for optimal viral replication. Our results demonstrate that the co-opted CCR4-mediated RNA decay facilitates cytorhabdovirus replication in plants and insects.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>plant cytorhabdovirus</kwd><kwd>phosphoprotein</kwd><kwd>CCR4</kwd><kwd>RNA decay</kwd><kwd>virus-plant interaction</kwd><kwd>barley</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31872920 and 31571978</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xian-Bing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31571978</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xian-Bing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A cytorhabdovirus phosphoprotein hijacks host CCR4 to trigger turnover of viral nucleoprotein (N)-bound cellular RNAs, thereby releasing nascent RNA-free N protein molecules to bind viral genomic RNAs for optimal replication.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotic cells, mRNA levels determined by biosynthesis and turnover tightly regulate protein production in response to cellular environment changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collart, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). The mRNA poly(A) tail is important for post-transcriptional regulation by affecting mRNA stability and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wiederhold and Passmore, 2010</xref>). Shortening of mRNA poly (A) tails, a process known as deadenylation, is the rate-limiting step in the mRNA decay process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garneau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parker and Sheth, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Houseley and Tollervey, 2009</xref>). In eukaryotes, mRNA deadenylation is primarily mediated by the CCR4-NOT complex in RNA processing bodies (PBs) that are dynamic cytoplasmic structures containing silenced mRNAs for degradation or translation repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parker and Sheth, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beckham and Parker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu and Chua, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller and Reese, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Shyu, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCormick and Khaperskyy, 2017</xref>). Accumulating evidence shows that the CCR4-NOT complex is recruited to some specific mRNAs for deadenylation by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) such as Pumilio, Roquin, and Tristetraprolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leppek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wahle and Winkler, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arae et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Webster et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In the CCR4-NOT complex, carbon catabolite repression 4 (CCR4) and CCR4 associated factor (CAF1) are two deadenylases responsible for removing mRNA poly(A) tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collart, 2016</xref>). CAF1 interacts directly with the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of CCR4 and the MIF4G domain of NOT1, and hence links CCR4 to the NOT1 scaffold protein of the CCR4-NOT complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zuo and Deutscher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basquin et al., 2012</xref>). While, plant CCR4 proteins do not contain LRR domains at their N termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dupressoir et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chou et al., 2017</xref>). Instead, the N termini of plant CCR4 orthologues contain a zf-MYND-like domain that interacts with plant CAF1 proteins in the CCR4-NOT complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chou et al., 2017</xref>). Cellular mRNA decay is usually manipulated by viruses to complete viral life cycles due to limited functional proteins in viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariumi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beckham and Parker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dougherty et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCormick and Khaperskyy, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). Currently, regulation of CCR4 and its deadenylase activity in viral infections is not well understood.</p><p>Rhabdoviruses are negative-stranded RNA viruses that infect a wide range of organisms including plants, vertebrates, and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ammar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mann and Dietzgen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dietzgen et al., 2016</xref>). Rhabdoviruses share similar genome organizations encoding five structural proteins, including the nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G), and large polymerase (L) proteins in a conserved order 3′–N–P–M–G–L–5′. In addition, a number of accessory proteins are encoded in the overprinted, overlapped, and interspersed regions of the structural protein genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Walker et al., 2011</xref>). The three core proteins, N, P, L proteins, and the genomic RNA molecule compose viral capsid complex (NC) that functions in elegantly regulated viral replication and transcription cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ivanov et al., 2011</xref>). The N protein entirely encapsidates the gRNA and antigenomic (ag) RNA to form N-RNA complexes that serves as templates for replication and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ivanov et al., 2011</xref>). The multiple functional P protein chaperones nascent RNA-free N (N<sup>0</sup>) by forming an N<sup>0</sup>–P complex that prevent N<sup>0</sup> from binding nonspecifically to cellular RNAs, and attaches L protein polymerase complexes to the N-RNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ivanov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leyrat et al., 2011a</xref>). Accumulating evidence provides preliminary glimpses of the mechanisms whereby P acts multiple roles in viral RNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ivanov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leyrat et al., 2011a</xref>), but numerous unanswered questions about the molecular mechanisms still need to be explored. For example, it is not well understood how P binds to N<sup>0</sup> to prevent binding to cellular mRNAs and facilitate specific viral gRNA and agRNA interactions. In particular, it remains to be determined whether cellular factors are involved into these processes.</p><p><italic>Barley yellow striate mosaic virus</italic> (BYSMV), a member of <italic>Cytorhabdovirus</italic> genus, infects cereal crops and causes yield losses worldwide. In 2015, BYSMV was first reported in wheat fields of northern China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di et al., 2014</xref>). BYSMV is obligately transmitted by the small brown planthopper (SBPH) in a persistent propagative manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2018</xref>). The complete BYSMV genome encodes ten proteins in the order of 3′–N–P–P3–P4/P5–P6–M–G–P9–L–5′ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yan et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, we successfully established the BYSMV minireplicon system and rescued BYSMV from full length cDNA clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2019</xref>). BYSMV reverse genetic systems allow us to begin to dissect interactions between BYSMV and its plant hosts and insect vectors and to engineer versatile delivery platforms in monocot plants and planthoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that the BYSMV P protein interacts directly with CCR4 and recruits the protein into viroplasm-like bodies to improve viral RNA replication. We also show that the P-recruited CCR4 proteins are responsible for turnover of the N-bound cellular mRNAs. Our results suggest a positive role of CCR4 in cytorhabdovirus infection cycles and explain how the P protein binds to N<sup>0</sup> to prevent binding of cellular mRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BYSMV P interacts with barley HvCCR4 in vitro and in vivo</title><p>Rhabodovirus P proteins have essential roles in viral genomic RNA replication and mRNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ivanov et al., 2011</xref>).

Here, these findings and those described below provide a novel strategy whereby BYSMV co-opts RNA decay machineries for virus infections.</p><p>PBs are mainly involved in RNA decay and microRNA mediated silencing which have been proposed as an antiviral strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lloyd, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reineke and Lloyd, 2013</xref>). Genetic analysis has shown that RNA decay plays an important role in plant defense responses against virus infections by affecting viral mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jaag and Nagy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li and Wang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garcia-Ruiz, 2019</xref>). These studies mostly focus on the 5′ to 3′ RNA decay components, including exoribonuclease 4 (XRN4) and decapping protein 2 (DCP2) in limiting virus accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jaag and Nagy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li and Wang, 2018</xref>). Correspondingly, some virus proteins, like potyviral HC-Pro and genome-linked protein (VPg), can interfere with RNA decay through interactions with XRN4 and DCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li and Wang, 2018</xref>). Compared to accumulating genetic evidence for antiviral RNA decay activities, less is known about the pro-viral activities of RNA decay in plant virus infections. In the case of BYSMV, we show that the BYSMV P protein interacts directly with host CCR4 to recruit CCR4 from PBs to BYSMV replication bodies containing N, L, P, and CCR4, are adjacent to P bodies marked by DCP1-mCherry. The results also suggest that the P protein recruits the protein from PBs to BYSMV replication bodies, indicating that cellular P bodies have important roles in viral replication. For example, BYSMV N-bound cellular mRNAs were first subjected to CCR4-mediated deadenylation, and then transferred to adjacent P bodies for RNA decay. Alternatively, the CCR4 protein may tether the BYSMV replication bodies and cellular P bodies to facilitate transfer of N-bound cellular RNAs to P bodies for RNA decay. In addition, RNA decay has shown to be related with RNA silencing in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li and Wang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moreno et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, CCR4 in the decay bodies might be a suppressor of RNA silencing to interfere antiviral RNA silencing, thereby promoting viral replication. In this study, we found that GFP-P bodies are adjacent to but not overlapped with SGS3-RFP-labelled siRNA bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, we used co-infiltration assays to reveal that neither dsRNA-induced CCR4 silencing or CCR4 overexpression has suppressor activities of GFP-induced silencing as the TBSV P19 suppressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Nonetheless, we will examine these possibilities in future studies.</p><p>In the CCR4–NOT1 complex, both CCR4 and CAF1 are functional deadenylases that belong to the EEP and DEDD (Asp-Glu-Asp-Asp) families, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dlakić, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zuo and Deutscher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Niinuma et al., 2016</xref>). HvCAF1 does not interact with BYSMV P and plays a negative role in the BYSMV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and hence is functionally distinct from the CCR4–P interactions and proviral function. One interpretation of the negative role of HvCAF1 is that HvCAF1 sequesters the HvCCR4 protein from the BYSMV P protein, thus interfering with the proviral function of HvCCR4 in BYSMV replication. Moreover, these results suggest that BYSMV P selectively hijacks the CCR4 protein, but not the complete CCR4–NOT1 complex to facilitate optimal virus replication. In insects, LsCCR4 contains a conserved LRR domain present in yeast and human homologs that mediates interactions with the BYSMV P protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Furthermore, LsCCR4 is required for BYSMV replication in insects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, these results suggest that the BYSMV P protein can interact with the two distinct N-terminal motifs of plant and insect CCR4s, which may be an important for trans-kingdom BYSMV infection of plant hosts and insect vectors.</p><p>As obligate organisms, viruses encode limited functional proteins, and must usurp host cellular resources for replicative advantages. Thus, identifying host factors involved in viral replication process is critical for understanding molecular mechanisms of viral pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hashimoto et al., 2016</xref>). Rhabdovirus replication requires viral gRNA and agRNA and three core virus proteins, consisting of the N, P, and L proteins. The viral RNA encapsidated by the N protein serves as a template for virus transcription and replication. However, rhabdovirus N proteins have a strong unspecific affinity for cellular RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Thus, for optimal viral replication, N proteins must be prevented from binding cellular RNAs. Previous studies about animal rhabdoviruses have demonstrated that rhabdovirus P binds to the nascent N<sup>0</sup> molecule to form soluble N<sup>0</sup>–P complexes that maintains the N<sup>0</sup> molecule in an RNA-free state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Masters and Banerjee, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peluso and Moyer, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mavrakis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leyrat et al., 2011b</xref>). However, it remains unknown whether N bound cellular RNA is degraded before interactions between the P and N<sup>0</sup> proteins. Our recent work has shown that BYSMV P forms trafficking bodies on the ER/actin networks to recruit BYSMV L, N<sup>0</sup> or N/cellular RNA during viral RNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fang et al., 2019</xref>). The trafficking P bodies recruit host CCR4 (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>), indicating that CCR4 is a host factor required for viral replication. In BYSMV P bodies, CCR4 deadenylase activities could remove poly (A) tails to initiate turnover of N-bound mRNA, and free N<sup>0</sup> protein for P protein associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). In agreement with this proposed model, we have shown that HvCCR4 can prevent N binding to cellular mRNAs through its deadenylation function. Thereafter, the released RNA-free N<sup>0</sup> to bind the P protein and specifically encapsidate viral genomic and antigenomic RNAs to provide functional templates for optimal replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that a rhabdovirus P protein can co-opt host CCR4 proteins for replication in plant and insect hosts. Host CCR4 protein mediated deadenylation is utilized by rhabdoviruses to prevent the N protein from binding to cellular mRNAs and to maintain specific encapsidation of viral genomic and antigenomic RNAs with the N protein to provide replication templates. In future studies, we plan to examine whether BYSMV P–CCR4 interactions interfere with cellular PB assembly and functions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials and virus inoculation by insect transmission</title><p>N.<italic>N. benthamiana</italic> and barley (Golden promise) plants were grown on soil at 25 ± 2°C with a day/night cycle of a 14/10 hr.

BYMSV, uses its phosphoprotein (P) to hijack the host deadenylation factor CCR4 to promote viral replication. A particularly striking finding is that the virus uses the same trick to manipulate both its plant host and its insect vector. The reviewers were pleased that the authors were overall very aware of the many pitfalls inherent in the complex experimental setups and data analysis. The work advances our understanding of the molecular arms race in virus-host interactions and will be of great interest to the fields of viral interaction and RNA turnover.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A co-opted CCR4 RNA decay factor enhances plant cytorhabdovirus replication&quot; for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by Detlef Weigel as Senior and Reviewing Editor and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Yi Li (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>RNA quality control and regulated RNA decay are conserved eukaryotic mechanisms that protect host cells from dysfunctional endogenous or invasive RNAs. Therefore, viruses have evolved strategies not only to evade, but also to manipulate these mechanisms in order to successfully complete their replication cycle.</p><p>In this manuscript, you address the roles of carbon catabolite repression 4 (CCR4) in a plant virus infection both in the host plant and the insect vector. In eukaryotes, mRNA deadenylation is primarily mediated by the CCR4-NOT complex in RNA processing bodies (PBs) known from yeast and human cells, but regulation of CCR4 and the role of its deadenylase activity during viral infections is not well understood. You discovered that BYMSV uses its phosphoprotein (P) to hijack host CCR4 to promote viral replication. You convincingly show that P protein interacts directly with CCR4 and recruits it into viroplasm-like bodies to improve viral RNA replication; P-recruited CCR4 proteins are responsible for turnover of the N-bound cellular mRNAs and thereby releasing RNA-free N protein to bind viral genomic RNA for optimal viral replication.</p><p>You present a potential mechanism for how P protein binds to RNA-free N protein (N<sup>0</sup>) to prevent binding to cellular mRNAs and to facilitate specific viral gRNA/agRNA interactions. A particularly nice aspect of the work is that you also tested CCR4 orthologues in the transmitting vector, which led to similar conclusions: CCR4 knockdown inhibits BYSMV infection of insects and significantly reduces virus transmissibility, indicating a potential evolutionarily conserved mechanism that BYSMV has adopted to outcompete and inhibit N protein binding of cellular mRNAs. You are overall very aware of the many pitfalls inherent in the complex experimental setups and data analysis. The manuscript is well written and does an especially effective job presenting complex interactions.</p><p>Overall, you present several interesting observations directly validated by combining approaches from molecular biology, cell biology and biochemistry. This allows you to propose a novel mechanism of how rhabodoviruses exploit the host RNA decay machinery for viral replication. The work advances our understanding of the molecular arms race in virus-host interactions and will be of great interest to the fields of viral interaction and RNA turnover.</p><p>While the reviewers were overall very positive, we ask you to conduct a few essential revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) You used transient expression to test N-bound RNA ratios in Figure 8E and F, with the key proteins all expressed from 35S promoters. To obtain more physiological relevant ratios, please repeat the experiments for Figure 8E and F using BYR-HvCCR4/HVCCR4<sup>mEEP</sup>-rescued barley plants.</p><p>2) Rhabdovirus P protein has been shown to form dimers through the central dimerization domain and the dimerization is important in the process of chaperoning nascent RNA-free N (N<sup>0</sup>) by forming the N<sup>0</sup>-P complex that prevents N<sup>0</sup> from binding non-specifically to cellular RNAs, and attaches L protein polymerase complexes to the N-RNA complex. In Figure 1, you show that P interacts with CCR4 through the central and/or the C-terminal domain. Does the CCR4-P interaction interfere with the dimerization of P protein? Also, what is the effect on the function of P protein? Is the functional P form a dimer or a monomer?</p><p>3) The deadenylation assays showed strong and direct evidence that P protein could tether CCR4 and that the N protein triggers degradation of RNA containing poly(A). However, the quality of Figure 8B should be improved; no significant increase of the degradation products can be seen in the figure at 15, 30, and 60 minutes. You should also describe the method and details how to quantify the deadenylated RNA in Figure 8B and C.</p><p>4) RQC and RNA decay act as antiviral mechanisms, but they also play a role as endogenous suppressors of PTGS. This entails that HvCCR4 overexpression may promote viral replication through repressing PTGS. HvCCR4 is localized to viroplasm-like structures where viral mRNA is transcribed. In another scenario, it is possible that HvCCR4 degrades aberrant or excessive viral mRNAs to suppress antiviral RNA silencing, thereby promoting viral replication. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CCR4a is localized to both P-bodies and siRNA bodies (Moreno et al., 2013) and BYSMV infection promotes the generation of virus-derived siRNAs as shown in one of the authors' previous study. Do BYSMV P protein (or viroplasm-like structures) co-localize with siRNA bodies and HvCCR4? Is the accumulation of virus-derived siRNAs affected by HvCCR4 overexpression (Figure 6D and Figure 7F)? Please consider this possibility and discuss it in depth.</p><p>5) Figure 2D and E requires quantitative data showing how many foci were detected and how many were completely or adjacently co-localized in the absence/presence of P proteins.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A co-opted CCR4 RNA decay factor enhances plant cytorhabdovirus replication&quot; for further consideration by eLife.

However, in the revised manuscript, the additional explanations and experiments supporting the promotion of viral replication by HvCCR4 and the fact that the level of CCR4 does not affect RNA silencing strengthen the conclusion of this study revealing a new aspect of the function of a RNA decay component, HvCCR4, in the interaction between viruses and plants, and I agree with it.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Zhang et al. report that CCR4 RNA decay factor is hijacked by BYSMV P protein into viroplasm-like bodies to trigger degradation of cellular mRNAs bound by BYSMV N protein, allowing N protein to bind viral genomic RNA for viral replication.

As shown in Figure 4B, transiently expressed HvCCR4, but not HvCCR4<sup>mEEP</sup>, could significantly increase the replication of minireplicon genome. Therefore, different accumulation of agMR would affect the final ratios of N-bound agMR verse cellular RNA in the presence of HvCCR4 or HvCCR4<sup>mEEP</sup>. To rule out the different accumulation of viral genomic RNA, we did not express the BYSMV L protein in the Figure 8E and F. Therefore, accumulation of the agRNA in vivo is similar in different samples, because all agRNA is transcribed from 35S promoter without virus replication. Then, we carried out the IP assays using N-Flag to show HvCCR4, but not HvCCR4<sup>mEEP</sup>, could improve the binding specificity of N to agMR.</p><p>We also constructed the pBYR-HvCCR4<sup>mEEP</sup> plasmid as the pBYR-HvCCR4 using the BYSMV vector. We first inoculated BYR-HvCCR4<sup>mEEP</sup> and BYR-HvCCR4 in two half parts of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves to compare their infectivity. In consistence with transiently expressed HvCCR4<sup>mEEP</sup> and HvCCR4 in minireplicon assays shown in Figure 4B, BYR-HvCCR4<sup>mEEP</sup> exhibited a significantly reduced infectivity compared with BYR-HvCCR4, which was revealed by the RFP fluorescence and accumulation of RFP as shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1. Since replication of BYR-HvCCR4<sup>mEEP</sup> is very weak in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves, we cannot rescue the BYR-HvCCR4<sup>mEEP</sup> infections in planthoppers and barley plants.

Thus, the direct CCR4-P interaction has no effect on the function of P protein. Moreover, the EEP domain is required for the positive effect of on BYSMV replication (Figure 4B, Figure 8, and the new Figure 6—figure supplement 1), indicating that the CCR4 deadenylation activity is essential for the CCR4 function in BYSMV infections.</p><p>The rhabdovirus P protein should form functional dimer structures in virus replication according to the review paper.
