Regular RNA G-quadruplexes are highly stable due to stacked planar arrangements connected by short loops. However, reports of irregular quadruplex structures are increasing and recent genome-wide studies suggest that they influence gene expression. We have investigated a grouping of G<sub>2</sub>-motifs in the UTRs of eight genes involved in polyamine biosynthesis, and concluded that several likely form novel metastable RNA G-quadruplexes. We performed a comprehensive biophysical characterization of their properties, comparing them to a reference G-quadruplex. Using cellular assays, together with polyamine-depleting and quadruplex-stabilizing ligands, we discovered how some of these motifs regulate and sense polyamine levels, creating feedback loops during polyamine biosynthesis. Using high-resolution <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrated that a long-looped quadruplex in the <italic>AZIN1</italic> mRNA co-exists in salt-dependent equilibria with a hairpin structure. This study expands the repertoire of regulatory G-quadruplexes and demonstrates how they act in unison to control metabolite homeostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>polyamine</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>quadruplex</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd><kwd>pyridostatin</kwd><kwd>thioflavin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008273</institution-id><institution>Novartis Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lightfoot</surname><given-names>Helen Louise</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NCCR RNA and Disease</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cléry</surname><given-names>Antoine</given-names></name><name><surname>Allain</surname><given-names>Frédéric Hai-Trieu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An ensemble of conserved G2-quadruplex structures in the untranslated regions of messenger RNAs from genes in the polyamine bioysynthesis pathway sense polyamine levels and regulate polyamine synthesis in cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polyamines (PAs) are small poly-cationic molecules present at millimolar concentrations in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lightfoot and Hall, 2014</xref>). In mammals, the dominant PAs are spermine and spermidine. PAs play critical roles in many processes but their mechanistic workings are rarely investigated and are poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller-Fleming et al., 2015</xref>). In cells, PAs bind nucleic acids in two ways: with un-specific interactions where they diffuse relatively freely around the polynucleotide, and with site-specific chelation in defined binding pockets with associated function. Levels of PAs are controlled on multiple levels, including synthesis, inter-conversion and depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casero and Pegg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pegg, 2009</xref>), as well as uptake and efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdulhussein and Wallace, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, PA-directed feedback loops operate at RNA and protein levels, whereby low levels of PAs are corrected with increased expression of PA synthesis enzymes and decreased activities of negative regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller-Fleming et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perez-Leal and Merali, 2012</xref>). For instance, several PA synthesis proteins (PSPs) (AZIN1, AMD1, PMOX, ODC1, SAT1) are subject to PA-mediated regulation <italic>via</italic> short open reading frames (uORFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanov et al., 2010</xref>). For example, ODC1 is the limiting factor in PA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller-Fleming et al., 2015</xref>): it has a highly structured 5’UTR and its translation is strongly affected by PA levels. It is also negatively regulated by binding to OAZ proteins, which themselves are regulated by binding AZIN1. PAs bind to nascent OAZ polypeptides, activating a frameshift needed for production of full-length OAZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kurian et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A considerable part of gene regulation is controlled by secondary/tertiary structures in UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wan et al., 2011</xref>). Examples of structures are stem-loops, pseudoknots and riboswitches, which serve as sensors, reacting rapidly to inputs such as changes in the concentrations of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), metabolites, or even changes in temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wan et al., 2011</xref>). The intramolecular G-quadruplex consists of stacked guanine tetrads connected by three loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Millevoi et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). They self-assemble through Hoogsteen binding and π-π interactions, stabilized by metals or proteins. The stability of G-quadruplexes is governed by the number of G-quartets, the loop length and composition, the flanking nucleotides and salt conditions. Although their structures are difficult to characterize in vivo, G-quadruplexes are recognized as important elements regulating gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rhodes and Lipps, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Millevoi et al., 2012</xref>), and they are increasingly linked to diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thandapani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conlon et al., 2016</xref>). Two recent genome-wide studies identified thousands of such motifs, the majority of which comprised canonical short-looped G<sub>3</sub>-tracts (G<sub>3</sub>-quadruplexes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kwok et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo and Bartel, 2016</xref>). In the latter study, the authors presented evidence that stable G<sub>3</sub>-quadruplexes (i.e. strong enough to stall reverse transcriptase) in eukaryotic cells were frequently unwound; this suggested the physiological relevance of quadruplex structures should not be automatically inferred from their stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo and Bartel, 2016</xref>). Consistent with this, several hundred putative metastable RNA G<sub>2</sub>-quadruplexes have also been predicted throughout the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kwok et al., 2016a</xref>). So far, few G<sub>2</sub>-quadruplexes have been studied in detail biophysically, structurally and functionally, all of which carry short loops that are ≤7 nucleotides (nt) in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mullen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morris et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cammas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kralovicova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Murat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blice-Baum and Mihailescu, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Weldon et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36362.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Polyamines (PAs) and G-quadruplexes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) PA biosynthesis pathway and summary of the roles/regulation of putative quadruplex sequences (PQS’s) on PA biosynthesis.

Using cellular reporter assays we showed that twelve of these covering eight PSPs altered reporter activity in comparison to mutants. Strikingly, most of the PQS’s increased or reduced reporter expression such that in the setting of their native UTRs they would reduce PA levels. This suggested they might act in unison as regulatory elements to control PA homoeostasis. Using a comprehensive set of independent in vitro biophysical methods, we generated strong supporting data for seven quadruplexes. These included a long-looped conserved quadruplex in the AZIN1 mRNA, which we demonstrated with high-resolution NMR spectroscopy, coexists in a salt-dependent equilibrium with hairpin structures. The activities of four PQS’s from <italic>OAZ2</italic>, <italic>AZIN1</italic> and <italic>SMS</italic> correlated with the levels of PAs in cells, suggesting that these G<sub>2</sub>-PQS’s respond to PA levels by an undetermined mechanism(s) in feedback loops. Overall, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized additional mechanism of PA self-regulation involving the entire pathway. We expect that such mechanisms through G-quadruplexes may be a common feature in other metabolic pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Predicted G<sub>2</sub>-PQS’s in PSP UTRs</title><p>We searched for PQS’s in the UTRs of PSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) using the algorithm QGRS Mapper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kikin et al., 2006</xref>), which predicts the ability of a sequence containing G-repeats to fold into (in many cases several) distinct quadruplexes and assigns them a stability score (G-score) based on published biophysical data. Canonical G<sub>3</sub>-quadruplexes are highly stable in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wieland and Hartig, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pandey et al., 2013</xref>) and arguably could be considered as ‘thermodynamic sinks’ that are unsuitable for fast structural changes during regulation of gene expression. Therefore, to identify more dynamic analogues in PSP UTRs, we applied a weak minimum consensus sequence (G quartets ≥ 2; total PQS sequence length ≤30) as search criteria. No G<sub>3-</sub>tract PQS’s (G<sub>3</sub>-PQS: i.e. with the potential to form a G<sub>3</sub>-quadruplex structure) were found by the algorithm in the UTRs. Intriguingly however, it revealed 20 G<sub>2-</sub>PQS’s across eleven 5’UTRs, and 15 G<sub>2</sub>-PQS’s in ten 3’UTRs of PSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Within many of the UTRs multiple overlapping G<sub>2</sub>-PQS’s were predicted and QGRS Mapper highlighted the PQS expected to form the most stable quadruplex structure. It seemed plausible that equilibria might exist between distinct PQS's within these G<sub>2</sub>-rich regions, possibly influenced by local conditions. To help assess if these G<sub>2</sub>-containing motifs are functional in cells, the UTR containing the PQS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) was cloned 5’- or 3’- to the <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase coding region in a dual luciferase reporter plasmid. Dual reporter assays are a preferred means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Halder et al., 2012</xref>) to investigate the function of putative G-quadruplexes in cells. Using full-length UTRs where possible, the properties of a putative regulatory element are investigated by comparison to those of a minimally-mutated control. Thus, we mutated or deleted a minimum number of selected guanines in each PQS so as to prevent the principal PQS, as well as alternative quadruplexes, from forming in the control reporters. During the design we were similarly mindful of recent reports that nucleobases other than G, or even a G-vacancy may substitute for G in a quadruplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Švehlová et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The influence of each PQS on reporter activity was then assessed by comparison with its respective control after plasmid transfection into HeLa cells.</p><p>Eight from 20 PQS’s in the 5’UTRs of PSPs affected reporter gene activity. Mutation of PQS’s from <italic>ARG2</italic> (ARG2<sub>5Q1</sub>: 40%), <italic>AZIN1</italic> (AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub>: 49%), <italic>SMS</italic> (SMS<sub>5Q1</sub>: 75%) and <italic>ODC1</italic> (ODC1<sub>5Q2</sub>: 28%; ODC1<sub>5Q3</sub>: 41%) increased <italic>Renilla</italic> activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Therefore, these PQS’s inhibit gene expression and in their natural 5’UTRs would be expected to suppress PA levels. SAT1 and OAZ2 are negative regulators of PA synthesis. In cells, translation of SAT1 is increased in response to high PAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casero and Pegg, 2009</xref>), possibly through an uORF and/or a stem-loop in its coding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perez-Leal and Merali, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Its most stable predicted quadruplex (SAT1<sub>5Q1</sub>) is conserved in mouse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) and is unusual because it contains no first loop: parallel intramolecular G<sub>3</sub>-quadruplex structures containing no first loop in DNA were recently described and characterized using a combination of biophysical techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Piazza et al., 2017</xref>). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Surprisingly however, we found that mutation of three nucleotides in this PQS reduced <italic>Renilla</italic> activity by &gt;30 fold, implying that this G<sub>2</sub>-PQS contributes strongly to SAT1 regulation. <italic>OAZ2</italic> has four PQS’s in its 5'-UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>): mutation of OAZ2<sub>5Q1</sub> inhibited <italic>Renilla</italic> activity (195%), whereas mutation of OAZ2<sub>5Q2</sub> enhanced activity (46%). Thus, these PQS’s might influence PA synthesis in context-dependent fashion. Mutations in four PQS’s in the 3'-UTRs of PSPs increased <italic>Renilla</italic> activities (ARG2<sub>3Q1</sub>: 52%; OAZ1<sub>3Q1</sub>: 44%; OAZ3<sub>3Q1</sub>: 31%; SMS<sub>3Q1</sub>: 39%). Accordingly, in their natural environments PQS’s from <italic>ARG2</italic> and <italic>SMS</italic> 3’-UTRs would also act as inhibitors of PA synthesis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36362.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>G<sub>2</sub>-PQS’s regulate luciferase reporter genes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Effect of PQS’s from PSP UTRs on <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase activity in HeLa cells; PQS's ARG2<sub>5Q1</sub>, AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub>, OAZ2<sub>5Q1</sub>, OAZ2<sub>5Q2</sub>, ODC1<sub>5Q2</sub>, ODC1<sub>5Q3</sub>, SMS<sub>5Q1</sub>, SAT1<sub>5Q1</sub>, ARG2<sub>3Q1</sub>, OAZ1<sub>3Q1</sub>, OAZ3<sub>3Q1</sub> and SMS<sub>3Q1</sub> show a statistically significant difference to their mutated controls (n = 3–7; *p≤0.05, **p≤0.01, ***p≤0.001); remaining PQS's are designated as inactive (n&gt;/=2); error bars represent standard error (SE)).

Furthermore, Thioflavin T staining produced greater fluorescence emission for SMS<sub>5Q1</sub> and SMS<sub>3Q1</sub> RNAs than their controls. A reversible UV melting transition (ΔAbs: ~0.2) with potassium-concentration dependence provided additional evidence of quadruplex formation for SMS<sub>5Q1</sub> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and not for SMS<sub>5Q1M</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), and SMS<sub>5Q1</sub> and SMS<sub>5Q1M</sub> RNAs produced distinct CD spectra with peaks at 278 nm and 273 nm respectively.

This was supported by a mFOLD analysis of the AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub>-containing sequence, which yielded a stable stem-loop structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>In summary, a variety of measurements added strong supporting evidence that short-looped G<sub>2</sub>-PQS’s, and at least one of the long-looped G<sub>2</sub>-PQS’s formed quadruplexes in vitro. Short oligoribonucleotides containing SAT1<sub>5Q1</sub> and ARG2<sub>3Q1</sub> possibly formed intermolecular quadruplex structures. For the two other G<sub>2</sub>-PQS’s the data was either inconclusive, possibly reflecting the limitations of in vitro methods (i.e. SMS<sub>3Q1</sub>) or other competing structures dominated in vitro possibly due to the absence of auxiliary factors present in cells (i.e. AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub>). Therefore, we looked for evidence for these long-looped quadruplex structures in cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PSP long-looped G<sub>2</sub>-PQS's perform as quadruplexes in cells</title><p>A common means to probe the functionality of a PQS in cells is with pyridostatin (PDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bugaut et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Murat et al., 2014</xref>), a ligand which binds to many RNA quadruplexes. When used at micromolar concentrations in vitro, this ligand usually stabilizes quadruplexes. In order to provide further insight on the importance of RNA quadruplexes on PA regulation, we treated cells with PDS, where stabilization of the aforementioned G<sub>2</sub>-PQS's would be expected to show suppression of PA levels. Using a standard cell viability assay and monitoring <italic>β</italic>-actin levels, we first established that PDS could be used without toxicity in HeLa cells at concentrations up to 128 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then treated cells with PDS and assayed intracellular PAs using a protocol in which PAs from cell lysates are quantified by analytical HPLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morgan, 1998</xref>). Indeed, we found that low micromolar concentrations of PDS strongly reduced spermidine and spermine levels in cells by 70-80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). To determine whether these effects were due to changes in levels of PSPs, we assayed endogenous SMS and AZIN1 proteins, both of which are expressed in HeLa cells and for which good antibodies are available. PDS treatment produced a 50% decrease in endogenous SMS protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Next, to examine whether SMS<sub>5Q1</sub> and SMS<sub>3Q1</sub> might have contributed to this outcome, we tested PDS on the SMS<sub>5Q1</sub> and SMS<sub>3Q1</sub> reporter genes. These assays provided an additional information: they enabled comparison of the effects of stabilizing (increasing) G<sub>2</sub>-PQS function (with PDS), with the effects of abolishing G<sub>2</sub>-PQS function by mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Indeed, PDS treatment of cells transfected with both SMS<sub>5Q1</sub> and SMS<sub>3Q1</sub> reporters dose-dependently reduced luciferase activity by 20-30% compared to matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), as expected for quadruplexes which suppress gene expression, and fully consistent with the effects of mutating SMS<sub>5Q1</sub> and SMS<sub>3Q1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Taken together, the experiments provided evidence in cells that the suppression of PAs by quadruplex-stabilizing PDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) was consistent with reduced SMS protein, and this may have been at least partly due to the additive action of G<sub>2</sub>-motifs SMS<sub>5Q1</sub> and SMS<sub>3Q1</sub> in its UTRs.</p><p>PDS (64 μM) yielded a 100-150% increase in both endogenous AZIN1 protein and the AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub> reporter (relative to AZIN1<sub>5Q1M</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). This regulation under reduced polyamine conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) was in the opposite direction to that of mutating AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub> under normal polyamine conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Hence, rather than stabilizing the quadruplex we were possibly observing a strong feedback response to global PA suppression by PDS, whereby cells activated AZIN1 in order to raise PA levels, at least partly via the AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub> element.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>PSPs self-regulate through some G<sub>2</sub>-PQS’s</title><p>Self-regulation and feedback mechanisms are strong features at multiple points in the PA biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller-Fleming et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perez-Leal and Merali, 2012</xref>).

Nevertheless, we examined the effects of PA addition (a mix of putrescine, spermine and spermidine at 0.01-1 mM concentrations) to cells expressing a selection of G<sub>2</sub>-PQS reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">6</xref>). We observed small reproducible statistically-significant decreases in Renilla activity from the AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub>, SMS<sub>5Q1</sub> and SMS<sub>3Q1</sub> reporters after normalization to matched controls, while SAT1<sub>5Q1</sub> and OAZ2<sub>5Q1</sub> responded with increased luciferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">6</xref>). Once again, given that AZIN1 and SMS drive PA synthesis and SAT1 and OAZ2 are suppressors of PAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), this data also suggested that these motifs participate in feedback loops, whereby cells attempt to maintain normal levels of PAs in the presence of high concentrations of exogenous polyamines.</p><p>Next, we turned to two ligands which deplete cells of PAs by distinct mechanisms: D,L-α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), which inhibits ODC1, and N-(3-aminopropyl)-cyclohexylamine (APCHA), which inhibits SMS. Consistent with expectations, levels of spermine and spermidine were reduced significantly (to 32 and 24%, respectively) in HeLa cells following combined treatment with DFMO (500 μM) and APCHA (100 μM) for 5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>). Notably, ligand treatment did not change luciferase activity from most reporter plasmids, which was generally very stable after normalization to matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">6</xref> and data not shown). However, the ligands increased the activity of AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub>, and SMS<sub>3Q1</sub> reporters (114 and 16% respectively), and decreased activity of OAZ2<sub>5Q1</sub> (81%), compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>) (we were unable to assess effects on SAT1<sub>5Q1</sub> because of too low luciferase counts from SAT1<sub>5Q1M</sub>). To confirm that these effects were due to ligand-induced PA suppression, and not unspecific toxicity, we performed a rescue in which the spermine/spermidine mix was added to the drug-treated cells. The PA mix reversed the effects of the ligands on luciferase counts from AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub>, SMS<sub>3Q1</sub> and OAZ2<sub>5Q1</sub> compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>), and it had no effect on reporters which were unaffected by the ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">6</xref>).

Structure predictions by QGRS Mapper and M-Fold suggested that it might adopt both a G-quadruplex and a hairpin structure, which prompted us to investigate it in further detail, since others have described how RNAs can equilibrate between stem loop and G-quadruplex structures in cation-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pandey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mirihana Arachchilage et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kwok et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olsthoorn, 2014</xref>).

Hence, we studied the structural behaviour of AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub> (herewith denoted as AZIN1<sub>wt</sub> for the NMR study), using high-resolution NMR spectroscopy, where we recorded the chemical shifts of its imino proton signals in the presence of different cations. Imino signals at 12–14 ppm are characteristic for Watson-Crick base pairs. The imino signals at approximately 10–12 ppm are characteristic for guanine imino protons involved in H-bonds derived from GU base pairs or from Hoogsteen-like interactions with the oxygen containing acceptor groups of another guanine in the context of G-quadruplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jin et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 1991a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">1991b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith and Feigon, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bahrami et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bugaut et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We recorded 1D <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of the five short-looped PQS's (NRAS control, ARG2<sub>5Q1</sub>, OAZ2<sub>5Q1</sub>, OAZ2<sub>5Q2</sub>, ODC1<sub>5Q2</sub>) and the long-looped, less stable SMS<sub>5Q1</sub> for which biophysical data (Thioflavin T staining and UV<sub>295</sub>-melting; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) indicated the presence of quadruplex structures.

We then measured <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of AZIN1<sub>wt</sub>.

When we increased the concentration of KCl (from 100 to 200 mM), we observed a decrease in intensity for the Watson-Crick imino signals (12–13.4 ppm), but not for those in the Hoogsteen region, consistent with a shift to a quadruplex conformation under increased K<sup>+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).

We substituted the first G<sub>2</sub>-tract at the 5´-end of AZIN1<sub>wt</sub> with adenines to give AZIN1<sub>neg</sub>, thereby preventing formation of an intramolecular G-quadruplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Indeed, peaks between 10.8–11.2 ppm disappeared in the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). In the second mutant AZIN1<sub>pos</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>), the 11-nt long loop was exchanged for a single adenine. This was expected to yield a more stable G<sub>2</sub>-quadruplex with a shorter loop and prevent the formation of a stem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pandey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, the spectra of AZIN1<sub>pos</sub> yielded imino signals in a narrow window between 10.8–11.4 ppm, and none in the presumed stem region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Furthermore, superimposition of spectra from AZIN1<sub>wt</sub> and AZIN1<sub>pos</sub> revealed substantial overlap in the presumed quadruplex-specific region, supporting the presence of the G<sub>2</sub>-quadruplex conformer at 100 mM KCl. The small shift downfield of the imino peaks for AZIN1<sub>pos</sub> might have resulted from an altered environment due to the absence of the long loop L1.</p><p>To confirm that the peaks in our spectra around 11 ppm with AZIN1<sub>wt</sub> were indeed from G imino-protons, we in vitro-transcribed an <sup>15</sup>N-labeled version of AZIN1<sub>wt</sub> and recorded a <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similarly to what was previously reported for RNA G-quadruplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nasiri et al., 2016</xref>), we observed that these protons were bound to <sup>15</sup>N atoms with a chemical shift of about 145 ppm. This chemical shift is characteristic of a guanine N1 atom bearing a proton involved in a G-quadruplex or GU base-pairing. Imino protons of GU base pairs can be assigned by a <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H 2D NOESY, due to strong NOE's between the imino protons of the guanine and the uridine; in addition, U imino protons in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC are expected at approximately 160 ppm for N3. Since neither strong imino-imino NOE's nor H3-N3 imino cross-peaks were observed in our spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), we concluded that the cross-peaks observed in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC of AZIN1<sub>wt</sub> between 10–11 ppm in the proton dimension originate from a G-quadruplex structure. G-quadruplexes also produce distinct NOE patterns involving the imino, amino and aromatic protons of the guanine nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Macaya et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith and Feigon, 1992</xref>). Typical for a G-quadruplex, NOEs between neighbouring imino groups and also between imino and amino groups (shifted to 9–10 ppm compared to Watson-Crick base-pairs) were present in the 2D NOESY spectrum obtained with AZIN1<sub>wt</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nasiri et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we accumulated evidence for the coexistence of stem structures and a G-quadruplex structure with the AZIN1<sub>wt</sub> sequence in 100 mM KCl. In addition, we demonstrated that the nature and concentration of metal ions in solution could direct the equilibrium towards either the stem conformers or the G-quadruplex. To our knowledge this is the first report of a mammalian sequence being in equilibrium between stem structures and a non-canonical RNA G<sub>2</sub>-quadruplex structure with an exceptionally long loop.</p><p>Data from the experiments in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) suggested that PAs might regulate an equilibrium between a stem loop and a G<sub>2</sub>-quadruplex structure in AZIN1<sub>wt</sub>. Therefore, we also investigated the influence of added spermine on the imino protons of AZIN<sub>wt</sub>. The proximity of spermine amino groups to the imino protons involved in base pairing might be expected to lower the intensity of their signals through exchange. Indeed, a titration of AZIN1<sub>wt</sub> with spermine to a ratio of 1:2 revealed that increasing polyamine significantly decreased the imino signals of presumed G-U wobble base pairs (at 11.8 and 10.5–10.8 ppm), as well as the G<sub>2</sub>-quadruplex signal set (at 10.8–11.2 ppm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) (we were unable to increase the spermine concentration further since at a 1:3 ratio in RNA:Spm precipitation was observed). In addition, we observed small chemical shift perturbations peaks upon spermine addition, which also suggested an interaction. The Watson-Crick imino signals of the hairpin forms (at 12–13.4 ppm) were less affected. Thus, spermine seems to preferentially interact with the quadruplex AZIN<sub>5Q1</sub> and G-U parts of the stem-containing structures.</p><p>Additional supporting evidence for such an interaction of spermine with AZIN<sub>wt</sub> was available from independent in vitro assays. Incubation of AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub> (but not three mutated controls) with spermine in the presence of 1 mM K<sup>+</sup> produced a new negative melting transition at 295 nm, consistent with a quadruplex structure (ΔAbs: ~0.02; T<sub>m</sub>: ~38°C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Long-looped SAT1<sub>5Q1</sub> showed no such change, whereas a minor effect was seen with SMS<sub>5Q1</sub> (not shown). Under the same conditions, the T<sub>m</sub> of the presumed stem measured at 260 nm decreased from 49°C to 28°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). We also assessed the effects of spermine on AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub> and three controls in the Thioflavin T assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), with the view that if the presence of spermine stabilized formation of a quadruplex, then fluorescence should be increased. Thioflavin T (4.5 µM) was added to pre-annealed AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub> and controls after incubation with spermine. Thioflavin T fluorescence was similar for all four sequences in the absence of spermine. However, in the presence of spermine, AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub> fluorescence increased 52%. These data provided additional evidence in vitro that spermine might alter the equilibrium dynamics of AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub> substructures, destabilizing the stem structure in order to form a G<sub>2</sub>-quadruplex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Conformational changes in dynamic RNA structures alter gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dethoff et al., 2012</xref>). They are triggered by cellular signals such as the binding of RNA helicases, RBPs, and small ligands, which change the energy landscape of the RNA structure after lowering barriers to conformational exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dethoff et al., 2012</xref>). The G-quadruplex is one of several important RNA structural elements, that are widespread throughout the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kwok et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo and Bartel, 2016</xref>), particularly in UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huppert et al., 2008</xref>), where they play roles in transcription termination, polyadenylation, splicing and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Millevoi et al., 2012</xref>). The canonical G<sub>3</sub>-quadruplex has short-loops and a compact structure that is extremely stable in the presence of cations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pandey et al., 2013</xref>). For example, its stability correlates with its capacity to inhibit translation from 5'UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Halder et al., 2009</xref>) and G<sub>3</sub>-quadruplexes reportedly need to be unfolded to avoid stalling of reverse transcriptase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo and Bartel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kwok et al., 2016a</xref>). Using methods that would not identify dynamic (i.e. transiently unfolded) quadruplexes or those strongly folded in the absence of potassium, it was shown that canonical quadruplexes are frequently held unfolded in eukaryotic cells by a dedicated machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo and Bartel, 2016</xref>), possibly by specialized helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bugaut and Balasubramanian, 2012</xref>). However, examples of irregular G-quadruplexes with uncharacterized structures, lower thermodynamic stabilities (in vitro) and distinct biophysical and electronic properties are increasingly proposed. In particular, recent transcriptome-wide searches have identified large numbers of putative G-quadruplexes with G<sub>2</sub>- instead of G<sub>3</sub>-tracts, including structures with long loops and even bulged loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kwok et al., 2016a</xref>). G<sub>2</sub>-quadruplexes are less stable than their canonical G<sub>3</sub>-counterparts, and long intervening loops further lower their stability in model sequences in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pandey et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, the dynamic character of a metastable G-quadruplex lends itself to participation in equilibria with other secondary or tertiary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang and Balasubramanian, 2012</xref>) where a change in conformation in response to a signal serves to adjust gene expression. Here, we demonstrated using high resolution <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy one example of such conformational changes under different salt conditions involving the G<sub>2</sub>-motif present in the 5'UTR of AZIN1.</p><p>PAs are regulated by an astounding array of unique and conserved mechanisms involving the enzymes and factors of the PSP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lightfoot and Hall, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller-Fleming et al., 2015</xref>). Many of these mechanisms center on secondary structures and uORFs in the UTRs of PSP mRNAs, thereby affecting translation. Here we describe 12 G<sub>2</sub>-PQS’s, several of which likely form G<sub>2</sub>-quadruplexes, in the 5’- and 3’UTR’s of the PSPs ARG2 (two motifs), ODC1 (two motifs), SMS (two motifs), OAZ2 (two motifs), OAZ3, OAZ1, AZIN1 and SAT1, which were identified using the standard QGRS predictive tool. Seven of them are likely short-looped G<sub>2</sub>-quadruplexes with typical G-scores. The remainder, which was active at the protein level, all possessed one unusually long loop and returned correspondingly low G-scores. Using matched pairs of wild-type and mutated reporters for each individual G<sub>2</sub>-PQS, we showed that most of those that affected reporter gene activity would suppress PA synthesis in their native UTR setting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We employed multiple assays on nine PSP G<sub>2</sub>-PQS’s in vitro, comparing them to a G<sub>3</sub>-quadruplex reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The four short-looped G<sub>2</sub>-PQS’s behaved similarly to the reference providing strong evidence for a quadruplex structure. Three of the long-looped G<sub>2</sub>-PQS’s (SMS<sub>5Q1</sub>, ARG2<sub>3Q1</sub>, AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub>) also showed many characteristics typical of a G-quadruplex in vitro, albeit with lower stabilities. In addition, data from cell assays provided persuasive evidence for the structure and function of long-looped G<sub>2</sub>-quadruplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>PDS, a ligand which generally stabilizes RNA G-quadruplexes, altered the expression of reporters containing the G<sub>2</sub>-PQS’s from SMS and AZIN1 UTRs, and also levels of native SMS and AZIN1 proteins in cells. Small effects (20–30%) on the individual reporters appeared at PDS concentrations of 16–256 µM, however 15-fold lower ligand concentrations sufficed to reduce endogenous spermine and spermidine levels by &gt;70–80%. We took this as a possible indication that PDS acts additively on individual G<sub>2</sub>-quadruplexes in the pathway to produce a strong cooperative suppression of PAs. In addition, several G<sub>2</sub>-PQS’s responded to changing levels of PAs in cells with feedback, for example PA addition suppressed the reporters from SMS and AZIN1 (drivers of PA synthesis), and activated those of SAT1 and OAZ2 (PA inhibitors).</p><p>G-quadruplexes in regulatory regions affect gene expression in several different ways depending on their structures and their positions. Indeed, in our study most of the G<sub>2</sub>-PQS’s decreased - but a few increased - expression of their host genes; some affected protein levels exclusively, while others were active on the RNA levels. The majority of the motifs scored positively in assays consistent with a regulatory role in PA biosynthesis. In some cases they may synergize with other regulatory elements, such as uORFs that collectively serve as PA sensors, making minor individual contributions - and a major collective contribution - to the control of PA levels in an RNA structure-driven network. This is in line with a recent hypothesis that PAs are regulated by a common, yet undiscovered chemical or physical mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller-Fleming et al., 2015</xref>). One possible function of such a network would be to control expression of the ‘polyamine modulon’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Igarashi and Kashiwagi, 2011</xref>), a family of proteins whose translation is regulated by PAs in bacteria, yeast and mammalian systems to control cell proliferation. Misregulation of PAs is also directly associated with tumorigenesis and several polyamine inhibitors have been investigated in cancer clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casero and Marton, 2007</xref>). The response of the PQS’s in PSP genes to PAs may help guard against cues which increase proliferation and cellular transformation/migration.</p><p>A principle function of PAs in cells is to bind and stabilize RNA structures. The monocations K<sup>+</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> strongly stabilize G-quadruplexes by binding in the G-quadruplex cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guiset Miserachs et al., 2016</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that the charged terminal amines of PAs may bind directly to G<sub>2</sub>-quadruplexes, possibly substituting for K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> in the tetrad. Indeed, polyamines have been reported to stabilize, destabilize and alter DNA quadruplex structures in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keniry and Owen, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wen and Xie, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Keniry and Owen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miyoshi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keniry, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qi et al., 2014</xref>) and in one case evidence for polyamine-modulation of a DNA quadruplex in cells was presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumar et al., 2009</xref>). In our in vitro study, AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub> switched between a stem-loop and a G-quadruplex in the presence of different concentrations of salt and spermine. Overall, this behaviour may be reminiscent of the Iron Responsive Element, which is an RNA stem loop in the 5`UTR of mRNAs that encodes a family of proteins required for iron metabolism and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Theil, 2015</xref>); binding of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to the IRE alters translation of these mRNAs as a coordinated feedback control mechanism. Our work may indicate a similar role for PAs in PA self-regulation though altering or switching RNA structural elements present within PA biosynthesis genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>HeLa cells (ATCC, CCL-2, STR profiling and Mycoplasma tested) were maintained in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with dialyzed fetal bovine serum (10%, Invitrogen) and aminoguanidine (1 mM, TCI Chemicals) in humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37°C.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Reviewing Editor Douglas Black and Senior Editor James Manley. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Cyril Dominguez (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work cannot be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>There was general agreement among the reviewers and the reviewing editor that the identification of regulatory G-quadruplexes was of some interest and that several findings had merit. However, it was also thought that the analysis did not go very deep. Instead of doing a limited analysis of multiple elements, it would be more significant to do a conclusive analysis of one or two. Notably, neither the existence of the identified elements as quadruplexes, especially those with 0-length loops, nor the role of the elements in controlling polyamine biosynthesis, were demonstrated to a high degree of certainty. For the study to be of interest to the broad audience of <italic>eLife</italic>, these findings would need much stronger support. Generating such data would take much longer than the maximum 8 weeks allowed for a revision. Thus, although some of the initial responses were positive, the consensus decision was to decline the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this paper Hall and Lightfoot provide a survey of locations of possible G quartet structures within 5' and 3' UTRs of mRNAs for enzymes in the polyamine pathway(s) of mammalian cells. Their interesting idea is that perhaps since polyamines might interact with G-quartets, then G-quartet structures might signal the presence of regulatory elements that respond to changes in polyamine levels in the cell.</p><p>They develop several assays for their analysis – expression of the target gene as wt and as a mutation designed to ablate the putative G-quartet (PQS) in vitro and in cells – comprise one set of assays. Other assays include structural and dye binding assays on model RNAs that are designed to distinguish G-quartets from other RNA folds. Finally, a bold in vivo approach is taken to hyperstabilize G-quartets with pyridostatin in vivo and see how this affects expression of endogenous genes and reporters, and the results are mostly consistent with the mutational data.</p><p>A major concern is that there are too many genes studied at too shallow a depth. There are many lower resolution and correlative assays employed so that the conclusions rely on the aggregate acceptance of many different assays each with different alternative explanations, and some of which work better on some genes and selected elements than others. The assays for structure determination aren't nucleotide resolution, and it remains tricky to predict these structures confidently by computational methods. Overall the need to accept this as an aggregate survey weakens the conclusiveness of the presentation. Having done this interesting survey, the authors are likely interested in higher resolution study of one or a few of these elements in detail that would really nail down the idea that G-quartets interact with polyamines to control expression of polyamine metabolic enzymes.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In the manuscript, Lightfoot and Hall describe the effect of transient G<sub>2</sub>-quadruplexes on the expression levels of proteins involved in the polyamine biosynthesis pathway.</p><p>Enzymes involved in this pathway are regulated at different levels including transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.</p><p>The authors hypothesized that these levels could be regulated at the post-transcriptional level by specific RNA structures, G-quadruplexes. Indeed, RNA G-quadruplexes have already been shown to play a role in RNA metabolism regulation, such as translation, splicing,.</p><p>Using bioinformatic tools, the authors identified putative G-quadruplex forming sequences (PQS) in the 5' and 3'UTR of many genes involved in this pathway. They validated the effect of these putative G-quadruplexes using in vivo and in vitro assays on WT and mutated sequences, as well as the effect of a well-characterized G-quadruplex stabilizer.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well written, clear, and sound. The authors nicely demonstrate that while many PQS do not have any effect on protein expression, other have a significant influence. The study of mutated sequences in itself is controversial (is the effect of the mutation due to a disruption of the G-quadruplex or a change in the ratio of proteins bound is always difficult to assess) but the complementary approach of testing the effect of a G-quadruplex stabilizer on protein expression makes the conclusions strong and compelling.</p><p>The final conclusion of the manuscript that spermine itself stabilizes G-quadruplex is interesting but lacks in my view strong evidence. The in cells experiments cannot provide evidence that the observed effects are direct and the in vitro validation assays have been done only on one PQS (AZIN1). It would be interesting to test the effect of spermine of the stability of other PQS sequence that respond to spermine in cells such as SMS<sub>5Q1</sub>, SMS<sub>3Q1</sub>, SAT1<sub>5Q1</sub> and OAZ2<sub>5Q1</sub>. It would also be interesting to compare the effect of spermine and PDS on G-quadruplex stabilization in vitro.</p><p>Subsection “PSP long-looped G<sub>2</sub>-PQSs perform as quadruplexes in cells”: The authors observed that the effect of PDS on AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub> was opposite to what was expected based on the mutant results. However, AZIN1 also has a PQS in its 3'UTR (AZIN1<sub>3Q1</sub>). It would be interesting to test the effect of PDS on this reporter.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is a well described study by Lightfoot and Hall that demonstrates many G-rich sequences regulate the RNA and protein levels of proteins important in polyamide (PA) biosynthesis. The authors identify many putative G-quadruplexes in the 5' and 3' UTRs of PA protein-coding genes and show that some of these elements can form G-quadruplex structures in vitro and provide evidence that they may function via these structures using a small molecule known to bind G-quadruplex structures. This work adds to our understanding of how these genes are regulated through potential G-quadruplex structures. Although this is an interesting body of work, several concerns reduce enthusiasm for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) A major concern is that there doesn't appear to be any data in this manuscript or other publications (search by this reviewer of the literature) that show G-quadruplexes can form without a single nucleotide loop (usually defined as 1-7 nucleotides although longer loops exist as previously demonstrated and in this work). If these references exist it would be helpful for the authors to include. Structurally, it doesn't seem possible for the four Gs to be split into two parts of the G-quad. This should be demonstrated or explained if previously published data hasn't demonstrated this unique G-quadruplex structure before. This point applies to the elements in SAT1, AZIN1 and OAZ3.</p><p>2) Presumably the authors tested if polyamines bind and stabilize / destabilize the putative G<sub>2</sub> quadruplex structures. These results should be included or discussed because otherwise the reader is left wondering how the polyamines self-regulate except for the AZIN1 example. For the AZIN1 data, the authors should correct ΔAbs of ~0.2 to ~0.02 in the Results section (Long-looped AZIN1 G<sub>2</sub>-quadruplex is induced by PAs in vitro). Again, please provide a rationale for how a G-quad can form without a loop nucleotide (see point #1) and not just state that high resolution structural studies will need to be performed (Discussion section). If the authors demonstrate G-quads can form without a loop this would be a major finding for the field and would be of great interest. The data for the 3 putative G-quads lacking loops is weak compared to the data provided for the G-quads with loops.</p><p>3) A more minor concern is the data shown in Figure 2. Several of the gel images for the Thioflavin-T with the G-quadruplexes don't appear to match the quantitation shown in the next panel although this could be explained by loading differences. For example, for ODC1<sub>5Q2</sub> there is a 2-fold difference in fluorescence quantitation, which doesn't seem to match the adjacent gel image. This might be explained by the significant difference in the loading of RNA seen in the first panel. If the RNA concentration levels or ability to detect RNA is significantly different for some species it may call into question the ability to detect differences between WT and mutant RNAs.</p><p>4) A minor point is why do the authors not spend more time in the discussion on the most significant PA regulatory element they identified in SAT1 (30-fold change)?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;Control of the polyamine biosynthesis pathway by G<sub>2</sub>-quadruplexes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. The evaluation has been overseen by Douglas Black as Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. Your revised article has been reviewed by two of the previous reviewers and one new reviewer. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Cyril Dominguez.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. It was generally agreed that the submission was much improved, but additional work was needed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Given the very loose restraints on the G<sub>2</sub> search criteria it is not surprising that many sequences were found. However, it seems possible that the G<sub>2</sub>s could be involved in alternative secondary structures that are not quadruplexes. Have the authors checked the PQS's for other secondary structures (for example, by M-fold?).</p><p>Transfected dual luciferase assays can be highly variable and the gold standard would be to report errors from at least 3 independent replicates, not 2. For example, AZIN1 has a strong effect in the dual luciferase assay (Figure 2A) but does not behave like a quadruplex in the biophysical assays in Figure 3. This could be an indication that the dual luciferase assay is not necessarily reporting on quadruplex formation. Negative controls are needed showing that mutations in the predicted loop regions have no effect in the dual luciferase assay.</p><p>AZIN1 showed no evidence for quadruplex formation in the biophysical assays (Figure 3), yet this is the only RNA that was chosen for further characterization by NMR in order to demonstrate quadruplex formation. The rationale for pursuing AZIN1 needs to be explained.</p><p>How does the addition of polyamines affect the biophysical characterizations in Figure 3?</p><p>Figure 5. The <sup>1</sup>H signals around 11 ppm are consistent with quadruplex formation but this is not conclusive as other types of base pairs can also give rise to resonances in this region of the proton spectrum. A <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N through hydrogen bond NMR experiment is needed to really show this. Do the RNAs that respond to Thioflavin T also have similar 1D NMR spectra?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36362.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There was general agreement among the reviewers and the reviewing editor that the identification of regulatory G-quadruplexes was of some interest and that several findings had merit.

Such a study must consider the function of many elements in order to probe the pathway.</p><p>Concerning &quot;too shallow&quot;: Briefly: from an initial screen of 35 elements (Figure 2), we followed up on 7 putative quadruplexes (PQS's), for which we acquired data using all known biophysical and cellular techniques for quadruplexes, including: (1) reporter assays + mutated controls in cells, (2) in vitro transcription/translation assays, (3) gel migrations, (4) ThioT stainings, (5) UV melts, (6) CD spectra (Figure 3). With the exception of ARG<sub>3Q1</sub> and AZIN1 (for which we provided credible data-based explanations (Figure 2D, Figure 4, new Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplement 1, Figure 5—figure supplement 3), the outcome from all of these techniques for the PQS's were consistent with our proposed structures and function. Finally, we investigated PQS's from AZIN 1 and SMS in cells (Figure 4). We showed that the endogenous proteins and luciferase reporters performed identically, in response to a known quadruplex-stabilizing drug and a polyamine depleting-drug with subsequent polyamine rescue. So, with respect, we see the referee's call for &quot;stronger support&quot; and &quot;the need to accept this as an aggregate survey&quot; as unjustifiable.</p><p>In the new manuscript we have investigated in more detail AZIN1 with a high-resolution NMR study. The data confirms our hypothesis that the AZIN1 quadruplex equilibrates with stem structures, and that the equilibrium is shifted in predictable fashion for a quadruplex by changing concentrations of potassium, magnesium and sodium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The assays for structure determination aren't nucleotide resolution, and it remains tricky to predict these structures confidently by computational methods. Overall the need to accept this as an aggregate survey weakens the conclusiveness of the presentation. Having done this interesting survey, the authors are likely interested in higher resolution study of one or a few of these elements in detail that would really nail down the idea that G-quartets interact with polyamines to control expression of polyamine metabolic enzymes.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure that we understand the referee's comment. We have added a nucleotide-resolution assay with the <sup>1</sup>H NMR study of AZIN<sub>5Q1</sub> (new Figure 5 and new Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In the manuscript, Lightfoot and Hall describe the effect of transient G<sub>2</sub>-quadruplexes on the expression levels of proteins involved in the polyamine biosynthesis pathway.</p><p>Enzymes involved in this pathway are regulated at different levels including transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.</p><p>The authors hypothesized that these levels could be regulated at the post-transcriptional level by specific RNA structures, G-quadruplexes. Indeed, RNA G-quadruplexes have already been shown to play a role in RNA metabolism regulation, such as translation, splicing,.</p><p>Using bioinformatic tools, the authors identified putative G-quadruplex forming sequences (PQS) in the 5' and 3'UTR of many genes involved in this pathway. They validated the effect of these putative G-quadruplexes using in vivo and in vitro assays on WT and mutated sequences, as well as the effect of a well-characterized G-quadruplex stabilizer.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well written, clear, and sound. The authors nicely demonstrate that while many PQS do not have any effect on protein expression, other have a significant influence. The study of mutated sequences in itself is controversial (is the effect of the mutation due to a disruption of the G-quadruplex or a change in the ratio of proteins bound is always difficult to assess) but the complementary approach of testing the effect of a G-quadruplex stabilizer on protein expression makes the conclusions strong and compelling.</p><p>The final conclusion of the manuscript that spermine itself stabilizes G-quadruplex is interesting but lacks in my view strong evidence. The in cells experiments cannot provide evidence that the observed effects are direct and the in vitro validation assays have been done only on one PQS (AZIN1).</p></disp-quote><p>The referee is referring to the final figure. We agree that the evidence for direct interaction is not strong and derives from in vitro experiments. The new NMR data does provide additional evidence for such an interaction, but as the direct interaction is not the main message of the paper, we have moved old Figure 5 to Figure 5—figure supplement 3 and have toned down (removed text and emphasized that data is from in vitro experiments) our implications of recognition of the AZIN1 quadruplex by spermine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be interesting to test the effect of spermine of the stability of other PQS sequence that respond to spermine in cells such as SMS<sub>5Q1</sub>, SMS<sub>3Q1</sub>, SAT1<sub>5Q1</sub> and OAZ2<sub>5Q1</sub>. It would also be interesting to compare the effect of spermine and PDS on G-quadruplex stabilization in vitro.</p></disp-quote><p>We did indeed test the effects of spermine on other G<sub>2</sub>-PQS's SMS and SAT1: there was a small effect on SMS<sub>5Q1</sub> but no effect on SAT1.

We did not perform experiments with PDS in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “PSP long-looped G<sub>2</sub>-PQSs perform as quadruplexes in cells”: The authors observed that the effect of PDS on AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub> was opposite to what was expected based on the mutant results. However, AZIN1 also has a PQS in its 3'UTR (AZIN1<sub>3Q1</sub>). It would be interesting to test the effect of PDS on this reporter.</p></disp-quote><p>Given the different status of the cells with respect to polyamine levels, the effect of PDS on AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub> was perhaps not so surprising. We have elaborated on this with a small additional text (subsection “PSP long-looped G<sub>2</sub>-PQSs perform as quadruplexes in cells”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is a well described study by Lightfoot and Hall that demonstrates many G-rich sequences regulate the RNA and protein levels of proteins important in polyamide (PA) biosynthesis. The authors identify many putative G-quadruplexes in the 5' and 3' UTRs of PA protein-coding genes and show that some of these elements can form G-quadruplex structures in vitro and provide evidence that they may function via these structures using a small molecule known to bind G-quadruplex structures. This work adds to our understanding of how these genes are regulated through potential G-quadruplex structures. Although this is an interesting body of work, several concerns reduce enthusiasm for publication in eLife.</p><p>1) A major concern is that there doesn't appear to be any data in this manuscript or other publications (search by this reviewer of the literature) that show G-quadruplexes can form without a single nucleotide loop (usually defined as 1-7 nucleotides although longer loops exist as previously demonstrated and in this work). If these references exist it would be helpful for the authors to include. Structurally it doesn't seem possible for the four Gs to be split into two parts of the G-quad. This should be demonstrated or explained if previously published data hasn't demonstrated this unique G-quadruplex structure before. This point applies to the elements in SAT1, AZIN1 and OAZ3.</p></disp-quote><p>Piazza et al., 2017 shows quadruplexes with a zero-nucleotide loop. We have added a short sentence and reference in the text (subsection “Predicted G<sub>2</sub>-PQS’s in PSP UTRs”). We did not further characterize the zero-looped quadruplexes because this non-canonical structure is not the main message of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Presumably the authors tested if polyamines bind and stabilize / destabilize the putative G<sub>2</sub> quadruplex structures. These results should be included or discussed because otherwise the reader is left wondering how the polyamines self-regulate except for the AZIN1 example.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a sentence to the text stating that polyamine addition had no effect on the UV melt traces of other long-looped G<sub>2</sub>-PQS (SMS and SAT1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the AZIN1 data, the authors should correct ΔAbs of ~0.2 to ~0.02 in the Results section (Long-looped AZIN1 G<sub>2</sub>-quadruplex is induced by PAs in vitro).</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Again, please provide a rationale for how a G-quad can form without a loop nucleotide (see point #1) and not just state that high resolution structural studies will need to be performed (Discussion section). If the authors demonstrate G-quads can form without a loop this would be a major finding for the field and would be of great interest. The data for the 3 putative G-quads lacking loops is weak compared to the data provided for the G-quads with loops.</p><p>3) A more minor concern is the data shown in Figure 2. Several of the gel images for the Thioflavin-T with the G-quadruplexes don't appear to match the quantitation shown in the next panel although this could be explained by loading differences. For example, for ODC1<sub>5Q2</sub> there is a 2-fold difference in fluorescence quantitation, which doesn't seem to match the adjacent gel image. This might be explained by the significant difference in the loading of RNA seen in the first panel. If the RNA concentration levels or ability to detect RNA is significantly different for some species it may call into question the ability to detect differences between WT and mutant RNAs.</p></disp-quote><p>There are no differences in loading, which is done on the basis of OD measurement, and experiments are repeated multiple times. Apparent differences between wild type and mutants on the migration gels are likely because Syber Gold shows a degree of sequence-selective binding (as reported in Tuma et al., 1999).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A minor point is why do the authors not spend more time in the discussion on the most significant PA regulatory element they identified in SAT1 (30-fold change)?</p></disp-quote><p>Although SAT1 is interesting, we found AZIN1 more interesting due to its structural equilibria and its strong regulation in cells. We have therefore added results from an NMR study of AZIN1 to the revised manuscript (new Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.

Have the authors checked the PQS's for other secondary structures (for example, by M-fold?).</p></disp-quote><p>We have checked the principal PQS's of Figure 3 by M-Fold. As expected for G-rich seqs, most of them show possible hairpin structures. However, given the strong evidence for the PQS's shown in Figure 3, particularly from the UV<sub>295</sub>-melting and Thioflavin T staining we did not pursue other secondary structures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Transfected dual luciferase assays can be highly variable and the gold standard would be to report errors from at least 3 independent replicates, not 2.</p></disp-quote><p>Our legend describing biological replicates for Figure 2A in the original manuscript was ambiguous: we have corrected it in the new manuscript. For each PQS that produced a statistically-significant difference between wild-type and control, the data represents 3-7 independent biological replicates. For PQS's that were inactive and were dropped from further investigation, data is presented from n&gt;/=2 independent biological replicates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example, AZIN1 has a strong effect in the dual luciferase assay (Figure 2A) but does not behave like a quadruplex in the biophysical assays in Figure 3. This could be an indication that the dual luciferase assay is not necessarily reporting on quadruplex formation. Negative controls are needed showing that mutations in the predicted loop regions have no effect in the dual luciferase assay.</p></disp-quote><p>The referee's assumption that generally mutating the loop sequences of a quadruplex should have no effect on luciferase activity is incorrect, according to previously published work which states that loop sequence is one of the 4 major determinants of quadruplex stability (Pandey, Agarwala and Maiti, 2013). (We stated this in the Introduction &quot;The stability of G-quadruplexes is governed by the number of G-quartets, the loop length and composition&quot;).</p><p>As an aside, we actually agree with the referee &quot;that the dual luciferase assay is not necessarily reporting on quadruplex formation&quot;: strong data in our manuscript (especially the new NMR data) describes a quadruplex/hairpin equilibrium for AZIN1<sub>5Q1</sub>. Thus, the referee's suggested experiment would not be a negative control; the best negative control is mutation of key G's, as we have done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>AZIN1 showed no evidence for quadruplex formation in the biophysical assays (Figure 3), yet this is the only RNA that was chosen for further characterization by NMR in order to demonstrate quadruplex formation.

Does the referee mean to test ALL 14 RNAs of Figure 3 in presence of polyamines in gel migrations, ThioT stainings, UV-melts and CD? Testing one polyamine at one concentration on a quadruplex and its mutant after optimizing conditions (e.g. polyamine conc., the presence/absence of Mg/K), whilst avoiding RNA precipitation etc. represents dozens of experiments.</p><p>We respectfully submit that grossly expanding the data set in this way without a specified reason would not add useful support for quadruplex structures above what we already have shown with biophysical experiments of Figures 3 and the new exhaustive NMR investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5. The <sup>1</sup>H signals around 11 ppm are consistent with quadruplex formation but this is not conclusive as other types of base pairs can also give rise to resonances in this region of the proton spectrum. A <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N through hydrogen bond NMR experiment is needed to really show this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee and thank him for the suggestion. We performed these experiments, as well as additional experiments to nail this down.</p><p>Signals around 11 ppm are characteristic for G-imino protons involved in H-bonds in GU base pairs, or H-bonding interactions with O6 from guanines in G-quadruplexes (Jin, 1990; Wang et al., 1991; Wang et al., 1919; Smith and Feigon 1992). To confirm that our signals from AZIN1<sub>wt</sub> at around 11 ppm (Figure 5b) were indeed G-imino protons, we in vitro-transcribed a <sup>15</sup>N-labeled AZIN1<sub>wt</sub> and recorded a <sup>1</sup>H <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC. Similarly to what was previously reported for RNA G-quadruplexes (Nasiri et al., 2016)<sup>6</sup>, we observed that the protons of AZIN1<sub>wt</sub> located at 11 ppm and the quadruplex positive control (AZIN1<sub>M2</sub>) were bound to <sup>15</sup>N atoms with a chemical shift of about 145 ppm (new Figure 5—figure supplement 2A,B, respectively), which is characteristic for guanine N1 atom involved in a G-quadruplex or a GU wobble.</p><p>Imino protons from GU base pairs can easily be seen in a <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H 2D NOESY due to the strong OE between the imino protons of guanine and uridine; furthermore, U-imino protons are typically seen in a <sup>1</sup>H <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC at around 160 ppm for N3. Neither strong imino-imino NOE's, or H3-N3 imino cross-peaks, were observed in our spectra (new Figure 5—figure supplement 2). We therefore conclude that all the cross-peaks observed in the <sup>1</sup>H <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC at 10-11 ppm in the proton dimension originate from a G-quadruplex.</p><p>In addition, G-quadruplex formation also gives rise to typical NOE patterns involving the imino, amino and aromatic protons of the guanine nucleotides involved in the G-quadruplex formation (Smith and Feigon 2010; Jin, 1992 and Macaya, 1993). So, we then recorded a 2D NOESY with AZIN1<sub>wt</sub> (new Figure 5—figure supplement 2C). NOEs' typical of G-quadruplexes between neighbouring imino groups and between imino and amino (shifted to 9-10ppm compared to Watson-Crick base-pairs) are present in the spectrum consistent with previous reports (Nasiri et al., 2016).</p><p>Taking these results together with the increased relative intensity of these imino signals in the presence of K (stabilizing the G-quadruplex) and the decrease in the presence of Na/Mg, provides strong evidence for formation of a G-quadruplex by AZIN1<sub>wt</sub> (Figure 5c, Figure 5—figure supplement 1) The conclusion is strengthened by the 1D <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>1</sup>H <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectra from the mutants AZIN1<sub>M1</sub> and AZIN1<sub>M2</sub> (new Figure 5—figure supplement 2B, Figure 5b).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do the RNAs that respond to Thioflavin T also have similar 1D NMR spectra?</p></disp-quote><p>We prepared large quantities of ODC1<sub>5Q1</sub>, ARG2<sub>5Q1</sub>, OAZ2<sub>5Q1</sub> and OAZ2<sub>5Q2</sub> and tested their ability to form G-quadruplex structures by 1D NMR. We used NRAS as a positive control as it was previously shown to adopt a G-quadruplex structure (Bugaut et al., 2010). For all these RNAs, imino protons were detected at 11 ppm indicating their ability to form G-quadruplex structures (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1). We also prepared <sup>15</sup>N-labeled versions of ARG2<sub>5Q1</sub>, OAZ2<sub>5Q1</sub> and OAZ2<sub>5Q2</sub>. In each case, we found that the imino protons observed at 11 ppm were attached to nitrogen atoms with chemical shifts of about 145 ppm (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1E-G). We saw no evidence of GU base pairs formation for any of these RNAs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
