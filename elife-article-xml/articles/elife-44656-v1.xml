pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44656.001</object-id><p>The mechanisms that regulate pluripotency are still largely unknown. Here, we show that Telomere Repeat Binding Factor 1 (TRF1), a component of the shelterin complex, regulates the genome-wide binding of polycomb and polycomb H3K27me3 repressive marks to pluripotency genes, thereby exerting vast epigenetic changes that contribute to the maintenance of mouse ES cells in a naïve state. We further show that TRF1 mediates these effects by regulating TERRA, the lncRNAs transcribed from telomeres. We find that TERRAs are enriched at polycomb and stem cell genes in pluripotent cells and that TRF1 abrogation results in increased TERRA levels and in higher TERRA binding to those genes, coincidental with the induction of cell-fate programs and the loss of the naïve state. These results are consistent with a model in which TRF1-dependent changes in TERRA levels modulate polycomb recruitment to pluripotency and differentiation genes. These unprecedented findings explain why TRF1 is essential for the induction and maintenance of pluripotency.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TRF1</kwd><kwd>telomere</kwd><kwd>pluripotency</kwd><kwd>TERRA</kwd><kwd>polycomb</kwd><kwd>lncRNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2013-45111-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>López de Silanes</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008433</institution-id><institution>Consejería de Educación, Juventud y Deporte, Comunidad de Madrid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S2017/BMD-3770</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montero</surname><given-names>Juan J</given-names></name><name><surname>Blasco</surname><given-names>Maria A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000321</institution-id><institution>World Cancer Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16-1177</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blasco</surname><given-names>Maria A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006373</institution-id><institution>Fundación Botín</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blasco</surname><given-names>Maria A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2015-72455-EXP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blasco</surname><given-names>Maria A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Telomeric TRF1 controls the transcriptional programmes of pluripotent stem cells by recruiting PRC2 to pluripotency and differentiation genes by controlling the expression of those gene sites and the binding of TERRA RNAs to them.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multiple cellular processes, including pluripotency and the determination of cell fate, are regulated by epigenetic modifications, including genome-wide changes in DNA and histone methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blasco, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Theunissen and Jaenisch, 2014</xref>). One key histone modification, tri-methylation of lysine 27 in histone 3 (H3K27me3), is a transcription repression mark that it is controlled by the polycomb transcriptional repressor (PRC) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sparmann and van Lohuizen, 2006</xref>). There are two polycomb complexes, PRC1 and PRC2, which cooperate to achieve gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lund and van Lohuizen, 2004</xref>). PRC2 encompasses EED (Embryonic ectoderm development), EZH2 (Enhancer of zeste), SUZ12 (Suppressor of zeste 12), and ESC (Extra sex combs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ringrose and Paro, 2004</xref>), and is involved in the initiation of gene repression. In particular, the PRC2 component EZH2 is a SET-domain-containing protein that catalyzes the repressive H3K27me3 mark and to lesser extent also H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simon and Kingston, 2009</xref>). PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 recruits PRC1, which contributes to gene silencing, possibly by blocking transcriptional elongation by the RNA Polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stock et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, polycomb PRC1 and PRC2 complexes have been proposed to have a key role in the maintenance of embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pereira et al., 2010</xref>). In particular, polycomb proteins are important for restraining the activity of lineage-specifying factors in ES cells, and also have been shown to be essential in establishing the conversion of differentiated cells towards pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Azuara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Endoh et al., 2008</xref>). PRC2 proteins and the H3K27me3 mark are proposed to maintain genes in a state in which they are poised for transcription and contribute to pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Azuara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Endoh et al., 2008</xref>). In agreement with this notion, EZH2 is upregulated during reprogramming and EZH2 knock-down impairs reprogramming. Also, PRC2 is essential for pluripotency but is not essential in human ES cells in the ‘naïve’ state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In ES cells, a significant proportion of polycomb target genes are repressed genes that encode transcription factors that are required for lineage specification later during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). These genes are also co-occupied by the key pluripotency factors OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2, suggesting that the function of these pluripotency genes in repressing gene expression may be mediated by polycomb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyer et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, downregulation of the PRC1 and PRC2 activity in ES cells leads to global de-repression of these genes and to unscheduled differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Endoh et al., 2008</xref>). Deletion of one of the PRC2 components in mice (EED, SUZ12 or EZH2) results in severe defects in development, suggesting the mis-expression of lineage-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Faust et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">O'Carroll et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pasini et al., 2004</xref>). However, the deletion of PRC2 components in ES cells is not lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leeb et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, polycomb has also been reported to bind to bivalent genes, which are occupied by both the heterochromatic mark H3K27me3 and the active mark H3K4me3. In this scenario, PRC2 is important in maintaining lineage genes in a poised state ready to respond to differentiation cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Voigt et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Telomeres are special heterochromatin structures at chromosome ends, which are formed by tandem repeats of the TTAGGG sequence bound by the so-called shelterin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blackburn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Lange, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martínez and Blasco, 2011</xref>). Telomeric chromatin is enriched in histone-repressive marks including H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">García-Cao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">García-Cao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gonzalo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonzalo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benetti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blasco, 2007</xref>). Recently, we also reported that telomeres are enriched for the PRC2-repressive mark H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Montero et al., 2018</xref>). The function of telomeres is to protect chromosome ends from degradation and from triggering chromosomal aberrations, such as chromosome end-to-end fusions. Two independent studies showed that the shelterin component TRF1 is also greatly upregulated during reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boué et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schneider et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, we showed that TRF1 upregulation is an early event during cellular reprogramming, which precedes and is independent of telomere elongation by telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schneider et al., 2013</xref>). The <italic>Terf1</italic> gene is a direct target of OCT4, and is also essential for the induction and maintenance of pluripotency. In support of this, deletion of TRF1 causes embryonic lethality at the blastocyst stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karlseder et al., 2003</xref>). More recently, we showed that TRF1 is also upregulated during in vivo reprogramming, showing a similar pattern of expression to that of OCT4 in reprogrammed tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marión et al., 2017</xref>). In spite of this solid evidence that TRF1 has an important role in pluripotency, the mechanisms that allow TRF1 to perform this mediating role have remained unknown until now.</p><p>PRC2 can interact both in vivo and in vitro with the long non-coding RNAs transcribed from telomeres, or TERRA, and this interaction is essential for the establishment of the H3K27me3 mark at telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Montero et al., 2018</xref>). TERRA has also been shown to be associated with polycomb marks in the vicinity of genes and to modulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, there seems to be an interplay between telomere transcriptional status and long-range epigenetic regulation. In fact, PRC2 interacts with several long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and this interaction is thought to regulate gene expression by recruiting PRC2 to specific loci. Some examples of lncRNAs that can physically interact with PRC2 and recruit it to specific loci include <italic>Xist</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>Hotair</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rinn et al., 2007</xref>) and the antisense non-coding RNA in the <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yap et al., 2010</xref>). These lncRNAs play important roles in X chromosome activation and tumorigenesis. However, how a lncRNA is able to provide specificity for PRC2 recruitment is not clear.</p><p>In addition, TERRA has been previously described to interact with the shelterin component TRF2, which can interact with TRF1, thus opening the possibility that polycomb may also be interacting with shelterin components. In this regard, a recent report showed that the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> telomere-repeat binding factors (TRBs) recruit PRC proteins to different promoters through a telobox motif. In the absence of the three TRB proteins, the PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 mark was altered in a similar manner to that of PRC2 mutants. Indeed, an interaction between TRB1–3 and PRC2 proteins was found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we set to address the mechanisms through which OCT4-mediated TRF1 upregulation functions as an essential process for the induction and maintenance of pluripotency in mouse cells. To this end, we have used an unbiased genome-wide approach, looking for global changes in gene expression in the absence of TRF1. We make the unprecedented finding that TRF1 abrogation has a ‘butterfly effect’ on the transcription of naïve pluripotent cells, altering the epigenetic landscape of these cells through a novel mechanism, which involves TERRA-mediated polycomb recruitment to pluripotency genes and cell-fate genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Abrogation of TRF1 in 2i-grown iPS cells changes the expression of genes related to pluripotency, differentiation and control by polycomb</title><p>To address whether TRF1 abrogation results in genome-wide changes in gene expression that could explain why TRF1 is required for pluripotency, we set to analyze the whole cellular transcriptome directly in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) cells in which TRF1 had been severely downregulated by the use of a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We used <italic>Trp53</italic> (also known as p53)-null iPS cells to allow for cell proliferation in the absence of TRF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martínez et al., 2009</xref>). We optimized the experiment so that the cells were harvested as soon as abrogation of TRF1 could be confirmed, in order to avoid deleterious effects associated to TRF1 depletion, such as increased DNA damage response. As expected from TRF1 downregulation, we observed an increase in the number of multitelomeric signals (MTS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which have previously been related to TRF1 abrogation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martínez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sfeir et al., 2009</xref>). In these conditions, we did not find a significant increase in the DNA damage marker γH2AX in TRF1-depleted cells compared to control cells using either western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) or immunofluorescence against γH2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Similarly, we did not find any significant difference in DNA damage specifically located at telomeres, as determined by performing double immunofluorescence against γH2AX and the telomeric protein RAP1 together with quantification of the number of colocalizations or Telomere-Induced Foci (TIFs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These results indicate that the short period of cell harvesting after TRF1 depletion is not sufficient to allow the activation of a DNA damage response (DDR) that is greater than the basal levels shown by control cells, thus ruling out the possibility that the transcriptome effects observed here may be due to increased DNA damage resulting from TRF1 depletion. To determine the global gene expression changes that are associated with TRF1 depletion, we next performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (see Materials and methods) in control <italic>Trp53</italic>-null 2i-grown iPS cells and <italic>Trp53</italic>-null 2i-grown iPS cells with downregulated TRF1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that genes that are downregulated when TRF1 is deleted, such as MYC, SOX2, NANOG and BMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–J</xref>), are overrepresented in gene sets that are targets of pluripotency factors and pluripotency pathways. Interestingly, we found a clear enrichment in genes regulated by MYC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), concomitant with the fact that <italic>Myc</italic> was indeed downregulated by 3.8-fold in the absence of TRF1 in this RNA-seq experiment (Table S1). Also, genes that are downregulated when TRF1 is depleted were enriched among the gene targets of SOX2 and NANOG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>), in genes that are upregulated in ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and in genes that are downregulated during the differentiation of embryoid bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that depletion of TRF1 induces the loss of pluripotency and initiates the differentiation of the iPS cells. In agreement with this notion, genes that are upregulated in the absence of TRF1 were enriched in gene sets that are upregulated during the differentiation of embryoid bodies from ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), in targets of SUZ12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), and in genes that are upregulated upon <italic>knockout</italic> of <italic>Bmp2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), a member of bone morphogenetic proteins that are important in tissue differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44656.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transcriptome of TRF1-depleted iPS cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot of TRF1 protein and actin (ACT) as the loading control in control and TRF1-depleted iPS cells.

Analysis of the genes that are downregulated when abrogating TRF1 by Enrichr (a comprehensive gene set enrichment analysis web server) showed a significant enrichment in the targets of a large number of pluripotency factors, including NANOG, OCT4, KLF4, SOX2 and MYC, with <italic>Myc</italic> again being one of the most downregulated genes after depletion of TRF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref> shows the percentages of the downregulated genes that are direct targets of the indicated transcription factors. Strikingly, up to 86% of the downregulated genes were targets of pluripotency factors. In particular, more than 40% of all downregulated genes were direct targets of OCT4 and more than 30% were direct targets of SOX2, NANOG and STAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). These findings indicate that TRF1 depletion alters the expression of numerous genes that are controlled by key pluripotency transcription factors. In line with these findings, Enrichr analysis of the downregulated genes show that they were significantly enriched in genes encoding components of signaling pathways regulating the pluripotency of stem cells; 26 of these genes belong to PluriNetWork, which contains genes underlying pluripotency in mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). All together, these results indicate that TRF1 depletion in 2i-grown iPS cells reduces the expression of genes that are implicated in maintaining pluripotency programs.</p><p>Interestingly, similar Enrichr analysis of genes that are upregulated when depleting TRF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>) showed a significant enrichment in the targets of the polycomb repressive complexes PRC1 and PRC2, together with pluripotency factors and factors related to development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). In particular, up to 82% were targets of differentiation factors, 64% were targets of PRC2, and 65% were targets of pluripotency factors. Wikipathways and KEGG pathways analysis revealed that the upregulated genes were also enriched in important pathways regulating pluripotency and differentiation, such as the BMP, Tgfβ and WNT signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref> left panel). In agreement with the unexpected finding that PRC2 targets were greatly enriched in TRF1-depleted cells, we found that the upregulated genes were enriched in the polycomb-related chromatin marks H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, which are characteristic of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref> right panel). We also found that thesegenes are enriched in H3K4me3, a mark present in bivalent genes, where polycomb has been described to bind in primed ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Voigt et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref> right panel). These findings suggest that TRF1 depletion in 2i-grown iPS cell results in the re-activation of polycomb target genes and genes containing the polycomb repressive mark H3K27me3, a phenomenon associated with the loss of the pluripotency stage and the expression of lineage genes. Thus, pathways that are important in lineage commitment and pluripotency, such as the BMP, Tgfβ and WNT signaling pathways, are altered, consistent with loss of the pluripotency state. In summary, these findings indicate that abrogation of TRF1 expression in 2i-grown iPS cells alters the expression of genes that are related to pluripotency, differentiation, and polycomb complexes, supporting the hypothesis that the loss of TRF1 induces the loss of pluripotency and the induction of differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Abrogation of TRF1 in 2i-grown iPS cells alters global SUZ12 and H3K27me3 genomic distribution</title><p>As TRF1 deletion alters the expression of polycomb- and H3K27me3-regulated genes, we next set out to address whether TRF1 affects the global genome distribution of SUZ12 and H3K27me3 proteins. To do so, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation of SUZ12 and H3K27me3 followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) in control 2i-grown iPS cells and 2i-grown iPS cells in which TRF1 had been severely downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, we found that TRF1 abrogation significantly increased the number of SUZ12 binding sites within the genome (4230 peaks) compared to that in control cells (440 peaks) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Heat maps of the read distribution around the SUZ12 peaks confirmed a clear increase in SUZ12 deposition in these genomic regions upon TRF1 depletion, indicating that abrogation of TRF1 in 2i-grown iPS induces a strong recruitment of SUZ12 into the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Total levels of SUZ12 protein were not altered upon TRF1 depletion in four independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, see bottom panel for quantification), indicating that the recruitment of SUZ12 to the genome is not due to overexpression of the SUZ12 protein. Then, we used Enrichr to analyze the characteristics of the genes that were associated with the genome sites where we observed an increased binding of SUZ12 protein upon depletion of TRF1 (see Clusters 1, 2 and 3 of the SUZ12 heatmap [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>]). Importantly, CHEA transcription factor analysis showed that the genes that were associated with sites of SUZ12 recruitment upon TRF1 deletion are the targets of a great number of pluripotency factors, including OCT4, NANOG, KLF4 and MYC (Table S2), as well as of components of the polycomb repressor complexes (Table S2). In addition, KEGG AND Wikipathway analysis showed that these genes are enriched in several pathways that are involved in the regulation of ESC pluripotency, such as the WNT and TGFβ pathways, pathways related to differentiation, and pathways related to the nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, Table S3). Furthermore, analysis of GO Biological process indicated that these genes are highly involved in processes related to the nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We performed a second ChIP-seq to confirm our results, and we found that the heatmaps of the two biological replicates of SUZ12 ChIP-seq, with reads plotted around the peaks for both replicates, show the same pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, the analysis of the genomic regions in which the SUZ12 signal was increased was very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, we observed that all of the clusters of these heatmaps included regions where SUZ12 increases upon TRF1 depletion in both replicas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, we showed that 99% of the genes that showed increased levels of SUZ12 upon TRF1 depletion in the first experiment also showed higher levels of SUZ12 in the second replicate, confirming the close similarity between both ChIP-seq replicates and the recruitment of SUZ12 to the described genomic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results suggest that TRF1 may control the expression of pluripotency- and differentiation-related proteins by directly or indirectly inducing the redistribution of the SUZ12 PRC2 component throughout the genome.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44656.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Abrogation of TRF1 alters SUZ12 and H3K27me3 genome localization.</title><p>Analysis of the genome-wide binding of SUZ12 and H3K27me3 by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) in control and TRF1-depleted 2i-grown iPS cells.

Interestingly, we found a set of upregulated genes that were only bound by SUZ12 and H3K27me3 in the absence of TRF1. An example of such recruitment in gene <italic>Cxcl12</italic> is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We confirmed the increased expression of some of these genes by q-PCR in three independent experiments of TRF1 abrogation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). As for the downregulated genes, to obtain more accurate information on SUZ12 and H3K27me3 binding to the genes that are upregulated in the absence of TRF1, we created heat maps of the reads distribution of SUZ12 and H3K27me3 within 2.5 Kb of the transcription start sites (TSS) of all of the genes that were significantly upregulated in the RNA-seq upon TRF1 abrogation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Surprisingly, we observed recruitment of SUZ12 to a great number of upregulated genes (Clusters 1 and 2 of the SUZ12 heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>)). By contrast, recruitment of H3K27me3 was not so dramatic. We performed Enrichr analysis of the genes contained in Cluster 1 of the SUZ12 heatmap, which corresponds to the larger increase in SUZ12 recruitment. The results showed that upregulated genes contained in Cluster 1 are direct targets of differentiation factors, as well as pluripotency factors and components of polycomb complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Importantly, these upregulated genes are enriched in pathways involved in cell differentiation and pluripotency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similar results were obtained when we analyzed genes in which H3K27me3 is recruited to the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results indicate that depletion of TRF1 induces the recruitment of SUZ12 and the deposition of H3K27me3 to genes that are upregulated and that are involved in pluripotency and differentiation. These results are in agreement with previous work showing that SUZ12 is required for mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation and that increased levels of PRC2 accumulate on a subset of genes during differentiation, despite their transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pasini et al., 2007</xref>). It has been reported that SUZ12 binding to the genome of pluripotent cells in a naïve state is at a low level, which increases upon transferring these cells to serum (primed state) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marks et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, we wondered whether the increased recruitment of SUZ12 to the genome upon depletion of TRF1 could represent the loss of the naïve state and a transition to a primed or differentiated state. In primed conditions, SUZ12 is bound to a set of so-called bivalent genes, including the <italic>Hox</italic> clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Voigt et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we created heatmaps of the reads of SUZ12 and H3K27me3 within 2.5 Kb of the TSS of the described list of bivalent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marks et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We found a dramatic increase of SUZ12 deposition at the TSS of bivalent genes, and a more moderate increase in H3K27me3 at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref> shows an example of this recruitment at some of the more relevant bivalent genes, the <italic>Hox</italic> clusters. We found that SUZ12 is absent from the <italic>Hox</italic> clusters when TRF1 is present, but is clearly recruited to them in the absence of TRF1. This finding is consistent with the idea that abrogation of TRF1 induces the loss of the naïve state. Also, analysis of the genes from Cluster 1 of the H3K27me3 heatmap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> (genes that show a moderate increase in H3K27me3) shows that almost 70% of them belong to the group of bivalent genes.

We observed few peaks of TRF1 when comparing two replicates of the ChIP-seq experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Comparison of the RNA-seq experiments with TRF1 ChIP-seq indicated that only three genes that are bound by TRF1 showed significantly altered expression when TRF1 was downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>). These genes were <italic>Lama1</italic>, which was significantly downregulated when TRF1 was deleted in our RNA sequencing experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and <italic>Pitx2</italic> and <italic>Fam43a</italic>, which were significantly upregulated when TRF1 was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and Table S1). Interestingly, the majority of the TRF1 peaks outside the telomere were located at extra-telomeric repetitions (TTAGGG or CCCTAA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Enrichr analysis of the genes that are associated with TRF1 peaks revealed that four of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>, labeled in bold), were targets of ZFP322A, a protein that is expressed in the <italic>Inner Cell Mass</italic>, which is essential for ES cell pluripotency and that binds to <italic>Oct4</italic> and <italic>Nanog</italic> promoters and regulates their transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma et al., 2014</xref>). These four genes were present among the 100 binding sites with top-ranked peak heights in ZFP322A ChIP-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma et al., 2014</xref>). Most of the TRF1 peaks are located in intergenic regions, but in all four of the genes targetted by ZFP322A, the TRF1 peaks were located in the introns. Two of these genes (<italic>Pde1c</italic> and <italic>Ppp1r9a</italic>) were upregulated in the RNA-seq and one of them, <italic>Lama1</italic>, was significantly downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>), whereas expression of the fourth gene (<italic>Bbox1</italic>) was not detected. Interestingly, ZFP322A controls the expression of <italic>Sall4</italic> and <italic>Zscan10</italic>, two genes that are downregulated upon TRF1 deletion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These results suggest that TRF1 may directly regulate ZFP322A, which in turn, regulates key genes involved in pluripotency, although the mRNA levels of this gene were not altered by TRF1 abrogation in the ChIP-seq data (not shown). However, although TRF1 is able to bind a few locations in the genome, this binding does not seem sufficient to explain the vast epigenetic changes that we observed in the absence of TRF1.</p><p>In order to determine whether TRF1 directly regulates the binding of polycomb in the genome, we performed mass spectroscopy of protein complexes that were immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP antibody in <italic>Terf1<sup>GFP/GFP</sup>, Terf1<sup>+/GFP</sup></italic> and <italic>Terf1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> iPS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schneider et al., 2013</xref>). We identified 64 proteins that showed co-immunoprecipitation in both <italic>Terf1<sup>GFP/GFP</sup></italic> and <italic>Terf1<sup>+/GFP</sup></italic> cells but not in <italic>Terf1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cells. We confirmed the presence in this group of proteins of different components of shelterin, namely TPP1, RAP1, TRF1, TIN2 and POT1. We did not, however, detect the presence of SUZ12 in the immunocomplex, suggesting that there is no direct interaction between TRF1 and PRC2, at least in this experimental setting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Depletion of TRF1 in 2i-grown iPS cells induces the upregulation of TERRA RNAs expression</title><p>Interestingly, the telomeric TERRA RNAs have been recently shown to bind throughout the genome in H3K27me3-rich regions, and to interact with components of the polycomb complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu et al., 2017</xref>). In our group, we also recently showed that TERRA proteins are required to recruit polycomb to telomeres and so contribute to H3K27me3 deposition at telomeric chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Montero et al., 2018</xref>). With these findings in mind, we set to address whether the expression of TERRA was altered when TRF1 was depleted, which could explain, at least in part, the effects of TRF1 depletion on polycomb. First, we performed RNA-FISH analysis using a TERRA-specific probe in control 2i-grown iPS cells and in 2i-grown iPS cells in which TRF1 expression had been reduced. The results showed a dramatic upregulation of TERRA signal in TRF1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Northern-blot analysis of TERRA levels in three independent TRF1 abrogation experiments in iPS cells showed TERRA upregulation as a consequence of TRF1 downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Note that TERRA is normally increased in iPS cells compared to differentiated MEFs cells, as we have previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marion et al., 2009</xref>), and that TERRA levels are further increased by TRF1 abrogation in iPS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), clearly indicating that TRF1 has a role as a repressor of TERRA during the induction of pluripotency. Finally, we also confirmed increased TERRA expression as the result of TRF1 abrogation in keratinocytes from <italic>Terf1<sup>Δ/Δ</sup> K5-Cre</italic> newborn mice, which lack TRF1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These results are in agreement with previous findings from other groups in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Porro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zeng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sadhukhan et al., 2018</xref>), which also show TERRA increase upon TRF1 depletion. Other studies, however, showed that depletion of TRF1 in mouse immortalized MEFs did not increase TERRA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sfeir et al., 2009</xref>), and that downregulation of TRF1 by siRNA in the immortalized mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 reduced the expression of TERRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schoeftner and Blasco, 2008</xref>). A possible explanation for this apparent contradiction could be that the immortalization process may alter TERRA expression or that TERRA regulation by TRF1 is cell-type specific. In any case, the results shown here clearly demonstrate a dramatic increase in TERRA in two different mouse cells types (iPS cells and keratynocytes) upon TRF1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which in turn could contribute to the recruitment of polycomb to new parts of the genome.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44656.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Abrogation of TRF1 induces the upregulation of TERRA RNAs expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left, representative image of RNA-FISH using a TERRA-specific probe in control 2i-grown iPS and in 2i-grown iPS cells in which TRF1 is depleted.

Using Homer software, TERRA CHIRT peaks with an enrichment fold of 10 or higher were assigned to genes and genome regions. We found that the vast majority of TERRA binding sites were localized in non-coding regions (mostly in intergenic or intronic regions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), in agreement with previous findings in embryonic stem cells (ESC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu et al., 2017</xref>).

Furthermore, most of those genes were bound by transcription factors that are related to pluripotency or differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting that TERRA could be important for the loss of pluripotency after TRF1 depletion, through PRC2 regulation. In agreement with this, those genes were enriched in the H3K27me3 mark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>We then performed heatmaps of the TERRA CHIRT-seq reads within 5 Kb of the peaks from SUZ12 and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

To understand whether the gain of SUZ12 and H3K27me3 binding after TRF1 removal is associated to locations where TERRA is present, we compared the genes that are associated with TERRA peaks with the genes associated with SUZ12 and H3K27me3 peaks that are exclusive for the shTRF1 ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). We found that 43.9% of the genes annotated to SUZ12 peaks were exclusive for shTRF1 ChIP-seq and that 49.2% of those from H3K27me3 peaks were also annotated in the TERRA CHIRT-seq. The fact that only a fraction of the newly recruited sites for SUZ12 coincides with TERRA peaks could be explained if SUZ12 recruitment to the genome were to be induced in part by the secondary changes in global epigenetic status and gene expression generated by TRF1 depletion. Also, the chromatin sonication process required for the ChIP and CHIRT techniques may be disrupting the long-range interaction mediated by TERRA. All together, these data indicate that there is a correlation of TERRA location and SUZ12 and H3K27me3 that includes the genes in which SUZ12 and H3K27me3 are deposited after TRF1 depletion, suggesting that TERRA could be mediating the effects of TRF1 abrogation on polycomb-regulated genes.</p><p>To evaluate whether the presence of TERRA binding could be associated with the changes of gene expression observed after TRF1 depletion, we compared the genes that were significantly altered in our RNA-seq with the genes that are associated with TERRA peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We found that 29.9% of the genes that are downregulated and 33.5% of the genes that are upregulated when TRF1 was deleted are annotated to TERRA peaks. Then, we created heatmaps of the TERRA CHIRT-seq reads within 2.5 Kb of the TSS of the downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) and the upregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

We performed CHIRT-qPCR analysis for these regions in both 2i-grown iPS depleted for TRF1 and in non-depleted controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>).

In particular, we and others found that TRF1 is highly upregulated in ES cells and iPS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boué et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schneider et al., 2013</xref>). Our group further showed that <italic>Terf1</italic> is a direct target of the pluripotency gene <italic>OCT4</italic> and that the upregulation of <italic>Terf1</italic> is an early event during the induction of pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schneider et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, we found that TRF1 is needed for both the induction and the maintenance of pluripotency, being essential therefore for nuclear reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schneider et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, we demonstrated that during in vivo reprogramming, TRF1 expression is highly upregulated in the de-differentiated areas upon reprogramming and that TRF1 chemical inhibition reduced the efficiency of in vivo reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marión et al., 2017</xref>). TRF1 is also present at high levels in the Inner Cell Mass (ICM) of the blastocyst when compared to differentiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Varela et al., 2011</xref>). Together these findings suggested a role for TRF1 upregulation during in vitro and in vivo tissue reprogramming and pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marión et al., 2017</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms through which TRF1 modulates pluripotency has not yet been revealed.</p><p>Here, we make the unprecedented finding that TRF1 controls the maintenance of the pluripotency state by influencing the epigenetic status of the chromatin. In particular, TRF1 depletion in naïve-state pluripotent stem cells leads to dramatic changes in the expression of genes that are associated with pluripotency pathways, as well as of genes that are controlled by the polycomb complex PRC. These changes are consistent with loss of the naïve state as the PRC2 complex is recruited to bivalent genes and the differentiation programs are initiated. We further demonstrate that TRF1 depletion leads to increased binding of PRC2 complex to its target genes, which is concomitant with an increase in the abundance of the H3K27me3 polycomb mark at some of these sites. Accordingly, we see that TRF1 depletion induces changes in the expression of the genes in which these TRF1-dependent PRC2 sites are located.</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, telomere-repeat binding factors (TRBs) similar to TRF1 have been reported to recruit PRC proteins to different promoters through a telobox motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Although the binding of human TRF1 to extratelomeric sites had been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Simonet et al., 2011</xref>), we show here for the first time that mouse TRF1 can directly bind to a set of genes containing TTAGGG/AATCCC repeats in iPS cells in a naïve state. Interestingly, a significant percentage of these genes are targets of the pluripotency regulator ZFP322A, opening the possibility that TRF1 may also exert a direct effect on pluripotency by directly regulating the transcription of these genes. However, the vast epigenetic changes observed here as the consequence of TRF1 depletion, which involve the re-localization of PRC2 to many genomic sites, are not likely to be explained by the binding of TRF1 to these few extra-telomeric sites.</p><p>TRF1 has been previously shown to interact with the telomere-originated long non-coding RNAs known as TERRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu et al., 2017</xref>). We have previously shown that TERRA interacts with polycomb components and that this interaction is important to establish polycomb marks and heterochromatin marks at telomeric chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Montero et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that TERRA can also bind to PRC2 sites in the genome that are dependent on TRF1. More importantly, we show that TRF1 depletion causes a dramatic increase in TERRA expression, in agreement with previous observations in human cells that show increased levels of TERRA upon TRF1 downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Porro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zeng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sadhukhan et al., 2018</xref>). This upregulation of TERRA expression coincides with an increased binding of TERRA to genomic regions where PRC2 is also increased upon TRF1 depletion and that are important in controlling pluripotency and differentiation. Interestingly, these TERRA- and PRC2-bound regions also show altered expression upon TRF1 abrogation. Finally, we demonstrate that SUZ12 binding to TERRA increases upon TRF1 depletion, reinforcing the idea that TERRA mediates the recruitment of SUZ12 to the genome.</p><p>All together, these findings suggest a model by which TRF1-dependent TERRA upregulation allows TERRA-mediated recruitment of PRC2 to key pluripotency and differentiation genes, thus controlling the epigenetic landscape of pluripotent stem cells (see the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Finally, these findings explain the fact that TRF1 is upregulated during in vitro and in vivo reprogramming and that it is essential for the reprogramming and maintenance of pluripotency. They also are in agreement with the fact that TERRA is tightly regulated during pluripotency and differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and culture conditions</title><p>The primary keratinocytes and iPS used in this work were generated in our lab and were tested for mycoplasm in a routine manner. <italic>Trp53</italic><sup>–/–</sup>, <italic>Terf1</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, <italic>Terf1</italic><sup>+/GFP</sup> and <italic>Terf1</italic><sup>GFP/GFP</sup> iPS cells were cultured in gelatin-coated plates with DMEM (high glucose) supplemented with serum replacement (KSR, Invitrogen), LIF 1000 u/ml, non-essential amino acids, glutamax and beta-mercaptoethanol (known as iPS medium).

Total RNA (1 µg) was used for the RNA-seq experiment, and the obtained sample RNA Integrity Number was 10 (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer). The poly(A)+ fraction was purified and randomly fragmented, converted to double-stranded cDNA and processed through subsequent enzymatic treatments of end-repair, dA-tailing, and ligation to adapters with the ‘NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina’ (NEB, Cat. No. E7760) as recommended by the manufacturer. This kit incorporates dUTP during second-strand cDNA synthesis, which implies that only the cDNA strand generated during first strand synthesis is eventually sequenced. An adapter-ligated library was completed by PCR with Illumina PE primers. The resulting purified cDNA library was applied to an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencer, following manufacturer's protocols.

The crosslinking was stopped by adding 0.125M glycine to the medium for 5 min at RT. Fixed cells were washed with PBS containing 1 μM PMSF and protease inhibitors and then pelleted. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)) at 2 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml for 20 min at 4°C. Sonication was performed with a Covaris system (shearing time 20 min, 20% duty cycle, intensity 6,200 cycles per burst, and 30 s per cycle). 50 μg of chromatin per immunoprecipitation reaction were diluted 1/10 in dilution buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)) and immunoprecipitated with a rabbit sera against TRF1 (raised in our laboratory), rabbit polyclonal antibody against SUZ12 (ab12073) or rabbit antibody against H3K27me3 (07–449 Upstate), using protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The beads were washed once with low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 150 mM NaCl), once with high-salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 500 mM NaCl), once with LiCl wash buffer (0.25 M LiCl, 1% NP40, 1% deoxycholateNa, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)), and twice with TE. The immune complexes were eluted with 500 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>). Reverse crosslinking was achieved through the addition of 20 μl of 5M NaCl and incubation at 65°C for 8 hr. DNA was recovered by RNase and proteinase K treatment, phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. For each sample, 10–15 ng of DNA were used for the ChIP-seq experiments. Samples were processed through subsequent enzymatic treatments of end-repair, dA-tailing, and ligation to adapters with ‘NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina’ from New England BioLabs (catalog # E7645). Adapter-ligated libraries were completed by limited-cycle PCR and extracted with a [single] double-sided size selection for library preparation (SPRI).

An antisense TERRA RNA biotinylated transcript consisting of eight CCCTAA repeats was used as bait for TERRA capture. After CHIRT, chromatin was eluted using RNAseH (NEB) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu et al., 2017</xref>), and the obtained DNA was used to prepare the libraries for deep sequencing. As input control, total fragmented chromatin was used. 0.5 ng of DNA per sample were used for the ChIRT-seq experiment (5 ng for the INPUT). Samples were processed through subsequent enzymatic treatments for fragmentation (5 min), end-repair, dA-tailing, and ligation to adapters with the ‘NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina’ from New England BioLabs (catalog # E7805). Adapter-ligated libraries were completed by limited-cycle PCR and extracted with a [single] double-sided SPRI. Resulting average fragment size is 400 bp, from which 120 bp correspond to adaptor sequences. Libraries were applied to an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencer, following manufacturer's protocols. To determine changes in TERRA binding in the shTRF1 CHIRT sample compared to the control CHIRT sample, quantitative real-time PCR was performed, using the DNA libraries described above, by Go-Taq qPCR master mix (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All values were obtained in triplicates. In each case, values were normalized to input and to a genomic region where TERRA binding was not found in the CHIRT-seq.

For TRF1 deletion in iPS cells, samples were obtained from three independent TRF1 deletion experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test. For TERRA analysis in primary keratinocytes from newborn mice, three newborn mice from each genotype were used. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>2i-grown <italic>Trp53</italic><sup>–/–</sup> iPS cells and 2i-grown <italic>Trp53</italic><sup>–/–</sup> iPS cells where TRF1 expression had been abrogated, or ES cells treated or untreated with retinoic acid, were plated in gelatin-coated coverslips, incubated with cytobuffer (100 mM NaCl, 300 mM sucrose, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM pipes (pH 6.8)) with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 6 min, and fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were then blocked in 10% BSA in PBS for 1 hr at RT and incubated with the primary antibodies dissolved in Dako antibody diluents (Dako) for 1 hr in a humid chamber at RT. The following antibodies were used: rat antibody anti-TRF1 (home made, 1:250), rabbit antibody against RAP1 (A300-306A, Bethyl, 1:250) and mouse monoclonal antibody against phospho histone H2A.X (Ser139) (Millipore 05–636, 1:250). Cells were washed 3 times for 30 min with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and incubated with Alexa secondary antibodies for 1 hr at RT in a humid chamber. After 3 washes of 30 min with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, samples were mounted in Prolong with DAPI. Fluorescent signals were visualized in a confocal ultraspectral microscope SP5-WLL (Leica). The experiment was performed once. Statistical analysis were performed using Student's t-test, where n indicates the number of cells in each analyzed sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Enrichr analysis</title><p>The p-values shown in all the figures containing Enrichr analysis (Wikipathways, KEGG Pathways, ENCODE histone modifications, CHEA) were the adjusted p-values provided by Enrichr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)</title><p><italic>Trp53</italic><sup>-</sup>/<sup>-</sup> 2i-grown iPS cells, either controls or cells in which TRF1 was depleted) were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min and the quenched with glycine 125 mM for 5 min. Cells were washed with PBS, scraped from the plate and pelleted for 5 min at 1200 rpm. 25 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per immunoprecipitation were resuspended in 7 ml of ice-cold cell lysis buffer (5 mM Tris (pH 8), 85 mM KCl, 0.5% Igepal), and incubated for 10 min at 4°C in rotation. Crude nuclear sample was collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 3000 g at 4°C. The nuclear pellet was washed with 0.5 ml of cell lysis buffer without Igepal (5 mM Tris (pH 8), 85 mM KCl) and microcentrifuged for 10 min at 3000 g at 4°C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Na-Doc, 1% Triton +0.1M DTT, RNAsin, Proteinase inhibitor 1x) to lyse the nucleus and incubated in ice for 10 min. The sample was doused 20 times and sonicated thrice for 5 s on setting 3. The sonicated lysate was microcentrifuged for 10 min at 4°C at 14,000 rpm. A fraction of the soluble chromatin (supernatant) was kept as input. The sample was pre-cleared with Protein A+G beads for 1 hr at 4°C and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 4 min. The precleared sample was then incubated o/n with the corresponding antibody (IgG as negative control or antibody anti SUZ12 (ab12073)). After o/n incubation, the beads were washed once with low-salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, +0.1M DTT, RNAsin, Proteinase inhibitor 1x), once with high-salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris (pH 8), 500 mM NaCl, +0.1M DTT, RNAsin, Proteinase inhibitor 1x), once with LiCl buffer (0.25 M LiCl, 1% Igepal, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris (pH 8), +0.1M DTT, RNAsin, Proteinase inhibitor 1x), and twice with TE (pH 8) (100 mM Tris (pH 8), 10 mM EDTA (pH 8)). Each wash was performed at 4°C for 5 min in rotation. The RNA was eluted with 250 ul of elution buffer (25 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS), treated with proteinase K for 45 min at 45°C and incubated 2 hr at 65°C to reverse crosslink. RNA extracted with trizol and purified and DNAse-treated on using RNeasy Kit (QUIAGEN 74106), following the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was loaded using a dot-blot and the presence of TERRA and 18S RNAs was detected as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marion et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Ana Cuadrado for her help with the setting up of ChIP-seq.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Hsueh Ping Chu (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Over the past decade, the Blasco lab has published a series of papers regarding on the telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) and the roles of TRF1 in cancer and pluripotent cells. As a continuation of her research, Marión et al., studied the impact of TRF1 on maintaining pluripotency in iPS cells. TERRA level increased as a result of TRF1 depletion and, under such situation, TERRA was recruited to the genes for stem cell renewal and embryonic development. Authors also conducted a series of ChIP-seq experiments, for which demonstrating PRC2 component SUZ12 and H3K27me3 histone mark enrichment on pluripotency and differentiation genes. Expression level was significantly changed among those genes showing concomitant SUZ12 and H3K27me3 enrichment, as they are recruited to the transcription start sites (TSS). SUZ12 and H3K27me3 enriched genes are also related to pluripotency and development, respectively, as shown in RNA-seq assays. TERRA CHIRT peaks were observed in the TSS of genes having altered expression, in certain case overlapped with SUZ12 and H3K27me3 association. TERRA bound genes are also often related to pluripotency and development. Additionally, TRF1 depletion may regulate gene expression via direct binding, authors revealed that TRF1 depletion cause Laminin A down-regulation which have TRF1 binding site in the intron. However, extra-telomeric TRF1 binding is only restricted on a few gene loci, would not suffice to explain the majority of epigenetic changes in TRF1 depleted cells. Overall, authors claim that TRF1 is essential to maintain pluripotency in stem cells, by suppressing TERRA expression and subsequent genome-wide PRC2 localization, thereby stabilizing epigenetic marks on pluripotency genes of stem cells. This paper contains potentially interesting and important data. The study is potentially valuable, but a number of technical issues need to be addressed before further consideration.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer 1: See points 1-3 and point 5 in the detailed review</p><p>Reviewer 2: A number of substantial concerns were raised by this reviewer. It seems important to us to deplete TERRA using gapmer ASO in TRF1-depleted cells with RNA-Seq or RT-qPCR of selected genes. The reviewer also raised the fact that TERRA upregulation in TRF1-depleted cells showed no changes in TERRA levels in TRF1-deleted MEFs by the de Lange lab. This contradiction needs to be explained. Finally, the Northern blots in Figure 5 remain problematic (but with thanks for the earlier explanation provided). The reviewer specifically noted that the TERRA pattern is different in each panel, there is no TERRA signal in panel C for MEFs, while mouse TERRA is definitely abundant and easily detectable. Similarly, there is no signal for TERRA in wt cells in panel D. Why does the 18S signal fade away till disappearing throughout samples in panel C?</p><p>Reviewer 3: This reviewer was generally supportive but would also like to see some additional experiments. Specifically, they would like evidence showing the TERRA mediates the increased recruitment of SUZ12 after TRF1 depletion. A RIP experiment after depletion seems appropriate. A good question is also about why SUZ12 and TERRA bind at different sites if TERRA is recruiting PRC2. Secondly, biological replicates for ChIP-seq data are critical. Finally, various contradictions mentioned by this reviewer (as well as the other reviewers) need to be addressed directly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper contains a large body of meta-analysis data, which should be useful for researchers studying on telomeres, long noncoding RNAs, epigenetic regulations, and stem cell biology. The authors also reveal a novel function of shelterin component TRF1, as one of the genes for maintaining stem cell identity by impeding TERRA promoted genome-wide epigenetic changes. Also, this paper connects the epigenetic roles of TERRA via interacting PRC2 (Chu et al., 2017; Montero et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017) with TRF1 upregulation as a stem cell marker (Schneider et al., 2013). The study is therefore potentially valuable, but a number of technical issues need to be addressed before publication.</p><p>1) Despite efficient TRF1 depletion, telomeres are not recognized as γH2AX TIF (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). This data directedly contradicts previous TRF1 studies including Blasco lab's publication on TRF1 knock-out iPS cells (Schneider et al., 2013). Cells might be harvested earlier than the moment of DDR activation (as written on the manuscript), however, authors need to provide the information that whether shTRF1 telomeres are inflicted with DNA damage responses as described before.</p><p>2) Overall links between the events of TERRA binding, PRC2 localization, and subsequent gene regulation are fairly weak. As shown in Figure 7D and E, only a fraction of TERRA bound genes shows both SUZ12 and H3K27me3 enrichment (13 / 101 of down-regulated genes and 25 / 142 of up-regulated genes). Furthermore, the SUZ12 and/or H3K27me3 increase in shTRF1 cells are not quite convincing (Figure 7D and E; Figure 3B, H3K27me3 peaks; Figure 4B, H3K27me3 peaks). TERRA protein interatom (Chu et al., 2017) covers a list of epigenetic regulators and transcription factors, therefore, TERRA mediated transcription regulations do not necessarily undergo PRC2 recruitment. Although TRF1 depletion convincingly increased SUZ12 level in certain genes (Figure 2 and 3), the large part of gene expression changes happened in genes without TERRA accumulation (Figure 7A). Therefore, most transcriptional changes are due to the systemic effect of TRF1 depletion rather than TERRA accumulation in such genes. Nevertheless, a significant portion of altered gene expression in shTRF1 cells coincide with TERRA bound genes (Figure 7A, 98/328 of down-regulated genes and 162/483 of up-regulated genes) and PRC2 (SUZ12) accumulation was clearly observed at pluripotency and differentiation genes. This study does not sufficiently support a model in Figure 8 as also claimed in the manuscript, but still can deliver important information of TRF1 functions on stem cells.</p><p>3) H3K27me3 is an epigenetic mark tightly associated with gene suppression. However, this study demonstrated that a number of genes are upregulated with increased H3K27me3. Authors need to provide a sufficient explanation of these seemingly contradictory results.</p><p>4) Physiological information is somewhat missing in this study. Authors can enhance their point on the TRF1 function by measuring TRF1 and TERRA level changes during early cell differentiation.</p><p>5) TRF1 is not a sole shelterin component regulating TERRA, previous studies show greater TERRA upregulation upon TRF2 depletion (Porro et al., 2014; Rossiello et al., 2017). Authors may make clear the insight on the TERRA mediated gene regulations with TRF2 depleted p53 -/- cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a potentially interesting paper suggesting a possible role for TRF1 in regulating pluripotency through TERRA expression and binding to extra-telomeric chromosomal loci. The authors show that 1) TRF1 depletion in 2i grown iPS cells leads to alteration of expression of genes involved in maintaining pluripotency and redistribution of the PRC2 component SUZ12 and of the heterochromatin mark H3K27me3; 2) TRF1 binds to a few extratelomeric loci in iPS cells, although this event does not seem to be directly responsible for the regulation of pluripotency-associated genes; 3) TRF1 depletion in different cells (including iPS) increases TERRA levels; 4) TRF1 depletion induces TERRA binding to extrachromosomal loci including a large number of genes deregulated when TRF1 is depleted.</p><p>The data are interesting as they might indeed explain why TRF1 is involved in pluripotency maintenance, yet the study remains largely descriptive/correlative. While the authors' model makes sense with the data, some validation experiments are necessary to validate the proposed mechanisms. Depleting TERRA in TRF1-depleted cells followed by RNA-Seq or RT-qPCR of selected genes would confirm of disprove the model. Anti-TERRA gapmers have been used successfully in mouse cells, thus this experimental plan should not pose major difficulties.</p><p>TERRA upregulation in TRF1-depleted cells is somehow surprising as the de Lange group showed no changes in TERRA levels in TRF1-deleted MEFs. Could this be linked to the p53 status of the used cells? That specific paper needs to be referenced as it was the first one describing a TRF1 KO mouse. Moreover, the Northern blots shown in Figure 5B-D are not satisfactory. TERRA pattern is different in each panel, there is no TERRA signal in panel C for MEFs, while mouse TERRA is definitely abundant and easily detectable. Similarly, there is no signal for TERRA in wt cells in panel D. Why does the 18S signal fade away till disappearing throughout samples in panel C?</p><p>It would be important to test whether the increased in TERRA depends on transcription.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, the authors (Marion, et al.) investigate the function of TRF1 in pluripotent cells and demonstrate that the TRF1 removal leads to the changes of gene expression that are related to the pluripotency. They also found that the enrichment of SUZ12 and H3K9me3 were increased in genes that are involved in the development and cell differentiation. In the end, they demonstrated that a long non-coding RNA, TERRA, is induced upon TRF1 depletion and the increase of TERRA binding to genome correlates the patterns of SUZ12 and H3K9me3 enrichment. The authors propose a model that TERRA mediates the recruitment of PRC2 complex in TRF1 depleted cells. Their findings are exciting and provide a mechanism by which TRF1 not only functions at telomeres but also is essential for the epigenetic regulation in ES cells. However, there are a few concerns that should be addressed that could make the manuscript more convincing and more interesting for the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) There is no direct evidence showing the TERRA mediates the increased recruitment of SUZ12 to those genomic loci after TRF depletion in this study. Does TRF1 removal increase the interaction between PRC2 and TERRA in vivo? This is an important question that could greatly support the author's claim. RNA immunoprecipitation (such as UV-RIP) for PRC2 complex could be done to address this question. Figure 7D and 7E show that the binding sites of SUZ12 and TERRA are nearby but not at the same sites. If TERRA mediates the PRC2 recruitment, why SUZ12 and TERRA bind at different sites?</p><p>2) I couldn't find anywhere that the authors mentioned the biological replicates for ChIP-seq data. If not, it is crucial to have at least two biological replicates of ChIP-seq or ChIP-qPCR to confirm the increase of SUZ12 and H3K27me3 enrichment at several genomic loci after TRF1 depletion.</p><p>3) The title seems to contradict the author's results in the manuscript. TERRA recruits more PRC2 complex to the genomic loci in the absence of TRF1. So it means that TERRA can regulate the transcriptional landscape of pluripotent cells through a TRF1-independent manner (not dependent). In the fourth paragraph of the Discussion, the authors also state that TERRA can also bind to PRC2 sites in the genome that are dependent on TRF1. If TERRA binding to PRC2 sites is in a TRF1-dependent manner, the results should show the decrease of TERRA binding to PRC2 sites upon TRF depletion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;TERRA regulate the transcriptional landscape of pluripotent cells through TRF1-dependent recruitment of PRC2&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been further evaluated by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining, significant issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The paper has now improved, yet some main issues remain.</p><p>1) The TERRA depletion experiment is not satisfactory according to me. First of all, a 10/20% depletion efficiency is essentially no depletion. With such depletion efficiencies I would argue that any observed cellular responses derive from introducing a C-rich telomeric RNA sequence in cells, rather than from depletion of TERRA. Additionally, measuring TERRA depletion using FISH is not ideal as the signal might diminish at least in part because the C-rich gapmer is preventing the FISH probe from binding, possibly in absence of TERRA degradation in cells. A Northern blot should be performed. Also, how does the TERRA signal look like? There is no image shown, as to give a sense of how this minor depletion can be visualized. A complementation experiment where TERRA is ectopically re-expressed is formally impossible using the telomeric C-rich gapmers, as the telomeric TERRA sequence cannot be changed. Nevertheless, the authors could also consider to deplete TERRA using one or more gamers targeting unique sequences from the subtelomere of chromosome 18, which is the TERRA locus according to results from the Blasco lab. In this case, a complementation experiment could be performed by expressing ectopic telomeric RNA, which should localize in trans to all telomeres, again according to what published by the Blasco lab. Issues stem also from the fact that siRNA-mediated depletion of TRF1 is very poor (at least at the mRNA levels; I am not sure I understand why the authors did not perform a Western blot). Why are shRNA and gapmers 'incompatible'? Overall, as they stand now, I do not think that those experiments should be published.</p><p>2) I still think that the quality of the Northern blots shown in Figure 5 is quite low. For panel D (which did not change compared to the last version), I suggest using the images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, they are definitely better.</p><p>3) The authors now back up their finding in mouse cells by citing several reports showing TERRA up-regulation in TRF1-depleted human cells of various type. This is ok and possibly interesting in terms of evolutionary conservation of this mechanism. Unfortunately, the authors forgot to cite their own paper appeared in Nat Cell Biol in 2008 (Schoeftner and Blasco, 2008), where siRNA-mediated depletion of TRF1 in C2C12 mouse cells was shown to decrease TERRA levels, and TRF1 was thus presented as a negative regulator of TERRA transcription through its interaction with RNA polymerase II. This should also be explained.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The revised version of the manuscript provides some additional work such as RNA-seq and RNA-IP experiments to strengthen the authors' idea that TRF1 regulating gene expression in pluripotent cells is mediated by TERRA and SUZ12 recruitment to the genome. They found that the interaction of TERRA and SUZ12 was increased after TRF1 depletion. They also used siRNA and LNA Gapmer to knockdown TRF1 and TERRA in 2i-grown iPS cells and investigated the transcriptome changes between TRF1-alone depletion and TRF1/TERRA depletion. They show that the expression of some genes, which were altered in TRF1-alone depletion, was not altered in TRF1/TERRA depletion, suggesting that the upregulation of TERRA levels is required for the changes in gene expression upon TRF1 depletion. However, the authors didn't compare the results with the gene targets for the increase of TERRA binding and SUZ12 binding after TRF1 depletion. Therefore, it is not clear whether the recruitment of TERRA and SUZ12 is required for the regulation of those genes. This question needs to be addressed before publication.</p><p>1) In Figure 7—figure supplement 1C, the authors show that the expression of some genes that were not altered when downregulation of TERRA after TRF1 depletion (such as Lef1 and Stk39), indicating that TRF1 regulates the expression of these genes by regulating TERRA levels. Do these genes have TERRA binding sites and SUZ12 binding sites? And do they correlate with the increase of TERRA binding and SUZ12 binding after TRF1 depletion? These questions are important to rule out whether TERRA regulates the gene expression is mediated by recruiting SUZ12 or other mechanisms. In Figure 7J, the authors also show that up or down-regulated genes after TRF1 depletion have TERRA binding sites nearby. Does the expression of those genes change in both TRF1 and TERRA depleted cells? Because I don't see any genes are presented in both Figure 7—figure supplement 1C and Figure 7J, the connection between TRF1 depletion, the increase of TERRA binding sites, and the increased of SUZ12 binding sites is weak. It would be more convincing that the authors show the gene expression of some specific genes (up or down-regulated in shTRF1 cells having TERRA and SUZ12 binding sites), which are controlled by TERRA and SUZ12 in a TRF1 dependent manner (TRF1 expression). In other words, the authors should find some common genes in Figure 7J and Figure 7—figure supplement 1C. The authors could check TERRA CHIRT qPCR for those genes found in Figure 7—figure supplement 1C using shTRF1 cells.</p><p>2) The CHIRT-seq technique can detect RNA interacting chromatin that could be either mediated by protein complexes or through direct RNA/DNA interaction. The sentence claiming that &quot;The CHIRT technique can only detect peaks where RNA-DNA interaction occurs.&quot; in the main text is incorrect and misleading. CHIRT-seq (Chu et al., 2017) utilizes glutaraldehyde to fix cells, and this reagent will crosslink the protein-protein complex, protein-RNA, protein-DNA complex, and RNA-protein-DNA complex. Other methods such as ChIRP-seq (Chu et al., 2012) developed by Howard Chang's laboratory and CHART-seq (Simon et al., 2013) developed by Robert Kingston's laboratory also use aldehyde-based chemicals to crosslink RNA-chromatin complex. The major purpose of these techniques is to detect RNA associated complexes that are made of RNA, proteins, and DNA. The authors need a better explanation of why SUZ12 and TERRA have different binding sites. One possibility is that ChIP and CHIRT use physical sonication to shear chromatin, and thus the long-range interaction mediated by long non-coding RNA could be disrupted after sonication.

It seems important to us to deplete TERRA using gapmer ASO in TRF1-depleted cells with RNA-Seq or RT-qPCR of selected genes. The reviewer also raised the fact that TERRA upregulation in TRF1-depleted cells showed no changes in TERRA levels in TRF1-deleted MEFs by the de Lange lab. This contradiction needs to be explained. Finally, the Northern blots in Figure 5 remain problematic (but with thanks for the earlier explanation provided). The reviewer specifically noted that the TERRA pattern is different in each panel, there is no TERRA signal in panel C for MEFs, while mouse TERRA is definitely abundant and easily detectable. Similarly, there is no signal for TERRA in wt cells in panel D. Why does the 18S signal fade away till disappearing throughout samples in panel C?</p></disp-quote><p>We have fully addressed these concerns reviewer #2 (see also “detailed answer to reviewer #2”) in the revised manuscript. In particular:</p><p>As requested by reviewer #2, in the revised manuscript we have now downregulated TERRA in TRF1-depleted cells by using Gapmers (see Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and analyzed the impact in gene expression (see Figure 7—figure supplement 1). Due to technical incompatibilities with the use of shRNAs and Gapmers, we used siRNAs to downregulate TRF1 levels and Gapmers to decrease TERRA expression. Thus, 2i-grown <italic>p53<sup>-/-</sup></italic>iPS cells were co-transfected with a combination of two different siRNAs against TRF1 and a Gapmer against TERRA. In this experimental setting, we obtained up to 25-30% downregulation of TERRA levels in these cells by using Gapmers (see Figure 7—figure supplement 1A) and a moderate decrease in TRF1 levels (see Figure 7—figure supplement 1B). In spite of the technical difficulties of the experiment and the moderate downregulation of TRF1 and TERRA, we went ahead and performed RNA-seq of the samples. We observed that a number of genes that we had found altered when depleting TRF1 by shRNA were also regulated when depleting TRF1 with an siRNA (see Figure 7—figure supplement 1C), although the changes were modest, most likely owing to the modest downregulation of TRF1. Importantly, we now show that expression of some of these genes was not altered when downregulation of TERRA was performed at the same time that depletion of TRF1 (see Figure 7—figure supplement 1C), indicating that their expression change depends on TERRA upregulation. Interestingly, ENRICH analysis of the downregulated genes showed that they are targets of pluripotency factors and belong to the PluriNetWork pathway (see Figure 7—figure supplement 1D), while upregulated genes are targets of pluripotency factors, differentiation factors and Polycomb, and belong to differentiation pathways (see Figure 7—figure supplement 1E). Therefore, these results are in agreement with our model, in which the upregulation of TERRA levels is required for the changes in gene expression produced upon TRF1 depletion.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we now discuss the apparent discrepancy with the de Lange results (see subsection “Depletion of TRF1 in 2i-grown iPS cells induces the up-regulation of TERRA RNAs expression”, first paragraph). Finally, we repeated the Northern blot shown in former Figure 5C and we now clearly show that TERRA increases associated to TRF1 downregulation (see new Figure 5C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3: This reviewer was generally supportive but would also like to see some additional experiments. Specifically, they would like evidence showing the TERRA mediates the increased recruitment of SUZ12 after TRF1 depletion. A RIP experiment after depletion seems appropriate. A good question is also about why SUZ12 and TERRA bind at different sites if TERRA is recruiting PRC2. Secondly, biological replicates for ChIP-seq data are critical. Finally, various contradictions mentioned by this reviewer (as well as the other reviewers) need to be addressed directly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed the concerns reviewer #2 (see also “detailed answer to reviewer #2”) in the revised manuscript. In particular:</p><p>As requested by reviewer #3, we now include in the revised manuscript a RIP experiment after depletion of TRF1 and show that the binding of SUZ12 to TERRA clearly increases after TRF1 depletion (see new Figure 8A). Also as requested by this reviewer, in the revised manuscript we now include a second biological replicate of all the ChIP-seq (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 4). In particular, we find that heatmaps of the two biological replicates of H3K27me3 ChIP-seq, with reads plotted around the peaks for both replicas, show the same pattern (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Cluster 3 and 7 include regions when H3K27me3 increases upon TRF1 depletion in both replicas. Importantly, more than 90% of the genes that show increased levels of H3K27me3 mark upon TRF1 depletion are the same in both replicas, confirming the high similarity between both ChIP-seq.</p><p>Finally, we have addressed all the other suggestions of this reviewer in the revised manuscript text and figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) Despite efficient TRF1 depletion, telomeres are not recognized as γH2AX TIF (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). This data directedly contradicts previous TRF1 studies including Blasco lab's publication on TRF1 knock-out iPS cells (Schneider et al., 2013). Cells might be harvested earlier than the moment of DDR activation (as written on the manuscript), however, authors need to provide the information that whether shTRF1 telomeres are inflicted with DNA damage responses as described before.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes a good point, however, this can be explained because we have used very short time points after TRF1 deletion precisely not to complicate the interpretation of our results by the activation of a DNA damage response (DDR) as a consequence of TRF1 abrogation. Nevertheless, in the revised manuscript, we now included the analysis of telomere aberrations previously associated to TRF1 abrogation, such as the so-called “multitelomeric signals” or MTS. To this end, we performed quantitative telomere FISH (QFISH) in metaphases obtained after TRF1 depletion in p53<sup>-/-</sup>iPS cells (see new Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). The new results demonstrate that TRF1 downregulation increases the abundance of “multitelomeric signals”, as expected from TRF1 depletion, however, the short time of cell harvesting after TRF1 depletion is probably not sufficient for the activation of a DDR over the basal levels observed in the p53-deficient control cell lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Overall links between the events of TERRA binding, PRC2 localization, and subsequent gene regulation are fairly weak. As shown in Figure 7D and E, only a fraction of TERRA bound genes shows both SUZ12 and H3K27me3 enrichment (13 / 101 of down-regulated genes and 25 / 142 of up-regulated genes). Furthermore, the SUZ12 and/or H3K27me3 increase in shTRF1 cells are not quite convincing (Figure 7D and E; Figure 3B, H3K27me3 peaks; Figure 4B, H3K27me3 peaks). TERRA protein interatom (Chu et al., 2017) covers a list of epigenetic regulators and transcription factors, therefore, TERRA mediated transcription regulations do not necessarily undergo PRC2 recruitment. Although TRF1 depletion convincingly increased SUZ12 level in certain genes (Figure 2 and 3), the large part of gene expression changes happened in genes without TERRA accumulation (Figure 7A). Therefore, most transcriptional changes are due to the systemic effect of TRF1 depletion rather than TERRA accumulation in such genes. Nevertheless, a significant portion of altered gene expression in shTRF1 cells coincide with TERRA bound genes (Figure 7A, 98/328 of down-regulated genes and 162/483 of up-regulated genes) and PRC2 (SUZ12) accumulation was clearly observed at pluripotency and differentiation genes. This study does not sufficiently support a model in Figure 8 as also claimed in the manuscript, but still can deliver important information of TRF1 functions on stem cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has an interesting point. We would like to clarify that the CHIRT technique can only detect the RNA loops formed by direct RNA-DNA interaction. Therefore, a defined TERRA peak by CHIRT indicates the place in the genome where the RNA-DNA interaction is taking place. However, TERRA RNAs are very long and can spread way further than the point of interaction with DNA. In this scenario, it is possible that TERRA is recruiting PRC2 components in places non-coincident with TERRA peaks. That could explain in part that only a fraction of TERRA peaks correlates with SUZ12 peaks and that many SUZ12 peaks do not show TERRA peaks. We now explain this in the revised manuscript text (see subsection “Genomic TERRA binding correlates with genes that are differentially expressed in the absence of TRF1 and that have presence of SUZ12 and H3K27me3”, third paragraph).</p><p>In addition, and in agreement with the reviewer´s remark, part of SUZ12 binding to the genome could be independent on TERRA recruitment due to changes in the epigenomic status of the cell. Alternatively, this could be due to the changes on gene expression that we observe upon TRF1 depletion (see Figure 1). We discuss now this subject in the revised manuscript text (see the aforementioned paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) H3K27me3 is an epigenetic mark tightly associated with gene suppression. However, this study demonstrated that a number of genes are upregulated with increased H3K27me3. Authors need to provide a sufficient explanation of these seemingly contradictory results.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has an interesting point. Cluster 1 in Figure 4D shows the genes whose expression is upregulated upon TRF1 depletion and present an increase of H3K27me3 around their TSS. It is important to note that the increase in H3K27me3 mark is very low. Most importantly, analysis of these genes shows that almost 70% of them belong to the group of bivalent genes. It is described that bivalent genes show a lower presence of H3K27me3 in naïve state that in primed state (Marks et al., 2012). Our data support the idea that depletion of TRF1 induces a transition from naïve to primed-differentiated state. The increased signal of H3K27me3 in those bivalent genes upon TRF1 depletion further supports this model. We now discuss this in the revised manuscript text (subsection “Depletion of TRF1 induces recruitment of SUZ12 and H3K27me3 to genes de-regulated in the absence of TRF1”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Physiological information is somewhat missing in this study. Authors can enhance their point on the TRF1 function by measuring TRF1 and TERRA level changes during early cell differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously described that in vivo de-differentiation in mouse tissues as the consequence of in vivo reprogramming results in increased TRF1 levels in the de-differentiated tissue areas coincidental with expression of the Oct4 pluripotency factor (Marion et al., 2017). In turn, we previously showed that TRF1 levels are higher in the Inner Cell Mass (ICM) at the blastocyst stage in mice compared to differentiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (see Figure 4C, D in Varela et al., 2011). In addition, we have previously shown that TRF1 is upregulated in stem cells compartments compared to the differentiated compartments in different adult tissues (Schneider et al., 2013). Together, these previous findings from our group clearly point to TRF1 regulation associated to differentiation state. Similarly, we have previously shown that TERRA is upregulated during induction of iPS cells (Marión et al., 2009).</p><p>Nevertheless, we have addressed this issue with an additional experiment in which we now demonstrate that TERRA and TRF1 levels are also downregulated when we induce differentiation of ES cells upon treatment with retinoic acid (see new Figure 5—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) TRF1 is not a sole shelterin component regulating TERRA, previous studies show greater TERRA upregulation upon TRF2 depletion (Porro et al., 2014; Rossiello et al., 2017). Authors may make clear the insight on the TERRA mediated gene regulations with TRF2 depleted p53 -/- cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this interesting suggestion. In the revised manuscript text, we now show that depletion of TRF2 by an shRNA in 2i-grown p53<sup>-/-</sup>iPS does not induce changes in TERRA expression (see new Figure 5—figure supplement 1B-C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The data are interesting as they might indeed explain why TRF1 is involved in pluripotency maintenance, yet the study remains largely descriptive/correlative. While the authors' model makes sense with the data, some validation experiments are necessary to validate the proposed mechanisms. Depleting TERRA in TRF1-depleted cells followed by RNA-Seq or RT-qPCR of selected genes would confirm of disprove the model. Anti-TERRA gapmers have been used successfully in mouse cells, thus this experimental plan should not pose major difficulties.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the detailed review of our manuscript and for considering that “The data are interesting as they might indeed explain why TRF1 is involved in pluripotency maintenance”. The reviewer also has a number of insightful suggestions for new experimentation and revisions, which we have addressed in the revised manuscript.

In the de Lange paper the experiment is done in immortalized MEFs, while we use either p53 KO iPS cells or keratinocytes. These differences in cell type and immortalization conditions could explain the contradictory results. In any case, we clearly show here a dramatic increase in TERRA in two different mouse cells types (iPS cells and keratinocytes) upon TRF1 depletion (see new Figure 5). Moreover, several works from other groups (Porro et al., 2014; Sadhukan et al., 2018, Zeng et al., 2017) have shown TERRA increase upon TRF1 depletion in human cells. Have now cite the De Lange paper and the three other papers in the revised manuscript text, as well as discuss this potential discrepancy (see subsection “Depletion of TRF1 in 2i-grown iPS cells induces the up-regulation of TERRA RNAs expression”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the Northern blots shown in Figure 5B-D are not satisfactory.

We have now repeated the Northern blot shown in former Figure 5C using new MEFs and a loading control. As expected, we see higher levels of TERRA in iPS when compared with MEFs, and a further increase in TERRA level upon TRF1 depletion (see new Figure 5C). Regarding WT cells for panel D, the levels of TERRA expression for WT keratinocytes are very low and then difficult to see. We have now included images for an independent experiment when, upon higher exposure, levels of TERRA levels in WT keratiyocytes can be better observed. Again, the results confirm that depletion of TRF1 highly increases the levels of TERRA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Regarding the reviewer concern of whether increase in TERRA levels upon TRF1 depletion depends on transcription, our CHIRT results indicate that there is an important presence of TERRA bound to the subtelomere of the chromosome 18, a locus previously described by us as a <italic>bona fide</italic> TERRA locus (Figure 6C), and that this binding is increased upon TRF1 depletion (Figure 7J), supporting the idea that more TERRA transcription is indeed occurring when TRF1 is depleted.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44656-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors (Marion, et al.) investigate the function of TRF1 in pluripotent cells and demonstrate that the TRF1 removal leads to the changes of gene expression that are related to the pluripotency. They also found that the enrichment of SUZ12 and H3K9me3 were increased in genes that are involved in the development and cell differentiation. In the end, they demonstrated that a long non-coding RNA, TERRA, is induced upon TRF1 depletion and the increase of TERRA binding to genome correlates the patterns of SUZ12 and H3K9me3 enrichment. The authors propose a model that TERRA mediates the recruitment of PRC2 complex in TRF1 depleted cells. Their findings are exciting and provide a mechanism by which TRF1 not only functions at telomeres but also is essential for the epigenetic regulation in ES cells. However, there are a few concerns that should be addressed that could make the manuscript more convincing and more interesting for the readership of eLife.</p><p>1) There is no direct evidence showing the TERRA mediates the increased recruitment of SUZ12 to those genomic loci after TRF depletion in this study. Does TRF1 removal increase the interaction between PRC2 and TERRA in vivo? This is an important question that could greatly support the author's claim. RNA immunoprecipitation (such as UV-RIP) for PRC2 complex could be done to address this question.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, in the revised manuscript we now include a RIP assay that demonstrates a higher binding of SUZ12 protein to TERRA upon TRF1 depletion (see new Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7D and 7E show that the binding sites of SUZ12 and TERRA are nearby but not at the same sites. If TERRA mediates the PRC2 recruitment, why SUZ12 and TERRA bind at different sites?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the observation. As The CHIRT technique can only detect the RNA loops formed by direct RNA-DNA interaction. Therefore, a defined TERRA peak by CHIRT indicates the place in the genome where the RNA-DNA interaction is taking place. However, TERRA RNAs are very long and can spread way farther than the point of interaction with DNA. In this scenario, it is possible that TERRA is recruiting PRC2 components in places non coincident with TERRA peaks. That could explain why binding sites of SUZ12 and TERRA are nearby but not at the same sites. We now discuss this in the revised manuscript text (subsection “Genomic TERRA binding correlates with genes that are differentially expressed in the absence of TRF1 and that have presence of SUZ12 and H3K27me3”, third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I couldn't find anywhere that the authors mentioned the biological replicates for ChIP-seq data. If not, it is crucial to have at least two biological replicates of ChIP-seq or ChIP-qPCR to confirm the increase of SUZ12 and H3K27me3 enrichment at several genomic loci after TRF1 depletion.</p></disp-quote><p>In our current study we have used two biological replicates. In Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 4, we now confirm the increase of SUZ12 and H3K27me3 at several genomic loci in both replicates, as well as the binding of TRF1 to extratelomeric sites (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 4). In particular, we found that heatmaps of the two biological replicates of SUZ12 ChIP-seq, with reads plotted around the peaks for both replicas, show the same pattern (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 1A). Importantly, the analysis of the genomic regions where SUZ12 signal was increased was highly similar (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 1A). Thus, we observed that all the clusters of these heatmaps included regions when SUZ12 increases upon TRF1 depletion in both replicas (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 1A). Importantly, we show that 99% of the genes that show increased levels of SUZ12 upon TRF1 depletion in the first experiment also show higher levels of SUZ12 in the second replica, confirming the high similarity between both ChIP-seq and the recruitment of SUZ12 to the described genomic sites (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). We also find that heatmaps of the two biological replicates of H3K27me3 ChIP-seq, with reads plotted around the peaks for both replicas, show the same pattern (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). We observed that cluster 3 and 7 of these heatmaps include regions when H3K27me3 increases upon TRF1 depletion in both replicas. Importantly, we show that 90% of the genes that show increased levels of H3K27me3 upon TRF1 depletion in the first experiment also show higher levels of H3K27me3 in the second replica (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 1F), confirming the high similarity between both ChIP-seq. In the case of the two biological replicas of TRF1 ChIP-seqs, we find that the number of genomics sites bound by TRF1 is very low in both replicas (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 4), suggesting that the vast epigenetic changes observed here as the consequence of TRF1 depletion and which involve re-localization of PRC2 to many genomic sites, are not likely to be explained by binding of TRF1 to these few extra-telomeric sites. Also, in both replicas the binding of TRF1 to the genome is mainly associated to extratelomeric sequences (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The title seems to contradict the author's results in the manuscript. TERRA recruits more PRC2 complex to the genomic loci in the absence of TRF1. So it means that TERRA can regulate the transcriptional landscape of pluripotent cells through a TRF1-independent manner (not dependent). In the fourth paragraph of the Discussion, the authors also state that TERRA can also bind to PRC2 sites in the genome that are dependent on TRF1. If TERRA binding to PRC2 sites is in a TRF1-dependent manner, the results should show the decrease of TERRA binding to PRC2 sites upon TRF depletion.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify this point. Since PRC2 is recruited to the genome by</p><p>TERRA expression regulation, and TERRA expression is regulated by TRF1 we consider adequate to state that PRC2 recruitment and TERRA expression is dependent on TRF1. By saying that is dependent on TRF1 we don´t imply that is dependent on the presence of TRF1, but on the regulation, function and expression of TRF1 protein.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining, significant issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The paper has now improved, yet some main issues remain.</p><p>1) The TERRA depletion experiment is not satisfactory according to me. First of all, a 10/20% depletion efficiency is essentially no depletion. With such depletion efficiencies I would argue that any observed cellular responses derive from introducing a C-rich telomeric RNA sequence in cells, rather than from depletion of TERRA. Additionally, measuring TERRA depletion using FISH is not ideal as the signal might diminish at least in part because the C-rich gapmer is preventing the FISH probe from binding, possibly in absence of TERRA degradation in cells. A Northern blot should be performed. Also, how does the TERRA signal look like? There is no image shown, as to give a sense of how this minor depletion can be visualized. A complementation experiment where TERRA is ectopically re-expressed is formally impossible using the telomeric C-rich gapmers, as the telomeric TERRA sequence cannot be changed. Nevertheless, the authors could also consider to deplete TERRA using one or more gamers targeting unique sequences from the subtelomere of chromosome 18, which is the TERRA locus according to results from the Blasco lab. In this case, a complementation experiment could be performed by expressing ectopic telomeric RNA, which should localize in trans to all telomeres, again according to what published by the Blasco lab. Issues stem also from the fact that siRNA-mediated depletion of TRF1 is very poor (at least at the mRNA levels; I am not sure I understand why the authors did not perform a Western blot). Why are shRNA and gapmers 'incompatible'? Overall, as they stand now, I do not think that those experiments should be published.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer´s concern regarding the partial depletion efficiency of TERRA in our experiments, and following his/her suggestion we are willing to remove these results from the revised manuscript. That said, we would like to explain all the attempts that we carried out to downregulate TERRA and the technical difficulties that we encountered. The reviewer asks about how TERRA signal looks like in the RNA FISH experiments. We now provide him/her with representative images of these experiments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2A</xref>). Regarding his concern about measuring TERRA depletion by FISH, we will like to mention that we have measured TERRA depletion also by Northern Blot and confirmed the results shown by RNA FISH, with a modest TERRA downregulation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2B</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44656-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The co-silencing of TRF1 and TERRA in iPS cells has proven to be a technically difficult experiment. Since TERRA is upregulated upon TRF1 depletion, downregulation of TERRA has to be achieved since the very first moment TRF1 is silenced, to avoid the activation of downstream consequences of TERRA expression. This timing requirement adds an extra difficulty to the experimental approach. We first tried several times to induce the co-silencing using shRNA against TRF1 and TERRA GAPMERS. As mentioned, TERRA should be silenced since the first time of shRNA infection to the last one, and maintained during the posterior antibiotic selection. During the infection process with shRNAs, cells are infected twice a day, so the medium is changed. This makes difficult to maintain the constant presence and facilitate the transfection of TERRA GAPMERS in a cell type, iPS cells, when transfection efficiency is already low. Also, after the infection process, the constant presence of antibiotic to select for infected cells interferes with the transfection of TERRA GAPMERS. We performed this experiment twice, with variations in the timing of TERRA GAPMERS transfection, and in any case we could not detect even a modest reduction of TERRA levels. It is worth to mention that measurement of TERRA by RNA FISH did not show any TERRA downregulation, indicating that introduction of C-rich GAPMERS is not preventing the FISH probe from binding.</p><p>Then, and to avoid the infections required for the use of shRNAs, we decided to downregulate TRF1 using siRNA in a double transfection experiment. With this approach, we have also performed several attempts to optimize the proper timings of infection to achieve the best TRF1 and TERRA downregulation. However, transfection of iPS cells is an inefficient process, and the chances that the same cell is transfected with both the siRNA and GAPMERs is low. Still, with this approach we have been able to obtain the moderate decrease (10-20%) shown in the manuscript. We believe that by using GAPMERs against the subtelomere of chromosome 18 we will encounter the same technical problems and we will not improve TERRA downregulation.</p><p>We understand that this level of downregulation is low and not optimal and thus, as suggested by the reviewer, we have removed this experiment from the revised manuscript. In any case, we believe that the main message of the paper remains the same, and represents a significant advance in our understanding of the role of TRF1 in pluripotency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I still think that the quality of the Northern blots shown in Figure 5 is quite low. For panel D (which did not change compared to the last version), I suggest using the images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, they are definitely better.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her suggestion. Following such suggestion, we have changed the representative image of Figure 5D in the revised manuscript figures (see new Figure 5D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors now back up their finding in mouse cells by citing several reports showing TERRA up-regulation in TRF1-depleted human cells of various type. This is ok and possibly interesting in terms of evolutionary conservation of this mechanism. Unfortunately, the authors forgot to cite their own paper appeared in Nat Cell Biol in 2008 (Schoeftner and Blasco, 2008), where siRNA-mediated depletion of TRF1 in C2C12 mouse cells was shown to decrease TERRA levels, and TRF1 was thus presented as a negative regulator of TERRA transcription through its interaction with RNA polymerase II. This should also be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right and this paper should have cited and discussed. In the revised manuscript we have now included the citation and discussion about these results (see subsection “Depletion of TRF1 in 2i-grown iPS cells induces the up-regulation of TERRA RNAs expression”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The revised version of the manuscript provides some additional work such as RNA-seq and RNA-IP experiments to strengthen the authors' idea that TRF1 regulating gene expression in pluripotent cells is mediated by TERRA and SUZ12 recruitment to the genome. They found that the interaction of TERRA and SUZ12 was increased after TRF1 depletion. They also used siRNA and LNA Gapmer to knockdown TRF1 and TERRA in 2i-grown iPS cells and investigated the transcriptome changes between TRF1-alone depletion and TRF1/TERRA depletion. They show that the expression of some genes, which were altered in TRF1-alone depletion, was not altered in TRF1/TERRA depletion, suggesting that the upregulation of TERRA levels is required for the changes in gene expression upon TRF1 depletion. However, the authors didn't compare the results with the gene targets for the increase of TERRA binding and SUZ12 binding after TRF1 depletion. Therefore, it is not clear whether the recruitment of TERRA and SUZ12 is required for the regulation of those genes. This question needs to be addressed before publication.</p><p>1) In Figure 7—figure supplement 1C, the authors show that the expression of some genes that were not altered when downregulation of TERRA after TRF1 depletion (such as Lef1 and Stk39), indicating that TRF1 regulates the expression of these genes by regulating TERRA levels. Do these genes have TERRA binding sites and SUZ12 binding sites? And do they correlate with the increase of TERRA binding and SUZ12 binding after TRF1 depletion? These questions are important to rule out whether TERRA regulates the gene expression is mediated by recruiting SUZ12 or other mechanisms. In Figure 7J, the authors also show that up or down-regulated genes after TRF1 depletion have TERRA binding sites nearby. Does the expression of those genes change in both TRF1 and TERRA depleted cells? Because I don't see any genes are presented in both Figure 7—figure supplement 1C and Figure 7J, the connection between TRF1 depletion, the increase of TERRA binding sites, and the increased of SUZ12 binding sites is weak. It would be more convincing that the authors show the gene expression of some specific genes (up or down-regulated in shTRF1 cells having TERRA and SUZ12 binding sites), which are controlled by TERRA and SUZ12 in a TRF1 dependent manner (TRF1 expression). In other words, the authors should find some common genes in Figure 7J and Figure 7—figure supplement 1C. The authors could check TERRA CHIRT qPCR for those genes found in Figure 7-supplement 1C using shTRF1 cells.</p></disp-quote><p>In this figure we show the 46 genes whose expression is altered in a similar way when downregulating TRF1 by siRNA and depleting TRF1 by shRNA (as measured by RNA-seq). Regarding his/her question about whether these genes show TERRA and SUZ12 binding sites and increased binding of SUZ12 upon TRF1 depletion, 39 genes show binding for SUZ12 (as obtained from heatmaps in Figures 3D and 4D), and all of them show increased binding of SUZ12 upon TRF1 depletion. In terms of TERRA, 11 of these genes show binding of TERRA (as obtained from heatmaps in Figure 7B and 7C) and 9 of them present increased binding of SUZ12 upon TRF1 depletion. Regarding his/her question about whether expression of genes shown in Figure 7J change in both TRF1 and TERRA depleted cells the answer is that none of them show any change, probably due to the low TERRA downregulation obtained in this experiment. Owing to the poor efficiency in TERRA downregulation, and as suggested by reviewer #2, we are removing the results shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1C from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The CHIRT-seq technique can detect RNA interacting chromatin that could be either mediated by protein complexes or through direct RNA/DNA interaction. The sentence claiming that &quot;The CHIRT technique can only detect peaks where RNA-DNA interaction occurs.&quot; in the main text is incorrect and misleading. CHIRT-seq (Chu et al., 2017) utilizes glutaraldehyde to fix cells, and this reagent will crosslink the protein-protein complex, protein-RNA, protein-DNA complex, and RNA-protein-DNA complex. Other methods such as ChIRP-seq (Chu et al., 2012) developed by Howard Chang's laboratory and CHART-seq (Simon et al., 2013) developed by Robert Kingston's laboratory also use aldehyde-based chemicals to crosslink RNA-chromatin complex. The major purpose of these techniques is to detect RNA associated complexes that are made of RNA, proteins, and DNA. The authors need a better explanation of why SUZ12 and TERRA have different binding sites. One possibility is that ChIP and CHIRT use physical sonication to shear chromatin, and thus the long-range interaction mediated by long non-coding RNA could be disrupted after sonication. Other mechanisms that may lead to this result should also be discussed in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this correction. In the revised manuscript we have now removed that sentence and include alternative explanations to explain why SUZ12 and TERRA have different binding sites (see subsection “Genomic TERRA binding correlates with genes that are differentially expressed 486 in the absence of TRF1 and that have presence of SUZ12 and H3K27me3”, third paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
