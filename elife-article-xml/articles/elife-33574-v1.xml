of processes in eukaryotic organisms. Interestingly, different chemokine receptors control distinct biological processes, and the same receptor can direct different cellular responses, but the basis for this phenomenon is not known. To understand this property of chemokine signaling, we examined the function of the chemokine receptors Cxcr4a, Cxcr4b, Ccr7, Ccr9 in the context of diverse processes in embryonic development in zebrafish. Our results reveal that the specific response to chemokine signaling is dictated by cell-type-specific chemokine receptor signal interpretation modules (CRIM) rather than by chemokine-receptor-specific signals. Thus, a generic signal provided by different receptors leads to discrete responses that depend on the specific identity of the cell that receives the signal. We present the implications of employing generic signals in different contexts such as gastrulation, axis specification and single-cell migration.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33574.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Every process in the body is regulated by a complex network of interactions between different molecules and cells. Chemokines, for example, are tiny molecules produced by a cell that are involved in a range of processes, from development to immune responses and cancer.</p><p>When chemokines bind to a specific protein on another cell, called the chemokine receptor, it stimulates different signaling pathways inside the cell. Consequently, chemokine receptors are equally important for regulating processes as diverse as the movement of cells during development and growth, or activating immune responses.</p><p>Mammals have over 20 different chemokine receptors, and the same receptor can have different roles depending in which cell type it is found in. For example, in one cell type it may stimulate an action such as cell growth, but in another, it may block this process. Until now, it was unclear how chemokine receptors can achieve such different effects. One theory was that chemokine receptors initiate a distinct signaling cascade, a phenomenon termed ‘signaling bias’, depending on the type of chemokine or receptor.</p><p>Here, Malhotra et al. used zebrafish embryos to investigate how four specific chemokine receptors regulate different events during early development. They found that the same chemokine receptor could direct different reactions in distinct cell types, while different receptors could also cause the same response in a specific cell type. In other words, the effect of a chemokine receptor depends on the cell type rather than the type of receptor.</p><p>Since each of these receptors was able to control processes that it normally does not regulate in other cells, Malhotra et al. suggest that different chemokine receptors provide the same generic signal when activated, which the specific cell types then interpret accordingly.</p><p>A next step will be to test how other chemokine receptors behave in different contexts, for example during an immune response. If the receptors work on the same principle regardless of the process, it could help to explain why faulty expression of chemokine receptors play such an important role during development and in disease. It could further highlight why blocking one receptor may not have any consequences, as they are dispensable and can be replaced by other receptors in the cell.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chemokine signalling</kwd><kwd>embryo development</kwd><kwd>pattern formation</kwd><kwd>signalling bias</kwd><kwd>chemokine</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RA 863/11-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raz</surname><given-names>Erez</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CellMig_268806</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raz</surname><given-names>Erez</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM118179</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Solnica-Krezel</surname><given-names>Lilianna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC 1003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raz</surname><given-names>Erez</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new form of chemokine signaling bias that depends on cell state is identified.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemokines are small proteins that signal upon binding seven-pass-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000</xref>). Chemokine receptors are classified into four categories namely, CXCR, CCR, XCR and CX3CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nomiyama et al., 2011</xref>). Chemokines were originally shown to function in the context of immune response, but were thereafter implicated in a range of developmental processes such as angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Strieter et al., 1995</xref>), neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zou et al., 1998</xref>) and migration of non-immune cells. Following binding to their ligands, chemokine receptors activate a wide range of effectors, including adenylyl cyclases, phospholipase isoforms, protein tyrosine kinases, ion channels, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). These responses can result from the activation of G proteins, as well as from other second messengers to initiate G-protein-independent signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steen et al., 2014</xref>). For example, in addition to signaling through the G protein Gαi and Gβγ, chemokine receptors can initiate JAK/STAT signaling and signal through β-arrestin, in the context of chemotaxis of hematopoietic progenitor cells and in the context of activation and release of granules in neutrophils, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barlic et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, chemokine receptor signaling through a range of second messenger molecules potentially expands an individual chemokine receptor’s ability to control qualitatively different cellular responses.</p><p>In many cases, the same chemokine receptor is expressed in different cell types, where it initiates very different types of biological responses. For example, Cxcr4 expression in hematopoietic progenitors is important for these cells’ mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Möhle et al., 1998</xref>), yet, the same receptor, when expressed in neuronal progenitor cells inhibits their proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krathwohl and Kaiser, 2004</xref>). Similarly, CCR7 is expressed by T lymphocytes to facilitate their homing to secondary lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sallusto et al., 1999</xref>), but it is also expressed in and important for the development of the human placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drake et al., 2004</xref>). On the other hand, in early zebrafish embryos Ccr7 is expressed broadly and is involved in proper dorsoventral axis formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). These observations raise the question of how different chemokine receptors control such a wide range of different processes.</p><p>Several models have been suggested to explain this phenomenon and these are collectively referred to as ‘signaling bias’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steen et al., 2014</xref>). Related to that, it has been recently demonstrated that the extracellular and membrane-spanning domains of chemokine receptors are not responsible for signaling specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). In this work, the extracellular and transmembrane domains of rhodopsin were combined with the intracellular domains of Cxcr4. In this case, in response to light (the ligand of rhodopsin), the chimeric protein elicited Cxcr4 signaling, such that it could direct the migration of T-cells. A receptor could show signaling bias by preferentially activating different signaling cascades depending on the specific ligand or agonist it binds. For example, when chemokine receptor Ccr7 is bound by Ccl19, it induces β-arrestin recruitment more potently than when it is bound by Ccl21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kohout et al., 2004</xref>). Another type of signaling bias, which could increase the range of processes that chemokine receptors control involves the initiation of different signaling cascades upon binding of the same ligand. For example, Cxcr4 interaction with its ligand Cxcl12 triggers both Gαi and β-arrestin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dumstrei et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>), while Cxcr7 receptor interaction with Cxcl12 was reported to activate β-arrestin but not G-protein signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rajagopal et al., 2010</xref>). Overall, the above-mentioned studies help explain how chemokine receptor signaling bias occurs, as these receptors and their ligands can differentially activate certain second messengers. However, previous studies have not thoroughly examined the relevance of specific differences in second messenger activation with respect to the resulting biological responses <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that distinct responses to chemokine receptor signaling depend on the responding cell type rather than on the specific receptor activated by its ligand. We demonstrate this principle via chemokine receptor signaling in zebrafish embryos by examining the function of four different chemokine receptors: Cxcr4a, Cxcr4b, Ccr7, and Ccr9. We gathered several lines of evidence to show that these chemokine receptors initiate specific biological processes in a way that depends on the cell types they are expressed in. These results present chemokine receptor signal interpretation module (CRIM) as a new mechanism for biasing the biological response resulting from chemokine receptor signaling. Specifically, we showed that each of those receptors is capable of controlling biological processes that it normally does not regulate, indicating that different chemokine receptors provide the same signal when activated. We thus suggest that different cell types express specific response modules or CRIM that interpret generic signals produced by different types of chemokine receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The signaling cascades initiated by Cxcr4a and Cxcr4b can direct similar biological processes</title><p>As a result of an additional genome duplication in teleosts relative to other vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meyer and Schartl, 1999</xref>), the zebrafish genome encodes two <italic>cxcr4</italic> genes, specifically <italic>cxcr4a</italic> and <italic>cxcr4b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chong et al., 2001</xref>). These two genes were shown to regulate very different biological events and respond to different ligands; Cxcr4a is activated by the chemokine Cxcl12b and Cxcr4b is activated by the chemokine Cxcl12a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boldajipour et al., 2011</xref>). Cxcr4a plays a central role in vascular system patterning by guiding multicellular vessel growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Siekmann et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, Cxcr4a controls endodermal cell-matrix adhesion, thereby ensuring proper gastrulation movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nair and Schilling, 2008</xref>). At the same time, Cxcr4b is involved in different processes such as the guided migration of primordial germ cells (PGCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doitsidou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knaut et al., 2003</xref>). To examine whether qualitative differences between Cxcr4a and Cxcr4b signaling exist, we investigated this issue in the contexts of gastrulation (Cxcr4a-controlled endodermal cell adhesion) and directional migration (Cxcr4b-controlled single-cell migration).</p><p>First, we expressed Cxcr4a instead of the Cxcr4b receptor in PGCs and examined whether the foreign receptor (Cxcr4a) could function in the context of guided single-cell migration, which is normally directed by Cxcr4b. We assayed the function of the receptor by monitoring the position of the PGCs in 12 hours post-fertilization (hpf) old embryos, a stage when <italic>cxcl12b</italic> (encoding for the Cxcr4a ligand) and <italic>cxcl12a</italic> (encoding for the Cxcr4b ligand) exhibit distinct expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boldajipour et al., 2011</xref>), allowing us to determine the response of the cells towards each of the ligands. In this experimental setup, embryos homozygous for the <italic>cxcr4b odysseus</italic> nonsense mutation, inactivating the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knaut et al., 2003</xref>) were used. In <italic>odysseus</italic> mutant embryos injected with control RNA encoding for the human CD14 the PGCs were randomly distributed, whereas injecting RNA encoding for Cxcr4b in the PGCs reversed the phenotype, such that the cells clustered at regions where the ligand Cxcl12a was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Intriguingly, PGCs expressing Cxcr4a were located closer to the midline at the region where the RNA encoding for the Cxcr4a ligand Cxcl12b is normally expressed (see green label in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> right panel, n = 60 embryos in three experimental repeats). Thus, the mis-expressed chemokine receptor Cxcr4a is capable of directing PGC migration toward sites where its ligand Cxcl12b is expressed, despite the fact that it is normally not involved in this process. This result is consistent with the idea that the signals provided by the two receptors are qualitatively similar, allowing the cells to respond in a similar way to the signals generated by either of the receptors.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33574.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The signaling cascades initiated by Cxcr4a and Cxcr4b are functionally equivalent.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The position of PGCs (detected by <italic>nanos3</italic> RNA expression, yellow) relative to tissues expressing <italic>cxcl12a</italic> (magenta) and <italic>cxcl12b</italic> (green) RNAs in 12 hpf <italic>cxcr4b-/-</italic> embryos.

In this experiment, we made use of a transgenic fish line (<italic>sox17::GFP,</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mizoguchi et al., 2008</xref>]) in which all the endodermal cells and the dorsal forerunner cells are labeled with GFP. Inhibiting the translation of <italic>cxcr4a</italic> along with <italic>cxcl12b</italic> RNAs using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides elicited the previously described abnormal displacement of endoderm from the dorsal forerunner cells, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nair and Schilling, 2008</xref>). Unlike the case of chemokine-guided migration, in the context of controlling the interaction of the endoderm with the mesoderm, the distribution of the ligand is not critical. Accordingly, global expression of the chemokine acting in a paracrine or autocrine manner is expected to effectively control the process. Indeed, the <italic>cxcr4a/cxcl12b</italic> morpholino–induced phenotype was effectively rescued by co-expressing the morpholino-resistant <italic>cxcr4a</italic> and <italic>cxcl12b</italic> mRNAs in the embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, consistent with the idea that the intracellular signals generated by the two receptors are equivalent, the expression of <italic>cxcr4b</italic> and c<italic>xcl12a</italic> RNAs in embryos knocked down for <italic>cxcr4a</italic> and <italic>cxcl12b</italic> reversed the phenotype as well. Thus, Cxcr4b signaling in endodermal cells could effectively replace that of Cxcr4a as determined by the reduction in the displacement between endodermal cells and forerunner cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CC chemokine receptors can control processes regulated by CXC receptors</title><p>The results presented above show that distinct CXC receptors can control processes they are not normally involved in. Nevertheless, Cxcr4a and Cxcr4b show relatively high similarity in their protein sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, to examine the equivalence of chemokine receptor signaling more rigorously, we performed analogous experiments where we exchanged CC and CXC receptors in different processes. Here, Ccr9 and Ccr7 (and their ligands Ccl25 and Ccl19, respectively), which do not share high-sequence similarity with Cxcr4a, Cxcr4b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) were tested in the context of Cxcr4-controlled PGC directional migration and endoderm cell adhesion.</p><p>To examine the general nature of chemokine receptor signals, we tested the potency of Ccr7 and Ccr9 in regulating endodermal cell movement.

Surprisingly, unlike the behavior PGCs exhibited with respect to low-Cxcl12a-expressing domains, when high levels of the ligand (400 pg) were expressed, the PGCs were not localized within the area where the ligand was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

According to this model, when cells reach the location of high ligand concentration, they can move away as they lost the ability to respond to the chemokine signal and migrate randomly. To examine this possibility, we compared the effect of ligand concentration on the levels of the Cxcr4b receptor on the membrane of PGCs. To this end, we labeled the PGC membrane with mCherry, and compared this signal with that of an EGFP-tagged Cxcr4b. The ratio between the mCherry and the EGFP signals reported the relative amount of functional receptor present on the membrane of the cell. Indeed, PGCs exposed to a high concentration of the ligand retained significantly fewer receptors on their membranes as compared with PGCs exposed to a low concentration of the ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). Thus, the level of receptor internalization could be correlated with reverse migration and could constitute the basis for this behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we show that the same chemokine receptor can direct distinct responses in different cell types, while different receptors elicit the same biological response in a specific type of cells. These findings are consistent with the idea, that the biological consequences of chemokine receptor signaling depend on the cell type rather than on qualitative differences in the signal produced by specific receptors. We demonstrate that the identity of the activated receptor is immaterial for the actual interpretation of the signal that results in distinct biological responses in different cells. Our findings suggest that based upon their specific differentiation state, different cell types contain specific chemokine receptor signal interpretation modules (CRIM) that interpret the generic signals produced by chemokine receptors. The suggestion that the same receptor can elicit different cellular responses is presented graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>. While it is possible that different receptors induce the response more efficiently or less, the qualitative features of the signaling, at least for the receptors and processes we examined, appear to be generic. Consistently, the cell-specific biological response to the signal appears to be robust as it can be observed when different levels of the receptor were expressed in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This situation is analogous to heterozygosity for mutated chemokine and chemokine receptor alleles that has no phenotypic consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knaut et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kupperman et al., 2000</xref>), as well as to a situation where the level of the Cxcr4b and Cxcl12a is altered by alleviating the miRNA regulation, a manipulation that has no phenotypic consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goudarzi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33574.028</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Graphical representation of Chemokine Receptor-signal Interpretation Module (CRIM).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Graphical summary of results.

For example, CCR1, CXCR1 and CXCR2 were shown to trigger arrest of rolling monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luscinskas et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weber et al., 2001</xref>). An interesting feature of the model we propose is that it allows positioning of cells by different ligands expressed in spatially distinct locations. Such a scenario was described in the case of neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow to the blood stream and is schematically presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>. In this case, the positioning of the cells is dictated by a tug-of-war situation in which CXCL12 expressed by osteoblasts functions as a retention signal that maintains the neutrophils within the bone and CXCL2 emanating from the endothelium that attracts the cells toward the blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eash et al., 2010</xref>). Another aspect of the model is presented schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>. In this case, concurrent trafficking of different cell types to distinct locations can be achieved using different chemokines. For example, in humans two subsets of memory T-cells, central memory T cells (T<sub>CM</sub>, CCR7<sup>+</sup>) and effector memory T-cells (T<sub>EM,</sub> CCR7<sup>–</sup>) exhibit different behavior and localization. T<sub>CM</sub> tend to home to secondary lymphoid organs, where ligand for CCR7 is expressed, whereas TEM, that express CCR1, CCR3, CCR5 migrate toward the inflamed tissue, where the corresponding ligands for those receptors are expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sallusto et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, while several cell types share CRIMs, their actions are compartmentalized by dynamic and distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns of the receptors and their cognate ligands.</p><p>In the context of embryonic development, the differentiation of cells and tissues dictates the presence of specific downstream signaling molecules in different cell types, which facilitates differential interpretation of a generic signal generated by chemokine receptors. This differential cell competence allows concomitant processes to be controlled by chemokines by regulating the expression pattern of receptors and ligands in specific cell populations. For example, during zebrafish gastrulation Cxcr4a regulates endodermal cell movement by controlling adhesion levels in response to uniform chemokine signaling. At the same time, the migration of germ cells is directed by specific patterns of a different ligand that interact with the chemokine receptor Cxcr4b. These two different events can take place at the same time within the same region of the embryo despite the generic signal the receptors produce as the different cell types interpret it differently.</p><p>A particular feature of the generic downstream signaling is to increase the robustness of physiologically important processes through cooperation between different receptors in supporting specific processes. For example, by inhibiting the function of lipid-activated GPCRs, we revealed a novel function of Cxcr4 in promoting epiboly during gastrulation. This function was not described before, as Cxcr4 function is redundant to that of the LPA and S1P receptors. Similarly, T cells utilize Ccr9, Cxcr4 and Ccr7 for homing to the thymus in early mouse embryos, but eliminating the function of one or two of these receptors is not sufficient to abrogate thymus homing. Only in the absence of all three receptors is thymic homing of T-cells completely abolished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calderón and Boehm, 2011</xref>). The implication of these findings is that to determine the role of chemokine signaling in a certain process, one should mutate all the chemokine receptors/GPCRs in a tissue. Our findings suggest that even if cells express multiple chemokine receptors, at a specific differentiation or physiological state they can respond to receptor activation in only one way, such as directed migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doitsidou et al., 2002</xref>), interaction with other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nair and Schilling, 2008</xref>) or embryonic patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). As S1P/LPA receptors and Cxcr4b were able to elicit a similar biological response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), this principle could be relevant for other G-protein-coupled receptors. Indeed, G-protein-coupled receptors of different families were shown to result in similar responses in other contexts. For example, neutrophils were shown to migrate towards fMLP and Cxcl8, ligands that bind distinct receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gallin et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ludwig et al., 1997</xref>). Interestingly, despite the fact that the receptors for these ligands (fMLP receptor and Cxcr2, respectively) differ in some different downstream effectors they activate, the response to ligand binding is qualitatively identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heit et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, despite differences in the biochemical response to such signals, the specific biological response of a specific cell type is identical.</p><p>In light of our findings, chemokine-mediated attraction, fugetaxis or retrotaxis do not represent the activation of distinct signaling pathways. We suggest that reverse migration does not involve a qualitatively different signaling pathway, but represents a lack of receptor signaling due to internalization and desensitization processes, as proposed by Holmes and colleagues based on mathematical modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holmes et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, cells that encounter regions where lower levels of the ligand are expressed maintain the receptor on their membranes and are therefore retained within those regions by positively responding to the chemokine distribution in the tissue. It would be interesting to determine if in other cases where retrotaxis was described for example in the case of LXA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamza et al., 2014</xref>), which has also been shown to act as a potent chemoattractant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maddox and Serhan, 1996</xref>), G-protein-coupled receptor internalization or desensitization of signaling provides the basis for reverse migration.</p><p>While we present here a role for a chemokine receptor signal interpretation modules (CRIM) in a range of biological process in the context of different receptors function, some previous findings report on qualitatively different responses in the same cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerszten et al., 1999</xref>). Such cases do not necessarily contradict our model if the cells investigated undergo a maturation process, which alter their interpretation of the signal. We suggest that since, among other differences, specific cell types differ from one another by the specific response network they harbor, the outcome of chemokine signaling can differ between cells of different lineages and sublineages (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref> for a graphical explanation of the concept). Apparently differential response to chemokine signaling was demonstrated in the case of leukocyte arrest in response to CXCL1 activation of CXCR2, while CCL2 binding to CCR2 could not lead to a similar biological response in the same cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huo et al., 2001</xref>). These findings are, however, contradictory to another study according to which CCL2 could actually induce leukocyte arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerszten et al., 1999</xref>). It would thus be interesting to critically examine such contrasting results in light of the model we suggest. Similar statements suggesting different biological responses elicited by the action of distinct ligands (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zohar et al., 2014</xref>]) should be carefully assessed for equal experimental starting conditions and cell states between the different treatments.</p><p>While the principle of generic signals and cell-specific interpretation presented here was tested in the context of chemokine receptors, it could also be relevant for other receptor families such as receptor tyrosine kinases. For example, for the receptor tyrosine kinase EGFR, the same ligand was shown to control different biological processes upon activating a specific receptor within different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freeman and Gurdon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Queenan et al., 1999</xref>). Similarly, activation of the G-protein-coupled receptor for Acetylcholine was shown to induce different biological responses in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caulfield, 1993</xref>). Such findings were interpreted as an indication that the same signaling pathway can lead to multiple cellular and developmental consequences, depending on the context and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freeman and Gurdon, 2002</xref>).</p><p>While based on our results chemokine receptors elicit qualitatively similar signals, which appear to be equivalent to those LPA and S1P receptors produce, the signal may not be universal for all GPCRs. Indeed, the endoderm migration defect resulting from loss of Apela, a GPCR ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pauli et al., 2014</xref>) could not be suppressed by expression of Cxcr4b or CCR9 with their corresponding ligands (data not shown). Further experiments should be conducted to determine if this finding reflects a qualitative difference between the signal the chemokine receptors produce and the receptor for Apela. Alternatively, the dynamics of the expression of Apela and its receptor, which we could not mimic by uniformly expressing receptors and their ligands is responsible for this result.</p><p>Our findings suggest that in addition to the expression of classic cell-specific differentiation markers, an important aspect of cell specification that dictates its fate and behavior is the expression of signaling interpretation modules. While the specific components of these modules are likely to be expressed in many cell types, the relative level of second messenger molecules as well as of molecules further downstream could provide specificity to the response. Understanding this relatively less explored yet important layer of cell differentiation is likely to shed more light on how cells regulate a range of processes and respond to different signals.</p><p>We suggest that based on the differentiation state of a cell, these second messengers and molecules further downstream of them could be present in different proportions. In this way, the interpretation of GPCR signaling would vary in each cell type, leading to different outcomes. It would thus be interesting to determine those parameters for different responses to chemokine receptors and determine if one can modulate the consequence of chemokine signaling in a predicted way.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish strains</title><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) of AB background were used as wild-type fish.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Holger Gerhardt (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Malhotra et al. use zebra fish germ cell migration and gastrulation as model processes to address the question to which extent the function of chemokine receptors is specific for a certain receptor ligand pair, for a certain physiological process and a certain cell type. By transplanting receptor ligand pairs between cells and context the authors find that receptor ligand systems are to a remarkable extent interchangeable and that it is the cell type that specifies the physiological response of the cell. They propose that, the decisive entity is the signal interpretation module, which determines what a cell will do upon receiving a GPCR stimulus.</p><p>All three reviewers find the results remarkable and the emerging concept important as it has the potential to change the angle how the field looks at chemokine receptor signalling. Furthermore, the focus on cellular context rather than specific functions of certain ligand receptor pairs also bears significant impact on strategies for therapeutic advances that exploit chemokine signalling as target. The following points should be addressed before publication:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The referees feel that although the manuscript is overall well written and most essential background is presented and discussed, there are a few points that deserve adding to the text either as Introduction or Discussion points. Previous studies and reviews have already shown that signals are information-poor and that it is mostly the state of the cell not the specific ligand/receptor that determines signaling outcome. See for example Freeman and Gurdon ARCDB 2002. Similarly, the GPCR cytoplasmic domain swops should be added to the Introduction.</p><p>2) It will be valuable for the reader if the authors would discuss the limitations and implications of their approach. Below are examples of points that the referees feel deserve discussion:</p><p>a) The ideal experimental approach would be the replacement of endogenous ligands/receptors via knock-ins rather than the reported RNA injections. For example, PGC migration is only assayed by attraction to one side rather than true rescue.</p><p>b) Does the over/mis-expression of ligands and receptors lead to ectopic phenotypes in an otherwise wild-type background (in addition to the reported rescue of mutants/morphants)? The model would suggest that cells should be misguided by ectopic inputs that compete for the same downstream effectors.</p><p>c) It is surprising how well ubiquitous ligand/receptor expression rescues the mutant/morphant phenotypes. Isn't there a requirement for spatially and temporally localized signaling? And wouldn't this approach lead to autocrine signaling?</p><p>d) How reliable was the rescue at different concentrations?</p><p>3) Another point to be discussed/clarified, is the phenotype in the <italic>ccr7</italic> mutant. It seems to be much weaker than the previously published morphant. Is that correct? If so, it would seem worthwhile to mention/discuss.</p><p>4) Finally, the omission of a third GPCR system (Apelin/Apela) that is also active in the early embryo deserves a comment. Would the model also hold true for this system? And does ectopic expression of the CXCR4 or CCR7 systems interfere with the Apelin/Apela system, as predicted by the model? The reviewers feel this should at least be discussed, if it cannot be addressed experimentally with reasonable efforts for a revision.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33574.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The referees feel that although the manuscript is overall well written and most essential background is presented and discussed, there are a few points that deserve adding to the text either as Introduction or Discussion points.

It should be noted however that those previous studies demonstrated that one receptor can control different processes in different cell types. While consistent with our suggestion, our findings go beyond this notion. We show that not only can the same receptor control different processes in different cells, but also that different receptors can control the same process.</p><p>- The “information-poor” notion (and relevant references (Caulfield, 1993; Freeman and Gurdon, 2002; Queenan et al., 1999)), is now presented in the paragraph in the Discussion starting with “While the principle of generic signals and cell-specific […]”.</p><p>- The domain swapping of GPCRs reported in (Xu et al., 2014) is now mentioned in the Introduction in the paragraph starting with “Several models have been suggested to explain this phenomenon […]”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It will be valuable for the reader if the authors would discuss the limitations and implications of their approach.

One should remember though that experiments of this kind also have limitations and might not always be successful. Such an experimental setup would not allow calibration of the receptor and ligand level at all, decoy receptors for specific ligands would not function, differences among ligand diffusion rates, ligand-receptor affinity, signaling level etc. could make a perfect phenotypic rescue impossible, despite the signal being qualitatively equivalent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Does the over/mis-expression of ligands and receptors lead to ectopic phenotypes in an otherwise wild-type background (in addition to the reported rescue of mutants/morphants)? The model would suggest that cells should be misguided by ectopic inputs that compete for the same downstream effectors.</p></disp-quote><p>This point is indeed valid and observing misguidance of germ cells (for example) under such conditions would lend further support to the model we propose.</p><p>Cxcr4a is not expressed in wild-type PGCs and is not involved in guiding their migration. In the new experiment we present in the revised manuscript, germ cells were engineered to express Cxcr4a receptor and their positioning was examined (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). According to our model, under such experimental conditions the migration of the cells would be influenced by Cxcl12b (the ligand of Cxcr4a), whose expression pattern differs from that of the endogenous Cxcr4b ligand Cxcl12a. During early development the expression of Cxcl12b is rather ubiquitous in contrast with Cxcl12a (the endogenous ligand of Cxcr4b) that is preferentially expressed within specific domains (Doitsidou et al., 2002). Indeed, despite the fact that Cxcl12a is highly expressed at these stages of development, expressing Cxcr4a in the germ cells interfered with their clustering. This point is now shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and is presented in the paragraph starting with “The finding that different types of chemokine receptors depend on the same signaling cascade […]”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) It is surprising how well ubiquitous ligand/receptor expression rescues the mutant/morphant phenotypes. Isn't there a requirement for spatially and temporally localized signaling? And wouldn't this approach lead to autocrine signaling?</p></disp-quote><p>Spatially restricted chemokine expression is indeed important for certain processes, directed cell migration for example. Accordingly, rescuing the chemokine directed migration of cells towards a specific region would not be possible by ubiquitous expression of the receptor and the ligand. For this reason we examine the ability of receptors to guide cell migration using the setup presented in Figure 3. Here, the ligand is expressed at a discrete part of the embryo and the cells are guided towards it by signals provided by a “foreign” receptor. This point is now described more clearly in the text in the paragraph starting with “To further test the capability of receptors to direct cell migration […]”</p><p>The ubiquitous ligand/receptor expression experiments were conducted in contexts where the endogenous ligands are not spatially restricted at the time of action for the processes we examined. In those cases the spatial restriction of the ligand is not required as the signal acts on many cells that express the relevant receptor in enhancing cell adhesion (in the case of Cxcr4a), or inhibiting <italic>β</italic>-catenin function (in the case of dorso-ventral patterning mediated by Ccl19). Therefore, in cases where the required signal does not provide spatial information, the activation of the receptor by paracrine or autocrine mechanism can both rescue the loss of function phenotype. We now include those considerations in the text in the paragraph starting with “To further investigate if the signals the two receptors […]”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) How reliable was the rescue at different concentrations?</p></disp-quote><p>The fact the processes we examine are not extremely sensitive to the overall levels of the receptors or ligands can first be appreciated by the fact that the corresponding mutations (e.g. in <italic>cxcl12a, cxcl12b, cxcr4a</italic> and <italic>cxcr4b</italic> genes) are recessive. In addition, as exemplified by germ cells migrating towards a chemokine source, the same response can be observed over a large range of ligand concentrations as the PGCs get closer to the cells expressing the ligand (e.g. in the wild-type situation). Consistently, altering the level of the Cxcr4b and Cxcl12a by alleviating the miRNA regulation results in an extremely weak PGC migration phenotype (1 out of 30 cells located ectopically (Staton et al., 2011), or no phenotype at all (Goudarzi et al., 2013).</p><p>In this work we typically tried 1-3 different concentrations of ligand/receptors and used the one that provided the most consistent results.</p><p>To demonstrate the robustness of the rescue, we expressed different concentrations of Ccr9 and observed effective response to its ligand in embryos injected with a range of RNA amounts. We expressed different amounts of Ccr9 in germ cells and observed effective migration of the cells towards parts of the embryo expressing the cognate ligand. This experiment is now presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. As can be observed in this figure, at very low concentrations of the receptor the rescue is not as reliable. This point is mentioned in the first paragraph of the Discussion (see - “Consistently, the cell-specific biological response […]”). Together with the experience from setting up the different experiments, we conclude that within a broad range, the level of the expressed receptor and ligand result in a similar biological effect. This could result from robustness of the interpretation module to changes in signal level, or from mechanisms controlling the signal level (e.g.(Minina et al., 2007)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another point to be discussed/clarified, is the phenotype in the ccr7 mutant. It seems to be much weaker than the previously published morphant. Is that correct? If so, it would seem worthwhile to mention/discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>Whereas <italic>ccr7</italic> morpholino causes strong dorsalization manifest in elongated embryo shapes at late gastrulation (Wu et al., 2012), neither zygotic <italic>ccr7</italic> nor maternal zygotic (MZ) <italic>ccr7</italic> mutants described here displayed similar morphologic defects and grew into fertile adults. qRT-analyses revealed downregulation of <italic>ccr7</italic> transcripts in MZ<italic>ccr7</italic> mutants consistent with a strong loss of function. As described in the results, MZ<italic>ccr7</italic> exhibit increased sensitivity to β-catenin induced dorsalization (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), consistent with Ccr7 acting as a negative but unessential regulator of β-catenin. To explore the inconsistency between the <italic>ccr7</italic> morphant and mutant phenotypes, we considered off-target effect of the <italic>ccr7</italic>-MO1 and genetic compensation as possible mechanisms (Rossi et al., 2015). Inconsistent with a genetic compensation operating in <italic>ccr7</italic> mutants, upon injection of <italic>ccr7</italic>-MO1, MZ<italic>ccr7</italic> mutants showed strong dorsalization phenotype comparable to that observed in wild-type embryos injected with the same morpholino dose. This result suggests that the morphant phenotype may be due to off-target effects on genes that encode negative regulators of β-catenin and are thus functionally redundant with <italic>ccr7</italic>. This would explain that MZ<italic>ccr7</italic> mutants appear phenotypically normal, but they are sensitive to the level of β-catenin. Intriguingly, at least 12 chemokine GPCRs are expressed at the early cleavage stages of zebrafish embryo (Jimann Shin and LSK, unpublished observations), and findings in this manuscript indicate that Ccr7’s effect on β-catenin and the extent of dorsalization can be directed by other chemokine receptors from different families. In addition, <italic>ccr7</italic>-MO1 modulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (Wu et al., 2012), making genes encoding other GPCRs likely targets of this morpholino. However, <italic>ccr7</italic>-MO1 targeting other negative regulators of <italic>β</italic> -catenin cannot be excluded at the moment. We are systematically mutating all chemokine GPCRs in zebrafish to distinguish between these possibilities (Jimann Shin and LSK, unpublished).</p><p>We present this information in the paragraph starting with “Since the biological contexts studied above […]”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Finally, the omission of a third GPCR system (Apelin/Apela) that is also active in the early embryo deserves a comment. Would the model also hold true for this system? And does ectopic expression of the CXCR4 or CCR7 systems interfere with the Apelin/Apela system, as predicted by the model? The reviewers feel this should at least be discussed, if it cannot be addressed experimentally with reasonable efforts for a revision.</p></disp-quote><p>The main finding of the manuscript is that GPCRs of the chemokine family elicit an equivalent signaling cascade that is differentially interpreted by different cell types. The extent to which this finding applies to other GPCR families is an interesting question, which we touched upon by examining the LPA/S1P receptor. In these experiments we could show that the “universal signal” hypothesis can in principle be extended beyond the chemokine family. In response to this question we attempted to rescue the endoderm ingression phenotype resulting from the mutation in the <italic>apela</italic> locus. In these experiments we could not reverse the <italic>apela</italic> phenotype suggesting a qualitative difference between chemokine receptor signaling and the signal produced by the Apela receptor, or signifying a requirement for tight control over the dynamics of receptor activation. We now mention this point in the paragraph starting with “While based on our results chemokine receptors elicit qualitatively similar signals […]” and made sure that it is clear from the text (as stated in the title of the paper), that the main statement relates to the chemokine receptor family of GPCRs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
