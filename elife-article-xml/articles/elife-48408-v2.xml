Distinct in vitro biophysical features of DA neurons have been associated with different axonal projection targets. However, it is unknown how this translates to different firing patterns of projection-defined DA subpopulations in the intact brain. We combined retrograde tracing with single-unit recording and labelling in mouse brain to create an in vivo functional topography of the midbrain DA system. We identified differences in burst firing among DA neurons projecting to dorsolateral striatum. Bursting also differentiated DA neurons in the medial substantia nigra (SN) projecting either to dorsal or ventral striatum. We found differences in mean firing rates and pause durations among ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neurons projecting to lateral or medial shell of nucleus accumbens. Our data establishes a high-resolution functional in vivo landscape of midbrain DA neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>axon</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>action potential</kwd><kwd>burst</kwd><kwd>pause</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA041705</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roeper</surname><given-names>Jochen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC 1080</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roeper</surname><given-names>Jochen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004812</institution-id><institution>Gutenberg Forschungskolleg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roeper</surname><given-names>Jochen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC 1193</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roeper</surname><given-names>Jochen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFG Priority Program 1665 (SCHN 1370/02-1)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schneider</surname><given-names>Gaby</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Midbrain dopamine neurons function according to their axonal projections in the intact brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The functional properties and the emerging diversity of the midbrain dopamine (DA) system have been extensively studied across many different biological scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schultz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2017</xref>).

Moreover, additional methods complementing classical single unit recordings, including voltammetric and fluorometric measurements of DA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dreyer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hamid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Howe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kishida et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lippert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Patriarchi et al., 2018</xref>) and in vivo calcium imaging of DA axons in distinct striatal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>) further support the notion of a multi-layered diversity of the DA system <italic>at work</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berke, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Rather than a single global computation, the midbrain DA system has therefore emerged as a parallel processor carrying out multiple functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haber, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kegeles et al., 2010</xref>). Support for this concept that distinct DA neuron subtypes carry out different computational processes arose from the mapping of their in vitro cellular properties in combination with retrograde tracing. This showed that projection-identified groups of DA neurons, including those that project to specific subregions of the striatum, have marked differences in intrinsic biophysical properties and input-output relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lammel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tarfa et al., 2017</xref>). However, this idea is somewhat challenged by virally-mediated single DA neuron labelling studies that depicted the extensive arborisation of individual axons often across distinct striatal territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aransay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matsuda et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Distinct DA subpopulations are also differentially affected by pathological processes driving major brain disorders such as Parkinson disease (PD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Obeso et al., 2017</xref>), schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCutcheon et al., 2019</xref>) or drug abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lüscher, 2016</xref>). In PD, a ventrolateral SN DA population is most severely affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Damier et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gibb and Lees, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kordower et al., 2013</xref>), which might be indicative for an innate and/or acquired differential vulnerability towards alpha-synuclein aggregation-mediated neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Surmeier et al., 2017</xref>). In schizophrenia, PET-studies in patients strongly suggested an early and selective dysregulation of a DA subpopulation projecting to associative, dorsomedial striatal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kegeles et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCutcheon et al., 2019</xref>), but cellular substrates have remained elusive. In models of drug addiction, a hierarchical sequence of DA release in different striatal territories has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Willuhn et al., 2012</xref>). In depression models, based on chronic social defeat, selective hyperactivity in mesolimbic-projecting DA subpopulations has been identified as a causal factor in depression-like behaviors using projection-selective optogenetic interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaudhury et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tye et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, there is increasing evidence that the classic triadic decomposition of the midbrain DA system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Björklund and Dunnett, 2007</xref>) into a dorsal mesostriatal, ventral mesolimbic, and cortical prefrontal arm might not be sufficiently granular to capture the functional and pathophysiological diversity of DA neurons. For example, the characteristic high-frequency ‘burst’ discharge of midbrain DA neurons in vivo is most commonly associated with positive reward prediction error signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eshel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schultz, 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stauffer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Steinberg et al., 2013</xref>), but there is increasing evidence that – depending on the DA subtype – burst discharge plays also a role for other functions, including action control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">da Silva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jin and Costa, 2010</xref>) and the signaling of salience, novelty, anticipated fear or non-reward prediction errors, even in cells located in the same anatomical region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Menegas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schiemann et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, the rapidly progressing dissection of DA controlled neuronal circuits using optogenetic and molecular tracing methods suggests this diversity in behavioral functions is matched to specific anatomical substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lammel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lerner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Menegas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ogawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In order to help closing the current resolution gap between anatomy and physiology, it is therefore crucial to study the functional properties of DA neurons with identified axonal projections in the intact brain to better understand how intrinsic cellular differences and network affiliations jointly compute functional output. Accordingly, we carried out a systematic comparison of baseline in vivo electrical properties of anatomically and immunohistochemically verified midbrain DA neurons with identified axonal projections. Given our previous finding that even the innocuous labelling of DA neurons with GFP can affect their in vivo properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schiemann et al., 2012</xref>), we also aimed to carefully establish and control an experimental protocol for retrograde tracing that enabled us to register genuine differences of in vivo activity among DA neurons.</p><p>With this approach, we found a number of surprising results. First, we identified an unanticipated functional diversity among SN DA neurons, even among those sharing the same projections, targeting the dorsolateral striatum. However, this diversity followed a clear medial-to-lateral topography. Moreover, DA neurons with distinct axonal projections but overlapping distributions in the midbrain displayed different electrical properties regarding bursting, pausing, and even baseline mean frequencies. Only some of these identified in vivo differences were predicted based on previous studies of diverging intrinsic in vitro properties between distinct DA subpopulations (e.g. rebound delays and pausing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lammel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tarfa et al., 2017</xref>), while other features, like differences in mean firing rates were surprising and indicated that certain neuronal network properties might override intrinsic differences in excitability. Overall, our study provides a refined functional in vivo landscape of the midbrain DA system embedded in an anatomical context of identified axonal projections.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Retrograde tracing with highly-diluted (0.002%) fluorogold preserves in vivo electrophysiological properties of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons</title><p>Our aim was to characterize the electrophysiological in vivo properties of midbrain DA neurons with defined axonal projections in adult male C57Bl/6N mice.

With this strategy, we identified 0.002% FG (FG-3) to be the lowest concentration where a significant proportion (ca. 20–30%) of SN DA neurons displayed detectable tracer levels based on intrinsic FG fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, FG-3, column four; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, signal to noise 3:1). This rate of detection was further improved by using a FG-antibody (see Materials and methods) combined with a fluorescently-labelled secondary antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The FG-antibody generated very low background in the ventral midbrain (contralateral side) resulting in an improved signal-to-noise ratio (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; Signal to noise 10:1).

All in vivo recorded neurons reported in this study were juxtacellularly labelled with neurobiotin to define their neurochemical nature (i.e. tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunopositive = dopaminergic) and cellular position in the midbrain with the identification of their respective axonal projection targets, indicated by the FG signal in the labelled neuron. For a sensitive comparison between FG-3-labelled and control DA neurons, we focused on those in the lateral substantia nigra (lSN), given that they are the most vulnerable to cellular damage among midbrain DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Surmeier et al., 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> compares the spontaneous in vivo activity of a DA lSN neuron in a control animal (panels B1-B4) with one from a FG-3-labelled DA lSN neuron of a traced mouse (panels C1-C4).

These tracing results implied that just obtaining precise information on the cellular localization (SOURCE) of recorded DA neurons via juxtacellular labelling, in particular in the mSN, would be insufficient to capture the in vivo functional diversity of the DA system.</p><p>We then asked whether DA neurons from the same midbrain area (SOURCE) but with distinct axonal projections (TARGETS) displayed different in vivo electrophysiological properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E2</xref> – shared SOURCE and distinct TARGETS).

This enabled us to meaningfully compare the in vivo physiological properties of largely parallel, non-overlapping DA projections. These recordings were carried out under well-controlled isoflurane anesthesia, which was continuously titrated to result in a spontaneous breathing rate between 1–2 Hz. This approach was very stable across animals (&gt;70% of animals, the isoflurane concentration was 1.2% in 100% O2, flow rate 350 ml/min) and the small variations in isoflurane concentrations in the range between 1–2% did not correlate with differences in firing frequencies or patterns in any of the studied DA projections (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A–C</xref>). Moreover, during anesthesia, under the conditions stated above, oscillatory cortical activity, observed under lighter isoflurane anesthesia, was largely suppressed (see see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4G and H</xref>). In addition, we found that firing frequencies and patterns of mSN/VTA were comparable to those in corresponding DA neurons recorded previously in freely moving, awake mice in the homecage (for detailed comparison, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4D–F</xref>).

The original 10 s sample recording traces, the 30 s raster plots and the two ISI histograms indicate that the depicted DLS-lSN DA neuron discharged in a highly bursty pattern, which was completely absent in the regularly discharging DLS-mSN DA neuron. Importantly, while about 40% of DLS-projecting DA neurons in the lSN (n = 6 of 15) displayed this type of robust bursting (SFB &gt;5%) throughout the recording period, none of the identified DLS-projecting DA neurons located in the mSN (n = 0 of 9) fired in this bursty manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Comparison of the cumulative probability distributions of burstiness (percentage of spikes fired in bursts; SFB%) between the two DLS-projecting SN DA populations confirmed their differences in firing pattern. In contrast, detailed analysis of other electrophysiological parameters between the two DLS-projecting SN DA neurons detected no further differences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then identified the best subset of electrophysiological parameters in a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) using half of the data from the two DLS-projecting SN DA populations. Using the variables burstiness (SFB), relative AP trough and precision of spiking (log(σ<sub>2</sub>)), we could accurately classify the remaining DLS-projecting SN DA neurons into a lateral and medial group with a predictive power of 79.2% (p&lt;0.05). When using the entire data set to train the linear classifier, almost all (92.6%) of DLS-projecting SN DA neurons were classified correctly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In summary, our data demonstrated that SN DA neurons projecting to the DLS possess distinct bursting properties in vivo depending on where they are located within the SN.

We provide the first detailed description and anatomical mapping of axon projection-specific functional DA phenotypes in vivo. Importantly, all n = 102 DA neurons in this study were labelled and immunohistochemically identified, thus avoiding the uncertainties of ‘putative’ DA populations. Moreover, our study controlled for functional perturbations by retrograde labelling itself, based on our high-dilution fluorogold protocol. In comparison to our previous work characterizing the in vitro properties of DA neurons with distinct axonal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lammel et al., 2008</xref>), we found a number of unexpected results in vivo. We did not anticipate the large degree of functional diversity regarding burst firing among those SN DA neurons projecting to dorsolateral striatum. Furthermore, we were surprised to find in vivo bursting of DA neurons in the medial SN to be exclusively associated with cells projecting to lateral shell of nucleus accumbens. Finally, the difference in mean firing rates between slower-discharging DA neurons projecting to medial shell and faster-firing DA neurons projecting to lateral shell of nucleus accumbens was unexpected given their respective intrinsic excitabilities. Overall, our findings provide a refined functional definition of distinct DA projections in the intact brain.</p><p>Our study has a number of limitations. Importantly, all in vivo electrophysiological data were recorded under isoflurane anesthesia. Therefore, we cannot directly draw conclusions about behaviorally relevant activity patterns in DA subpopulations but rather identify differences in in vivo baseline excitability. We have previously shown that some of these differences are associated with altered behaviour, as in the case of burst firing in the medial SN and novelty-induced locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schiemann et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, we also showed that differences in in vivo firing rates between VTA DA neurons identified under isoflurane anesthesia in a mouse model of cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krabbe et al., 2015</xref>), were recapitulated in awake behaving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duvarci et al., 2018</xref>). However, the task-related differences in firing were only revealed in awake behaving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duvarci et al., 2018</xref>). A second limitation is that we tried but did not succeed in getting more than an anecdotal data set of medial prefrontal projecting DA neurons. The unique mismatch between the extent of retrograde labelling and the difficulty of identifying and recording mesocortical DA neurons in vivo indicated that this DA subpopulation might either be particularly vulnerable to our labelling protocol or mostly silent under isoflurane anesthesia. The latter possibility is not unlikely given the evidence for orexinergic modulation of mesocortical DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Del Cid-Pellitero and Garzón, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, our study focused on rostral striatal areas not covering the caudal ‘tail’ region, which is a projection area of DA neurons located in the SN pars lateralis. This DA projection has been shown to be involved in the computing of aversive stimuli and stable visual memories in rodents and non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Menegas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Menegas et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our study has a number of specific implications for future work. Given that labelling of DA subpopulations – for identification and/or optogenetic manipulation – has become an essential tool, we believe it is crucial to control whether the labelling itself will change functional properties of the targeted neurons in vivo. In addition to the effect of conventional concentrations of fluorogold, we have previously shown that virally-mediated GFP-expression in SN DA neurons leads to robust changes in their intrinsic firing pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schiemann et al., 2012</xref>). We currently do not know how general these perturbations of in vivo activity of DA neurons are, regarding the type of label, its concentration and post-injection timing.</p><p>Another notable result of our study is the large difference in burstiness between dorsolateral striatum projecting DA neurons in the medial compared to the lateral SN. While the underlying mechanisms need to be resolved, our findings are in line with a previous study from the Khaliq lab that found differences in in vitro excitability, including T-type calcium channel mediated rebound excitability, between calbindin-positive and calbindin-negative SN DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Evans et al., 2017</xref>). Also, Lerner and colleagues demonstrated larger HCN-currents in DLS-projecting SN DA neurons compared to DMS-projecting SN DA neurons, which might further enhance rebound excitability and possibly in vivo bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lerner et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to the functional implications for nigrostriatal signaling, the enhanced burst excitability might also be of pathophysiological relevance. An influential hypothesis regarding the differential vulnerability between distinct DA subpopulations in Parkinson disease proposes that different degrees of activity-dependent calcium loading might play a crucial role for selective neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Surmeier et al., 2017</xref>). Given that the lateral SN is the most vulnerable DA region in PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Damier et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gibb and Lees, 1991</xref>), we believe that the high in vivo burstiness of lateral SN DA neurons might be an attractive new target for protective intervention.</p><p>In contrast, we were surprised to find that mSN DA neurons projecting to dorsal striatum virtually showed no in vivo burst firing. This implies that K-ATP channel dependent burst mechanisms, which we previously identified to be selective for the medial SN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schiemann et al., 2012</xref>), might be operative in lateral shell-projecting rather than dorsal striatum-projecting DA neurons in this region. The mechanism for this region-specific absence of bursting are currently unknown but might be highly relevant given that selective dysregulation in DA projections to dorsomedial striatum has been associated with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kegeles et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCutcheon et al., 2019</xref>). While cue- and reward-triggered burst discharge has been well characterized, the function of on-going burst ‘states’ is less clear in the DA system. However, we and others have recently shown that DA neurons become phase-locked to prefrontal 4 Hz rhythms during working memory tasks, which might also result in rhythmic bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duvarci et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fujisawa and Buzsáki, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our study gives further support to the idea that mesolimbic DA neurons projecting to medial versus lateral shell of accumbens constitute two parallel pathways. Recent studies highlighted the differential functional roles of these DA projections, as well as their distinct circuit affiliations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Jong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lammel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Our firing frequency data suggest that these two DA projections operate at different baseline excitation/inhibition (E/I) setpoints in vivo. In particular, medial shell projecting DA neurons, which displayed high intrinsic excitability associated with sustained high frequency firing in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lammel et al., 2008</xref>), discharged in vivo at a lower rate, which might be indicative for a higher degree of tonic net inhibition. Based on the systematic firing differences between these two mesolimbic DA subpopulations, that intermingle mainly within the VTA, it will crucial for future work in awake animals to disentangle them.</p><p>In summary, we have provided a refined source-target functional in vivo topography of midbrain DA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), which we believe will facilitate our understanding of dopamine neuron diversity in health and disease.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48408.030</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Midbrain dopamine neurons with distinct source-target topographies display functional in vivo firing differences.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the organization of distinct midbrain DA subtypes defined by their source-target topography. Single midbrain source areas and striatal target areas are colored individually (midbrain: lSN red, mSN yellow, PBP brown, PN light green; striatum: DLS green, DMS cyan, lNAcc magenta, mNAcc orange).

In a multidimensional data set with two or more specified groups, the LDA finds the direction that optimally separates the groups. In order to identify the set of variables contributing to this discrimination, we used the following cross validation technique: For every possible subset S<sub>j</sub> of the set of all variables (i.e., the four GLO parameters, the mean spike frequency, the CV, the SFB, the skewness and kurtosis of the interspike intervals, the burst rate, the number of estimated pauses, the AP duration and the relative AP through), we performed the following analysis: we used 1000 random divisions of the data in two equally sized groups A and B. For every division, we performed LDA on A and predicted the group affiliations of B, and vice versa. The mean percentage of correct predictions in A and B, averaged across all 1000 random divisions, is called the predictive power of the model with variable set S<sub>j</sub> and denoted by M<sub>j</sub>. The maximal predictive power is then given by max<sub>j</sub> M<sub>j</sub> and the corresponding subset S<sub>j</sub> is called the best subset.</p><p>In order to investigate statistical significance of the maximal predictive power, we used a permutation test, performing the same analysis with 1000 randomly permuted data sets, in which the two groups were assigned randomly. Statistical significance was then assessed by deriving the percentage of these analyses of permuted data sets – as specified in the results – which yielded a maximal predictive power as large as or larger than the observed. In case of statistical significance, we also give the percentage of correct categorizations for the respective subset S<sub>j</sub> when performing LDA on the whole data set.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by research grants to JR (NIH Grant R01DA041705, DFG CRC 1080, CRC 1193 and a Fellowship by the Gutenberg Research College, University Mainz) and to GS by the DFG Priority Program 1665 (SCHN 1370/02–1).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor.

Previous literature indicates that these DA neurons form significantly smaller axonal arbors (Aransay et al., 2015). Furthermore, these authors and others have distinguished DA cells projecting to medial and lateral NAc shell (de Jong et al., 2019).

This provides a connection between what is already known about differences in in vitro features with in vivo activity according to projection target. A major accomplishment of this study was to retrogradely label the recorded neurons without affecting their in vivo firing activity. This was accomplished by using a 10-fold lower concentration of fluorogold that the authors convincingly demonstrate does not affect the in vivo firing activity of the dopamine neuron. Of interest is also the use of the Linear Discriminate Analysis, which provides for predictive power of the firing activity to predict projection target.</p><p>Only one moderate concern should be addressed.

This kind of work is labour intensive and technically challenging for multiple reasons: 1/ all the DA neurons included in this work were neurochemically identified through in vivo juxtacellular labelling combined with post-hoc immuno-detection for the tyrosine hydroxylase; 2/ the authors further identify subclasses of dopaminergic neurons based on their site of projection through the retrograde transport of fluorogold. The results are interesting and provide additional evidence that dopaminergic neurons are functionally diverse. That being said, the electrophysiological differences described by the authors between distinct target-projecting DA neurons are subtle (i.e. minor change in firing rate or bursting) and not always present (no differences between DLS vs. DMS projecting DA neurons in medial SN). Overall, the manuscript is sound and the work of good-quality; the only downside being that the results highlight only minor (or in some cases even no differences) between DA neurons with distinct axonal projections.</p><p>1) Within one 'source' (i.e. the medial SN), the authors identify distinct 'targets' DA projecting neurons (i.e. projecting to the DMS, the DLS, or the NAcc). This is achieved using a fluorogold retrograde approach but only one target can be tested at any time. This projection-based classification is then used as a criterion for electrophysiological comparison between distinct DA neurons subclasses but this approach does not allow to identify neurons with multiple projection site, for example: DMS and DLS. This has important consequences since the authors might be comparing 'presumably' distinct population of DA neurons that in fact belong to the same cluster of neurons. It seems important here to better characterize whether or not DA neurons have multiple projection targets.</p><p>2) Another consequence of this 'single' target retrograde strategy is that the electrical activity of subclasses of DA neurons are recorded in different subject, yet compared as if they were recorded from the same animal in similar condition. Unfortunately, the level of isoflurane anaesthesia can vary a lot from one animal to another, which mean that the cortical activity will change from animal to another and this will impact onto the firing properties of DA neurons (both on the level of bursting and firing rate). Considering this important aspect and the fact that the authors did not record the cortical activity, how confident can we be that the different electrical properties of DA neurons recorded in different mice are not artificially caused by extrinsic factors such as brain state, or variability across animals? It seems important to clarify this point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Farassat et al. presents a comprehensive analysis of midbrain dopamine neuron functional diversity performed in the in vivo mouse preparation. The authors combine retrograde fluorogold labeling with juxtacellular recordings to compare firing patterns in dopamine neuron subpopulations categorized according to their major projection patterns. Comparing dopamine neurons within and between midbrain regions (i.e. medial vs. lateral SNc DA neurons), they find that burst firing cells are present in all SNc (lateral and medial) and VTA subregions examined. Interestingly, however, dorsal striatum projecting cells located in the medial substantia nigra do not burst. Additionally, medial NAc projecting cells fire tonically at lower rates than lateral NAc projecting neurons. Overall, these data further support the idea that dopamine neurons are diverse in their firing patterns and presumably in their function.</p><p>This is a well-executed study. The data are of high quality and the presentation is clear. The authors should be commended for performing and including their careful control experiments testing the effects of different concentrations of fluorogold on electrophysiological properties. In addition, the anatomical identification of cells and description of source and targets is valuable and important. Unlike the authors' past heterogeneity study in brain slices (Lammel et al., 2008), the firing patterns reported in this study likely result from a mixture of intrinsic properties as well as activity of the surrounding circuit. This is important because the recordings here were all made in anaesthetized mice which may complicate the interpretation of the data. Despite this caveat, however, I believe that this study is an important step in our understanding of diversity among dopamine neuron subpopulations in the intact brain.</p><p>1) Burst firing in dopamine neurons is typically associated with a stimulus (e.g. unexpected reward, aversive stimulus, etc.). Here, however, the authors report burst firing (both periodic and irregular) that seems to be ongoing. How do the authors interpret this activity? It would be helpful to discuss instances where this type of activity has been reported in studies of dopamine neurons recorded in awake behaving animals or to provide ideas/predictions involving circuit properties that may contribute to this spiking behavior (intrinsic properties contribute, but SNc neurons do not typically burst in the absence of synaptic input).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48408.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Dopamine neurons have widespread axonal projection (see Matsuda et al., 2009) that can cover extremely large striatal area (both medial and lateral).

In the context of this study, it was important to define the percentage of DA neurons that innervated two neighboring striatal sufficiently to result in double labelling. To test for the potential overlap of distinct projection-defined subtypes in their projection site, we carried out double tracing experiments with fluorogold (FG) and red beads (RB). We focused on three pairs of neighboring striatal projection sites – 1) lNAcc and mNAcc, 2) lNAcc and DLS, 3) DLS and DMS (N=3 for each pair). Animals were sacrificed one week after double infusions. After performing immunohistochemistry with TH and FG antibodies, 20x z-stack confocal images were taken. Counting of single- and double-labelled DA neurons was performed in the relevant midbrain region of highest potential overlap (VTA for lNAcc/mNAcc, mSN for lNAcc/DLS, and DLS/DMS) across the caudo-rostral extent of the midbrain (caudal: -3,64mm; intermediate: -3.28mm; rostral section: -3.08mm).</p><p>In essence, our results demonstrated that most (85-95%) DA SN neurons were single-labelled indicating that they predominantly projected to single striatal territories with only a minor proportion of doubled labelled DA neurons. Given our analysis of more than 2500 DA neurons, this result is likely to be representative (for mouse). Given this large degree of segregation between parallel DA projections, our approach to systematically compare their in vivo electrophysiology is validated (for details please consult new Figure 5).</p><p>Figure 5A displays the respective injection sites. Panel B shows the distribution of double-labelled and single-labelled DA neurons. Less than 5% of DA neurons (52 of 1167 DA neurons) counted in the VTA are double-labelled for mNAcc (FG) and lNAcc (RB) while 11,2% of DA neurons (45 of 402 DA neurons) in the m-SN are double-labelled for lNAcc (FG) and DLS (RB) and 14% of DA neurons (120 of 859 DA neurons) in the m-SN are double-labelled for DMS (FG) and DLS (RB).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Comparing in vivo firing activity of neurons requires the careful control of cortical brain state activity.

It would clarify a key concern and be a great addition to the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that more information on the stability of isoflurane anesthesia and its effects on cortical states is an important addition. Here, we wish to address two related but distinct aspects. First, how does DA in vivo firing under isoflurane compare to firing in awake, freely moving animals? This is important because – apart from the obvious absence of task-related activity – DA neurons under isoflurane might either lack important aspects of their awake firing properties and/or display additional features never observed in awake behaving animals. In particular, the latter case could lead to serious misinterpretations, also in the context of this study. Second, how stable – and thus comparable – is the isoflurane anesthesia across animals? In addition, how sensitive are firing patterns of identified DA subpopulations to variations of isoflurane anesthesia.</p><p>Comparison Isoflurane - awake</p><p>We provide comparative data between the basic electrophysiological in vivo properties of immunohistochemically and projection-specifically identified DA neurons in mSN/VTA of this study – performed under isoflurane anesthesia – and pharmacologically identified mSN/VTA DA neuron in awake, freely moving animals (home cage activity) taken from our recent study (Duvarci et al., 2018). Regarding the overall ranges of mean firing frequencies as well as burst firing, mSN/VTA DA neurons recorded under isoflurane anesthesia and those during awake home cage activity are similar (see Figure 4—figure supplement 4D and E). However, electrical in vivoactivity in the awake state was consistently more irregular (i.e. larger CV) compared to isoflurane anesthesia, both driven by higher burst frequencies and longer pauses. Compared to awake, this data set indicated a compression of the dynamic range of DA firing under isoflurane. For our study, this implies that DA neuron firing is not less but more stable under isoflurane and that it might be more difficult to identify significant differences between distinct DA projections regarding bursting and pauses.</p><p>Stability of isoflurane anesthesia and cortical states</p><p>As in previous in vivo studies using anesthesia (e.g. Schiemann et al., 2012), we continuously adjusted the concentration of isoflurane during anesthesia to result in a targeted spontaneous respiratory rate between 1-2 Hz (when animals were also non-responsive to painful stimuli, a legal requirement for intraoperative anesthesia). This approach was remarkably stable across animals and resulted in the fact that 72% (67/94) of in vivo recorded DA neurons in this study were recorded exactly at 1.2% isoflurane (at 350ml/min 100% O<sub>2</sub>) and all neurons were recorded in the range between 1-2% isoflurane. Figure 4—figure supplement 4 plots firing frequencies, SFBs and CVs of all DA neurons reported in this study against the exact isoflurane concentration during their recording. As we did not find any significant correlations between any of the firing properties and the isoflurane concentration for any of the DA projection, we can essentially rule out any relevant effect of “anesthesia instability” on our data set. Finally, the well-controlled level of anesthesia- continuously monitored and adjust to the target breathing rate was consistently associated with an electrically silent cortex, in contrast to lower isoflurane concentrations, where animals breathed faster (&gt; 2 Hz), showed withdrawal reflexes upon painful stimulation and displayed oscillatory cortical LFP activity (see Figure 4—figure supplement 4G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would be more helpful to evaluate the injection sites if given a sense of the variability in injection spread and location for each target site. An atlas collecting all injection spreads and locations will increase confidence in the injection target regions being separate and would be a great resource to researchers in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the mapping of striatal injection sites of the retrograde trace is beneficial. This information is now given in Figure 4—figure supplement 3 and demonstrates the high precision and low variability of our approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) While burst firing in dopamine neurons is typically associated with a stimulus, the current data report &quot;ongoing&quot; burst firing (both periodic and irregular). How do the authors interpret this activity?

However, recent evidence from Fujisawa and Buszaki, 2011, and our lab demonstrated task-related rhythmic entrainment of DA neuronal firing to long-range cortical 4 Hz oscillations (Duvarci et al., 2018). Furthermore, we showed that reduced phase-looking of DA neurons during a working memory task was associated with cognitive impairment. This – yet sparse – evidence points to additional functional roles and related firing pattern of DA neurons outside the canonical reward-prediction error framework. These aspects are now included in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Only one moderate concern should be addressed. It would be more helpful to evaluate the injection sites if given a sense of the variability in injection spread and location for each target site. An atlas collecting all injection spreads and locations will increase confidence in the injection target regions being separate.</p></disp-quote><p>See essential revision 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) Within one 'source' (i.e. the medial SN), the authors identify distinct 'targets' DA projecting neurons (i.e. projecting to the DMS, the DLS, or the NAcc). This is achieved using a fluorogold retrograde approach but only one target can be tested at any time. This projection-based classification is then used as a criterion for electrophysiological comparison between distinct DA neurons subclasses but this approach does not allow to identify neurons with multiple projection site, for example: DMS and DLS. This has important consequences since the authors might be comparing 'presumably' distinct population of DA neurons that in fact belong to the same cluster of neurons. It seems important here to better characterize whether or not DA neurons have multiple projection targets.</p></disp-quote><p>See essential revision 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another consequence of this 'single' target retrograde strategy is that the electrical activity of subclasses of DA neurons are recorded in different subject, yet compared as if they were recorded from the same animal in similar condition. Unfortunately, the level of isoflurane anaesthesia can vary a lot from one animal to another, which mean that the cortical activity will change from animal to another and this will impact onto the firing properties of DA neurons (both on the level of bursting and firing rate). Considering this important aspect and the fact that the authors did not record the cortical activity, how confident can we be that the different electrical properties of DA neurons recorded in different mice are not artificially caused by extrinsic factors such as brain state, or variability across animals? It seems important to clarify this point.</p></disp-quote><p>See essential revision 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) Burst firing in dopamine neurons is typically associated with a stimulus (e.g. unexpected reward, aversive stimulus, etc.).
