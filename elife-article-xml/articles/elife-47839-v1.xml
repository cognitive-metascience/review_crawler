protein homo-oligomer that binds a symmetry-matched small molecule larger than a metal ion has not yet been achieved. We used de novo protein design to create a homo-trimeric protein that binds the C<sub>3</sub> symmetric small molecule drug amantadine with each protein monomer making identical interactions with each face of the small molecule. Solution NMR data show that the protein has regular three-fold symmetry and undergoes localized structural changes upon ligand binding. A high-resolution X-ray structure reveals a close overall match to the design model with the exception of water molecules in the amantadine binding site not included in the Rosetta design calculations, and a neutron structure provides experimental validation of the computationally designed hydrogen-bond networks. Exploration of approaches to generate a small molecule inducible homo-trimerization system based on the design highlight challenges that must be overcome to computationally design such systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>de novo protein design</kwd><kwd>symmetry</kwd><kwd>amantadine</kwd><kwd>Rosetta</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001906</institution-id><institution>Washington Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Innovation Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Jooyoung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35GM125034-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McShan</surname><given-names>Andrew C</given-names></name><name><surname>Sgourakis</surname><given-names>Nikolaos G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Award at the Scientific Interface</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boyken</surname><given-names>Scott E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first successful de novo design of a homo-trimeric protein that binds a C3 symmetric small molecule larger than a metal ion is an advance for computational protein design.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>While there has been progress in the de novo design of small molecule binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tinberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ollikainen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mills et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Polizzi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dou et al., 2018</xref>), there are still considerable challenges in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dou et al., 2017</xref>). There has also been progress in designing protein structures with internal symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyken et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghirlanda et al., 2004</xref>). We focus in this paper on the challenge of designing symmetric protein homo-oligomers that bind to symmetry matched small molecules such that each protein monomer makes identical interactions with the small molecule. From the protein design standpoint, this challenge is interesting as it enables more economical design strategies in which one protein-small molecule interface is utilized multiple times, analogous to the use of a single designed protein-protein interface in self-assembling protein nanostructures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bale et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hsia et al., 2016</xref>). From the applications standpoint, the challenge has considerable importance because it provides a stepping stone to ligand induced homo-oligomerization systems, which are increasingly in demand in cellular engineering applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fegan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeRose et al., 2013</xref>). Chemically-inducible dimerization systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Spencer et al., 1996</xref>) have been utilized to modulate signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Spencer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mallet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guerrero et al., 2008</xref>), transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nyanguile et al., 1997</xref>), and post-translational modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Stankunas et al., 2003</xref>), and as components for logic gates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miyamoto et al., 2012</xref>). However, to our knowledge, no chemically-inducible trimerization systems have been developed despite the importance of trimerization in pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Spencer et al., 1996</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Computational design strategy for ABP</title><p>We set out to design trimeric proteins that bind small molecules with three-fold symmetry on their symmetry axes. We focused on the C<sub>3</sub> symmetric compound amantadine as it is an FDA approved drug (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/016023s041,018101s016lbl.pdf">https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/016023s041,018101s016lbl.pdf</ext-link>) with a low side effect profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Perez-Lloret and Rascol, 2018</xref>). To de novo design amantadine-binding sites at the protein trimer C<sub>3</sub> axes, we started from parametrically generated C<sub>3</sub> symmetric helical bundle backbones consisting of two concentric rings each with three helices. The symmetry axes of the protein scaffold and the amantadine were aligned, and the remaining two degrees of freedom (the placement along the symmetry axis, and the rotation around this axis) were sampled by grid search (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). For each placement, RosettaDesign was used to optimize the identities and conformations of the residues within 12.5 Å of the amantadine for high affinity binding, and residue conformations at distances farther than 12.5 Å to retain hydrogen-bond networks identified by Rosetta HBNet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–c</xref>). The search was restricted to symmetric solutions in which each monomer is identical in sequence and structure. We found a particularly low energy solution starting from a previously characterized design with a high-resolution crystal structure (2L6HC3_13) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyken et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and d</xref>). This solution, which we refer to as ABP (<bold>a</bold>mantadine-<bold>b</bold>inding <bold>p</bold>rotein), contains 19 amino acid changes compared to 2L6HC3_13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The interactions critical for amantadine binding include hydrogen bonds from Ser-71 to the polar amino group of amantadine and a shape complementary binding pocket composed by Ile-64, Leu-67, and Ala-68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Computational design methodology.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The homo-trimeric scaffold was designed to bind amantadine such that the C<sub>3</sub> axes of the protein and the small molecule are aligned.

(<bold>b</bold>) The binding pocket in ABP was designed to have polar serine residues (Ser-71) that hydrogen-bond (yellow dashed lines) to the amino group of amantadine and nonpolar residues (Ile-64, Leu-67, and Ala-68) to complement the shape of the hydrophobic moiety of amantadine.

The design was expressed at high levels in the soluble fraction and was found by SEC-MALS to be a trimer in the presence and absence of amantadine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Interactions with amantadine were probed using thermofluor dye binding assay (differential scanning fluorimetry). The thermofluor melting curve for apo-ABP exhibited a high initial fluorescence signal at 25° C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), indicating that hydrophobic residues in the protein core are exposed to solvent, characteristic of a molten globule state. As the protein was heated to 95° C, the fluorescence signal decreased, likely due to aggregation and/or complete unfolding. In the presence of amantadine (1 mM), the initial fluorescence signal was much lower, characteristic of properly folded proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), suggesting that amantadine binding may cause local ordering and exclude solvent. In contrast, 2L6HC3_13, which has the same backbone parameters but lacks the amantadine binding site, is thermally stable by thermofluor assay, only starting to denature at ~80° C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyken et al., 2016</xref>). As expected, amantadine had no effect on the melting curve of 2L6HC3_13, suggesting the interactions with ABP are through the designed binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of ABP at 25° C suggests an all ɑ-helical structure, with negative bands at 222 nm and 208 nm, and a positive band at 190 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). As the sample was heated to 95° C, a loss in CD signal was observed which was not significantly altered in the presence of 1 mM amantadine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Binding characterization of amantadine to ABP.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) SEC chromatogram monitoring absorbance at 280 nm (mAU) and estimated molecular mass (from MALS).

The <sup>1</sup>H dispersion in the 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HQMC and 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC NMR spectra suggests that ABP, both in the presence and absence of amantadine, adopts a similar helical structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). A full titration of amantadine on ABP confirms the formation of a stable amantadine-ABP complex, with chemical exchange between the free and bound ABP states slow on the NMR chemical shift time scale (residence time of 10–100 milliseconds) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, arrows). An NMR line shape fitting of the three most significantly affected ABP methyl resonances (&gt;0.1 ppm chemical shift deviation between free and bound states) using TITAN suggest an apparent dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 24.1 ± 2.7 μM and upper limit for off-rate constant (<italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>) of 60.7 ± 5.6 s<sup>−1</sup> (on-rate constant of 2.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> sec<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The relatively slow fitted on- and off-rate constants are consistent with a buried amantadine binding site. Fixing the K<sub>D</sub> to half (12 μM) or twice (48 μM) the value obtained from the fit yielded higher chi-square residuals and less good agreement between observed and simulated line shapes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). We also performed an independent conventional fraction bound analysis, which yielded lower and upper bounds for the K<sub>D</sub> to be 25 μM and 55 μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, inset). Together, these data suggest that amantadine likely binds to ABP with a K<sub>D</sub> in the low micromolar range. We were not able to assign the resonances of the protein due to difficulties in preparing labeled samples, but we observe significantly affected methyl resonances which could correspond to the Ile-64, Leu-67, and Ala-68 residues in close proximity to the intended amantadine binding site in the designed structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Together, the NMR titrations of both amide and methyl groups suggest the presence of localized backbone and side-chain conformational changes in ABP upon amantadine binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>X-ray crystal structure is in close agreement with the design model</title><p>We carried out crystallographic studies to characterize the interaction between ABP and amantadine. Crystallization screen trays were set up with the same protein sample with or without ~five fold molar excess amantadine (7.5 mM). Crystals were obtained in the presence but not the absence of amantadine, consistent with ordering upon amantadine binding. The X-ray crystal structure of ABP+amantadine was solved to 1.04 Å, providing a high-resolution view of the ABP-amantadine complex structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2A</xref>).

The primary difference between the design model and crystal structure is in the compactness of helices in the amantadine-binding region and rotation of the amantadine molecule accompanied by the presence of crystallographic water molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). In the original design model, the amino group of amantadine was oriented to hydrogen bond directly to Ser-71 in ABP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), but in the X-ray crystal structure, amantadine was found to be rotated 60° with ordered water molecules mediating hydrogen bonds to Ser-71 residues in ABP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–c</xref>). Amantadine is often bound as a tri- or tetra-hydrate with the waters associated with the amino group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Thomaston et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), for example in a recent crystal structure of amantadine bound to the influenza M2 channel protein, amantadine bound the key His-37 residues in M2 through water-mediated interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>).

Room temperature neutron data collected to 2.3 Å on a deuterium-exchanged ABP crystal revealed the protonation state of residues that form hydrogen bonds to the polar amino group of amantadine and the orientation of the D<sub>2</sub>O network that helps anchor amantadine at the trimeric interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e–f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2B</xref>). Nuclear scattering length density is clearly visible for the deuterium atoms of water molecules DOD-31 and DOD-41, and the amino group of amantadine. DOD-31 accepts hydrogen bonds from the amino hydrogens of amantadine and donates hydrogen bonds to SER-71 and DOD-41. In both the X-ray and neutron structures, amantadine sits at a special position on the C<sub>3</sub> symmetry axis, with its adamantane moiety interlocked at the trimeric interface and surrounded by the hydrophobic residues Ile-64, Leu-67, and Ala-68. The neutron structure shows no evidence of H/D exchange within the trimeric interface, even though the crystals were D<sub>2</sub>O exchanged, suggesting that the trimeric core is tightly packed, and that once formed, remains stable and inaccessible to solvent at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>ABP variant designs</title><p>ABP binds amantadine in a manner very similar to the design model and leads to significant localized changes as visualized by solution NMR, but it is a constitutive (albeit perhaps not a very thermal-stable) trimer in the absence of amantadine. We sought to generate ABP derivatives with amantadine-inducible trimerization by destabilizing the trimer in a variety of ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Sidechain truncations such as Ala/Ser mutations were introduced in the core of ABP to destabilize the trimeric interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>), but these constructs were either poorly expressed or lost amantadine binding activity as assessed by thermofluor. The Rosetta HBNet protocol that was used to generate the hydrogen-bond networks in ABP was extended to search for intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions between residues that span the monomer-monomer interfaces reduce the extent of hydrophobic packing of the trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>), but these constructs were again poorly expressed. Truncations of the outer helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d–f</xref>) were attempted, but this resulted in mostly insoluble protein or monomeric species that no longer bound amantadine (In one case, truncation of both helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g</xref>) resulted in a tetramer that no longer bound amantadine). In larger-scale redesigns, the core amantadine-binding site was backed up with helical repeat fusions to stabilize the helical core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1h</xref>), but these constructs remained constitutive trimers. Taken together, these results suggest that conversion of our design into well behaved monomers that assemble into a trimer in the presence of amantadine is difficult because the subunit-subunit interface in the trimer involves considerable non-polar surface area which makes the subunits poorly behaved as monomers, and the low binding affinity for amantadine does not provide a strong driving force for assembly.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We report the characterization of a de novo designed trimeric protein, ABP, which binds the small molecule drug amantadine. The designed protein contains hydrogen-bond networks that specify the trimeric state and water-mediated binding to amantadine. The solution NMR data suggest that ABP adopts a stable, symmetric structure and readily binds amantadine. The high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of the designed protein in complex with amantadine is very close to the computational model, and the neutron structure demonstrates the presence of the designed hydrogen-bond networks. While we were unable to design an inducible trimer, our results are an advance for protein design as to our knowledge this is the first successful de novo design of a homo-trimeric protein that binds a C<sub>3</sub> symmetric small molecule other than a metal ion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mills et al., 2016</xref>). Our results suggest two major bottlenecks to the goal of an amantadine-inducible trimerization system based on amantadine binding at a helical bundle three-fold interface: (1) Amantadine, given its small size, does not provide strong driving force for trimerization. (2) Well behaved monomers in the absence of amantadine are hard to achieve in a system with substantial buried nonpolar surface area at the trimer interface (which becomes exposed in the monomers). Success in designing protein homo-trimerization systems will likely require smaller subunit interfaces and higher affinity binding sites, perhaps using larger C<sub>3</sub> molecules.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (include species and sex here)</td><td>One ShotBL21 Star (DE3) Chemically Competent <italic>E. coli</italic></td><td>Invitrogen (Thermo Fisher Scientific)</td><td>C601003</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pET28b(+) DNA - Novagen</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich (Millipore Sigma)</td><td>69865–3</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>NeXtal Tubes JCSG+Suite</td><td>Qiagen</td><td>130720</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Amantadine hydrochloride</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich (Millipore Sigma)</td><td>A1260</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Rosetta software suite</td><td>Rosetta Commons</td><td>N/A</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Rosetta design</title><p>Design calculations were performed using RosettaDesign.

This work combines the challenging design of symmetric homo-oligomers with that of small molecule binding, by starting from a previously designed homo-trimer and inserting a symmetric amantadine binding site. An experimentally determined molecular structure shows amantadine bound to the designed binding site, albeit via a number of water molecules instead as designed via the protein side-chains. The work thus demonstrates both the promise of de novo design for small molecule binding and the challenges that remain in designing accurate binding sites.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;de novo design of a homo-trimeric amantadine-binding protein&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ross Anderson (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Park and colleagues builds on previous work from the Baker lab in which parametrically designed α-helical hairpins were generated. Now, a trimeric hairpin is designed to bind the drug amantadine, which displays C<sub>3</sub> symmetry. Design success was evaluated by thermofluor assay, NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and neutron diffraction. The work thus addresses the critical challenge of functionalizing de novo designed proteins. The crystal structure shows the amantadine-bound complex; however, not quite as designed through sidechain interactions but via a number of water molecules. While such a design is of interest to protein scientists, many questions remain that should be addressed in a revision. The main questions are listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) How general is this design approach? The manuscript describes in detail one designed binder; were others attempted but failed? Was there anything to learn from these failures about the designed proteins' expression, stability or ligand binding?</p><p>2) The main concern in the manuscript is the determination of the binding affinity. There is no doubt that amantadine binds, but with the high ligand concentrations used in crystallography (and some of the NMR experiments) also very weakly interacting molecules could bind. The affinity is determined using NMR line shape analysis with only 4 ligand concentrations. This is less than the number of fitting parameters in the model. In comparison, in the TITAN publication, the experimental data were analyzed using 23 ligand concentrations. Beyond the graphical display in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 (which is difficult to evaluate) there is no presentation of the quality of fit. Also, the lowest used ligand concentration is almost 3 times more than the presented K<sub>D</sub>. Given that the system is in slow exchange it should be possible to fit the K<sub>D</sub> to the chemical shift values directly rather than through a line shape analysis, which is considerably more complex and difficult to validate. In any case, 4 conditions are too few for a reasonable K<sub>D</sub> determination and more concentrations should be tested. Alternatively, it should also be straightforward to use a complementary method like ITC on this system to determine K<sub>D</sub>. The CD data also suggests weak binding with Kd:s higher than reported. It is suggested in the manuscript that the presence of 1 mM amantadine does not alter the CD temperature denaturation.

The reviewers also appreciated the clarifications and the very thorough experimental characterization provided in your revision.

This data is, however, not supportive of binding. There is no stoichiometric binding phase that allows determining deltaH, and N(sites) is calculated to be 0.1 which would mean that only 10% of the protein bind the ligand.

The manuscript describes in detail one designed binder; were others attempted but failed? Was there anything to learn from these failures about the designed proteins' expression, stability or ligand binding?</p></disp-quote><p>In total, we attempted 70 designs. There were varying levels of expression, stability, and ligand binding, the details of which have now been added to the Results section. We have also elaborated on our learnings in the Discussion section:</p><p>“Our results suggest two major bottlenecks to the goal of an amantadine-inducible trimerization system based on amantadine binding at a helical bundle three-fold interface: 1) Amantadine, given its small size, does not provide strong driving force for trimerization. 2) Well behaved monomers in the absence of amantadine are hard to achieve given the extensive exposed subunit interaction surface. Success in designing protein homo-trimerization systems will likely require smaller subunit interfaces and higher affinity binding sites, perhaps using larger C<sub>3</sub> molecules.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The main concern in the manuscript is the determination of the binding affinity. There is no doubt that amantadine binds, but with the high ligand concentrations used in crystallography (and some of the NMR experiments) also very weakly interacting molecules could bind. The affinity is determined using NMR line shape analysis with only 4 ligand concentrations. This is less than the number of fitting parameters in the model. In comparison, in the TITAN publication, the experimental data were analyzed using 23 ligand concentrations. Beyond the graphical display in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 (which is difficult to evaluate) there is no presentation of the quality of fit. Also, the lowest used ligand concentration is almost 3 times more than the presented K<sub>D</sub>. Given that the system is in slow exchange it should be possible to fit the K<sub>D</sub>to the chemical shift values directly rather than through a line shape analysis, which is considerably more complex and difficult to validate. In any case, 4 conditions are too few for a reasonable K<sub>D</sub>determination and more concentrations should be tested.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. First, we note that the exact value of the measured K<sub>D</sub> is not central to the conclusion of our manuscript. While indeed amantadine may bind weakly (estimated K<sub>D</sub> of 24.1 μM by NMR and measured K<sub>D</sub> of 39.8 μM by ITC (see below)), the stability of the amantadine-ABP complex was sufficient to observe it also by X-ray crystallography and neutron scattering. Second, to provide corrorborating evidence to the K<sub>D</sub> estimated by solution NMR, we have determined the K<sub>D</sub> by an analogous method, ITC, as mentioned below.</p><p>Because of the important points raised by the reviewer, in the updated manuscript we have revised the Results section to place less emphasis and significance to the K<sub>D</sub> value estimated by solution NMR.</p><p>“An NMR line shape fitting of the three most significantly affected ABP methyl resonances (&gt; 0.1 ppm chemical shift deviation between free and bound states) using TITAN, suggests a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 24.1 ± 2.7 μM and upper limit for off-rate constant (<italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>) of 60.7 ± 5.6 s<sup>-1</sup> (on-rate constant of 2.5 x106 M-1 s-1) (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), which is within a factor of two of the K<sub>D</sub> value of 39.8 ± 3.1 μM estimated by ITC (Figure 2—figure supplement 3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, it should also be straightforward to use a complementary method like ITC on this system to determine K<sub>D</sub>. The CD data also suggests weak binding with Kd:s higher than reported. It is suggested in the manuscript that the presence of 1 mM amantadine does not alter the CD temperature denaturation. Binding to a folded state always results in increased stability, see for example Cimmperman et al., 2008. If there is no change in Tm upon addition of amantadine this should, therefore, be commented on.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have additionally used an alternative method (ITC) to measure the binding between ABP and amantadine. We find that the determined K<sub>D</sub> between ABP and amantadine, in corroboration of our solution NMR experiments, is 39.8 μM. These new findings have been incorporated as Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The fact that the ligand does not interact via the designed hydrogen-bond network adds to other reports in the literature on the difficulty of designing hydrogen-bond networks in functional sites. Are there any lessons to learn on how to improve the chances of accurately designing hydrogen-bond networks in binding sites?</p></disp-quote><p>The greatest lesson was the fact that including explicit water molecules in the Rosetta design calculations could contribute to generating a protein that can bind amantadine with higher affinity. As a result, the lab is focusing Rosetta development efforts in this area specifically, which we hope will expand the scope of computational protein design. Despite being a “negative result,” we hope the sharing of this information will encourage readers to consider and employ explicit water molecules in future research efforts. We have updated the text in the Results section to elaborate on this lesson.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the second round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…]</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>In particular they provided additional data for binding in form of an ITC titration.
