Rod-shaped bacteria harbor regulatory proteins that place and remodel the division machinery during cytokinesis. In the spherical human pathogen <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, we found that the essential protein GpsB localizes to mid-cell during cell division and co-constricts with the division machinery. Depletion of GpsB arrested cell division and led to cell lysis, whereas overproduction of GpsB inhibited cell division and led to the formation of enlarged cells. We report that <italic>S. aureus</italic> GpsB, unlike other <italic>Firmicutes</italic> GpsB orthologs, directly interacts with the core divisome component FtsZ. GpsB bundles and organizes FtsZ filaments and also stimulates the GTPase activity of FtsZ. We propose that GpsB orchestrates the initial stabilization of the Z-ring at the onset of cell division and participates in the subsequent remodeling of the divisome during cytokinesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38856.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A bacterium called <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> causes many infections in humans, especially in hospital patients with weakened immune systems. These infections are generally treated with drugs known as antibiotics that interact with specific proteins in the bacteria to kill the cells, or stop them from growing. However, some <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections are resistant to the antibiotics currently available so there is a need to develop new drugs that target different bacterial proteins.</p><p>Bacteria multiply by dividing to make identical copies of themselves. When a bacterium is preparing to divide, filaments made of a protein called FtsZ form a ring at the site where the cell will split. Many other proteins are involved in controlling how and when a cell divides. For example, several species of bacteria harbor a dispensable cell division protein called GpsB. In at least one organism, it helps to maintain the proper shape of the cell during cell division. In <italic>S. aureus</italic>, though, GpsB is essential for cells to survive and could therefore be a potential target for new antibiotics. However, its role in <italic>S. aureus</italic> has not been studied.</p><p>Eswara et al. have now used genetic and biochemical approaches to study the <italic>S. aureus</italic> form of the GpsB protein. The experiments show that GpsB moves to the middle of <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells just before they begin to divide and binds directly to FtsZ. This helps to secure the position of FtsZ across the middle of the cell and activates the protein so that the cell can begin to divide into two. In cells that produce too much GpsB, the FtsZ proteins become active too early, leading to the cells growing larger and larger until they burst.</p><p>The findings of Eswara et al. reveal that GpsB plays a different role in <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells than in some other species of bacteria. Further studies into such differences could help researchers to develop new antibiotics, as well as improving our understanding of why bacteria are so diverse.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DivIVA</kwd><kwd>MinCDE</kwd><kwd>Min system</kwd><kwd>EzrA</kwd><kwd>PBP1</kwd><kwd>peptidoglycan</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM128037</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eswara</surname><given-names>Prahathees J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008900</institution-id><institution>University of South Florida</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Start-up grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eswara</surname><given-names>Prahathees J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G12MD007597</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Karl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SC2 GM105419</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Karl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000199</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>232838</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Camberg</surname><given-names>Jodi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM118927</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Camberg</surname><given-names>Jodi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramamurthi</surname><given-names>Kumaran S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>GpsB in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> directly regulates the central cell division protein FtsZ, a different function from that assigned for GpsB in other closely related organisms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacterial cell division has been extensively studied in rod-shaped organisms such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Errington, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lutkenhaus et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rowlett and Margolin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tsang and Bernhardt, 2015</xref>). However, spherical bacteria lack several key components found in these well-studied model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pinho et al., 2013</xref>), so fundamental features of how they divide are poorly understood. The Gram-positive human pathogen <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is a spherical bacterium that is commensal inÂ ~30% of the U.S. population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuehnert et al., 2006</xref>), but in immunocompromised individuals, it is a leading cause of bacteremia and nosocomial infections in industrialized nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klevens et al., 2007</xref>). The emergence of several antibiotic resistant strains of <italic>S. aureus</italic> has necessitated the identification of novel antibiotic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pendleton et al., 2013</xref>). In recent years, components of the bacterial cell division machinery have been proposed as such targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lock and Harry, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sass and BrÃ¶tz-Oesterhelt, 2013</xref>).</p><p>GpsB is a small coiled-coil cell division protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Claessen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rismondo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tavares et al., 2008</xref>) that is widely conserved in the Firmicutes phylum and is conditionally required for growth in certain species, depending on growth media and temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Claessen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fleurie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Land et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rismondo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tavares et al., 2008</xref>). GpsB is highly co-conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pinho et al., 2013</xref>) with the cell division protein DivIVA. Like DivIVA, GpsB is relatively small and harbors a highly homologous N-terminal Î±-helical domain. However, the C-terminus differs from that of DivIVA: whereas DivIVA assembles into an anti-parallel tetramer, the GpsB structure was reported to hexamerize with a parallel alignment of helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rismondo et al., 2016</xref>). Similar to DivIVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaval and Halbedel, 2012</xref>), GpsB orthologs perform slightly different functions in different species. In the rod-shaped <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, GpsB participates in shuttling a cell wall assembly protein (PBP1 or PBP A1, respectively) to help maintain the characteristic rod shape of the bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Claessen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rismondo et al., 2016</xref>). In the ovoid-shaped <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, GpsB additionally has been reported to interact with PBP2a, PBP2b, and MreC, and has been implicated in recruiting a Ser/Thr kinase to mid-cell that activates cell wall assembly machinery specifically at the division septum, thereby modulating a switch between peripheral and medial cell wall assembly to again maintain the proper shape of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fleurie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rued et al., 2017</xref>). In all reported cases, GpsB interacts with a peripheral divisome component, EzrA, but not necessarily core components of the division machinery, to mediate its role in cell shape maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Claessen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fleurie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rued et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steele et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>S. aureus</italic>, GpsB is an essential protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Santiago et al., 2015</xref>) (M. Santiago, personal communication), but its cellular function is poorly understood. Herein, we report that GpsB interacts directly with bacterial tubulin homolog FtsZ, the core component of the division machinery, and orchestrates the dynamics of its assembly. In vivo, we show that GpsB localizes to mid-cell at the onset of cell division and co-constricts with the divisome during cytokinesis. Depletion of GpsB in vivo arrested cell division and prevented the robust assembly of the divisome at mid-cell. In vitro, we show that purified GpsB promotes lateral interactions between FtsZ polymers in a manner reminiscent of bundling, thereby increasing the local concentration of FtsZ, and organizes the polymers. Unlike other proteins that exhibit FtsZ bundling activity, GpsB stimulated FtsZ GTPase activity. Consistent with this activity, overproduction of GpsB in vivo inhibited cell division and resulted in the production of large <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells. Our data suggest that, compared to GpsB orthologs in other Gram-positive bacteria, <italic>S. aureus</italic> GpsB plays a significantly different role by directly interacting with central component of the division machinery to regulate the remodeling of the divisome during cytokinesis: first, by bundling and stabilizing FtsZ polymers at mid-cell by promoting lateral interactions between FtsZ filaments, which increases the local concentration and triggers the GTPase activity of FtsZ and allows cytokinesis to proceed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overproduction of <italic>S. aureus</italic> GpsB inhibits cell division in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic></title><p>To initially investigate if <italic>Staphylococcal</italic> GpsB (GpsB<sup>Sa</sup>) performs a similar function as the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> GpsB ortholog (GpsB<sup>Bs</sup>), we expressed <italic>gpsB<sup>Sa</sup></italic> under the control of an inducible promoter in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. In the presence of inducer, otherwise WT <italic>B. subtilis</italic> harboring either <italic>gpsB<sup>Sa</sup></italic> or <italic>gpsB<sup>Sa</sup>-GFP</italic> exhibited a severe growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In contrast, cells similarly expressing <italic>gpsB<sup>Bs</sup></italic> or <italic>gpsB<sup>Bs</sup>-GFP</italic> did not exhibit a growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that cell toxicity was specifically due to expression of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> ortholog of <italic>gpsB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Immunoblotting with antisera specific to GpsB<sup>Sa</sup> revealed aÂ ~Â 3.2 fold overproduction of GpsB<sup>Sa</sup> at a population level in the presence of inducer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>; note that the anti-GpsB<sup>Sa</sup> antiserum did not recognize GpsB<sup>Bs</sup>). In the absence of inducer, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells harboring <italic>gpsB<sup>Sa</sup></italic> examined by epifluorescence microscopy were of uniform length and displayed division septa at mid-cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), but in the presence of inducer, these cells were filamentous with segregated chromosomes that rarely elaborated division septa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). GpsB interacts with several cell division proteins in different Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Claessen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cleverley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pompeo et al., 2015</xref>). Deletion of <italic>ezrA</italic>, <italic>ponA</italic>, <italic>prkC</italic>, or <italic>gpsB</italic> resulted in minor morphological defects in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, but overproduction of GpsB<sup>Sa</sup> in these strain backgrounds nonetheless resulted in filamentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâK</xref>). Additionally, while deletion of <italic>divIVA</italic> resulted in cell elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edwards and Errington, 1997</xref>), overproduction of GpsB<sup>Sa</sup> in the absence of DivIVA resulted in further filamentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1LâM</xref>). Thus, the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> filamentation phenotype resulting from GpsB<sup>Sa</sup> overproduction does not require these peripheral cell division factors. We next examined if GpsB<sup>Sa</sup> affects FtsZ localization. In the absence of inducer, FtsZ-GFP localized properly to mid-cell at incipient and active sites of cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>). However, upon overproduction of GpsB<sup>Sa</sup>, filamentous cells displayed diffuse localization of FtsZ-GFP in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>), suggesting that GpsB<sup>Sa</sup> overproduction interferes with the localization of the central component of the <italic>B. subtlis</italic> cell division machinery.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38856.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overexpression of <italic>S.aureus gpsB</italic> inhibits cell division in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Luria-Bertani agar plates streaked with wild type <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (WT, strain PY79), or otherwise wild type <italic>B. subtilis</italic> harboring an inducible copy of <italic>gpsB<sup>Bs</sup></italic> (GG18), <italic>gpsB<sup>Bs</sup>-gfp</italic> (GG19), <italic>gpsB<sup>Sa</sup></italic> (GG7), or <italic>gpsB<sup>Sa</sup>-gfp</italic> (GG8) integrated into the chromosome, in the absence (left) or presence (right) of inducer.

Consistent with this observation, we were unable to knockout the gene, even in the presence of a complementing multicopy plasmid, presumably due to the disruptive overproduction phenotype described above. We therefore sought to deplete GpsB by overexpressing <italic>gpsB</italic> antisense RNA under the control of an inducible promoter from a multicopy plasmid and examined the morphology of cells using fluorescence microscopy (antisense resulted in ~2.5-fold reduction in GpsB; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F</xref>)Â . Immediately after addition of the inducer, cells harboring this construct were morphologically similar to cells harboring the empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2LâM</xref>). At later time points, we observed that cells harboring the depletion construct that had already elaborated a division septum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>, arrow) did not complete cytokinesis. Instead, the division septa became deformed and membrane aberrantly accumulated as foci. Cells that had not yet initiated cell division at the time of induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>, arrowhead) did not elaborate division septa and also accumulated aberrant membrane foci. In contrast, cells harboring only the empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>) elaborated division septa and completed cytokinesis during the observation period.</p><p>The severe growth defect imposed by <italic>gpsB<sup>Sa</sup></italic> overexpression in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> permitted us to isolate suppressor mutations that could correct this defect. One such mutation, an intragenic single nucleotide change in <italic>gpsB<sup>Sa</sup></italic>, altered the specificity of a highly conserved codon at position 35 from Leu to Ser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, boxed residue), and allowed <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells overexpressing <italic>gpsB<sup>Sa-L35S</sup></italic> to grow normally. To check if the L35S substitution caused in a major structural change in the protein, we purified WT GpsB<sup>Sa</sup> and the L35S variant and examined the Î±-helical content of both proteins using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). The CD spectrum revealed similar profiles for each protein, suggesting that the L35S substitution did not grossly affect the secondary structure of GpsB<sup>Sa</sup>. In the presence of inducer, <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells harboring inducible <italic>gpsB<sup>Sa-L35S</sup></italic> did not exhibit a cell enlargement defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2IâJ</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that overproduction of GpsB<sup>Sa</sup>, but not GpsB<sup>Bs</sup>, inhibits cell division in both <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, resulting in cell filamentation (in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>) or cell enlargement (in <italic>S. aureus</italic>), like the depletion phenotype of FtsZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pinho and Errington, 2003</xref>). Depletion of GpsB in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, however, arrested cell division without a coincident enlargement of cells and ultimately caused aberrant membrane accumulation.

At the onset of cell division, mid-plane images of <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells displayed only two GpsB-GFP foci that co-localized with sites of membrane invagination at mid-cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Bi</xref>). Reconstruction of deconvolved Z-stacks and rotation of the reconstructed image around the axis of cell division revealed that GpsB-GFP formed an irregular ring-shaped structure, reminiscent of the structure of an assembling divisome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Bi</xref>)Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lund et al., 2018</xref>). In cells that were further advanced in cell division, the two foci of GpsB-GFP followed the leading edges of the constricting membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Bii</xref>) and formed a ring structure that was smaller than the diameter of the cell, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Bii</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buss et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ebersbach et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that the GpsB ring structure co-constricts with the division machinery. In a cell approaching completion of cytokinesis, GpsB-GFP collapsed into a single focus at the center of the invaginating membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Biii</xref>), and immediately after the completion of cell division, we observed that GpsB-GFP localized largely to the cell periphery in the adjacent daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Biv</xref>), suggesting that GpsB may dynamically localize during the cell cycle.</p><p>Phototoxicity induced by SIM precluded us from performing super-resolution time lapse experiments of actively dividing cells using this method. To test the dynamic nature of GpsB-GFP localization, we followed the fate of GpsB-GFP in individual cells through three rounds of cell division using diffraction-limited epifluorescence microscopy. At the onset of our measurements, GpsB-GFP localized primarily at mid-cell in a cell that had completed cytokinesis and was poised to separate into two daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">[Steele et al., 2011</xref>]). After cell separation, GpsB-GFP redistributed to the periphery of each daughter cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Beginning the next round of cell division, GpsB-GFP re-localized to the mid-cell of each daughter cell as two foci that coincided with the invaginating membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,t</xref>). It again localized with the invaginating membrane, followed by redistribution of fluorescence to the cell peripheries of the daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The redistribution of peripherally-localized GpsB to the division septum is reminiscent of the FtsZ-dependent late localization of GpsB reported in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Land et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore conclude that GpsB localizes as a single ring-shaped structure at mid-cell at the onset of cell division, constricts with the invaginating membrane during cytokinesis, and ultimately, after daughter cell separation, uniformly redistributes to the periphery of each daughter cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>GpsB localization and divisome assembly reciprocally influence each other</title><p>Although the <italic>S. aureus</italic> ortholog of GpsB was non-functional in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, its ability to localize at mid-cell suggested that it is capable of recognizing an intrinsic feature of the divisome shared between <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The bacterial divisome is composed of approximately 10 core proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lutkenhaus et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Margolin, 2005</xref>) that direct the cell wall assembly machinery to mid-cell and mediate cell membrane constriction during cell division.

To investigate a potential interaction between the divisome and GpsB, we examined the localization of GpsB-GFP in <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells grown in the presence and absence of the PC190723, a small ligand that inhibits GTPase activity of FtsZ and inhibits cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haydon et al., 2008</xref>). In the presence of the drug, 92.5% of cells (nÂ =Â 200) harboring empty vector exhibited a diameter larger than 1.5 Âµm, compared to just 30.5% of cells in the absence of inhibitor, consistent with a block in cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4AâBâ</xref>). To confirm that the drug was inhibiting divisome assembly, we examined the localization of ZapA-GFP, a known early stage cell division protein that assembles concomitantly with FtsZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gamba et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reichmann et al., 2014</xref>) and is used as a proxy for localization of FtsZ.

In the absence of inhibitor, GpsB-GFP localized at mid-cell or the periphery in 55% or 30% of cells, respectively, and mis-localized in the cytosol in 15% of cells (nÂ =Â 200; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4EâEâ</xref>). In contrast, in the presence of inhibitor, GpsB did not localize to mid-cell in any cell observed (nÂ =Â 200) and instead displayed a combination of diffuse cytosolic localization and aggregation along the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4FâFâ</xref>).

Thus, wild type GpsB, which purifies as a hexamer and dodecamer, stimulates the GTPase activity of FtsZ at substoichiometric levels at sufficiently high enough concentrations of FtsZ (above 30 Î¼M), whereas GpsB<sup>L35S</sup>, which is locked in the dodecameric form, fails to do so.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>GpsB interacts with and promotes lateral interactions between FtsZ polymers</title><p>We next investigated if GpsB directly interacts with polymerized FtsZ using a high-speed sedimentation assay performed with a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog (GMPCPP), which promotes the assembly of stable FtsZ polymers.

Purified FtsZ or GpsB alone did not show any distinguishable structures by TEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6BâC,FâG</xref>). In the presence of GTP, FtsZ formed linear polymers,~100 nm in length, that were abundant and scattered in different directions on the grid, indicating that it had polymerized successfully in a GTP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,H</xref>). In the presence GpsB and GTP, however, FtsZ polymers formed long filaments, closer to 1 Âµm in length, which were oriented in a similar direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,I</xref>). This pattern of orientation on an EM grid was reminiscent of the bundling behavior reported previously for proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> that could promote lateral interactions between FtsZ filaments in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hale et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Small et al., 2007</xref>).

Incubation of either 10 ÂµM or 20 ÂµM purified <italic>S. aureus</italic> FtsZ with GTP did not result in an appreciable increase in light scattering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>), consistent with the apparent high critical concentration for FtsZ assembly suggested in GTP turnover experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5CâD</xref>). Incubation of 30 ÂµM or 40 ÂµM FtsZ with GTP resulted in a rapid increase in light scattering that likely corresponds to the assembly of FtsZ polymers. The increase was followed by a brief plateau, likely reflecting that the reaction was at steady state, then a decrease in light scattering, corresponding to disassembly of FtsZ polymers coincident with depletion of GTP in the reaction. Such kinetics were not detected when 30 ÂµM FtsZ was incubated with GDP, ATP, or ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), suggesting that the light scattering assay specifically reflects GTP-dependent dynamics of FtsZ assembly. To confirm that the decrease in light scattering corresponded to the depletion of GTP and accumulation of GDP in the reaction, we repeated the assay in the presence of a regeneration system to replenish GTP. As expected, addition of a GTP regeneration system prevented the rapid loss of scatter following the plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2B</xref>), suggesting that the decrease in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref> represents the disassembly of FtsZ polymers as GTP becomes limiting.</p><p>Next, we tested the effect of GpsB on FtsZ assembly. Addition of 10 ÂµM GpsB to the reaction with GTP and 30 ÂµM FtsZ resulted in an initial increase in light scattering that was much more rapid and larger in amplitude than that of FtsZ alone in the presence of GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>), whereas incubation of GpsB alone with GTP did not result in an increase in light scattering. To determine if the increase in light scattering due to GpsB was reversible, we followed the assembly reaction for a longer period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). Upon addition of GTP, the reaction containing FtsZ and GpsB displayed a rapid increase in light scattering, which was not observed when FtsZ was incubated with GpsB<sup>L35S</sup>. Note that, due to saturation of the detector in the presence of GpsB, the slit width in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref> was adjusted, precluding a direct comparison between the signal amplitudes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J K</xref>. After reaching a plateau, the reaction containing WT GpsB displayed a steady decrease in light scattering, suggesting that the assembly of the higher order FtsZ structures generated in the presence of GpsB was reversible, in contrast to the behavior of other FtsZ bundling proteins reported in other systems. We therefore conclude that GpsB directly interacts with polymerized FtsZ and bundles FtsZ filaments. Taken together with the observation that GpsB also triggers GTP hydrolysis by FtsZ, we propose that FtsZ bundling by GpsB increases FtsZ local concentration and triggers GTP hydrolysis which, in the light scattering assay, is linked to the disassembly of FtsZ polymers as GTP is depleted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Since binary fission has been traditionally studied in rod-shaped model organisms, the roles of factors that participate in cell division of spherical bacteria have been less well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eswara and Ramamurthi, 2017</xref>). In this report, we investigated the role of a coiled-coil protein, GpsB, during cell division in the spherical bacterium <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Unlike the orthologs of GpsB in other systems, we report that GpsB directly interacts with FtsZ, the core component of the bacterial cell division machinery and increases the GTPase activity of FtsZ. We also demonstrate that GpsB promotes bundling of FtsZ filaments in vitro. We propose a model in which the bundling of <italic>S. aureus</italic> FtsZ by GpsB raises the local concentration of FtsZ transiently so that it may robustly hydrolyze GTP, and thereby participates in remodeling the constricting divisome during cytokinesis. A recent report suggested that cell division in <italic>S. aureus</italic> proceeds in two principal steps: an initial FtsZ treadmilling-dependent step in which membrane invagination initiates, followed by recruitment of peptidoglycan remodeling enzymes by later arriving divisome components that mediates the progression and completion of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Monteiro et al., 2018</xref>). We propose that GpsB may participate in the initial step that stabilizes FtsZ at mid-cell and activates GTP hydrolysis (by increasing the local concentration of FtsZ via a bundling-like mechanism) to trigger FtsZ treadmilling, which is linked to constriction of the membrane and concurrent peptidoglycan synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bisson-Filho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In our model, FtsZ requires a high concentration to polymerize and to hydrolyze GTP efficiently.

We propose that the bridging of FtsZ filaments also serves to increase the local FtsZ concentration and enhances GTP hydrolysis. Unlike other proteins that bundle FtsZ irreversibly in vitro by inhibiting GTP hydrolysis, incubation with GpsB ultimately allows for the subsequent disassembly of FtsZ polymers once GTP is depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first report of an FtsZ regulatory protein that promotes both lateral interactions between FtsZ filaments while also stimulating GTP hydrolysis. Furthermore, considering the intracellular concentrations of FtsZ and GpsB and what we have observed biochemically, FtsZ polymers and regulators appear poised at the threshold between assembly and disassembly, enabling tight control over the division process.</p><p>Our view is supported by multiple lines of evidence. First, overexpression of <italic>gpsB</italic> resulted in the enlargement of <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells, reminiscent of the phenotype caused by depletion of FtsZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pinho and Errington, 2003</xref>), likely due to increased FtsZ GTPase activity leading to the inability of FtsZ to polymerize and treadmill in a concerted fashion. Curiously, overexpression of <italic>S. aureus gpsB</italic> in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, but not the <italic>B. subtilis gpsB</italic> ortholog, resulted in filamentation, suggesting that <italic>S. aureus</italic> GpsB harbors a unique cell division-modulating activity that is not exhibited by the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> version. Second, depletion of GpsB in <italic>S. aureus</italic> resulted in the arrest of cytokinesis and abrogation of initiation of cell division. Third, we observed that GpsB co-localized with the cell division machinery at the onset of cytokinesis, and co-constricted with the invaginating membrane during cell division, consistent with its role in modulating the activity of FtsZ. Fourth, we found that purified GpsB directly interacted with FtsZ in vitro and stimulated the GTPase activity of FtsZ, consistent with the ability of GpsB to inhibit cell division in vivo when overproduced. Finally, when incubated with FtsZ in vitro, GpsB promoted lateral interactions between FtsZ polymers, but also allowed for the ultimate disassembly of FtsZ in vitro once GTP had been depleted.</p><p>Our genetic, cytological, and biochemical data in sum suggest a model in which <italic>Staphylococcal</italic> FtsZ begins assembling at mid-cell and recruits GpsB to that location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) where GpsB stabilizes the Z-ring via a bundling-like mechanism that concentrates and organizes FtsZ polymers. We propose that this reinforces the faithful and robust assembly of FtsZ at mid-cell at the onset of cell division and drives an increase in the local concentration of FtsZ, which stimulates its GTPase activity, which is linked to treadmilling- an activity that is likely coincident with the initial membrane constriction that initiates cytokinesis. After completion of cytokinesis, GpsB redistributes to the cell periphery and awaits the next round of cell division. It is tempting to speculate that this dynamic redistribution of GpsB, presumably coincident with a dynamic ability to modulate FtsZ activity, is dependent on the multimerization state of GpsB. In this way, the hexameric and dodecameric populations of purified GpsB could represent the active and inactive forms, respectively, of the protein that may mediate its interaction with FtsZ. Consistent with this model, the inactive GpsB<sup>L35S</sup> was locked in the dodecameric form and did not exhibit the dynamic redistribution from the cell periphery to the cell division site in vivo. Identifying the factors that regulate the multimerization state of GpsB could therefore provide an understanding into the temporal regulation of cell division in <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Interestingly, depletion of a known interaction partner of GpsB, EzrA, also leads to cell enlargement, hinting at a possible collaboration between these two proteins in regulating cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jorge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steele et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Several divisome proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> that positively regulate cell division by bundling FtsZ polymers do so via inhibition of FtsZ GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durand-Heredia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hale et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lutkenhaus et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mohammadi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pacheco-GÃ³mez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Small et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tsang and Bernhardt, 2015</xref>). In our model, the seemingly contradictory observation that GpsB stimulates GTP hydrolysis, even though it promotes FtsZ bundling may be explained by the proposition that FtsZ bundling is not the ultimate activity of GpsB. Rather, we envision that FtsZ bundling is an intermediate step that increases local FtsZ concentration to stimulate GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This set of opposing activities exhibited in <italic>S. aureus</italic> in a single protein is reminiscent of the model in <italic>E. coli</italic>, where FtsZ polymers bundled by other proteins require a separate protein, FtsA, that can disrupt the bundles and destabilize FtsZ polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krupka et al., 2017</xref>). In a slight variation of this model, since FtsZ bundling in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> requires C-terminal positively charged residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buske and Levin, 2012</xref>), it is conceivable that GpsB modulates exposure of the C-terminus of FtsZ to promote FtsZ self-interactions or remodels FtsZ to stabilize a conformation associated with enhanced GTP hydrolysis. In this way, GpsB, an essential <italic>S. aureus</italic> protein, may orchestrate the organization, stabilization, and activity of FtsZ to remodel the divisome during cell division.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>)</td><td>PY79</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Youngman et al.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;An essential <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> cell division protein regulates assembly and disassembly of FtsZ&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While the three reviewers note that discovering the function of GpsB in cell division would be an important finding for the field, all feel that the study it is not sufficiently advanced to support the conclusions. In particular, effects other than interference with FtsZ polymerization could explain the cell biology phenotypes, and the biochemical characterization of GpsB is insufficiently advanced to justify the conclusions. Specifically, the reviewers do not feel that the in vitro data show unequivocally that GspB is an FtsZ-bundling factor and alternative explanations are possible. Last, the proposed constriction model is at odds with recent work suggesting that FtsZ might rather distribute peptidoglycan synthesis along the septal ring. Given the extent of the requested modifications, we have no choice but to reject the manuscript. The individual reviews are provided below to help you prepare the manuscript for another journal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors analyze the function of the GpsB protein in <italic>S. aureus</italic>. GpsB and its paralog DivIVA are well-studied in <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and <italic>Actinobacteria</italic>. In these species, these two proteins have been shown to be involved in regulation of cell growth, regulation of cell division and/or in chromosome segregation. Here, it is reported that overproduction of GpsB from <italic>S. aureus</italic> in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> gives rise to filamentous cells; overproduction of GpsB in <italic>S. aureus</italic> gives rise to large spherical cells; depletion of GpsB in <italic>S. aureus</italic> results in inhibition of cell division; a gspB mutation is isolated that does not affect cell shape upon expression in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>; GpsB localization is determined and found to be dynamic over the cell cycle: and, that GpsB interacts with FtsZ in vitro.</p><p>Previously, it has been reported that GpsB is essential in <italic>S. aureus</italic>. This manuscript aims to clarify the function of GpsB in <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The data presented present a good starting point for this clarification; however, as outlined below I have several major problems with the manuscript that will require additional experiments. In its current format, the data do not support the major conclusions.</p><p>1) In the Introduction it would be very helpful if an explanation was included for how DivIVA and GpsB proteins are defined and how they differ from each other.</p><p>GpsB expression in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>:</p><p>It is not clear that GpsB from <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> accumulate at the same levels in the strains were the two proteins are overproduced.</p><p>The multiple nucleoids in the filamentous <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells formed after overproduction of GpsB from <italic>S. aureus</italic> are not clearly segregated. Therefore, it is not clear what actually causes the filamentous phenotype, i.e. does GpsB from <italic>S. aureus</italic> interfere with chromosome segregation or with cell division or both processes?</p><p>Does overproduction of GpsB from <italic>S. aureus</italic> cause a filamentous phenotype in a <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strain that lacks the native GpsB or DivIVA?</p><p>GpsB overproduction in <italic>S. aureus</italic>:</p><p>Please provide numbers for how many uninduced cells have septa and how many cell shave septa after induction of GpsB overproduction.</p><p>The large cells formed after GpsB overproduction seem to be devoid of nucleoid. So more quantitative analyses using chromosomal markers need to be included to clearly demonstrate that chromosome segregation is normal.</p><p>From the data provided it is not clear if overproduced GpsB interferes with chromosome segregation, cell division, cell growth or a combination of these processes. It is essential to include additional experiments to precisely define the process that overproduced GpsB interferes with is precisely defined.</p><p>GpsB depletion in <italic>S. aureus</italic>:</p><p>Please include experimental data to demonstrate that GpsB has been depleted in the experiments shown in Figure 2. Along the same lines, it seems that a construct in which expression of gpsB is regulated directly (and without the extra step with the antisense RNA) would be a more simple experimental setup.</p><p>Only a few <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells seem to be affected in their cell shape in the depletion experiment shown in Figure 2A, B. More quantitative data are needed.</p><p>From the experiments in Figure 2B it is by no means clear that chromosome segregation proceeds normally. In fact, it looks as if segregation has been halted. So, more quantitative analyses using chromosomal markers need to be included to clearly demonstrated that chromosome segregation is normal.</p><p>As is the case for the overproduction experiment, it is not clear if the depletion phenotype is caused by defects in chromosome segregation, cell division, cell growth or a combination of these processes. It is essential to include additional experiments to precisely define the process that is affected upon GpsB depletion.</p><p>GpsB<sup>L35S</sup>:</p><p>What is the phenotype of the gpsB<sup>L35S</sup> mutant in <italic>S. aureus</italic>?</p><p>Cell biology:</p><p>The experiments nicely demonstrate that GpsB localize to the septum. Does this localization depend on FtsZ, i.e. what happens to GpsB localization upon depletion of FtsZ?</p><p>To establish a more direct connection between cell division and GpsB it is essential to include experiments on Z-ring formation and localization in the strains overproducing GpsB or depleted for GpsB.</p><p>in vitro experiments:</p><p>Please use the same units in Figure C, D and E.</p><p>All experiments in Figure 5: Please include EM images to unequivocally demonstrate that FtsZ forms filaments and that these filaments are altered by GpsB.</p><p>All experiments in Figure 5: Please include control experiments that the effect of GTP on FtsZ polymerization is specific to GTP.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Eswara et al. describe analysis of the <italic>S. aureu</italic>s homolog of GpsB, a protein implicated in varied aspects of cell division among the firmicutes. Using several approaches they come to the conclusion that in contrast to other bacteria, Sa GpsB interacts directly with the highly conserved cell division protein FtsZ to control its activity. I was initially enthusiastic about this study and its potential to define the function of GpsB, a protein whose true nature has been the source of significant debate in the field. Unfortunately, many of the experiments presented in this paper are poorly designed and the physiological relevance of the authors' findings is unclear. Experiments investigating the impact of GpsB on <italic>B. subtilis</italic> growth and division, the apparent inclusion of an N-terminal His tag on Sa FtsZ in sedimentation and light scattering experiments, and the extremely long duration of the light scattering assays (3 hours or ~6 <italic>S. aureus</italic> generations in rich medium), are particularly concerning. In addition, the model that GpsB stimulates constriction of the FtsZ ring (Figure 6) is at odds with recent work from the Garner and Xiao laboratories indicating that FtsZ forms treadmilling polymers that serve to time average peptidoglycan synthesis but does not contribute directly to constriction itself (PMID:26831086 PMID: 28209899 PMID: 28209898). On the whole, I did not find the data sufficient to support the authors' major conclusions, significantly detracting from my initial enthusiasm for this study.</p><p>1) The value of ectopic GpsB expression in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is limited at best. It is not uncommon for cell division proteins from one organism to interfere with division in another due to minor differences in protein-protein interaction. The fact that <italic>S. aureus</italic> gpsB does not complement a loss of function mutation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> gpsB reinforces this point. GpsB depletion and overexpression in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, should be more than sufficient to prove their point provided they add additional information on FtsZ assembly in the different mutant strains.</p><p>2) In the absence of data indicating that excess GpsB and/or GpsB depletion disrupts FtsZ localization, I do not think that the authors can fairly conclude that GpsB inhibits FtsZ assembly in vivo. It is equally plausible that changes in GpsB impact the localization or activity of a downstream cell division protein.</p><p>3) Evidence for GpsB promoting lateral interactions between FtsZ polymers is limited to light scattering experiments that show increased signal when GpsB is added to FtsZ in vitro. Light scattering does not distinguish between differentiate between the formation of a few large protein complexes and the formation of a high number of smaller complexes (e.g. in the case of FtsZ large bundles or lots of single stranded polymers).</p><p>4) A better way to show GpsB driving lateral interaction is to add purified GpsB to FtsZ + GTP to determine if it a) increases pellet size in a sedimentation experiment and b) leads to the formation of bundles of single stranded polymers by EM.</p><p>5) The authors use the term polymerization when I believe they mean assembly. None of the assays they employ truly distinguish between polymerization-the formation of single stranded FtsZ polymers-and bundling-the formation of bundles of single stranded polymers via lateral interactions. Assembly is a generic term that the field uses to describe both phenomena.</p><p>6) I cannot find any information regarding GpsB protein concentration either in wild type cells or in overexpression strains. Such data is essential both for the reader to evaluate the impact of GpsB overexpression on <italic>S. aureus</italic> division and to support the physiological relevance of in vitro work.</p><p>7) For <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> FtsZ the leveling out in 90-degree angle assembly assays indicates that the reaction is at steady state with regard to polymerization and depolymerization. It does not mean that the polymers are &quot;stable&quot;.</p><p>8) The concentration of Sa FtsZ used for in vitro experiments is quite high. In previous studies, Sa FtsZ activity was measured at 10Î¼M (PMID: 22958099). The authors are encouraged to use FtsZ at as low a concentration as possible-ideally near its in vivo concentration-to avoid artifacts.</p><p>9) I was confused by the use of the His tag for purification of Sa FtsZ. Was this removed prior to analysis? If not, is the tagged version able to complement depletion of native Sa FtsZ in vivo? It is straightforward to purify native Sa FtsZ (see PMID 22958099), which is far preferable to the tagged version for in vitro analysis.</p><p>10) It is highly unlikely, if not physically impossible, for a protein that stimulates lateral interactions to enhance GTP hydrolysis. Lateral interactions stabilize FtsZ polymers, restricting nucleotide turnover and inhibiting hydrolysis.</p><p>11) The long (180 minute) delay between achievement of steady state and disassembly does not support the authors conclusion that Sa GpsB stimulates first bundle formation and then disassembly in vivo where FtsZ monomer turnover is likely on the order of seconds or minutes.</p><p>12) The time frames of the GTPase assays and the 90-degree angle light scattering experiments differ substantially. If the conditions of the two assays are the same and the authors' model is correct, the expectation is that GTP hydrolysis rates would be bimodal with a low rate early in the experiment (corresponding to high levels of light scattering and polymer bundling) and with a short burst of increased rates of GTP hydrolysis at the end (corresponding to disassembly).</p><p>13) The authors are encouraged to use a regenerating GTP system to avoid accumulation of GDP over long time courses. GDP inhibits FtsZ-FtsZ interactions and its accumulation could very well be the cause of the rapid disassembly observed in the LS assays.</p><p>14) The authors should consider alternative hypotheses. In particular, their data is consistent with a scenario in which GpsB stimulates FtsZ polymerization, elevating the concentration of short FtsZ polymers (but not bundles). Increases in the numbers of short polymers is expected to increase light scattering AND increase rates of GTP hydrolysis due to increases in the number of polymer ends available for nucleotide exchange.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This report describes the GpsB protein of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, which, like some other GpsB homologs, is involved cell division. Although GpsB is not essential for viability in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> or some strains of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, it is essential in <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Here, the authors explore why GpsB might be essential. They first show that overproduction of <italic>S. aureus</italic> GpsB inhibits septation in <italic>S. aureus</italic> (causing cell enlargement) as well as in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (causing cell filamentation), and nucleoid segregation seems to be affected in both cases. Depletion of GpsB in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, on the other hand, results in lysis of some cells and production of some anucleate cells, which is interpreted here as a cell division timing defect. The authors then show that GpsB localizes to the leading edge of the division septum, and purified GpsB, which seems to form multimers, co-sediments and co-assembles with FtsZ. <italic>S. aureus</italic> FtsZ has a very low GTPase activity and a high critical concentration, similar to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> FtsZ. However, when FtsZ is at high concentration, purified GpsB can stimulate the GTPase activity 3-fold and promote massive bundling of the highly concentrated FtsZ. Finally, light scattering experiments suggest that GpsB not only stimulates massive assembly of FtsZ bundles, but also eventually promotes its disassembly. An intriguing model proposes that GpsB first bundles FtsZ, then after a while debundles (or disassembles) FtsZ polymers, making it a dual-function FtsZ assembly state regulator.</p><p>Although the new information about <italic>S. aureus</italic> GpsB is interesting and welcome, particularly the direct interaction with FtsZ, this paper has a number of significant shortcomings. The main one is that the data do not provide sufficient support for many of the conclusions, including the regulation of assembly and disassembly of FtsZ described in the title. For example, key conclusions about FtsZ bundling and un-bundling are made from experiments with likely non-physiologically high levels of FtsZ (30 Î¼M). The main conclusions about FtsZ bundling come from fluorescence experiments, but without inspection of these structures by EM, it is difficult to tell whether they are aggregates or bundles of protofilaments (especially as they are tens of microns in width, which would require thousands of FtsZ protofilaments to associate laterally).</p><p>Moreover, there is no differentiation between &quot;assembly&quot; and &quot;bundling&quot;. As the relevant experiments in vitro use sedimentation, fluorescence microscopy of labeled proteins, and light scattering, all the observed effects may be different degrees of FtsZ protofilament bundling. It is too bad that the authors did not include some TEM analysis, as this could allow them to make more specific conclusions about assembly state, including GpsB assembly state. As it is, the fact that they don't really know whether the effects are on FtsZ lateral interactions or longitudinal interactions should at the least be stated in the text.</p><p>Another key conclusion, that GpsB promotes FtsZ disassembly, comes from a single experiment showing loss of light scattering from this very high concentration of FtsZ after incubation with GpsB. While the authors' conclusions may be correct, an alternative possibility is that the GTP was depleted. They mention use of a GTP regeneration system, but this system was not described or referenced, and there is no way to know whether such a regeneration system could be overwhelmed by 30 Î¼m of assembled FtsZ that has been stimulated to hydrolyze GTP by GpsB.</p><p>Finally, there is a disconnect between the in vivo and in vitro results. For example, the in vivo images focus mainly on the effects of too much or too little GpsB on the nucleoid or membrane integrity, whereas in vitro experiments focus on GpsB-FtsZ interactions. It would greatly strengthen the authors' case if they could better correlate their in vivo and in vitro data. For example, there is no attempt to localize FtsZ in the GpsB depletion or overproducing strains.</p><p>Other major comments:</p><p>1) Figure 1E: the poorly segregated chromosomes in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells after GpsB overproduction are puzzling and were never discussed further.</p><p>2) Figure 1J-K: Why is the DAPI staining diffuse in panel J, while it is at the cell periphery in panel K? Why would DNA be at the cell periphery, unless GpsB itself drags DNA there? Is this a possibility? These odd results were never mentioned. The DAPI staining in Figures 2-3 looks much more normal.</p><p>3) Were the levels of GpsB overproduction similar in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells vs. <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells?</p><p>4) Subsection âOverproduction of <italic>S. aureus</italic> GpsB inhibits cell division in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>â, third paragraph and Figure 2: It seems that only a fraction of dividing <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells that are being depleted for GpsB have a nucleoid segregation defect. Unfortunately, the extent of this defect was not quantified, but from the images provided, only a few anucleate cells are apparent. Do the authors think that this defect is similar to the nucleoid segregation defect observed by Land et al. for <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> in the absence of GpsB?</p><p>5) These experiments require much more rigor. First, the proportion of anucleate cells in the population needs to be quantitated. It is possible that to maintain overall ability to form a colony, a very high proportion of <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells must have nucleoids, but at this point it is impossible to tell. Second, the extent of GpsB depletion in the cell population (e.g., a western blot comparing protein levels during depletion with WT levels) was not shown, making it difficult to conclude much even if more quantitation of anucleate cells were done.</p><p>6) Subsection âOverproduction of <italic>S. aureus</italic> GpsB inhibits cell division in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>â, third paragraph: The accumulation of membrane debris was not at all apparent from the micrographs of FM4-64 staining, and neither were any explanations for this phenomenon or implications for the cell.</p><p>7) The time-lapse series in Figure 2D-F was not well presented. Although the cartoons to the right helped, it seems that the highlighted cells never formed visible division septa during the time course (contrary to what is claimed in the third paragraph of the subsection âOverproduction of <italic>S. aureus</italic> GpsB inhibits cell division in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>â), whereas septation in other cells, such as those at the right of the panel) seemed to progress in septation. Moreover, these cells had apparently normal segregated nucleoids. So it is not clear (a) how typical this time course is or (b) what proportion of the cells in this population have normal nucleoids and normal ability to segregate them.</p><p>8) Figure 2: The arrows and arrowheads were not defined. Also, there is no scale bar for panels D-F; they look slightly magnified compared with panels A-C.</p><p>9) Subsection âOverproduction of <italic>S. aureus</italic> GpsB inhibits cell division in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>â, end of third paragraph: the idea of a timing defect is speculative. In addition to the abnormal nucleoid distribution being a rare event (see comments #4-5 above), there is no direct evidence that there is a timing defect. Another possibility is that GpsB depletion somehow causes nucleoid segregation to run in reverse, at least in some cells.</p><p>10) Subsection âGpsB localizes to mid-cell and co-constricts with the divisomeâ, second paragraph: without doing a 3D reconstruction as was done in Figure 3Biii', it is not possible to confirm that Figure 3Bi shows a ring structure, although it is likely. Surely there must be some tilted cells that show the FtsZ/GpsB ring, as was shown in Pinho's Nature Reviews article.</p><p>11) Subsection âGpsB localizes to mid-cell and co-constricts with the divisomeâ, end of second paragraph: The localization of GpsB to the cell periphery in adjacent daughter cells instead of to new septal rings suggests that GpsB localizes later than FtsZ. This would be similar to what was observed for <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (Land et al.). It would have strengthened this section of the manuscript to show whether GpsB localizes later than FtsZ, and this would also test the model in Figure 6.</p><p>12) The high critical concentration for <italic>S. aureus</italic> FtsZ assembly suggests that this FtsZ needs a stimulatory factor for its assembly in vivo, and the massive increase in FtsZ bundling certainly makes a case for GpsB as a candidate for one of these factors. Localizing FtsZ in GpsB-depleted cells would be one way to validate this idea in vivo and provide some type of correlation between in vivo and in vitro results, for which there is none at present (see main comment above).</p><p>13) Subsection âGpsB stimulates GTPase activity of FtsZâ: Do the authors know what the approximate concentration of FtsZ is in <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells? FtsZ can form aberrant structures when it is highly concentrated, and these structures are also dependent on buffer and pH conditions. The authors have shown that <italic>S. aureus</italic> FtsZ's GTPase activity is heavily dependent on concentration, probably because its assembly is as well. Therefore, using concentrations of FtsZ that are several-fold higher than what is in cells may give artifactual results.</p><p>14)Subsection âGpsB stimulates GTPase activity of FtsZâ: The 3-fold stimulation of GTPase by GpsB is significant and interesting, but of course it is relative to a very low basal GTPase activity that, at a more physiological concentration of 10 Î¼M, calculates to about 3 GTP hydrolyzed per FtsZ per hour. So that means GpsB can bring that number up to 10. The authors should discuss whether those rates of hydrolysis make physiological sense given the doubling time of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and the likelihood of FtsZ treadmilling at the septal ring (see two recent Science papers on this topic).</p><p>15) &quot;did not appreciably stimulate&quot; seems to be true, but perhaps the data suggest that GpsB might inhibit GTPase activity?</p><p>16) How reproducible is the separation of GpsB into hexamer and dodecamer fractions as shown in Figure 4C?</p><p>17) The y axes in Figure 4D-E are not the same as in 4C, where the rate per mol of FtsZ is a more intuitive way to present the data. Perhaps these could be harmonized.</p><p>18) The authors conclude that GpsB stimulates FtsZ GTPase activity sub-stoichiometrically. Does increasing GpsB concentration stimulate FtsZ's GTPase activity further?</p><p>19) What is the GpsB:FtsZ ratio in cells? How close to this ratio are the experimental conditions?</p><p>20) Subsection âGpsB interacts with and bundles FtsZ polymersâ, second paragraph and Figure 5: Despite the claim in the text, no obvious structures are visible in the micrographs other than those in F-G.</p><p>21) Subsection âGpsB interacts with and bundles FtsZ polymersâ, last paragraph and Figure 5N: it looks like FtsZ polymerized at the same rate in the presence of GpsB, just more extensively, so the wording should be changed. And as mentioned elsewhere, &quot;polymerized&quot; likely reflects bundling of protofilaments, not polymerization of single protofilaments.</p><p>22) How reproducible is the disappearance of fluorescent FtsZ polymers and loss of light scattering signal in response to GpsB? This is certainly an intriguing result, but needs more rigorous corroboration before it can be a major conclusion of the paper (and in the title). Even then, any conclusion about GpsB regulation of FtsZ assembly needs to come with the caveat that GpsB likely interacts with multiple divisome proteins (e.g. see Rued et al., 2017, for examples in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>) that may modulate its activities.</p><p>23) Discussion, first paragraph: As there is no in vivo evidence to back up the in vitro data, this conclusion seems premature.</p><p>24) Discussion, second paragraph: the logic here is cloudy, as it is not clear why depletion of a protein that both positively and negatively regulates FtsZ assembly could result in incorrect timing of cell division, particularly as this incorrect timing was not directly shown (see comments above).</p><p>25) &quot;GpsB rapidly colocalized with the cell division machinery at the onset of cytokinesis&quot;. This is partially true, but perhaps more importantly, there seems to be a delay between the arrival of FtsZ and that of GpsB, because GpsB is not localized to the ring (and yet is localized to the membrane) in newborn cells. If GpsB is important for FtsZ ring assembly, which is implied by the model, how might that be reconciled?</p><p>26) &quot;consistent with its role in modulating the activity of FtsZ&quot;. It is also consistent with its ability to bind a divisome component, which could be FtsZ but also could be something else such as EzrA.</p><p>27) Discussion, third paragraph: In their model, the authors assume that FtsZ disassembly is a feature of ring constriction. While this may be true, there is also published evidence that increased FtsZ filament density is important for ring constriction. At this point, it is totally unclear what happens to FtsZ assembly state during constriction in <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</p><p>28) Discussion, third paragraph and following are indeed very speculative considering that they are largely based on one gel filtration experiment.</p><p>29) Discussion, third paragraph: Might another model be that the L35S mutant GpsB fails to redistribute in the cell because it interacts poorly with FtsZ?</p><p>30) Discussion, third paragraph: While the correlation between EzrA and GpsB may be true, it is misleading to correlate them because they both have similar depletion phenotypes; depletion of any protein important for <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell division will result in cell enlargement.</p><p>31) Discussion, last paragraph: If this model is true, then an interesting and straightforward experiment would be to determine if there is a time lag in GTP hydrolysis compared with assembly. The prediction is that assembly should occur prior to hydrolysis.</p><p>32) Figure 6: although quite a bit of text early in the paper is devoted to the aberrant nucleoid segregation in response to excess or depleted GpsB levels, the nucleoid is ignored in the model.</p><p>33) Figure 6: the model for GpsB is reminiscent of a model for ZipA and FtsA in <italic>E. coli</italic>, with ZipA as the FtsZ bundler and FtsA as the debundler.</p><p>34) Do the authors know whether the His<sub>6</sub> tags on both of the proteins have any aberrant effect on their interactions?</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;An essential <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> cell division protein directly regulates FtsZ dynamics&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

As mentioned in the Discussion this would be in contrast to other proteins such as <italic>E. coli</italic> ZapA or ZapC that bundle FtsZ without activating GTPase activity. The sedimentation results show nicely that GpsB interacts with FtsZ; but if GpsB bundles FtsZ, why then would its addition not increase the amount of FtsZ in the pellet fraction? Is the fraction of FtsZ bundles already maximized in these conditions? This should be commented upon because the sedimentation results are currently at odds with the light scattering experiments.</p><p>An alternative model consistent with the sedimentation data that the authors might consider is that GTP hydrolysis is not a consequence of FtsZ bundling but instead is required for bundling, perhaps because GpsB-mediated FtsZ bundling only occurs after FtsZ subunits become poised for turnover. In other words, GpsB stimulates GTP hydrolysis by FtsZ, which then triggers a conformational change that stimulates lateral interactions between FtsZ protofilaments. This could be tested by repeating the sedimentation with GTP instead of GMPCPP, matching the conditions in the light scattering experiment. If enough GTP is provided, e.g. 4 mM or so, the low hydrolysis rate of FtsZ makes it unlikely that GTP will be exhausted during the experiment. The prediction is that the ability of FtsZ to hydrolyze GTP will allow GpsB to bundle FtsZ and consequently pellet much more efficiently. This also predicts that FtsZ bundles would not be detectable by EM in the presence of GpsB and GMPCPP instead of GTP.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38856.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors analyze the function of the GpsB protein in S. aureus. GpsB and its paralog DivIVA are well-studied in Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. In these species, these two proteins have been shown to be involved in regulation of cell growth, regulation of cell division and/or in chromosome segregation. Here, it is reported that overproduction of GpsB from S. aureus in B. subtilis gives rise to filamentous cells; overproduction of GpsB in S. aureus gives rise to large spherical cells; depletion of GpsB in S. aureus results in inhibition of cell division; a gspB mutation is isolated that does not affect cell shape upon expression in B. subtilis; GpsB localization is determined and found to be dynamic over the cell cycle: and, that GpsB interacts with FtsZ in vitro.</p><p>Previously, it has been reported that GpsB is essential in S. aureus.

We therefore induced the construct and collected samples at an earlier time point, before cell lysis took over the culture, and quantified the fold decrease.

Using several approaches they come to the conclusion that in contrast to other bacteria, Sa GpsB interacts directly with the highly conserved cell division protein FtsZ to control its activity. I was initially enthusiastic about this study and its potential to define the function of GpsB, a protein whose true nature has been the source of significant debate in the field. Unfortunately, many of the experiments presented in this paper are poorly designed and the physiological relevance of the authors' findings is unclear. Experiments investigating the impact of GpsB on B. subtilis growth and division, the apparent inclusion of an N-terminal His tag on Sa FtsZ in sedimentation and light scattering experiments, and the extremely long duration of the light scattering assays (3 hours or ~6 S. aureus generations in rich medium), are particularly concerning. In addition, the model that GpsB stimulates constriction of the FtsZ ring (Figure 6) is at odds with recent work from the Garner and Xiao laboratories indicating that FtsZ forms treadmilling polymers that serve to time average peptidoglycan synthesis but does not contribute directly to constriction itself (PMID:26831086 PMID: 28209899 PMID: 28209898). On the whole, I did not find the data sufficient to support the authors' major conclusions, significantly detracting from my initial enthusiasm for this study.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version, we have responded to every concern raised, often with fresh experiments. Notably, all the in vitro experiments have been repeated with an untagged <italic>S. aureus</italic> FtsZ, and we now explicitly discuss in the text how these results may be consistent with a treadmilling activity for FtsZ. The result, we think, is a greatly improved manuscript that will we hope will reignite the reviewerâs initial enthusiasm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The value of ectopic GpsB expression in B. subtilis is limited at best. It is not uncommon for cell division proteins from one organism to interfere with division in another due to minor differences in protein-protein interaction. The fact that S. aureus gpsB does not complement a loss of function mutation in B. subtilis gpsB reinforces this point. GpsB depletion and overexpression in S. aureus, should be more than sufficient to prove their point provided they add additional information on FtsZ assembly in the different mutant strains.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the <italic>S. aureus</italic> experiments are ultimately the most informative, but the transcomplementation experiments in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> foreshadow the sufficiency of GpsB in interacting with FtsZ that is formally demonstrated in the biochemical experiments at the end of the paper. Moreover, reviewers 1 and 3 asked for additional experiments in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> to clarify our initial observation. In the revised version, we have therefore reported these experiments (and the experiments requested by the other reviewers) in a new Figure 1, but we are of course open to removing all the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> data if the reviewers suggest it is appropriate.</p><p><italic>2) In the absence of data indicating that excess GpsB and/or GpsB depletion disrupts FtsZ localization, I do not think that the authors can fairly conclude that GpsB inhibits FtsZ</italic> assembly <italic>in vivo. It is equally plausible that changes in GpsB impact the localization or activity of a downstream cell division protein.</italic></p><p>Agreed. We have examined the localization of FtsZâGFP in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> when GpsB was overexpressed and observed that FtsZâGFP itself misâlocalized in the cytosol. The data are now reported in Figure 1NâO.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Evidence for GpsB promoting lateral interactions between FtsZ polymers is limited to light scattering experiments that show increased signal when GpsB is added to FtsZ in vitro. Light scattering does not distinguish between differentiate between the formation of a few large protein complexes and the formation of a high number of smaller complexes (e.g. in the case of FtsZ large bundles or lots of single stranded polymers).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now directly examined lateral interactions between FtsZ polymers using EM. Please see our detailed response to comment #4 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A better way to show GpsB driving lateral interaction is to add purified GpsB to FtsZ + GTP to determine if it a) increases pellet size in a sedimentation experiment and b) leads to the formation of bundles of single stranded polymers by EM.</p></disp-quote><p>We had included a sedimentation experiment in the original submission that has now been repeated with untagged FtsZ in the current submission. In the original submission, we also showed lateral interaction in vitro with fluorescently FtsZ polymers. In the present submission, we have replaced this experiment in Figure 6 with EM images that more directly demonstrate bundling of FtsZ polymers. As we noted in the response to reviewer 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response Image 1</xref>, the images are qualitatively similar to those published by the Erickson lab (Figure 4A-C in Sci Rep 2017; 7:3650) that demonstrated the ability of <italic>E. coli</italic> ZipA to bundle FtsZ filaments (please compare arrowheads to arrowheads; arrows to arrows).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors use the term polymerization when I believe they mean assembly.

Assembly is a generic term that the field uses to describe both phenomena.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We have substituted âpolymerizationâ with âassemblyâ to describe FtsZ behavior in the light scattering and centrifugation experiments. We use the term âbundlingâ when we directly observe it in the new EM experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) I cannot find any information regarding GpsB protein concentration either in wild type cells or in overexpression strains. Such data is essential both for the reader to evaluate the impact of GpsB overexpression on S. aureus division and to support the physiological relevance of in vitro work.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a discussion comparing our in vitro data to the physiological concentration of FtsZ and GpsB in <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Discussion, first paragraph). Briefly, FtsZ and GpsB are reported to be present at 4452 and 1659 molecules per cell (Zuhlke et al., 2016; primary data found in http://aureowiki.med.unigreifswald.de/SACOL1199 and http://aureowiki.med.uniâgreifswald.de/SACOL1484), which is equivalent to 7.4 Ã 10<sup>â21</sup> moles of FtsZ. If we consider a <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell with a diameter of 0.8 Âµm, the cell volume is 2.7 Ã 10<sup>â16</sup>L, so the molarity of FtsZ in vivo is 27.6 ÂµM: remarkably close to the 30 ÂµM that was required for our purified FtsZ to show appreciable activity. The intracellular concentration of GpsB is 2.7âfold less than FtsZ, or 10.2 ÂµMâ again, remarkably close to the 10 ÂµM we used in our in vitro experiments.</p><p>We have now included, in a new Figure 1âfigure supplement 1BâC, immunoblots that show the extent of overproduction of GpsB in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) For E. coli and B. subtilis FtsZ the leveling out in 90-degree angle assembly assays indicates that the reaction is at steady state with regard to polymerization and depolymerization. It does not mean that the polymers are &quot;stable&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this was a very poor choice of words. We have now described the plateau as indicating that the reaction is in steady state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The concentration of Sa FtsZ used for in vitro experiments is quite high. In previous studies, Sa FtsZ activity was measured at 10Î¼M (PMID: 22958099). The authors are encouraged to use FtsZ at as low a concentration as possible-ideally near its in vivo concentration-to avoid artifacts.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the detailed response to point #6. The intracellular concentration of FtsZ in <italic>S. aureus</italic> is ~28 ÂµM and that of GpsB is ~10 ÂµMâ remarkably similar to the concentrations required in our in vitro experiments that showed activity. Thus, we have used FtsZ and GpsB at concentrations that are nearly identical to their in vivo concentrations.</p><p>The cited paper reported that ââ¦the basal activity of the enzyme is significantly lower (â¼0.5 GTP/FtsZ/min) than we observed for EcFtsZ or BsFtsZ.â By comparison, we too observed FtsZ activity (~0.1 GTP/FtsZ/min; Figure 5D) when we used 10 ÂµM FtsZâ a very similar turnover as reported by Anderson et al. We have now cited this paper in the Results section as consistent with the slow GTP turnover rate by FtsZ reported here. Additionally, we now have included experiments in Figure 5F that test the effect of GpsB on 10 ÂµM FtsZ. There is indeed a slight but insignificant increase in GTPase activity, but the overall rates are so low that it is difficult to draw a firm conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) I was confused by the use of the His tag for purification of Sa FtsZ. Was this removed prior to analysis? If not, is the tagged version able to complement depletion of native Sa FtsZ in vivo? It is straightforward to purify native Sa FtsZ (see PMID 22958099), which is far preferable to the tagged version for in vitro analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now replaced all previous experiments in the manuscript with experiments that use only untagged <italic>S. aureus</italic> FtsZ. The data are now reported in new Figures 5â6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) It is highly unlikely, if not physically impossible, for a protein that stimulates lateral interactions to enhance GTP hydrolysis. Lateral interactions stabilize FtsZ polymers, restricting nucleotide turnover and inhibiting hydrolysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We certainly appreciate that these two seemingly contrasting activities have not been observed previouslyâ indeed, we ourselves initially struggled with reconciling these observations. That said, we have demonstrated, in a purified system, that 1) addition of GpsB alone stimulates GTP hydrolysis of FtsZ, and 2) promotes lateral interactions between FtsZ polymers as measured by electron microscopy. The model we have proposed states that promoting lateral interactions between FtsZ filaments (which we refer to as âbundlingâ, in keeping with the nomenclature for similar in vitro phenomena observed using <italic>E. coli</italic> for example) increases the local concentration of FtsZ and increases GTPase activity. A slight variation of this model, which we also included in the Discussion, is that GpsB may remodel FtsZ conformation to âstimulateâ GTPase activity.</p><p>It is critical to note that, for previously reported proteins, FtsZ bundling activity was the endpoint of their activity. Here, we are proposing that bundling is an intermediate step that allows for the stimulation of GTPase activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The long (180 minute) delay between achievement of steady state and disassembly does not support the authors conclusion that Sa GpsB stimulates first bundle formation and then disassembly in vivo where FtsZ monomer turnover is likely on the order of seconds or minutes.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We have revised the model to suggest that enhanced GTP turnover by FtsZ, stimulated by GpsB, likely leads to increased treadmilling, which drives progression through the cell cycle. Light scattering assays performed on FtsZ, after removal of the histidine tag and shown in Figure 6, suggest that steady state is reached in ~10â25 min and shortly thereafter, disassembly is favored. In the in vitro assay, this is due to GTP depletion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The time frames of the GTPase assays and the 90-degree angle light scattering experiments differ substantially. If the conditions of the two assays are the same and the authors' model is correct, the expectation is that GTP hydrolysis rates would be bimodal with a low rate early in the experiment (corresponding to high levels of light scattering and polymer bundling) and with a short burst of increased rates of GTP hydrolysis at the end (corresponding to disassembly).</p></disp-quote><p>As described in the response to point #11, we have revised the model to suggest that enhanced GTP turnover by FtsZ, stimulated by GpsB, likely leads to increased treadmilling, which drives progression through the cell cycle. We did not detect either a lag or bimodal rates in time course experiments following GTP hydrolysis. Light scattering assays performed on FtsZ, after removal of the histidine tag and shown in Figure 6, are shorter (signal begins to fall by ~25 min) and consistent with GTP hydrolysis assays (i.e., 60 min or less).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The authors are encouraged to use a regenerating GTP system to avoid accumulation of GDP over long time courses. GDP inhibits FtsZ-FtsZ interactions and its accumulation could very well be the cause of the rapid disassembly observed in the LS assays.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We now report (in a new Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B) that, in the presence of a regeneration system, FtsZ does not disassemble during this time period. The argument presented in Figure 6L, where FtsZ disassembles after âhyperâ assembly in the presence of GpsB, is that the assembly and bundling is reversible. We suggest that the enhanced GTP turnover may correlate to the onset of rapid treadmilling activity in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The authors should consider alternative hypotheses. In particular, their data is consistent with a scenario in which GpsB stimulates FtsZ polymerization, elevating the concentration of short FtsZ polymers (but not bundles). Increases in the numbers of short polymers is expected to increase light scattering AND increase rates of GTP hydrolysis due to increases in the number of polymer ends available for nucleotide exchange.</p></disp-quote><p>Actually, we think that the reviewerâs model is quite consistent with what we have proposed. In the new model figure (Figure 7B), we purposely show discontinuous FtsZ and GpsB localization at the division site. Our model now explicitly proposes that GpsB increases local concentration of FtsZ, which triggers GTPase activity, which may be linked to the onset of treadmilling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[â¦] Although the new information about S. aureus GpsB is interesting and welcome, particularly the direct interaction with FtsZ, this paper has a number of significant shortcomings. The main one is that the data do not provide sufficient support for many of the conclusions, including the regulation of assembly and disassembly of FtsZ described in the title. For example, key conclusions about FtsZ bundling and un-bundling are made from experiments with likely non-physiologically high levels of FtsZ (30 Î¼M). The main conclusions about FtsZ bundling come from fluorescence experiments, but without inspection of these structures by EM, it is difficult to tell whether they are aggregates or bundles of protofilaments (especially as they are tens of microns in width, which would require thousands of FtsZ protofilaments to associate laterally).</p><p>Moreover, there is no differentiation between &quot;assembly&quot; and &quot;bundling&quot;. As the relevant experiments in vitro use sedimentation, fluorescence microscopy of labeled proteins, and light scattering, all the observed effects may be different degrees of FtsZ protofilament bundling. It is too bad that the authors did not include some TEM analysis, as this could allow them to make more specific conclusions about assembly state, including GpsB assembly state. As it is, the fact that they don't really know whether the effects are on FtsZ lateral interactions or longitudinal interactions should at the least be stated in the text.</p><p>Another key conclusion, that GpsB promotes FtsZ disassembly, comes from a single experiment showing loss of light scattering from this very high concentration of FtsZ after incubation with GpsB. While the authors' conclusions may be correct, an alternative possibility is that the GTP was depleted. They mention use of a GTP regeneration system, but this system was not described or referenced, and there is no way to know whether such a regeneration system could be overwhelmed by 30 Î¼m of assembled FtsZ that has been stimulated to hydrolyze GTP by GpsB.</p><p>Finally, there is a disconnect between the in vivo and in vitro results. For example, the in vivo images focus mainly on the effects of too much or too little GpsB on the nucleoid or membrane integrity, whereas in vitro experiments focus on GpsB-FtsZ interactions. It would greatly strengthen the authors' case if they could better correlate their in vivo and in vitro data. For example, there is no attempt to localize FtsZ in the GpsB depletion or overproducing strains.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad to read that the reviewer found our paper interesting and welcome! In the revised version, we have responded to each of the reviewerâs concerns with fresh experiments as required, including examining the bundled FtsZ structures using EM. Specific responses to each major point is included below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other major comments:</p><p>1) Figure 1E: the poorly segregated chromosomes in B. subtilis cells after GpsB overproduction are puzzling and were never discussed further.</p></disp-quote><p>We reâimaged these strains paying more attention to the chromosomal arrangement, and found that the nucleoids are indeed well segregated in the filamentous strains (WT and various mutant backgrounds requested by reviewer 1). We have now omitted these statements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1J-K: Why is the DAPI staining diffuse in panel J, while it is at the cell periphery in panel K? Why would DNA be at the cell periphery, unless GpsB itself drags DNA there? Is this a possibility? These odd results were never mentioned. The DAPI staining in Figures 2-3 looks much more normal.</p></disp-quote><p>The DAPI localization at the periphery was puzzling to us as well, but is likely well beyond the scope of the manuscript, which focuses on the direct interaction between GpsB and FtsZ. So that this observation can receive the proper amount of analysis, in the revised version, we have omitted the image and will follow up on this phenomenon elsewhere where we can dedicate a sufficient amount of space to analyzing the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Were the levels of GpsB overproduction similar in B. subtilis cells vs. S. aureus cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included, in a new Figure 1âfigure supplement 1BâC, immunoblots that show the bulk overproduction levels of GpsB in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> and have reported the approximate foldâoverproduction in the main text (subsection âOverproduction of <italic>S. aureus</italic> GpsB inhibits cell division in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>â, first and third paragraphs). Overproduction was between ~3.5â5 âfold.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection âOverproduction of S. aureus GpsB inhibits cell division in B. subtilis and S. aureusâ, third paragraph and Figure 2: It seems that only a fraction of dividing S. aureus cells that are being depleted for GpsB have a nucleoid segregation defect. Unfortunately, the extent of this defect was not quantified, but from the images provided, only a few anucleate cells are apparent. Do the authors think that this defect is similar to the nucleoid segregation defect observed by Land et al. for S. pneumoniae in the absence of GpsB?</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. The depletion experiment was initially a bit challenging for us, but after optimizing conditions, we have now repeated the time lapse depletion experiment and show a field in which every cell shows a cell division defect (new Figure 2LâM). We report that depletion of GpsB prevents initiation of cell division in cells that have not started dividing and arrests cell division in cells that have initiated cell division. Cells also accumulate aberrant membrane accumulations that preceded lysis. Due to phototoxicity issues, we did not monitor chromosome segregation. We hope that, for the current report showing the direct interaction between FtsZ and GpsB, that we may focus on the cell division defects caused by depletion of GpsB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) These experiments require much more rigor. First, the proportion of anucleate cells in the population needs to be quantitated. It is possible that to maintain overall ability to form a colony, a very high proportion of S. aureus cells must have nucleoids, but at this point it is impossible to tell. Second, the extent of GpsB depletion in the cell population (e.g., a western blot comparing protein levels during depletion with WT levels) was not shown, making it difficult to conclude much even if more quantitation of anucleate cells were done.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included an immunoblot (new Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F) that shows the depletion of GpsB upon induction of the antisense RNA. It is worth noting that induction of the antisense RNA resulted in cell lysis, which prevented efficient extraction of bulk protein from the culture. We therefore induced the construct and collected samples at an earlier time point, before cell lysis took over the culture, and quantified the fold decrease. As a result, the GpsB that we detected is likely overârepresented and the foldâdepletion we calculated is likely an underestimation. The new experiment now combines a larger field of cells that display the cell division phenotype, quantification of cells that show cell division defects, and a clear demonstration that GpsB is being depleted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection âOverproduction of S. aureus GpsB inhibits cell division in B. subtilis and S. aureusâ, third paragraph: The accumulation of membrane debris was not at all apparent from the micrographs of FM4-64 staining, and neither were any explanations for this phenomenon or implications for the cell.</p></disp-quote><p>In a revised Figure 2LâM, we have now included time lapse images of cells that are being depleted of GpsB. In the image, we show the aberrant accumulation of membrane upon GpsB depletion and point out two populations of cells: those that have initiated cell division, but become arrested; and those that have not initiated cell division and fail to initiate. Both cell types accumulate aberrant membranes and ultimately lyse. We interpret membrane accumulation as likely resulting from impaired cell division.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The time-lapse series in Figure 2D-F was not well presented. Although the cartoons to the right helped, it seems that the highlighted cells never formed visible division septa during the time course (contrary to what is claimed in the third paragraph of the subsection âOverproduction of S. aureus GpsB inhibits cell division in B. subtilis and S. aureusâ), whereas septation in other cells, such as those at the right of the panel) seemed to progress in septation. Moreover, these cells had apparently normal segregated nucleoids. So it is not clear (a) how typical this time course is or (b) what proportion of the cells in this population have normal nucleoids and normal ability to segregate them.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now optimized the conditions for growth under the agarose pad and the imaging to reduce phototoxicity. The result, we think, is a much clearer representation of the cell division arrest phenotype, so we have eschewed the cartoon representation for this figure (now Figure 2LâM).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 2: The arrows and arrowheads were not defined. Also, there is no scale bar for panels D-F; they look slightly magnified compared with panels A-C.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this. In the revised Figure 2, all arrows and arrowheads are now defined in the legend, and scale bars are included for images represented at different magnifications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Subsection âOverproduction of S. aureus GpsB inhibits cell division in B. subtilis and S. aureusâ, end of third paragraph: the idea of a timing defect is speculative. In addition to the abnormal nucleoid distribution being a rare event (see comments #4-5 above), there is no direct evidence that there is a timing defect. Another possibility is that GpsB depletion somehow causes nucleoid segregation to run in reverse, at least in some cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. We have now softened the conclusion here and claim only that 1) GpsB depletion arrests cell division, 2) causes the aberrant accumulation of membranes, and 3) ultimately results in cell lysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Subsection âGpsB localizes to mid-cell and co-constricts with the divisomeâ, second paragraph: without doing a 3D reconstruction as was done in Figure 3Biii', it is not possible to confirm that Figure 3Bi shows a ring structure, although it is likely. Surely there must be some tilted cells that show the FtsZ/GpsB ring, as was shown in Pinho's Nature Reviews article.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included 3D reconstructions of all 2D images that were rotated around the yâaxis to check if GpsB formed ringâlike structures. The results are presented in a new Figure 3B, which show that GpsB forms a single ring structure at the onset of cell division, coâconstricts with the septum as a ring as cell division proceeds, and eventually collapses into a focus at the center of the septum, whereas it localized to the cell periphery in recently divided cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Subsection âGpsB localizes to mid-cell and co-constricts with the divisomeâ, end of second paragraph: The localization of GpsB to the cell periphery in adjacent daughter cells instead of to new septal rings suggests that GpsB localizes later than FtsZ. This would be similar to what was observed for S. pneumoniae (Land et al.). It would have strengthened this section of the manuscript to show whether GpsB localizes later than FtsZ, and this would also test the model in Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We have now noted (subsection âGpsB dynamically localizes to mid-cell in <italic>S. aureus</italic> and co-constricts with the division septumâ, last paragraph) the similarity to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and have cited Land et al.</p><p>The twoâcolor time lapse experiment proved a bit difficult for us due to phototoxicity issues. Nonetheless, to investigate the dependence on FtsZ, we have examined the localization of GpsB in cells that were treated with an FtsZ inhibitor. The data are now presented in a new Figure 4AâF. As the reviewer predicted, GpsB remained localized at the cell periphery, suggesting a genetic dependence on FtsZ. We thank the reviewer for the suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The high critical concentration for S. aureus FtsZ assembly suggests that this FtsZ needs a stimulatory factor for its assembly in vivo, and the massive increase in FtsZ bundling certainly makes a case for GpsB as a candidate for one of these factors. Localizing FtsZ in GpsB-depleted cells would be one way to validate this idea in vivo and provide some type of correlation between in vivo and in vitro results, for which there is none at present (see main comment above).</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. In a new Figure 4GâK, we investigate the localization of ZapAâGFP (proxy for FtsZ) in 1) cells overproducing GpsB, and 2) cells in which GpsB is depleted. In GpsBâoverproducing cells, ZapAâGFP fails to localize, consistent with a model in which excess GpsB may lead to premature disâassembly of FtsZ. In the absence of GpsB (prior to cell lysis), interestingly, ZapAâGFP localizes to midâcell, but the localization is very faint. This is consistent with the in vitro data where we claim that robust assembly (bundling) of FtsZ, but not necessarily subcellular localization, requires GpsB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Subsection âGpsB stimulates GTPase activity of FtsZâ: Do the authors know what the approximate concentration of FtsZ is in S. aureus cells? FtsZ can form aberrant structures when it is highly concentrated, and these structures are also dependent on buffer and pH conditions. The authors have shown that S. aureus FtsZ's GTPase activity is heavily dependent on concentration, probably because its assembly is as well. Therefore, using concentrations of FtsZ that are several-fold higher than what is in cells may give artifactual results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a discussion comparing our in vitro data to the physiological concentration of FtsZ and GpsB in <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Discussion, second paragraph). Briefly, FtsZ and GpsB are reported to be present at 4452 and 1659 molecules per cell (Zuhlke et al., 2016; primary data found in http://aureowiki.med.unigreifswald.de/SACOL1199 and http://aureowiki.med.uniâgreifswald.de/SACOL1484), which is equivalent to 7.4 Ã 10<sup>â21</sup> moles of FtsZ. If we consider a <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell with a diameter of 0.8 Âµm, the cell volume is 2.7 Ã 10<sup>â16</sup>L, so the molarity of FtsZ in vivo is 27.6 ÂµM: remarkably close to the 30 ÂµM that was required for our purified FtsZ to show appreciable activity. The intracellular concentration of GpsB is 2.7âfold less than FtsZ, or 10.2 ÂµMâ again, remarkably close to the 10 ÂµM we used in our in vitro experiments. Thus, we have used FtsZ and GpsB at concentrations that are nearly identical to their in vivo concentrations.</p><p>The reviewer raises an important point about artifactual assembly, which we also considered.</p><p>However, the structures observed by EM at 30 Î¼m coincide with an <italic>increase</italic> in the rate of GTP hydrolysis, which also occurs at around 30 Î¼M. We therefore propose that the structures observed are not likely artifactual because they track with increased specific activity. If structures were aberrant and artifactual (i.e., aggregates), one would expect the rate of enzyme activity to decrease.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14)Subsection âGpsB stimulates GTPase activity of FtsZâ: The 3-fold stimulation of GTPase by GpsB is significant and interesting, but of course it is relative to a very low basal GTPase activity that, at a more physiological concentration of 10 Î¼M, calculates to about 3 GTP hydrolyzed per FtsZ per hour. So that means GpsB can bring that number up to 10. The authors should discuss whether those rates of hydrolysis make physiological sense given the doubling time of S. aureus and the likelihood of FtsZ treadmilling at the septal ring (see two recent Science papers on this topic).</p></disp-quote><p>1) Please see our detailed response to the physiological concentration of FtsZ and GpsB in point #13. To summarize, 10 ÂµM is <italic>not</italic> the physiological concentration of FtsZ in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, according to newer proteomic data (Zuhlke et al., 2016). The intracellular concentrations of FtsZ and GpsB in <italic>S. aureus</italic> (~28 ÂµM and ~10 ÂµM, respectively) are nearly identical to the concentrations that displayed activity in vitro in our experiments. Our data suggests that FtsZ polymers and regulators appear poised at the threshold between assembly and disassembly, enabling tight control over the division process.</p><p>2) Agreed. The two papers that the reviewer referred to were still relatively recent reports at the time of our first submission, so we hesitated in invoking treadmilling explicitly, even though we felt that our data were consistent with such an activity. We have now included an extensive discussion of how we envision our data would be consistent with this activity in vivo. Specifically, we propose that FtsZ polymers would be bundled and organized by GpsB and, following this step, treadmilling would increase as GTP hydrolysis increases. We have also modified our model figure (Figure 7) to incorporate the role of treadmilling in the context of our model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) &quot;did not appreciably stimulate&quot; seems to be true, but perhaps the data suggest that GpsB might inhibit GTPase activity?</p></disp-quote><p>The mean hydrolysis rate of FtsZ in the presence of GpsB(L35S) is well within the first quartile of data we collected when FtsZ was incubated with WT GpsB (Figure 5F). Combined with the inability of the L35S variant to interact with FtsZ (Figure 6A), we feel uncomfortable suggesting that the GpsB(L35S) negatively influences FtsZ activity and therefore prudently stated that it does not stimulate it. We hope the reviewer agrees with our statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) How reproducible is the separation of GpsB into hexamer and dodecamer fractions as shown in Figure 4C?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now indicated in the legend for Figure 5 that the chromatogram is representative of at least three independent purifications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) The y axes in Figure 4D-E are not the same as in 4C, where the rate per mol of FtsZ is a more intuitive way to present the data. Perhaps these could be harmonized.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. The graphs in Figure 5DâF are now expressed either in pmol/min or pmol/min/pmol, as appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) The authors conclude that GpsB stimulates FtsZ GTPase activity sub-stoichiometrically. Does increasing GpsB concentration stimulate FtsZ's GTPase activity further?</p></disp-quote><p>We were ourselves interested in this question. However, it was difficult to achieve higher concentrations than 10 ÂµM for GpsB in the reaction so, combined with our observation that FtsZ hydrolysis jumped drastically between 8 and 10 ÂµM GpsB, we left 10 ÂµM as the highest concentration we tested. We hope this will suffice for this initial report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) What is the GpsB:FtsZ ratio in cells? How close to this ratio are the experimental conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the detailed response to this question in point #13 above. Briefly, the calculated intracellular concentration of FtsZ is ~28 ÂµM and that of GpsB is ~10 ÂµMâ nearly identical to the 30 ÂµM FtsZ and 10 ÂµM GpsB that displayed activity in our in vitro experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) Subsection âGpsB interacts with and bundles FtsZ polymersâ, second paragraph and Figure 5: Despite the claim in the text, no obvious structures are visible in the micrographs other than those in F-G.</p></disp-quote><p>On the advice of the other reviewers, we have now replaced the fluorescence micrographs with electron microscopy images to demonstrate lateral interactions between FtsZ polymers. The data are now presented as a new Figure 6BâI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21) Subsection âGpsB interacts with and bundles FtsZ polymersâ, last paragraph and Figure 5N: it looks like FtsZ polymerized at the same rate in the presence of GpsB, just more extensively, so the wording should be changed. And as mentioned elsewhere, &quot;polymerized&quot; likely reflects bundling of protofilaments, not polymerization of single protofilaments.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We have now largely replaced âpolymerizedâ with the more generic term âassemblyâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22) How reproducible is the disappearance of fluorescent FtsZ polymers and loss of light scattering signal in response to GpsB? This is certainly an intriguing result, but needs more rigorous corroboration before it can be a major conclusion of the paper (and in the title). Even then, any conclusion about GpsB regulation of FtsZ assembly needs to come with the caveat that GpsB likely interacts with multiple divisome proteins (e.g. see Rued et al., 2017, for examples in S. pneumoniae) that may modulate its activities.</p></disp-quote><p>Both experiments were, of course, very reproducible (n&gt;3). The fluorescence data are no longer presented, on the advice of the other reviewers, and has been replaced by EM images to show bundling. To dovetail our results with the treadmilling model of FtsZ, we have now rewritten the manuscript to emphasize that the increase in GTPase activity and the disassembly observed in vitro is likely linked to the increase in treadmilling activity of FtsZ in vivo. As such, the title also deemphasizes the in vitro FtsZ âdisâassemblyâ result and now simply states that GpsB regulates FtsZ dynamics.</p><p>Regarding the contribution of other divisome proteins, it was certainly not our intention to suggest that no other divisome protein influences FtsZ. We have, though, reported that GpsB <italic>directly</italic> interacts with FtsZ which we have shown in vitro is <italic>sufficient</italic> to modulate FtsZâs behavior in the absence of any other factors, and the model that we have presented, fitting with the scope of the paper in defining the function of GpsB in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, was meant to be limited to what we report in the paper. Since, in vivo, additional divisome components most certainly contribute to FtsZâs dynamics, we invoked in the Discussion section the possibility, for example, that EzrA may collaborate with GpsB in <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Discussion, fifth paragraph). Since the interaction of GpsB with the other cell division proteins has not been explicitly reported yet in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, we have not incorporated the contributions of the other factors in our model. We request that the contributions of other proteins may be introduced in models presented in future reports, once we have a better understanding of <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell division.</p><p>Finally, we thank the reviewer for pointing out Rued et al. We have now referenced the paper in the Introduction (second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>23) Discussion, first paragraph: As there is no in vivo evidence to back up the in vitro data, this conclusion seems premature.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this conclusion from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>24) Discussion, second paragraph: the logic here is cloudy, as it is not clear why depletion of a protein that both positively and negatively regulates FtsZ assembly could result in incorrect timing of cell division, particularly as this incorrect timing was not directly shown (see comments above).</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. In the revised manuscript, the model has been revised to suggest that bundling by GpsB leads to increased FtsZ GTPase activity in vitro (which, in the GTPâlimiting conditions, eventually leads to disassembly detected by light scatter). in vivo, we suggest that this translates to the activation of FtsZâs treadmilling activity (i.e., GTP cycling). Consistent with this, depletion of GpsB arrests cell division in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>25) &quot;GpsB rapidly colocalized with the cell division machinery at the onset of cytokinesis&quot;. This is partially true, but perhaps more importantly, there seems to be a delay between the arrival of FtsZ and that of GpsB, because GpsB is not localized to the ring (and yet is localized to the membrane) in newborn cells. If GpsB is important for FtsZ ring assembly, which is implied by the model, how might that be reconciled?</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We have now simply stated that ââ¦GpsB coâlocalized with the cell division machineryâ, not ârapidlyâ. In the revised manuscript, we have also shown that localization of ZapA (FtsZ proxy) occurs in the absence of GpsB, but is very faint. Together with the in vitro bundling data, we propose that GpsB permits the ârobustâ assembly of FtsZ, even though GpsB is not responsible for FtsZ localization at midâcell, per se.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>26) &quot;consistent with its role in modulating the activity of FtsZ&quot;. It is also consistent with its ability to bind a divisome component, which could be FtsZ but also could be something else such as EzrA.</p></disp-quote><p>While it is of course possible to invoke other factors, we humbly proposed that the <italic>sufficiency</italic> of GpsB to influence FtsZâs behavior in vitro leads to the parsimonious model that overproduction of GpsB inhibits FtsZ in vivo. This model is also consistent with our observation that overproduction of GpsB in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> led to filamentation, even in the absence of EzrA. To reiterate, the scope of this paper is, above all, to report that GpsB can directly interact with FtsZ in <italic>S. aureus</italic>. As mentioned above, we have tried to be cautious in applying lessons learned from other (even closely related) organisms, because the function of this protein seems to vary from species to species and, with respect to bundling activity, also behaves differently from other known bundlers. That said, we have not completely ignored the contribution of EzrA to our model and do indeed invoke it in the Discussion section (fifth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>27) Discussion, third paragraph: In their model, the authors assume that FtsZ disassembly is a feature of ring constriction. While this may be true, there is also published evidence that increased FtsZ filament density is important for ring constriction. At this point, it is totally unclear what happens to FtsZ assembly state during constriction in S. aureus.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. In the revised manuscript, we have modified our model to incorporate the notion that FtsZ GTPase activity, and hence GTP turnover, is linked to treadmilling in vivo. in vitro, this is reported as disassembly due to GTP depletion. We have revised the manuscript to reflect this in a refined model</p><p>(Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>28) Discussion, third paragraph and following are indeed very speculative considering that they are largely based on one gel filtration experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is highly speculative, which is why we decided to place it in the Discussion section. Indeed, we began the sentence with âIt is tempting to <italic>speculate</italic>â¦â so that there would be no doubt that this is not a conclusion and rather a discussion point for further study. If the reviewer wishes, we can certainly remove this entire discussion, but we feel that such speculation in the Discussion section is valuable, especially when we make it clear that we are presenting a testable hypothesis (that is beyond the immediate scope of the current paper).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>29) Disussion, third paragraph: Might another model be that the L35S mutant GpsB fails to redistribute in the cell because it interacts poorly with FtsZ?</p></disp-quote><p>Definitely! We have now indicated (Discussion, fifth paragraph) that the L35S variant may not interact with FtsZ. We thank the reviewer for the suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>30) Discussion, third paragraph: While the correlation between EzrA and GpsB may be true, it is misleading to correlate them because they both have similar depletion phenotypes; depletion of any protein important for S. aureus cell division will result in cell enlargement.</p></disp-quote><p>This is certainly true. As mentioned above, this was an effort to bring into the Discussion section other cell division components, that have been reported in <italic>S. aureus</italic> to be linked to GpsB so as not to present the GpsB/FtsZ interaction in isolation. If the reviewer would like us to remove any mention of EzrA in this capacity in the Discussion section, we can certainly do so and limit the discussion solely to GpsB and FtsZ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>31) Discussion, last paragraph: If this model is true, then an interesting and straightforward experiment would be to determine if there is a time lag in GTP hydrolysis compared with assembly. The prediction is that assembly should occur prior to hydrolysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised our model to instead describe that GpsB promotes bundling and increases GTP turnover, likely through increasing local concentrations of FtsZ. Bundling appears to initiate very rapidly by light scatter (Figure 6L), and hence no detectable lag is expected based on the methods described here. We also did not observe a lag by monitoring GTP hydrolysis under the conditions tested (Figure 5C). However, this is an interesting suggestion and has also been reported for FtsZ from <italic>S. pneumoniae,</italic> which exhibits a lag in a time course of GTP hydrolysis whereby peak hydrolysis activity occurs simultaneously with maximal polymerization detected by light scattering amplitude (Salvarelli, et al., 2015). If <italic>Sa</italic> FtsZ behaves similarly, then we would expect to reach maximal hydrolysis at 10â30 min after addition of nucleotide, the peak by light scattering. Under this scenario, if there were a lag, we would have detected it in a 10 min time course experiment; however, no lag was detected.</p><p>Notwithstanding, even a modest increase in concentration (i.e., 33%, which is equivalent to the increase from 30 to 40 Î¼M) more than doubles the rate of GTP hydrolysis, so detectable lag time measurements in the absence and presence of GpsB, which very rapidly induces bundling, would likely require rapid mix/stopped flow experiments, which we hope the reviewer agrees is well beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>32) Figure 6: although quite a bit of text early in the paper is devoted to the aberrant nucleoid segregation in response to excess or depleted GpsB levels, the nucleoid is ignored in the model.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. In this preliminary report, the unusual nucleoid segregation was totally distracting and remains a mystery to us. We have therefore left this data out of the current manuscript and will attempt to follow it up at a later date.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>33) Figure 6: the model for GpsB is reminiscent of a model for ZipA and FtsA in E. coli, with ZipA as the FtsZ bundler and FtsA as the debundler.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have now compared our model to that of the combined action of ZipA and FtsA in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Discussion, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>34) Do the authors know whether the His<sub>6</sub> tags on both of the proteins have any aberrant effect on their interactions?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. All of the biochemistry experiments in the revised manuscript were replaced with experiments performed with a tagâless version of FtsZ. The His6 tag on GpsB likely does not impede GpsB function because GpsBâHis6 induces filamentation when overexpressed in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>It is proposed that higher FtsZ bundling and thus higher local concentrations lead to higher GTPase activity. As mentioned in the Discussion this would be in contrast to other proteins such as E. coli ZapA or ZapC that bundle FtsZ without activating GTPase activity. The sedimentation results show nicely that GpsB interacts with FtsZ; but if GpsB bundles FtsZ, why then would its addition not increase the amount of FtsZ in the pellet fraction? Is the fraction of FtsZ bundles already maximized in these conditions? This should be commented upon because the sedimentation results are currently at odds with the light scattering experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion. The original intention of the sedimentation experiment in Figure 6A was to test the interaction between GpsB and assembled FtsZ polymers. To maximize FtsZ pelleting for this purpose, the experiment was performed with the non-hydrolyzable GMPCPP and at very high relative centrifugation force (130k Ã g). At this RCF, the experiment as originally performed likely did not distinguish between small polymers, large polymers, and bundles, which is probably why the addition of GpsB did not result in an increase in FtsZ in the pellet fraction.</p><p>We have now modified the protocol by centrifuging the reactions at slower speeds. As predicted by the reviewer, we observed differential pelleting behavior of FtsZ in the presence of GpsB (and nucleotide), consistent with bundling. Furthermore, to test the alternative model posed below by the reviewers, we also performed the experiment at lower speed either in the presence of GTP or GMPCPP. The results are now presented as a new Figure 6âfigure supplement 1. For +GTP experiments we empirically determined that, when centrifuged at 90k Ã <italic>g</italic>, addition of GpsB to the FtsZ assembly reaction resulted in increased FtsZ in the pellet fraction, consistent with the reviewersâ prediction that centrifugation should reveal additional FtsZ in the pellet if FtsZ polymers were indeed bundling. For +GMPCPP experiments, the GMPCPP-stabilized FtsZ polymers are much longer, as observed by TEM in the new Figure 6âfigure supplement 1D, and we empirically determined that, when centrifuged at 20k Ã <italic>g</italic>, addition of GpsB again resulted in increased FtsZ in the pellet fraction. The modified centrifugation experiments are now consistent with the light scattering experiments. In sum, we have now demonstrated using three different techniques (differential centrifugation, 90Â° light scattering, and electron microscopy) that GpsB promotes the assembly of higher order FtsZ structures. Additionally, the new differential centrifugation assay performed with GMPCPP (accompanied by additional electron microscopy studies â please see below for an expanded discussion) indicate that GTP hydrolysis by FtsZ is not required for the GpsB-mediated assembly of higher order FtsZ structures.</p><p>Since the original sedimentation experiment showed robust FtsZ pelleting (by using GMPCPP and high RCF), and the reviewers thought it was convincingly demonstrated GpsB interaction with FtsZ, we have retained that experiment in Figure 6A. The new differential centrifugation experiments are now included in a new Figure 6âfigure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An alternative model consistent with the sedimentation data that the authors might consider is that GTP hydrolysis is not a consequence of FtsZ bundling but instead is required for bundling, perhaps because GpsB-mediated FtsZ bundling only occurs after FtsZ subunits become poised for turnover. In other words, GpsB stimulates GTP hydrolysis by FtsZ, which then triggers a conformational change that stimulates lateral interactions between FtsZ protofilaments. This could be tested by repeating the sedimentation with GTP instead of GMPCPP, matching the conditions in the light scattering experiment. If enough GTP is provided, e.g. 4 mM or so, the low hydrolysis rate of FtsZ makes it unlikely that GTP will be exhausted during the experiment. The prediction is that the ability of FtsZ to hydrolyze GTP will allow GpsB to bundle FtsZ and consequently pellet much more efficiently. This also predicts that FtsZ bundles would not be detectable by EM in the presence of GpsB and GMPCPP instead of GTP.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised sedimentation data (please see the discussion above) are now only consistent with a model in which GTP hydrolysis is not required for FtsZ bundling. To additionally test the alternative model proposed by the reviewers (that increased GTP hydrolysis drives FtsZ bundling), we 1) examined FtsZ assembly in the presence of GpsB and GMPCPP using electron microscopy, as suggested by the reviewers; and 2) performed the differential centrifugation experiment with GMPCPP to monitor the assembly of higher order FtsZ structures.</p><p>1) Electron microscopy. In the presence GpsB and GMPCPP, we observed increased lateral association of FtsZ filaments, indicating that GTP hydrolysis is not required for GpsB-mediated bundling of FtsZ. The results are therefore inconsistent with a model in which GTP hydrolysis drives bundling.</p><p>2) Differential centrifugation. As noted above, we observed increased FtsZ pelleting even in the presence of GMPCPP, indicating that GTP hydrolysis is not required for the assembly of higher order FtsZ structures, again inconsistent with the alternative model.</p><p>We have now experimentally considered the proposed alternative model and conclude that the data are consistent with a model in which bundling precedes GTP hydrolysis. A simple model to explain the data is that GpsB promotes bundling of FtsZ filaments, thereby increasing the local concentration of FtsZ, which then permits GTP hydrolysis. in vitro, GTP hydrolysis results in the depolymerization of FtsZ polymers (and disassembly of bundles) which is observed in the light scattering experiments in Figure 6.</p></body></sub-article></article>
