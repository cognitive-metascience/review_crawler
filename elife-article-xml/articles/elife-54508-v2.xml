chromosome inactivation (XCI). Here we show that Spen, an <italic>Xist</italic>-binding repressor protein essential for XCI , binds to ancient retroviral RNA, performing a surveillance role to recruit chromatin silencing machinery to these parasitic loci. Spen loss activates a subset of endogenous retroviral (ERV) elements in mouse embryonic stem cells, with gain of chromatin accessibility, active histone modifications, and <italic>ERV</italic> RNA transcription. Spen binds directly to <italic>ERV</italic> RNAs that show structural similarity to the A-repeat of <italic>Xist</italic>, a region critical for <italic>Xist</italic>-mediated gene silencing. <italic>ERV</italic> RNA and <italic>Xist</italic> A-repeat bind the RRM domains of Spen in a competitive manner. Insertion of an ERV into an A-repeat deficient Xist rescues binding of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA to Spen and results in strictly local gene silencing in <italic>cis</italic>. These results suggest that <italic>Xist</italic> may coopt transposable element RNA-protein interactions to repurpose powerful antiviral chromatin silencing machinery for sex chromosome dosage compensation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genetic material inside cells is often packaged into thread-like structures called chromosomes. In humans, mice and other mammals, a pair of sex chromosomes determines the genetic or chromosomal sex of each individual. Those who inherit two “X” chromosomes are said to be chromosomally female, while chromosomal males have one “X” and one “Y” chromosome. This means females have twice as many copies of genes on the X chromosome as a male does, which turns out to be double the number that the body needs.</p><p>To solve this problem, mammals have developed a strategy known as dosage compensation. The second X chromosome in females becomes “silent”: its DNA remains unchanged, but none of the genes are active. A long noncoding RNA molecule called <italic>Xist</italic> is responsible for switching off the extra X genes in female cells. It does this by coating the entirety of the second X chromosome.</p><p>Normally, RNA molecules transmit the coded instructions in genes to the cellular machinery that manufactures proteins. “Noncoding” RNAs like <italic>Xist</italic>, however, are RNAs that have taken on different jobs inside the cell. Researchers believe that the ancestral Xist gene may have once encoded a protein but changed over time to produce only a noncoding RNA. Carter, Xu et al. therefore set out to find out how exactly this might have happened, and also how <italic>Xist</italic> might have acquired its ability to switch genes off.</p><p>Initial experiments used mouse cells grown in the laboratory, in which a protein called Spen was deleted. Spen is known to help <italic>Xist</italic> silence the X chromosome. In female cells lacking Spen, the second X chromosome remained active. Other chromosomes in male and female cells also had stretches of DNA that became active upon Spen’s removal. These DNA sequences, termed endogenous retroviruses, were remnants of ancestral viral infections. In other words, Spen normally acted as an antiviral defense.</p><p>Analysis of genetic sequences showed that Spen recognized endogenous retrovirus sequences resembling a key region in <italic>Xist</italic>, a region which was needed for <italic>Xist</italic> to work properly. Inserting fragments of endogenous retroviruses into a defective version of <italic>Xist</italic> lacking this region also partially restored its ability to inactivate genes, suggesting that X chromosome silencing might work by hijacking cellular defenses against viruses. That is, female cells essentially ‘pretend’ there is a viral infection on the second X chromosome by coating it with <italic>Xist</italic> (which mimics endogenous retroviruses), thus directing Spen to shut it down.</p><p>This research is an important step towards understanding how female cells carry out dosage compensation in mammals. More broadly, it sheds new light on how ancient viruses may have shaped the evolution of noncoding RNAs in the human genome.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Xist</kwd><kwd>long noncoding RNA</kwd><kwd>transposon</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>gene silencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HG007735</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Howard Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HG004361</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Howard Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001845</institution-id><institution>Scleroderma Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Howard Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Howard Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM120347</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Batey</surname><given-names>Robert T</given-names></name><name><surname>Wuttke</surname><given-names>Deborah S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEO26730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Longaker</surname><given-names>Michael T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hagey Laboratory for Pediatric Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Longaker</surname><given-names>Michael T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A long noncoding RNA uses viral mimicry to achieve developmental gene silencing across a chromosome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Xist</italic> is a 17 kb long noncoding RNA that acts through specific interactions between its distinct RNA domains and nuclear effector proteins. The <italic>Xist</italic> RNA-associated protein complex was identified in 2015 using both genetic and affinity-based methods, and consists of multiple pleiotropic proteins, many of which are highly conserved throughout evolution and act on chromatin structure and gene regulation in myriad systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McHugh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Minajigi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Monfort et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moindrot et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that <italic>Xist</italic> evolved the ability to bind these proteins in the eutherian mammals, coopting those which evolved initially to perform other epigenetic functions. <italic>Xist</italic> evolved in the eutherian clade through exaptation of a combination of coding genes that were pseudogenized, as well as transposable elements (TEs) that inserted into this locus. <italic>Xist</italic> contains six tandem repeat regions (A-F), all of which show sequence similarity to TEs, suggesting they arose from eutheria-specific TE insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elisaphenko et al., 2008</xref>). One of these is the A-repeat, which is essential for gene silencing. When this ~500 bp region is deleted, <italic>Xist</italic> RNA coats the X chromosome, but silencing and reorganization of the X does not follow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wutz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giorgetti et al., 2016</xref>). The A-repeat sequence is thought to derive from the insertion and duplication of an endogenous retrovirus (ERV), a class of TEs present in many copies throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elisaphenko et al., 2008</xref>). In general, lncRNAs are not well-conserved compared to protein-coding genes but are enriched for TE content, suggesting they may be able to rapidly evolve functional domains by exapting protein- and nucleic acid-binding activity from entire TEs that colonize their loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnson and Guigó, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kelley and Rinn, 2012</xref>). Understanding how the <italic>Xist</italic> RNA sequence was evolutionarily stitched together from these existing building blocks to gain protein-binding potential is of great interest towards understanding dosage compensation and lncRNA-mediated gene regulation genome-wide.</p><p>Spen (also known as SHARP, MINT) is a ~ 400 kDa <italic>Xist</italic> RNA binding protein (RBP) that contains four canonical RNA binding domains, as well as a SPOC domain to facilitate protein-protein interactions. Spen is a co-repressor that binds to several chromatin remodeling complexes, including histone deacetylases (HDACs), and the NuRD complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McHugh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2001</xref>). Though now recognized for its central role in the eutherian-specific XCI process, Spen is an ancient protein that plays roles in gene repression during development in species including <italic>Drosophila </italic>and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, in addition to mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yabe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsuji et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bäurle et al., 2007</xref>). Spen binds directly to the A-repeat of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA and <italic>Spen</italic> inactivation abrogates silencing of multiple X-linked genes, suggesting that the RNA-protein interaction between the A-repeat and Spen is an early and essential step in XCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McHugh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Monfort et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To test the effect of Spen loss on gene regulation and chromosome accessibility during XCI and genome-wide during development, we performed ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>) in haploid mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) harboring a doxycycline-inducible <italic>Xist</italic> transgene either in the wild-type (WT) context or with a full deletion of <italic>Spen</italic> (<italic>Spen</italic> KO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Monfort et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Thus, how <italic>Xist</italic> evolved the ability to recruit Spen is of great interest. We hypothesized that understanding Spen’s role in autosomal gene regulation and its target specificity might lend clues into how Spen was exapted to participate in the Eutherian-specific process of XCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Comparison of ATAC-seq data in WT and <italic>Spen</italic> KO mESCs revealed 288 sites on the autosomes that gain accessibility in two clones of <italic>Spen</italic> KO mESCs, compared to only 147 sites that lose accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This observation is consistent with chromatin de-repression in the absence of Spen’s repressive function. The DNA elements that were more accessible in <italic>Spen</italic> KO mESCs are almost all distal to transcriptional start sites (TSS), in contrast to unchanging peaks and those that are less accessible, which encompassed both promoters and distal sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). This indicated that DNA elements regulated by Spen on the autosomes are not found at gene promoters, but rather are found in heterochromatic, gene-poor regions.</p><p>To better understand Spen’s autosomal targets, we performed genome ontology enrichment for the sites that are de-repressed in <italic>Spen</italic> KO mESCs using HOMER. While the set of sites confidently gaining accessibility in both <italic>Spen</italic> KO clones is relatively small, it showed a striking enrichment for TE-derived long terminal repeat (LTR) elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). When we looked more closely at subsets of these annotations, we found an enrichment specifically for endogenous retrovirus K (ERVK) TEs in these sites, which is reproduced in two independent <italic>Spen</italic> KO clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). These ERVKs are enriched specifically for LTR elements in the RLTR13, RLTR9, and early transposon (ETn) families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). ERV-derived sequences in the genome have recently been shown to play important roles in genome regulation in embryonic cell types, serving as binding sites for transcription factors, indicating that Spen loss may activate ectopic regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bourque et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Macfarlan et al., 2012</xref>). Because sequencing reads coming from TEs in the genome do not map uniquely, it is difficult to accurately quantify reads coming from a given ERV subfamily while also mapping them to the correct element. We thus mapped ATAC-seq reads to the genome, while either keeping only uniquely mapping reads, or allowing multi-mapping reads to randomly map to one location. Both of these methods revealed the same trend, demonstrating the de-repression of a subset of ERVK elements in <italic>Spen</italic> KO mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>).</p><p>The observation that TE-derived elements were activated in <italic>Spen</italic> KO mESCs was intriguing, given that the A-repeat region of Xist is itself believed to be derived from an ancient TE insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elisaphenko et al., 2008</xref>). It has been posited that TEs, upon insertion into pseudogenes or non-coding loci may contribute functional protein-binding domains to noncoding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnson and Guigó, 2014</xref>). Indeed, noncoding RNAs, including Xist, are enriched for TE content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kelley and Rinn, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, it is known that in a very distantly related species, the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the Spen homologs <italic>fca</italic> and <italic>fpa</italic> bind to and regulate transcription of TEs in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bäurle et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, Spen’s ability to regulate a subset of ERVK families may explain Spen’s ability to recognize the A-repeat and interact directly with it.</p><p>In mESCs, the majority of TEs, including ERVKs, are silenced by histone H3 lysine nine trimethylation (H3K9me3). When members of the TE silencing machinery, such as Kap1 and Setdb1, are inactivated, H3K9me3 is lost, and these TE insertions can be expressed and function as ectopic promoters and enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maksakova and Mager, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rowe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karimi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). We hypothesized that in the absence of Spen and its protein partners, these ERVKs would lose H3K9me3 and gain histone modifications associated with active gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Żylicz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McHugh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, ChIP-seq experiments revealed that DNA elements gaining accessibility in <italic>Spen</italic> KO showed a dramatic loss of H3K9me3 and a gain of both histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) and histone H3 lysine four trimethylation (H3K4me3) marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>). Conversely, H3K9me3 peaks that are lost in <italic>Spen</italic> KO mESCs are enriched for ERVKs, and sites that gain the enhancer mark H3K27Ac are enriched for ERVKs including ETn elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d–f</xref>). This demonstrates that at the level of chromatin modifications, a subset of ERVK elements are de-repressed when Spen is lost in mESCs. To test whether these ERVK elements are upregulated at the level of transcription, we performed RNA-seq in WT and <italic>Spen</italic> KO mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a,e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a–c</xref>).

In order for the cell to handle these parasitic elements, pathways have evolved to shut down these transposons at the level of the DNA locus and the RNA transcript. ERVK insertions that are more similar to the original TE sequence pose more of a threat to cells, as they are more likely to be mobile and able to replicate. Thus, we compared the sequence diversity of the ERVKs upregulated in S<italic>pen</italic> KO to those not upregulated in <italic>Spen</italic> KO, and found that those repressed by Spen have diverged less than those that are not repressed by Spen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). The lower diversity indicates that Spen targets more recent ERVK insertions. Furthermore, we found that genes involved in the innate cellular immunity pathway, which responds to retroviral RNA presence, are modestly upregulated in <italic>Spen</italic> KO mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2d</xref>). These data suggest that Spen represses young, more intact ERVKs, and when Spen is inactivated, the cell responds to the presence of those RNA transcripts to attempt to silence them.</p><p>TE insertions are enriched for transcription factor binding motifs, and it has been suggested that insertion of many elements of the same family within the genome may have led to the evolution of transcription factor-based regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bourque et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sundaram et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sundaram et al., 2017</xref>). ERVK, and more specifically ETn, elements are enriched for binding sites for Oct4, one of the most critical transcription factors for regulation of the pluripotent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bourque et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schöler, 1991</xref>). Oct4 plays a critical role in balancing the expression of pro-self renewal and pro-differentiation genes in mESCs. We find that the Oct4 binding motif is enriched at DNA elements gaining accessibility in <italic>Spen</italic> KO mESCs, and Oct4 occupancy increases at these loci as shown by ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The ability of this core stemness factor to bind to these TE elements suggests that their misregulation in <italic>Spen</italic> KO mESCs may affect the self-renewal or differentiation programs within these cells. GO term analysis revealed that genes downregulated in <italic>Spen</italic> KO mESCs are enriched for early developmental terms, indicating that these cells may be deficient in early lineage commitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2e–f</xref>).

To test whether <italic>Spen</italic> KO mESCs can spontaneously differentiate when deprived of self-renewal signals, we removed leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) from the media and allowed cells to grow for 6 days. After 6 days, WT mESCs downregulated pluripotency factors such as Oct4 and expressed early differentiation markers such as Nestin. In contrast, <italic>Spen</italic> KO mESCs maintained Oct4 expression and mESC morphology despite LIF removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3b,c</xref>). We then tested whether <italic>Spen</italic> KO mESCs can be directed to differentiate toward the neurectoderm fate, by driving differentiation toward neural progenitor cells. After 14 days of differentiation, WT cells express Nestin and have NPC morphology while <italic>Spen</italic> KO mESCs do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3d</xref>).

RRMs 2–4 were shown to be bona fide RNA binding domains, with RRM3 specifically required for binding to known Spen binding partner <italic>SRA</italic> RNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arieti et al., 2014</xref>). We expressed tagged Spen RRM2-4 in both <italic>Spen</italic> KO mESCs, which express <italic>Xist</italic> upon doxycycline treatment, and in WT male V6.5 mESCs, which do not express <italic>Xist</italic>, but do express <italic>ERVs</italic>. Following UV crosslinking of RNA and protein complexes in vivo, we isolated RRM2-4-bound RNAs using an anti-FLAG antibody and prepared libraries from the isolated RNA.</p><p>On mRNAs and lncRNAs, we detected Spen RRM2-4 binding at 29,625 sites (irCLIP-seq clusters), on a total of 4732 transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Compared to other RBPs, Spen binds relatively very few RNAs in irCLIP-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). <italic>Xist</italic> was the top bound gene, with much higher binding strength than other RNAs, consistent with its known interaction with the A-repeat region of <italic>Xist</italic> and role in XCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McHugh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Minajigi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Monfort et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moindrot et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dossin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nesterova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Spen RRM2-4 binds specifically to the A-repeat monomers as reported for full-length and truncated Spen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arieti et al., 2014</xref>). This confirmed that our FLAG-tagged RRMs bind Spen’s RNA targets in vivo. In addition to <italic>Xist</italic>, Spen binds to several mRNAs, one of which is the <italic>Spen</italic> mRNA itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d,f</xref>). This is consistent with our observation that loss of Spen protein leads to upregulation of <italic>Spen</italic> mRNA expression, suggesting that the Spen protein represses its own RNA output in <italic>cis</italic>.</p><p>To assess whether Spen RRM2-4 binds directly to ERVK-derived RNA, we mapped irCLIP-seq data to TEs in the genome. Because irCLIP-seq reads are short and single ended and thus less likely to map uniquely to these repetitive elements, we mapped reads only to the elements that are expressed in our RNA-seq data. We detected a total of 7812 irCLIP-seq clusters on TE RNAs (20% of total clusters detected), covering 2267 individual TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,c</xref>). Of these, we detected RRM2-4 binding at 442 LTRs and 208 ERVKs. The TE subfamily with the greatest number of bound elements is the MMETn-int family, a member of the ETn class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g,h</xref>). In addition, RLTR13G and ETnERV-int showed a large number of elements bound as well as a high percentage of total genomic elements bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g,h</xref>). RRM-bound elements within these families show modestly increased RNA expression in Spen KO mESCs, consistent with Spen binding contributing to repression of these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i–k</xref>). These <italic>ERV</italic> RNAs are bound by RRM2-4 as well as full-length Spen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d–f</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a,b</xref>).</p><p>The specificity of RBP binding to its RNA targets may have a structural and/or sequence basis. In order to understand whether Spen binds to the A-Repeat and <italic>ERV</italic> RNAs in the same manner, we first investigated the sequence features in Spen-bound mRNAs, lncRNAs, and ERVs. We found that RRM2-4 binding sites on mRNA and lncRNAs, as well as ERVs, are enriched for AU content, but did not find any longer, more complex motifs shared amongst the classes. Furthermore, we did not find sequences that showed strong homology to the highly conserved A-Repeat regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3a–c</xref>). This was perhaps not surprising, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arieti et al., 2014</xref> previously showed that Spen’s recognition of the <italic>SRA</italic> lncRNA is largely dictated by RNA secondary structure, not sequence, with Spen binding to a flexible, single stranded region adjacent to a double stranded region.</p><p>We asked whether Spen RRMs bind to a similar structural feature in the A-Repeat and in <italic>ERV</italic> RNAs. Spen has previously been reported to bind to the junction between a single stranded loop and a duplex formed by multiple A-Repeat monomers interacting in three dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2016</xref>), a structure that is similar to Spen’s binding site within SRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arieti et al., 2014</xref>). Upon closer examination of icSHAPE data, which determines whether RNAs are single (high icSHAPE reactivity score) or double stranded (low icSHAPE reactivity score) in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Spitale et al., 2015</xref>), we found that the A Repeat region of <italic>Xist</italic> consists of a hairpin that contains a small bulging single stranded region, flanked by two larger single stranded loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–e</xref>). Both the Spen RRMs and the full length Spen bind to the conserved single stranded regions directly adjacent to the double-stranded hairpin and to the small bulge within the hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–e</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Spen RRMs recognize a common structural feature in A-Repeat and <italic>ERV</italic> RNA.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) irCLIP-seq signal from full-length Spen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kahles et al., 2016</xref>) across the 8 <italic>Xist</italic> A-repeats.

For LTR families for which we had enough loci that are both bound by RRMs and have icSHAPE signal, (RLTR13G, ETnERV, MMETn) we found that Spen binding occurs within short single stranded regions adjacent to double stranded regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f–h</xref>). This is consistent with a model where Spen RRMs bind to single-stranded bulges within larger duplexes in <italic>ERVK</italic> RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>).

We hypothesized that if Spen binds <italic>ERVK</italic>s and the A-Repeat with the same structural recognition mechanism, it should bind with similar affinity and in a competitive manner. We used fluorescence anisotropy experiments to measure the binding affinity of Spen RRMs 2–4 to <italic>ERV</italic> RNA elements as well as the <italic>Xist</italic> A-repeat and the <italic>SRA</italic> RNA H12H13 hairpin, two known interactors of Spen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McHugh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arieti et al., 2014</xref>). We also measured binding of a version of the Spen RRMs that has five point mutations in RRM3 (RRM3 Mt), which was previously shown to diminish binding of Spen to SRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arieti et al., 2014</xref>). Using in vitro irCLIP RNA isolation, we found that the RRM3 Mt binds ~50% less RNA than RRM2-4 confirming these residues are essential for Spen RNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b–f</xref>).</p><p>Using fluorescence anisotropy, we found that the binding affinity of Spen RRM2-4 for our <italic>ERV</italic> transcripts and the <italic>Xist</italic> A-Repeat are similar (dissociation constant <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> = 53 nM~140 nM), and higher than the affinity of Spen RRM2-4 for the <italic>SRA</italic> hairpin (K<sub>D</sub> = 450 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref>). The binding affinity of the RRM3 Mt is about half that of the RRM2-4 for both <italic>Xist</italic> A-repeat and the <italic>ERV</italic> RNAs, suggesting that the same residues of Spen’s RRM3 domain are binding both <italic>Xist</italic> A-repeat and <italic>ERV</italic> RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2g</xref>). Finally, we found that an unlabeled <italic>ERV</italic> RNA competed with a labeled <italic>Xist</italic> A-repeat for binding to Spen RRM2-4, further demonstrating that Spen recognizes these two RNAs, in part, through the same binding domain and in a very similar manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). These data, taken with our irCLIP-seq data, show that Spen binds to ERVK-derived RNA in the nucleus and does so via the same binding mechanism and with the same strength as it binds the A-Repeat of <italic>Xist</italic>.

The observation that the A-repeat may be derived from an ancient ERV insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elisaphenko et al., 2008</xref>), which shows structural similarity to the ERV elements bound by Spen, suggests that <italic>Xist</italic> evolved its ability to recruit Spen via Spen’s recognition of ERV sequence and subsequent recruitment of repressive complexes. Spen itself has evolved relatively little throughout evolution from fish to humans, and Spen’s RNA binding domains show no evidence of branch-specific evolution in the eutherian clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus a mechanism in which the <italic>Xist</italic> RNA itself evolved toward Spen’s functionality is fitting.</p><p>We reasoned that if the <italic>Xist</italic> A-repeat region evolved via the insertion of a TE that had affinity for Spen into the proto-<italic>Xist</italic> locus, then the insertion of an ERV element into <italic>Xist</italic> may be able to complement the A-repeat deletion of <italic>Xist</italic>. We would expect that this chimeric <italic>Xist-ERV</italic> would be able to 1) recruit and bind to Spen and 2) silence X-linked genes in cis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we utilized a male (XY) mESC line that harbors both a doxycycline inducible <italic>Xist</italic> gene on the X as well as a deletion of the A-repeat region (Xist-ΔA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wutz et al., 2002</xref>). While induction of <italic>Xist</italic> by doxycycline treatment in the WT male mESCs (Xist-WT) leads to silencing of the single X chromosome, <italic>Xist</italic> expression in Xist-ΔA mESCs has no effect on X chromosome gene expression or accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wutz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giorgetti et al., 2016</xref>).

We chose a 9x array of binding sites because the A-repeat region of <italic>Xist</italic> consists of 8.5 repeats in human and 7.5 repeats in mouse, which fold into a complex secondary structure with multiple Spen binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Minks et al., 2013</xref>).

The rescue of <italic>Xist-ERV</italic> expression by Spen depletion was quite variable from experiment to experiment; addition of an inhibitor of HDAC3, which is recruited by Spen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Żylicz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McHugh et al., 2015</xref>), made the Xist-ERV induction substantially more consistent and up to 20-fold in at least one clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). This suggested that <italic>Xist-ERV</italic> recruits Spen, leading to local silencing of the <italic>Xist</italic> transgene in cis.</p><p>Therefore, the insertion of an ERV-derived RNA motif into <italic>Xist</italic> is sufficient to partially substitute for the A-repeat, recruit Spen to the chimeric RNA, and mediate strictly local gene silencing in cis. This is the first demonstration of how a TE insertion during evolution could confer new functionality on a noncoding RNA, by introducing a new protein recruitment domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnson and Guigó, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we tested whether this Spen recruitment by the <italic>Xist-ERV</italic> RNA is sufficient to lead to chromosome-wide silencing. We conducted these experiments in the presence of HDAC1/2 inhibition, which increases <italic>Xist</italic> induction but was previously shown not to affect silencing during XCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Żylicz et al., 2019</xref>). While expression of X-linked genes <italic>Pgk1</italic>, <italic>Gpc4</italic>, <italic>Mecp2</italic>, and <italic>Rnf12</italic> was reduced after <italic>Xist</italic> induction in Xist-WT cells, expression was unchanged upon expression of <italic>Xist-ΔA</italic> or <italic>Xist-ERV</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3a</xref>). Thus, while the addition of the ETn array to an A-repeat-deficient <italic>Xist</italic> was sufficient to recruit Spen, it was not sufficient to carry out XCI. These experiments were conducted in the presence of HDAC1/2i, necessary to overcome Xist-ERV silencing of its own locus, but may also inhibit the chimeric RNA’s silencing of distal loci. Furthermore, this could be due to the differences in levels of <italic>Xist</italic> that we are able to induce in this system, which are lower in the Xist-ERV cells than the Xist WT or Xist ΔA cells, even in the presence of HDAC1/2i. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that insertion of an ERV element into the proto-<italic>Xist</italic> locus was an <italic>early</italic> evolutionary step in the functionalization of the A-repeat, but that additional rounds of evolution may have subsequently acted on this region of the genome in order to evolve <italic>Xist</italic>’s full functionality for silencing the entire chromosome over long genomic distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elisaphenko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brockdorff, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we show that Spen, a highly conserved and pleiotropic RNA binding protein, binds to and regulates specific classes of ERVK loci in mouse embryonic stem cells. Spen represses these ERVK loci via a direct mechanism where it binds transcripts derived from these parasitic elements, and can then recruit its chromatin silencing protein partners. In the absence of Spen, these elements become derepressed, showing loss of repressive H3K9me3 and gain of active chromatin modifications. Sensing transposon silencing at the RNA level is attractive, as it provides a mechanism for the cell to identify the ‘leaky’ locus and target the silencing machinery to the locus in <italic>cis</italic>.</p><p>These observations are striking when taken with the observation that the <italic>Xist</italic> RNA, which is also robustly bound by Spen, is derived from a number of ancient retroviral insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elisaphenko et al., 2008</xref>). We show direct evidence, for the first time, that an <italic>Xist</italic> binding protein can bind to ERV-derived RNA in vivo, and thus may have been recruited to <italic>Xist</italic> via the insertion of an ERV element into the proto-<italic>Xist</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). This evidence supports the hypothesis that lncRNAs, which are evolutionarily young, may exapt TE-protein interactions in order to form functional protein binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnson and Guigó, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kelley and Rinn, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guttman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hezroni et al., 2015</xref>). In effect, <italic>Xist</italic> lncRNA ‘tricks’ the female cell to perceive the inactive X chromosome as being coated by dangerous transposon RNAs. The cell can then deploy Spen, a transposon-silencing protein, to carry out X chromosome dosage compensation.</p><p>One of the major mysteries of X inactivation is the <italic>cis</italic>-restriction of <italic>Xist</italic>, which only silences the chromosome from which it is expressed, a property critical for dosage compensation of two X chromosomes in females to one X in males. Our discovery of the link between Spen and transposon silencing suggests an ancient evolutionary origin for <italic>cis</italic> silencing. Spen sensing of <italic>ERV</italic> RNA and Spen-mediated silencing are <italic>cis</italic> restricted, and indeed grafting ERV into the <italic>Xist</italic> locus caused <italic>cis</italic> silencing of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA expression itself. Hence, these data suggest that the invasion of an ERV-like sequence into proto-<italic>Xist</italic> led first to RNA-based silencing in <italic>cis</italic>. Subsequent mutations in this proto-<italic>Xist</italic> may then have allowed this RNA to localize to and silence distal sites on the X chromosome. The transition from short to long range silencing in <italic>cis</italic> may be a fruitful topic in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (mouse)</td><td>Spen</td><td>RefSeq</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&amp;db=Nucleotide&amp;term=NM_019763&amp;doptcmdl=GenBank&amp;tool=genome.ucsc.edu">NM_019763.2</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (mouse)</td><td>TXY WT and TXY deltaA</td><td>Dr. Edith Heard</td><td>Xist-WT and Xist-deltaA</td><td>Cell lines have a doxycycline inducible Xist gene + / - the A repeat region</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (mouse)</td><td>HATX WT and HATX Spen KO</td><td>Dr. Anton Wutz</td><td>WT, <italic>Spen</italic> KO</td><td>KO cells have a deletion <break/>of the majority of the Spen gene.

Cells were flash-cooled on ice for 10 min, then 1 mM IPTG was added to induce protein expression overnight at 20°C. Cells were harvested, and pellets were frozen and stored at −20°C until purification. All proteins were subject to a 3-column purification protocol; the wild-type buffers were pH 7.5, while the mutant buffers were pH 8.3 due to differences in predicted pI and anticipated solubility requirements. Specifically, one cOmplete EDTA-free EASYpack protease inhibitor tablet (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was added to each cell pellet corresponding to 1 L of growth. The tablet and frozen cell pellet were resuspended in 80 mL of lysis buffer (750 mM KCl, 750 mM NaCl, 1 M urea, 50 mM Tris, 10% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole, 1% triton X-100). The cell slurry was sonicated on ice with a Misonix Sonicator 3000 (Misonix, Farmingdale, NY) for 4–6 total minutes in pulses of 15 s followed by 35 s of rest. Membranes and other cellular debris were sedimented away from soluble protein on a Beckman J2-21 large floor centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Supernatant containing the recombinant protein was incubated with 10 mL of precleared Ni-NTA beads for 10 min at 4°C. Unbound cellular proteins were cleared by gravity flow. Beads were washed twice; once with 150 mL of lysis buffer, and once with 100 mL of modified lysis buffer containing 20 mM imidazole. Protein was then eluted with 50 mL of similar buffer containing 300 mM imidazole. For the washes and elution, beads were resuspended and incubated with the buffer for 10 min prior to gravity flow through. The elution was dialyzed in 4 L of size exclusion column buffer (500 mM urea, 270 mM KCl, 30 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 7% glycerol, 1–2 mM DTT) for about 2 hr at 4°C. 1–2 mL of 1 mg/mL in-house His-ULP1 [Mossessova and Lima, Mol.

Protein precipitate, when present, was pelleted or filtered prior to flowing over the second Ni-NTA column (11 mL beads precleared in column buffer). The Spen fragment flowed through the second Ni column while the His tagged protease and SUMO expression tag were retained on the resin. Flowthrough containing the cleaved Spen construct was concentrated to 2 mL for injection onto the Superdex 200 size exclusion column. Size exclusion fractions are checked for the presence of purified protein by SDS-PAGE.

<italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Gene W Yeo as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Molly Hammell (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Carter et al. demonstrates that SPEN, an RNA binding protein involved in <italic>Xist</italic> interaction, also binds to ERV elements embedded in transcripts. Structurally, ERV elements appear to be similar to the SPEN binding site in <italic>Xist</italic>. The authors provide data that indicate SPEN represses ERV elements in mouse ES cells. Inactivation of SPEN leads to increase in chromatin accessibility, active histone marks and RNA transcription of ERV element-encoded transcripts. The authors identify that RRM3 domain of SPEN is responsible for binding to ERV and insertion of ERV into an A-repeat deficient <italic>Xist</italic> can rescue binding of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA to SPEN, which result in local gene silencing. Overall the paper is an interesting observation that has for the most part rigorous assays that contribute to our understanding of how <italic>Xist</italic> evolved new domains to recruit protein interactors for gene expression control. There are, however, major concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) Can the authors clarify how the chromatin changes observed at ERV genomic loci change upon SPEN depletion in mESCs as there are some inconsistencies. The high expression of the ERV elements in WT ESCs would be expected to reflect open chromatin at these loci. But are these ERVs then repressed normally? The model of RNA recruitment of SPEN to the ERVs can be better explained to account for these inconsistencies. Also, what fraction of the ERVs with altered chromatin marks have associated expressed transcripts and which ones are differentially expressed in SPEN KO cells? Can the authors present the data as standard DEseq-like scatter/volcano plots?</p><p>2) The preference for ERVs, and especially ERV-K's is still unclear. The only thing that links ERVK type TEs to each other is the presence of a lysine-tRNA in the primer binding site (PBS) of those ERV internal sequences. So, given that SPEN is not looking for a specific sequence, but a structure. And, given that SPEN doesn't seem to care about the ERV PBS region, it is difficult to understand why it prefers ERVK elements. Can the authors show that these are structurally different than the other TEs that are not bound? Eg., do they lack the single stranded bubbles associated with SPEN preferred shapes? Or, are these really just following what's expressed at this stage?</p><p>3) The results from the experiments replacing the A-repeat in <italic>Xist</italic> with the ERV sequence needs more clarification. The RIP-PCR data does not appear to demonstrate significant binding of SPEN to ERV-XIST for clone 1 and the CLIP-PCR data in the supplement does not show significance testing and have differing data between the two <italic>Xist</italic> primer pairs. The results regarding the repression of ERV-XIST needs to be clarified. It seems that HDAC1/2 inhibition has the largest effect on derepression, even though SPEN is thought to function through HDAC3 in XCI. Which HDACs might be involved in SPEN recruitment to ERV-XIST? In that same line of inquiry, the authors should explain some inconsistencies. They report SPEN induces silencing of the <italic>Xist</italic> RNA instead of silencing the <italic>Xist</italic>-bound chromosome. This suggests that there is some information that could be useful in the comparisons between which TEs were directly bound in the Clip-seq data, which of them had chromatin-based alterations, and which induced changes at the RNA level. There should have been one summary figure of the genomics data that shows how consistent these are with each other. Perhaps what happens at a locus depends on where SPEN binds (on the LTR promoter elements vs. internally)? Perhaps the number of SPEN binding sites on the locus influences how those transcripts are regulated (as they seem to be hinting at in Figure 6E)? Even if this can't explain why SPEN seems to regulate TEs differently from how it contributes to XCI, these comparisons should be explored.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54508.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) Can the authors clarify how the chromatin changes observed at ERV genomic loci change upon SPEN depletion in mESCs as there are some inconsistencies.

In general, there is low but detectable level of ERV RNA expression in wild type cells. In <italic>Spen</italic> KO cells, some ERV loci gain chromatin access, lose heterochromatic marks, and have elevated RNA expression. These results are consistent with a Spen-mediated surveillance of ERV loci via RNA. We now present this data in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-F. In panels a-c, we show that there are family-specific changes in chromatin accessibility, H2K9me3 modification, and expression of specific subfamilies of transposable element as determined by DESeq2 in <italic>Spen</italic> KO mESCs. In panels d-f, we show the changes in RNA expression and chromatin modification at the sites that gain accessibility in <italic>Spen</italic> KO mESCs. Consistent with the data presented in Figure 2, we demonstrate that sites gaining accessibility in <italic>Spen</italic> KO mESCs show increased RNA expression, increased enhancer-associated marks (H3K27Ac), and decreased repressive marks (H3K9me3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The preference for ERVs, and especially ERV-K's is still unclear.

Or, are these really just following what's expressed at this stage?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise a good point, that Spen’s apparent preference for ERVKs cannot be explained entirely by their belonging to the ERVK family of TEs. We believe that Spen’s specificity for this subset of ERVK subfamilies has at least two components: (i) the developmental stage during ES cell differentiation, and (ii) the structure of the recognition site on the RNA. First, we observed that Spen does not bind to nor repress all ERVKs. Rather, only specific subsets of ERVK families are targeted, notably the ETn family and RLTR9 and 13 (Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1). These subsets of ERVKs have the potential to be expressed in the mESC state, and thus are not as heavily repressed by DNA methylation and other chromatin modifications as other TE families. Thus, they may display some aberrant transcription in mESCs, leading Spen to recognize their RNA products and recruit silencing machinery to silence the locus. Consistent with this idea, we see ectopic occupancy of Oct4, the pluripotency transcription factor on these subsets of ERVKs (Figure 2A, 2B).</p><p>Second, within each of these TE subfamilies we find that the elements with the strongest RRM binding in <italic>Spen</italic> KO mESCs show the highest expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A, B</xref>). Despite these TE families being highly expressed, there are other TE families that show high expression but low Spen binding, suggesting that structural features in TE RNAs also contribute to Spen’s ability to recognize them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1C</xref>). It is difficult to assess the structural features of TEs that are not bound by Spen. For Spen-bound TEs, we know the specific Spen binding site from our irCLIP-seq data and can use the sequence in that specific region to assess RNA structure from icSHAPE and RNA folding models. For unbound TEs, the entire length of the ERVK RNA contains many secondary structures (predicted), so it is difficult to assess which regions are appropriate to compare to the Spen binding sites on bound RNAs. Nonetheless, the Spen irCLIP-seq data show that the RRM binding is highly focal within ETnERV and Xist RNAs (Figure 4), which correspond to specific RNA secondary structures with a GC-rich dsRNA regions interspersed with single-stranded RNA bases. This specificity is consistent with the known RNA binding specificity of Spen RRM (Arieti et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2016).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Relationship between expression and Spen RRM binding for ERV RNAs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Scatter plot showing the number of RT stops from irCLIP-seq vs. the expression from RNA-seq for all expressed MMETn-int elements.

First, we observed that expression of <italic>Xist-ERV</italic> was significantly reduced compared to <italic>Xist-WT</italic> or <italic>Xist-</italic>△<italic>A</italic> upon doxycycline treatment and we found that this failure to induce the chimeric <italic>Xist</italic> RNA was due to epigenetic silencing and not genetic changes in the Tet operator in our cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 2D-G). Recent work from Edith Heard’s lab (Zylicz et al., 2019) showed that HDAC3 inhibition partially blocks X chromosome inactivation. Interestingly, they also found that HDAC1/2 inhibition leads to upregulation of transgenic <italic>Xist</italic> through epigenetic derepression. Thus, we tested whether HDAC1/2i or HDAC3i could relieve Spen-mediated silencing of <italic>Xist-ERV</italic>. We found that both HDAC1/2 and HDAC3 relieved Spen-mediated <italic>Xist</italic> repression, and chose to perform functional experiments in the presence of HDAC1/2i, since we knew this would allow expression of our chimeric <italic>Xist</italic> presumably without affecting the ability of this lncRNA to silence the X chromosome which we wished to test. Our data also indicate that Spen and HDAC3 are responsible for <italic>Xist-ERV</italic> mediated gene repression, as the repression is relieved by knock down of Spen and inhibition of HDAC3 (Figure 6D).</p><p>We also wish to clarify the results of the Spen RRM RIP experiments with Xist-ERV clone 1. Even in the presence of HDACi, <italic>Xist-ERV</italic> expression was significantly lower than the expression of <italic>Xist-WT</italic>, making the RIP-qPCR results for this cell line significantly noisier than those obtained with Xist-WT. The results are plotted as the percent of input RNA, and in the case where the input RNA is lowly expressed, this value is inherently noisier. While the result is not statistically significant, this is driven in large part by two outliers (one high and one low, of 6 total). Thus the results for Xist-ERV clone 1 suggest that Spen RRM binds to Xist-ERV and the results from clone 2 show that Spen RRM binding to Xist-ERV is significant.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> and in Figure 6B, we now present the results of the Spen RRM RIP-qPCR experiments excluding the highest and lowest replicates for each sample, including all controls. Due to the low levels of <italic>Xist</italic> expression, the noise in the assay warrants the removal of these outliers, as the experiment is operating at the lower bound of dynamic range. From this analysis, we conclude that the results in Xist-ERV clones 1 and 2 show that the Spen RRMs bind to <italic>Xist-WT</italic> and <italic>Xist-ERV</italic>, but not to <italic>Xist-ΔA</italic>.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Spen RRM RIP-qPCR results with and without outlier correction (related to Figure 6b).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) RIP-qPCR for Xist and ActB in Xist-WT, Xist-ΔA, and Xist-ERV clones 1 and 2 mESCs. qRT-PCR values are normalized to input samples.

The reason that these panels did not have significance indicated is that they were performed with technical but not biological replicates. We opted to perform more experiments (n=6 biological replicates) for the RIP-qPCR instead of the CLIP-qPCR, so we have chosen to remove the CLIP-qPCR results from the manuscript. We don’t believe this affects the results presented in Figure 6.</p><p>Regarding the mechanism by which Spen silences target loci, we believe that our results are consistent with a model in which Spen recognizes and binds certain transcripts, including ERV-derived transcripts, recruits silencing machinery, including HDACs, and silences the promoter. We provide the list of altered loci with each assay in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. This model is consistent with our results at ERVs as well as our results in the context of the <italic>Xist-ERV</italic> chimeric RNA.</p><p>The matter of the overlap between ERVKs bound by Spen RRMs (irCLIP-seq) and the ERVKs that become de-repressed at the level of chromatin modifications and RNA expression is complex. We find consistently that the sites that change at the chromatin and RNA level belong to specific subsets of ERVKs including ETns, and we found that these ERVK subfamilies are also bound by Spen RRMs in multiple cell lines and conditions (Spen FL and RRM-FLAG). However, we find very little overlap between the specific genomic loci that change in accessibility and produce RRM-bound transcripts (1/288 sites that gain accessibility). We believe that this is likely due to differences in when these experiments were performed and the passage of the cells used. For the irCLIP-seq experiments, cells had to be expanded, infected with RRM-FLAG viruses and subcloned. Thus, if Spen’s recognition of ETns and other ERVKs is consistent, but the source of these aberrant expressed ETns in the genome is dynamic, the results are consistent with what we observe. Unfortunately, for technical reasons, these experiments were performed multiple passages apart.</p><p>A fascinating mystery of the X inactivation field is how <italic>Xist</italic> itself can be expressed from the inactive X chromosome when this lncRNA is recruiting multiple powerful gene silencing complexes. This duality of potent expression on the inactive X while silencing the remainder of the chromosome is an evolved function of the modern lncRNA. In the context of wild type <italic>Xist</italic>, Spen is able to bind to <italic>Xist</italic> and spread across the chromosome in order to silence distal gene promoters. We found that <italic>Xist-ERV</italic>, our model of a proto-Xist lncRNA, mainly executes cis silencing of its own locus. This implies that additional features are missing in <italic>Xist-ERV</italic>. We agree with the reviewer that the number or quality of RNASpen interaction may determine the difference between local vs. distant gene silencing. It is also worth recalling that <italic>Xist</italic> A-repeat interacts with m6A modification machinery (WTAP, RBM15) as well as RNF20 (Chu et al., 2015; Patil et al., 2016). Some of these interactions are likely missing in <italic>Xist-ERV</italic>. Very recently it was suggested that <italic>Xist</italic> A-repeat has transcriptional anti-terminator activity (Lee et al., 2020), that allows <italic>Xist</italic> RNA to be transcribed in the face of regulatory factors that normally terminate transcription. We believe that solving this longstanding mystery in the field is beyond the scope of the present work, and respectfully suggest our work has clarified the distinct functions that may be gained by a lncRNA when it exapts an endogenous retroviral element.</p></body></sub-article></article>
