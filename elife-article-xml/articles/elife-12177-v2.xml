mediates cellular entry of Ebola virus. Cholesterol export is inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of U18666A, a cationic sterol. To identify the target of U18666A, we synthesized <bold>U-X</bold>, a U18666A derivative with a benzophenone that permits ultraviolet-induced crosslinking.

Crosslinking was prevented by point mutation in the sterol-sensing domain (SSD) of NPC1, but not by point mutation in the N-terminal domain (NTD). These data suggest that the SSD contains a U18666A-inhibitable site required for cholesterol export distinct from the cholesterol-binding site in the NTD. Inasmuch as inhibition of Ebola requires 100-fold higher concentrations of U18666A, the high affinity U16888A-binding site is likely not required for virus entry.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12177.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12177.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12177.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cholesterol is a type of fat molecule and is a vital component of animal cell membranes. It is taken up into cells within particles called low density lipoproteins (LDLs) that are then digested in cell compartments known as lysosomes to release the cholesterol. Then, the cholesterol leaves the lysosome with the help of a transport protein called NPC1. Mutations in the gene that encodes NPC1 lead to the accumulation of cholesterol in lysosomes; this can cause a devastating illness that affects the brain, liver and other organs. The NPC1 protein also plays a crucial role in allowing Ebola viruses to infect animal cells and multiply.</p><p>U18666A is a drug that blocks the movement of cholesterol out of lysosomes and also inhibits Ebola virus infections, but it was not known what components it targets in cells. Lu et al. used a technique called ultraviolet-induced crosslinking to identify the proteins that U18666A can bind to. The experiments show that U18666A can directly bind to a site that is within a section of the NPC1 protein called the sterol-sensing domain. The binding of U18666A to this site blocks the movement of cholesterol out of lysosomes.</p><p>Lu et al.’s findings indicate that the sterol-sensing domain of NPC1 plays a crucial role in cholesterol’s export from lysosomes.

First, mutations in NPC1 underlie Niemann-Pick C disease, a devastating lysosomal storage disease in which accumulation of cholesterol in lysosomes causes abnormalities in brain, liver, lung, and other tissues, leading to death in the teenage years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pentchev, 2004</xref>). Second, NPC1 is the receptor that permits cellular entry of the RNA genomes of lethal Ebola virus, Marburg virus, and other filoviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carette et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Côté et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we use the term ‘lysosome’ in its inclusive sense to encompass late endosomes where NPC1 may also function. NPC1 mediates the egress of cholesterol that has entered lysosomes through the receptor-mediated endocytosis of low density lipoprotein (LDL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liscum et al., 1989</xref>). When cell membranes are depleted of cholesterol, LDL receptors bind circulating LDL, internalize it, and deliver it to lysosomes where acid lipase hydrolyzes the lipoprotein’s cholesteryl esters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown and Goldstein, 1986</xref>). The liberated cholesterol binds to NPC2, a soluble diffusible protein in the lysosome lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sleat et al., 2004</xref>). NPC2 transports the cholesterol to the lysosomal membrane where it transfers its cholesterol to membrane-embedded NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Designated a hydrophobic handoff, this transfer occurs in such a way that hydrophobic cholesterol is shielded from the aqueous environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>NPC1 is an intrinsic membrane protein of 1278 amino acids that contains 13 membrane spanning helices separated by hydrophilic loops and 19 potential N-linked glycosylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies and Ioannou, 2000</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). NPC2 transfers its cholesterol to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of NPC1, which is the hydrophilic sequence of 239 amino acids that projects into the lysosomal lumen after the signal peptide is cleaved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Infante et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2008b</xref>). NPC2 binds to the second luminal loop of NPC1, an event that may precede the cholesterol transfer to the NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deffieu and Pfeffer, 2011</xref>). Mutations that abolish the function of either NPC2 or NPC1 lead to cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes and cause the fatal Niemann-Pick C disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pentchev, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dixit et al., 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12177.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Domain structure of human Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1).</title><p>The predicted topology of the polytopic protein is based on the data of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies and Ioannou (2000)</xref>.

Some of the cholesterol reaches the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it has two actions. First, it binds to Scap, an ER protein that regulates the cleavage and activation of membrane-bound sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). Cholesterol binding to Scap prevents the protease-mediated release and nuclear entry of the active fragment of SREBPs, thereby blocking cholesterol synthesis and uptake from LDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horton et al., 2002</xref>). When excess cholesterol reaches the ER, it is esterified with a long chain fatty acid through the action of acyl-coenzyme A cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), which converts the cholesterol to its storage form as cholesteryl esters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 1975</xref>). Lysosome-derived cholesterol also reaches the plasma membrane where it fills three distinguishable pools, thereby assuring membrane integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Das et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The role of NPC1 in Ebola virus infection was recognized in 2011 through groundbreaking work by two groups. One group identified NPC1 through a haploid mutagenesis screen to detect genes required for Ebola infection in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carette et al., 2011</xref>). The other group identified small molecules that block Ebola infection and used ultraviolet crosslinking to trace their target to NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Côté et al., 2011</xref>). Mutant cells that lack NPC1 were found to resist Ebola virus infection, and infectivity was restored by transfection with a plasmid expressing full length NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carette et al., 2011</xref>). In vitro binding studies demonstrated that an Ebola virus surface glycoprotein binds to luminal loop 2 of NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller et al., 2012</xref>), the same loop that binds to NPC2 (amino acids 373–620). Indeed, Ebola sensitivity was restored when NPC1-deficient Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding only the luminal loop 2 portion of NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller et al., 2012</xref>). The latter data indicate that NPC1 serves only as the passive attachment site for the Ebola glycoprotein and that the presumed cholesterol transport activity of NPC1 is not required.</p><p>A powerful tool for the study of lysosomal cholesterol transport and Ebola virus infectivity is an androstenolone derivative termed U18666A that inhibits three enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cenedella, 2009</xref>). In 1989 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liscum and Faust, 1989</xref>) demonstrated that U18666A has another action: it inhibits the exit of LDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes, thereby creating the equivalent of NPC1 deficiency.</p><p>U18666A is a cationic amphiphile owing to a diethylaminoethyl chain attached to the 3-hydroxyl. Other cationic amphiphiles with very different structures also inhibit cholesterol egress from lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lange et al., 2000</xref>). The structural discrepancies created some confusion as to mechanism of inhibition. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wojtanik and Liscum (2003)</xref> reported that U18666A is more than 100-fold more potent than another cationic amphiphile, imipramine, raising the possibility that U18666A directly inhibits a protein required for lysosomal egress, whereas the low potency amphiphiles may have a nonspecific effect.</p><p>U18666A and other amphiphiles have also been reported to block the cellular entry of Ebola virus RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shoemaker et al., 2013</xref>). However, the concentrations required are in the micromolar range rather than the nanomolar range at which U18666A blocks cholesterol egress, suggesting that U18666A acts through a nonspecific effect on Ebola virus as opposed to its specific effect on cholesterol transport.</p><p>In the current study, we used an unbiased chemical screen to identify a postulated cholesterol transport protein that is inhibited by low concentrations of U18666A. For this purpose, we synthesized <bold>U-X</bold>, a derivative of U18666A that contains a benzophenone moiety that attaches covalently to proteins when exposed to ultraviolet light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gubbens et al., 2009</xref>). The <bold>U-X</bold> compound also contains an alkyne group that allows attachment of fluorophores and other functional elements through click chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kolb et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sapkale et al., 2014</xref>). <bold>U-X</bold> retains the ability to disrupt LDL-mediated cholesterol egress from lysosomes with high affinity. We also synthesized a series of U18666A derivatives that either retain or lose the ability to block lysosomal cholesterol export, and we used these as competitors to assure the specificity of the <bold>U-X</bold> crosslinking reaction. We identified one protein whose U18666A-binding properties matched the requirements for inhibition of cholesterol export, and that protein turned out to be NPC1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows the predicted topology of NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies and Ioannou, 2000</xref>) together with its five known functional domains.

In both assays, we first deplete cells of cholesterol by incubating them in the absence of lipoproteins (i.e., in lipoprotein-deficient serum, LPDS) and the presence of compactin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. We add a low concentration of mevalonate, the product of HMG CoA reductase, to allow the cells to synthesize nonsterol products of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldstein and Brown, 1990</xref>). After 16 hr, we switch the cells to a medium containing lipoproteins in the form of human LDL, fetal calf serum (FCS), or rabbit β-migrating very low density lipoprotein (β-VLDL), all of which deliver cholesterol to lysosomes via the LDL receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goldstein et al., 1983</xref>). For the cholesterol esterification assay, we wait 3–5 hr and then add [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate for 1–2 hr. The cells are harvested and the amount of [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate incorporated into cholesteryl [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate is measured by thin layer chromatography and scintillation counting (see Materials and methods). As a control for nonspecific effects, we also measure the amount of [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate incorporated into [<sup>14</sup>C]triglycerides. This incorporation does not depend upon lipoprotein-derived cholesterol, and it was not affected by any of the manipulations in the current experiments. The values for [<sup>14</sup>C]triglycerides are given in the figure legends.</p><p>The second assay relies on the ability of cholesterol to block the proteolytic cleavage and nuclear localization of SREBP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown and Goldstein, 1997</xref>). Synthesized as an intrinsic protein of ER membranes, SREBP-2 binds immediately to Scap, an escort protein. When the ER membranes are low in cholesterol, the Scap/SREBP-2 complex is transported to the Golgi where the SREBP-2 is cleaved by two proteases, liberating a soluble fragment that translocates to the nucleus. When LDL-derived cholesterol reaches the ER, it binds to Scap and blocks transport of the Scap/SREBP-2 complex to the Golgi. As a result, the amount of nuclear SREBP-2 declines as revealed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows a cholesterol esterification assay in which 10% FCS was used as a source of LDL-cholesterol. U18666A inhibited the incorporation of [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate into LDL-derived cholesterol with high affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). <bold>U-X</bold> retained similar inhibitory activity. On the other hand, compound <bold>A</bold> was nearly 100-fold less active.

These differences in K<sub>i</sub> values between U18666A and <bold>A</bold> indicate the necessity for a correctly positioned dialkylamino group to achieve inhibitory activity. In separate experiments, we showed that U18666A did not block cholesterol esterification when it is stimulated by 25-hydroxycholesterol, which enters cells without traversing lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abi-Mosleh et al., 2009</xref>). We also found that U18666A does not inhibit cholesteryl [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate formation when cholesterol is added to ER membranes in vitro.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12177.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Cholesterol esterification, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 2 processing, and <sup>125</sup>I-LDL (low density lipoprotein) degradation in Chinese Hamster Ovary  (CHO) 7 cells.</title><p>On day 0, CHO-7 cells were set up for experiments in medium A with 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) at a density of 2.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/60-mm dish.

A mutation that changes this proline to serine did not prevent normal localization of NPC1 to lysosomes, but it abolished the cholesterol transport function of NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Watari et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ko et al., 2001</xref>) (also, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Moreover, this mutation was also shown to prevent the crosslinking of [<sup>3</sup>H]azocholesterol to NPC1 in intact cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohgami et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Considered together, the data with the P691S mutant is consistent with the idea that NPC1 contains a second cholesterol-binding site located in the sterol-sensing domain. Cholesterol initially binds to the NTD as demonstrated biochemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Infante et al., 2008b</xref>) and confirmed by X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>). By comparing the structures of sterols bound to NPC2 and NPC1, it was possible to postulate a hydrophobic handoff by which cholesterol moves from NPC2 to NPC1 without encountering the water phase. Mutations predicted to disrupt the interaction of NPC2 with the NTD of NPC1 also disrupt cholesterol exit from lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). The hydrophobic handoff may be facilitated by the binding of NPC2 to the second luminal loop of NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deffieu and Pfeffer, 2011</xref>). This binding may orient NPC2 so that it can transfer cholesterol to the NTD. The current data raise the possibility that cholesterol may move in relay fashion from the NTD to a second binding site in the sterol-sensing domain. This second site may play a role in transferring cholesterol across the lysosomal membrane. It may lack the exquisite specificity of the NTD, and it may bind U18666A and other cationic amphiphiles that thereby block cholesterol egress from lysosomes.</p><p>The postulated cholesterol-binding site in the sterol-sensing domain may require proper membrane orientation in order to bind. Although <bold>U-X</bold> crosslinks to NPC1 in intact cells, so far we have been unable to crosslink <bold>U-X</bold> to purified NPC1 in detergent solution. Moreover, our previous studies indicated that the NTD contains the only site that binds [<sup>3</sup>H]cholesterol in detergent. Thus, a single point mutation in the NTD (Q79A) abolished [<sup>3</sup>H]cholesterol binding to full length NPC1 when the protein was purified in detergents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Infante et al., 2008a</xref>). We are currently attempting to reconstitute purified NPC1 into phospholipid bilayers to find conditions that retain the proper membrane orientation, allowing the binding of <bold>U-X</bold> as well as [<sup>3</sup>H]cholesterol.</p><p>It is unlikely that binding to the sterol-sensing domain constitutes the mechanism by which U18666A inhibits Ebola virus infection. According to published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shoemaker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carette et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller et al., 2012</xref>), this inhibition requires concentrations of U18666A (~3–12 µM) that are several orders of magnitude higher than are required to block cholesterol transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Moreover, Ebola infection does not require the sterol-sensing domain of NPC1. The second luminal loop of NPC1 is sufficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller et al., 2012</xref>). The data raise the possibility that high concentrations of cationic amphiphiles may interact at low affinity with luminal loop 2 of NPC1, thereby blocking virus infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>We obtained U18666A, Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), CuSO<sub>4</sub>, Tris-HCl, NaCl, FCS, chloroquine, biotin, thiourea, and Benzonase Nuclease from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; [1-<sup>14</sup>C]oleic acid (55 mCi/mmol) from Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA; Zeocin and pcDNA3.1/Zeo(-) from Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY; and FuGENE HD from Promega, Madison, WI.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by the Reviewing Editor and Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This outstanding paper uses a combination of chemical and cell biological approaches to identify NPC1 as the target of U18666A, an inhibitor of lysosomal cholesterol export and ebola virus infection. The reviewers were in agreement that the work was convincing and of broad interest and offered only relatively minor suggestions for the authors' consideration.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) In previous work, the authors concluded that NPC1 has only one binding site for cholesterol, in the N-terminal domain.

Mass spectroscopy on hydrophobic polytopic membrane proteins is notoriously difficult. Because of the limited coverage of the hydrophobic peptides, we were unable to identify unambiguously a peptide that dropped out when crosslinked or a novel peptide that appeared in the crosslinked material.</p><p><italic>2) That U18666A does not bind N-terminal domain mutants is not a surprise (but a nice experiment) as the structure of the compound would not be predicted to bind there.
