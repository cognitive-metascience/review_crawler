(SRTFs) control the ultimate transcriptional output of signaling pathways. Here, we examined a family of FGF-induced SRTFs – <italic>Etv1</italic>, <italic>Etv 4</italic>, and <italic>Etv 5</italic> – in murine lens development. Contrary to FGF receptor mutants that displayed loss of ERK signaling and defective cell differentiation, <italic>Etv</italic> deficiency augmented ERK phosphorylation without disrupting the normal lens fiber gene expression. Instead, the transitional zone for lens differentiation was shifted anteriorly as a result of reduced Jag1-Notch signaling. We also showed that Etv proteins suppresses mTOR activity by promoting <italic>Tsc2</italic> expression, which is necessary for the nuclei clearance in mature lens. These results revealed the functional divergence between Etv and FGF in lens development, demonstrating that these SRTFs can operate outside the confine of their upstream signaling.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many cells contain proteins known as signal-induced transcription factors, which are poised to receive messages from the environment and then react by activating genes required for the cell to respond appropriately. It is commonly thought that these transcription factors faithfully follow the instructions they receive from the external signal: for instance, if the message was to encourage the cell to grow, the transcription factors would switch on growth-related genes.</p><p>As the eyes of mice and other mammals develop, a signal known as FGF is required for certain cells to specialize into lens fiber cells: these long, thin, transparent cells form the bulk of the lens, the structure that allows focused vision. Previous studies suggest that FGF activates three transcription factors known as Etv1, Etv4 and Etv5, but their precise roles in the development of the lens has remained unclear.</p><p>Here, Garg, Hannan, Wang et al. confirm that FGF signaling does indeed activate all three proteins. However, mutant mice that lacked Etv1, Etv4 and Etv5 still created lens fiber cells, suggesting that the transcription factors are largely unnecessary for lens fiber cells formation.</p><p>Instead, the Etv proteins participated in a cascade of molecular events involving a protein called Notch; as a result, if the transcription factors were absent, the lens fiber cells formed prematurely. In addition, deactivating Etv1, Etv4 and Etv5 also promoted the activity of a protein which interfered with the removal of internal cell compartments, a process required for lens fiber cells to mature properly. These findings reveal that the roles of Etv1, Etv4 and Etv5 deviate from and even oppose FGF signaling in the lenses of mice.</p><p>Transcription factors control the ultimate fate of a cell, and there is therefore increased interest in targeting them for therapy. The work by Garg, Hannan, Wang et al. reveals an unexpected complexity in how these proteins respond to upstream signals, highlighting the importance of further dissecting these relationships.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>FGF</kwd><kwd>ETS</kwd><kwd>PEA3</kwd><kwd>Notch</kwd><kwd>mTOR</kwd><kwd>lens development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY017061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY025933</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Jules and Doris Stein Research to Prevent Blindness Professorship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009784</institution-id><institution>Starr Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garg</surname><given-names>Ankur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Qian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The FGF-induced Etv transcription factors operate outside the confines of upstream signaling in lens development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cell signaling networks are commonly depicted in a hierarchical manner, starting with the binding of extracellular ligands to cell surface receptors, followed by the relay of cytoplasmic mediators, and culminating in the activation of nuclear transcription factors. In this unidirectional view, each signal-regulated transcription factor (SRTF) is expected to control a subset of the transcriptional output of upstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cvekl and Zhang, 2017</xref>). This model has been confirmed in many systems. For example, the transcriptomic changes induced by BMP, Hedgehog and Wnt signaling can be readily accounted for by their transcription effectors Smad, Gli and β-catenin, respectively. However, whether this principle applies to the SRTFs for FGF signaling remains to be determined.</p><p>The 28 mammalian E26 transformation-specific (ETS) proteins share a highly conserved winged helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain, which recognizes a core GGA sequence motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charlot et al., 2010</xref>). Post-translational modifications of these factors, especially serine/threonine phosphorylation by ERK, directly affect their subcellular localization, DNA binding and transactivation. In particular, FGF-ERK signaling induces expression of the <italic>Etv</italic> (<italic>Pea3</italic>) subfamily of ETS transcription factors, <italic>Etv1</italic> (<italic>Er81</italic>), <italic>Etv4</italic> (<italic>Pea3</italic>) and <italic>Etv5</italic> (<italic>Erm</italic>), in addition to enhancing their transcriptional activities during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Münchberg and Steinbeisser, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Raible and Brand, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roehl and Nüsslein-Volhard, 2001</xref>). Conditional knockouts of these <italic>Etv</italic> genes disrupted the anterior-posterior patterning of the limb bud and branching morphogenesis of the lacrimal gland controlled by FGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). The significance of <italic>Etv</italic> factors have also been demonstrated in studies of human cancer, where aberrant activation of <italic>ETV</italic> genes has been proposed to emulate oncogenic <italic>RAS</italic> in cellular transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hollenhorst et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the <italic>Etv</italic> transcription factors <italic>Etv1</italic>, <italic>Etv4</italic> and <italic>Etv5</italic> are considered to be SRTFs that are directly downstream of FGF-Ras-ERK signaling.</p><p>FGF signaling is required during several steps of vertebrate lens development, including induction of the lens vesicle, proliferation of lens epithelial cells, and differentiation of lens fiber cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cvekl and Zhang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Faber et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Robinson, 2006</xref>). The mature lens consists of a single layer of epithelial cells in the anterior and differentiated lens fiber cells in the posterior; the latter accounts for the bulk of the lens tissue. FGF signaling has been proposed to act in a gradient fashion, promoting proliferation in the lens epithelium at low signaling strength and stimulating differentiation in the lens fiber cells at high strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lovicu and McAvoy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McAvoy and Chamberlain, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McAvoy et al., 1991</xref>). In support of this model, genetic knockouts of FGF receptors disrupted the expression of lens-specific genes <italic>Maf</italic>, <italic>Prox1</italic>, <italic>Pax6</italic>, <italic>Cdh1</italic> and <italic>Crystallins</italic>, affecting survival and proliferation of lens epithelial cells and elongation of fiber cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chow et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garcia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Robinson et al., 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Apart from FGF receptors, their co-receptors heparan sulphates and downstream mediators Frs2, Shp2, and Crk have also been demonstrated to regulate lens cell differentiation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Madakashira et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qu et al., 2011</xref>). The knockout phenotypes of these genes were reproduced by overexpression of negative regulators of FGF-ERK pathway, <italic>Sef</italic> and <italic>Sprouty</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Newitt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shin et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, transgenic overexpression of <italic>Fgf1</italic> or <italic>Fgf3</italic> resulted in premature differentiation of lens epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Robinson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robinson et al., 1995b</xref>), whereas over-activation of FGF signaling as a result of <italic>Nf1</italic> and <italic>Spry1/2</italic> deletion disrupted lens induction and lens fiber cell differentiation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carbe and Zhang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kuracha et al., 2011</xref>). These results demonstrated that the FGF signaling cascade is critical for lens development, but the direct downstream transcriptional effectors of FGF signaling were not well understood.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the role of <italic>Etv</italic> family transcription factors in the lens by genetically ablating <italic>Etv1</italic>, <italic>Etv4,</italic> and <italic>Etv5</italic>. Instead of the delayed cell differentiation phenotype expected from FGF signaling deficiency, we observed that the lens epithelial cells differentiated prematurely as a result of reduced Notch signaling. On the other hand, the expression of FGF targets <italic>Maf</italic> and <italic>Crystallins</italic> were largely preserved in <italic>Etv1/4/5</italic> mutant lenses. We also showed that mTOR signaling was aberrantly upregulated, resulting in the failure of nuclei removal in the mature lenses. These results revealed the critical differences between the function of Etv family transcription factors and FGF signaling during lens development, demonstrating that these SRTFs can operate outside the confine of upstream signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MAPK-regulated Etv transcription factors are required for lens development</title><p>Previous studies have shown that Etv transcription factors are controlled by FGF signaling during embryonic development.

In <italic>Pax6<sup>Le</sup>-Cre; Etv1<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Etv4<sup>-/-</sup>; Etv5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> embryos (<italic>Etv</italic> TKO), the lens induction and lens vesicle formation were unaffected, but the lens size was reduced at E14.5 as shown by Hematoxylin and Eosin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and E</xref>).

On the other hand, the transcript level of <italic>Spry2</italic>, an inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases, was also reduced, which we confirmed by RNA in situ hybridization in <italic>Etv</italic> TKO mutant lenses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and F</xref>, arrows).

It was previously reported that FGF signaling controls the expression of <italic>αA-crystallin</italic> (<italic>Cryaa</italic>) in the lens cells via <italic>Etv5</italic> and <italic>Maf</italic>; the latter also contains Etv-binding sites in its regulatory region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xie et al., 2016</xref>).

Indeed, combined deletion of <italic>Erk1</italic>(<italic>Mapk3</italic>) and <italic>Erk2</italic>(<italic>Mapk1</italic>) resulted in a drastic reduction in lens size as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xie et al., 2016</xref>). However, Maf, α- and γ-crystallins mRNA and protein were still expressed in <italic>Erk</italic> CKO mutant lenses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K–O</xref>).

In the severely diminished <italic>Mek</italic> CKO mutant lenses, we again failed to detect significant reduction in the intensity of Maf, α- and γ-crystallins staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4P–T</xref>). Therefore, genetic ablation of Erk and Etv transcription factors did not abolish lens differentiation as in FGF receptor mutants.</p><p>The phenotypic dichotomy between <italic>Fgfr</italic> and <italic>Etv</italic> mutants raised the question whether Etv transcription factors play any role in the FGF-induced lens fiber differentiation. To address this issue, we took a gain-of-function approach to test the genetic epistasis between Etv and FGF signaling. As we and others have previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Robinson et al., 1998</xref>), the lens-specific overexpression of <italic>Fgf3</italic> in <italic>Fgf3<sup>OVE391</sup></italic> transgenic animals greatly elevated ERK phosphorylation in the lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Consistent with regulation of <italic>Etv</italic> and <italic>Spry2</italic> by ERK signaling we showed above, this led to increased expression of <italic>Etv1</italic>, <italic>Etv4</italic>, <italic>Etv5</italic> and <italic>Spry2</italic> in the <italic>Fgf3<sup>OVE391</sup></italic> lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), which was accompanied by ectopic induction of Maf and γ-crystallin but loss of E-cadherin in Pax6-positive anterior lens epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,J and N</xref>, arrows). We hypothesized that if Etv is required for FGF signaling to promote lens differentiation, then blocking Etv activity should prevent the <italic>Fgf3</italic>-overexpression phenotype. Since it was cumbersome to use the triple knockout of <italic>Etv1/4/5</italic> to generate compound mutants for the genetic epistasis experiments, we employed the <italic>R26<sup>EtvEnR</sup></italic> allele, which can be induced to express an Etv4 fusion protein linked to the Engrailed repressor domain (EtvEnR) after Cre-mediated excision of a transcriptional STOP cassette. This was previously shown to act as a dominant negative protein to suppress the activities of endogenous Etv transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mao et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with this, <italic>Pax6<sup>Le</sup>-Cre;R R26<sup>EtvEnR</sup></italic> lenses were reduced in size like those of <italic>Etv</italic> TKO mutants, while the expression of E-cadherin, Maf and γ-crystallin was maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,K,O and Q</xref>).

Therefore, inhibition of Etv transcriptional activities prevented FGF signaling from inducing ectopic expression of the fiber-specific genes in the lens epithelium.

Contrary to the defective lens differentiation found in FGF signaling mutants, deletion of <italic>Etv</italic> genes did not prevent the expression of lens fiber genes in normal development.

Moreover, <italic>Etv</italic> mutations led to an increase in the activity of ERK and mTOR signaling, with the latter responsible for the abnormal retention of the nuclei in the adult lens. Therefore, unlike BMP, Hedgehog and Wnt signaling that command their downstream signal-regulated transcription factors (SRTFs) as faithful effectors, ETV transcription factors activated by FGF signaling can oppose the intended function of the pathway.</p><p>Our study of <italic>Etv</italic> mutants in lens development has revealed several important features of <italic>Etv</italic> function that deviate from the expected role of a faithful executor for FGF signaling. First, deletion of <italic>Etv</italic> caused significant derangement of ERK signaling, which is the main intracellular pathway activated by FGF. Contrary to the loss of ERK activity in mutants lacking either FGF receptors or downstream mediators Frs2 and Shp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>Etv-</italic>deficient lenses displayed elevated ERK signaling, which was evident in the increased level of ERK phosphorylation and expression of ERK early response genes <italic>Egr1</italic> and <italic>Fos</italic>. This was likely due to reduced expression of ERK inhibitor <italic>Spry2</italic>, which has been shown to be a direct transcriptional target of Etv (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yan et al., 2013</xref>). In support of this, deletions of <italic>Spry</italic> genes have been found to result in upregulation of ERK signaling in a wide variety of tissues, including the lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kuracha et al., 2011</xref>). The aberrant ERK activation in <italic>Etv</italic> mutants may stimulate downstream targets normally silenced by loss of FGF signaling, inducing further compensatory changes that rewire the signaling network. It underscores the intricate role of Etv in stabilizing the intracellular signaling activated by FGF.</p><p>The second distinction of <italic>Etv</italic> mutants compared to FGF receptor knockouts is the relatively normal lens differentiation. This was unexpected because a previous study shown that both lens differentiation genes <italic>Maf</italic> and <italic>Cryaa</italic> were under direct control of Etv transcription factors in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xie et al., 2016</xref>). We presented three lines of evidence in support of our conclusion. First, we performed RNA sequencing, RNA in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry in <italic>Etv</italic> mutant lenses, none of which showed significant reduction in the expression of <italic>Maf</italic> and <italic>Cryaa</italic>. Second, we generated lens-specific knockouts of <italic>Erk1/2</italic>, which we showed to be required for <italic>Etv</italic> expression. Even in these ERK signaling mutants, we still observed expression of <italic>Maf</italic> and <italic>Cryaa</italic>. Of note, the previous study observed that immunostaining for α-crystallin and Maf were severely reduced or even absent in the <italic>Erk1/2</italic> knockout lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xie et al., 2016</xref>). It is not clear what caused the phenotypic discrepancy between ours and the previous study, which could be due to a difference in the genetic background of the animal models or the source of antibodies. It should be noted that γ-crystallin expression appeared to move posteriorly in both <italic>Etv</italic> and <italic>Erk</italic> knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,M and R</xref>), which may reflect a slight delay of lens fiber terminal differentiation. Nevertheless, even knockout of ERK kinase <italic>Mek</italic> still failed to abolish <italic>Maf</italic> and <italic>Cryaa</italic> expression. In the third approach, we explored the role of Etv in a gain-of-function setting, showing that inhibition of <italic>Etv</italic> indeed blocked ectopic FGF from stimulating Maf and γ-crystallin expression in the lens epithelium. This result suggests an intrinsic difference between normal differentiation at the lens equator and ectopic differentiation in the lens epithelium, which may be shaped by their unique microenvironment and different dosage of FGF signaling. Taken together, our results demonstrate that <italic>Etv</italic> genes are dispensable for FGF-induced cell differentiation under the physiological condition during lens development.</p><p>Genetic ablation of <italic>Etv</italic> also differed from inactivation of FGF signaling in its impact on the transitional zone of cell differentiation, which was shifted anteriorly after <italic>Etv</italic> deletion and posteriorly in FGF signaling mutants. We recently showed that FGF plays a dual role in specifying the location of the transitional zone by regulating the timing of lens differentiation; FGF directly promotes differentiation of lens fiber cells, but it also cooperates with PDGF to restrain differentiation of the lens progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2019</xref>). The latter is mediated by Jag1, which induces Notch signaling in the anterior lens epithelium to suppress progenitor cell differentiation. In the current study, we determined that Jag1 expression is under the direct control of Etv transcription factors and ERK, delineating a complete molecular cascade that connects FGF to Notch signaling. In the absence of <italic>Etv</italic>, loss of Notch signaling leads to premature differentiation of lens progenitor cells indicated by Foxe3 and Prox1 expression, but the pattern of Crystallin expressions are unchanged. This suggests the terminal differentiation of lens fibers may be slightly delayed relative to onset of progenitor cells differentiation. Nevertheless, <italic>Etv</italic> mutants proceed to express <italic>Crystallin</italic> genes at the comparable level as wild-type controls, which is in sharp contrast to the loss of γ-crystallin expression in FGF receptor mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, Etv mediates the anti-differentiation function of FGF to activate Notch signaling but it is largely dispensable for the pro-differentiation aspect of FGF signaling.</p><p>Lastly, our study showed that <italic>Etv</italic> deficiency augmented mTOR phosphorylation. This is likely caused by reduced expression of <italic>Tsc2</italic>, a negative regulator of mTOR. Indeed, we also observed significant increase in phosphorylation of S6 and 4EBP1, two downstream targets of mTOR. Importantly, we observed aberrant retention of the lens fiber cell nuclei in postnatal <italic>Etv</italic> mutants, which was mimicked by deletion of Tsc2 partner Tsc1 in the lens. Previous studies have shown that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin promotes degradation of the organelle in chick lens explants although the exact mechanism remained controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morishita and Mizushima, 2016</xref>). Our study provides the in vivo evidence that mTOR is indeed an important regulator of organelle removal in lens maturation.</p><p>Taken together, our genetic study firmly establishes <italic>Etv</italic> family transcription factors as SRTFs for FGF signaling in lens development. SRTFs constitute a special class of transcription factors that relay intracellular signals to shape the cellular transcriptome, which ultimately determines the identity and status of the cell. Although many SRTFs have proven to be faithful to their upstream signaling, we showed that <italic>Etv</italic> transcription factors deviate or even oppose the function of FGF-ERK signaling in the lens. This is likely because, unlike other signaling pathways such as BMP, Hedgehog and Wnt that rely on a single downstream effector, FGF signaling can induce multiple transcription factors. This generates diversity among the FGF SRTFs that may evolve to acquire their unique or even opposing functions, which fine tunes the overall transcriptional response. The three <italic>PEA3/ETV</italic> genes and <italic>ERG</italic> are the only <italic>ETS</italic> genes implicated in tumorigenesis, which has been attributed to their ability to mimic the oncogenic effect of Ras signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hollenhorst et al., 2011</xref>). Our previous work in lacrimal gland development has indeed found that deletion of <italic>Etv</italic> transcription factors largely reproduced the phenotype of FGF-ERK mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garg et al., 2018</xref>). In the lens, however, our current study paints a more complex picture of Etv activity, suggesting that their functions deviate considerably from their upstream FGF signaling. As transcription factors attract increasing interests as viable therapeutic targets, it will be important to elucidate the context-dependent function of these SRTFs in development and diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Primary antibody incubation was performed overnight at 4°C in humid chamber followed by incubation with florescent-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature in dark. The following primary antibodies were used: Pax6 (PRB-278P), Prox1 (PRB-238C) (both from Covance, Berkeley, CA), E-cadherin (U3254, Sigma, St Louis, Missouri), Maf (sc-7866), Foxe3 (sc-377465), Jag1 (sc-8303) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Lamin A/C (ab133256, Abcam), pHH3 (06-570, Millpore), phospho-4EBP1 (#2855). phospho-S6 (#5364), phospho-Akt (D9E), phospho-Erk (#4370), phospho-mTOR (#5536), Cyclin D1 (#55506), Notch1-ICD (# 4147) (all from Cell signaling Technology). Antibodies against α- and γ-crystallins were kindly provided by Dr. Sam Zigler (National Eye Institute). For Notch1-ICD antibody staining, samples were paraffin embedded, sectioned and followed by antigen retrieval for 20 min in a pressure cooker. To detect phospho-Erk, phospho-mTOR, phospho-S6, phospho-4EBP1 and NICD, HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and Tyramide signal amplification kit (Perkin Elemer) were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Quantification of lens phenotype</title><p>The perimeters of the anterior epithelial layer and posterior fiber cells were measured using ImageJ and the ratio was calculated for control and mutant lenses. To quantify the nuclei degradation, the lenses were stained with nuclear markers DAPI and Lamin A/C. The number of nuclei within a concentric circle of the lens at the half of the lens radius were counted. For statistical analysis, at least three embryos of each genotype were taken and two lens sections at the equatorial plane per embryo were analyzed. The statistical significance was calculated by one-way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>TUNEL assay</title><p>TUNEL assays were performed on 10-μm paraffin sections following the manufacturer's instructions in the Fluoroscein In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Apoptosis rates were calculated as the ratio of TUNEL-positive cells to DAPI-positive cells in control and mutant samples, and results were analyzed by t-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>EdU incorporation assay</title><p>Pregnant females were injected with EdU (ab146186, Abcam) dissolved in DMSO at the dosage of 50 mg/kg body weight. After 2 hr, the mice were sacrificed and embryos collected for cryosection. For EdU detection, the Click-IT EdU Imaging Kit (C10337, Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The proliferation rates in the lens epithelium were calculated as the ratios of EdU-positive cells to DAPI-positive cells within the epithelium and the statistical significances between controls and mutants were evaluated by t-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RNA in situ hybridization</title><p>Section in situ hybridization was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carbe et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, the cryoblocks were sectioned at 10 μm and hybridized with diluted probes (1:500) at 65°C overnight. The sections were washed 3X with wash buffer at 65°C for 30 min, followed by 2X wash with MABT for 30 min. The sections were then blocked with blocking buffer for 1 hr at room temperature, followed by incubation with anti-DIG antibody (1:1500) overnight at 4°C. Next, the slides were washed 4X with MABT for 20 min and 2X alkaline phosphatase buffer for 10 min, before incubating with BM purple for colorimetric reaction for 24 hrs at room temperature. The following probes were used: <italic>Pea3</italic>, <italic>Erm5</italic> (from Dr. Bridget Hogan, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA), <italic>Er81</italic> (from Dr. Gord Fishell, New York University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA), <italic>Fgfr1</italic> and <italic>Fgfr3</italic> (from Suzanne Mansour, University of Utah, Salt Lake city, UT) and <italic>Sprouty2</italic> (from Gail Martin, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Laser capture micro-dissection and gene expression profiling</title><p>Freshly harvested embryos were frozen in OCT medium (Sakura Finetek), sectioned at 10 μm thickness and transferred to PEN slides (Ziess). To fix and stain the slides, they were dipped in 95% ethanol for 2 min to fix the samples, stained with crystal violet stain (3% in ethanol) on ice. The slides were then rigorously washed in 2 X 70% ethanol for 30-40 s to remove the OCT and dehydrated in 100% ethanol for 2 min. For control and <italic>Etv</italic> mutant embryos, the lens tissue was micro-dissected from the transitional zone using Laser capture microscope (Zeiss AxioObserver.Z1 inverted microscope). The RNA was extracted using Qiagen Micro Plus kit. Conversion to cDNA and amplification were performed using Clontech SMART-seq v4 Ultra low input RNA kit and the cDNA library construction was performed using Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit by the core facility at Columbia university prior to RNA sequencing. The RNAseq data are available from the GEO repository (GSE137215). Normalization and differential gene expression analysis for RNA-seq data were performed using De-Seq package in R studio. The GSEA analysis was performed using JavaGSEA desktop software from Broad Institute.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cell culture and western blot</title><p>Immortalized lens cells were authenticated by immunostaining with lens markers and confirmed to be free of mycoplasma contamination as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2019</xref>). They were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and L-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin. After serum starved for 24 hr, cells were subject to FGF2 (50 ng/ml) stimulation, with or without Mek inhibitor U0126 (50 μM), PD0325901 (50 μM) or PI3K inhibitor LY (50 μM) for the indicated time periods, and harvested in CelLytic-M lysis buffer (Sigma) with proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo fisher). Protein lysates were collected following centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min and resuspended in SDS buffer. Equal amounts of total protein were loaded for western blot analysis and visualized using an Odyssey SA scanner (LICOR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Antibodies used were Jagged1 (H-114, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Notch1 (#4380, Cell signaling Technology), phospho-ERK1/2 (sc-7383, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ERK (#4695, Cell signaling Technology).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation</title><p>The Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed in immortalized lens cells as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2019</xref>).

previously unappreciated aspects of lens development.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Ivan Topisirovic as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kathryn Cheah as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript seeks to determine the role of Etv factors in lens development and establish the underpinning signaling mechanisms. Presented data support potential role of Etv 1, 4 and 5 in lens development, whereby the functional divergence between the latter factors and FGF is proposed. Notwithstanding that mouse genetics and the number of characterized phenotypes were found to be impressive, several important concerns were raised regarding interpretation of corresponding signaling perturbations.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The focus of this article is to examine the roles of Etv1, Etv4, and Etv5 in lens development using Etv triple knockdown (Etv TKO) mice. Data are provided showing that Mek/Erk signaling dictates expression of Etv1, 4 and 5 in the transitional zone of the lens whereby Etv TKO mice exhibit alterations in lens development. Based on genome-wide steady-state mRNA analysis and subsequent genetic approaches, the authors suggest the model whereby downregulation of Spry2 leads to inhibition of Fgfr and Erk signaling. Moreover, in the Etv TKO background, Jagged1/Notch1 signaling is attenuated, while Tsc2 is downregulated leading to sustained mTORC1 activity. Overall, this manuscript is well written and of potential interest. Several issues were however observed. The major concern was that proposed signaling mechanisms were open to alternative interpretations and/or founded on data that were deemed to be too preliminary. It was concluded that these issues should be addressed to sufficiently support authors' conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Based on apparent complexity of the interplay between FGF and ERK signaling in Etv TKO lenses, several issues were raised considering data interpretation. To this end, although Etv loss resulted in Spry2 downregulation, it also decreased the expression of FGFR1 and 3. Considering that these events are expected to have an opposing effect on FGF signaling, it is important to examine how Fgfr1/Fgfr3 mRNA expression is spatially decreased in Etv TKO lens. Does decreased expression of Fgfr1 and 3 occur across the lens area or is it limited to the transitional zone? The authors should also discuss why fgfr1 and 3 reduction does not affect increase in phospho-ERK levels in Etv TKO. Finally, to corroborate claims regarding potential Etv-Fgf feedback, the authors should determine Spry2 levels in Erk-CKO and Mek-CKO lenses.</p><p>2) Better characterization of Etv TKO phenotypes is warranted. For example, the assumption that Fgfr loss result in same phenotypes as ablation of Mek and Erk was found to be inadequate, as pathways other than Mek/Erk also mediate the effects of Fgfr, while factors other than FGF can trigger Mek/Erk signaling. Accordingly, Fgfr mutants present with the smaller lens that appears as a vesicle with impaired primary fiber elongation, while the Mek/Erk mutants do not present this lumen. In addition, although Fgfr mutants cause effects similar to Sef overexpression in lens, they do not exactly mirror Spry2 mutants. It was also found that the statement that Etv mutants continue to express fiber-specific crystallin genes, while the Fgfr mutants do not, is not sufficiently substantiated by the data. The authors should therefore reconsider their conclusions as their data convincingly points on to the Erk1/2- Etv link, and not to direct connection to Fgfr signaling. Finally, considering the multitude of MAPKs, the authors should specify that they are monitoring Erk throughout the manuscript.</p><p>3) To further strengthen the role of Spry2 downregulation in Etv TKO lens phenotypes, the authors should also determine expression of Etv 1, 4 and 5 and Spry2 in Fgf3(OVE391) lenses. More specifically, the levels of Etv 1, 4 and 5 and Spry2 in anterior lens epithelium in Fgf3(OVE391) mice should be determined. Also, is Spry2 downregulated in anterior lens epithelium of Fgf3(OVE391)/<italic>R26<sup>EtvEnR</sup></italic> mice? The authors should also acknowledge that Spry2 is not a 'specific' FGF signaling inhibitor, because it has been shown to suppress other receptor tyrosine kinases.</p><p>4) In experiments using <italic>R26<sup>EtvEnR</sup></italic>, the authors presume that Etv functions only as a transcription activator. Monitoring the lens development in <italic>R26<sup>EtvVP16</sup></italic> is an important control that is missing.</p><p>5) The authors implicate defects in Notch signaling in Etv TKO phenotypes based on an anterior shift of Foxe3/ Prox1. However, this shift is not that spatially obvious relative to the reduced size of the mutant lens, in particular as this is not accompanied by the corresponding shift in fiber crystallin patterns (Figure 4). Furthermore, it is difficult to determine whether the observed defects in Notch signaling are direct consequence of Etv loss, or caused indirectly via factors acting upstream. The authors should experimentally address this. Finally, the experiments in Figure 6 should be complemented by those monitoring levels of Notch1-ICD.</p><p>6) The mTOR part of the study was found to be underdeveloped. Considering complexity of feedbacks between Erk and mTOR signaling, the authors should use pharmacological (mTOR inhibitors) approaches to corroborate conclusions that Etv TKO phenotypes are driven by sustained mTOR activation.</p><p>7) Several inconsistencies and issue with data quality were observed. These include variable histology of Etv TKO lenses in different images (Figure 2) and peripheral sections through the eye, which may give misleading labeling [e.g. c-Maf in mutants (Figures 5O, P)]. In addition, size differences should not only be quantified for some of the mutants but also for Etv TKO mutants vs. controls. It was also found that it was difficult to appreciate the denucleation effects in Figure 7A, E and I. It is advised that these experiments are repeated using anti-lamin antibody, and calculating the number of nuclei followed by appropriate statistical analysis. Finally, there is apparent high variability of steady state mRNA levels between the replicates (Figure 2B). Herein, additional quality controls (e.g. showing how individual replicates and conditions segregate using PCA) should be included.</p><p>8) Description of certain procedures in Materials and methods section was found to be incomplete. Herein, the authors are encouraged to provide detailed description of how their EdU experiments including statistical analysis were carried out. Especially, in the histogram in Figure 1I where it was found that it is unclear what EdU-positive fraction represents. Is it the percentage of EdU positive cells in lens epithelium or percentage of total lens cells?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Etv transcription factors functionally diverge from their upstream FGF signaling in lens development&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kathryn Cheah as the Senior Editor and Ivan Topisirovic as the Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Please refer to Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 in the Results section. These supplementary figures should be mentioned in an appropriate location of Results section.</p><p>2) Figure 3—figure supplement 1: It is shown that Spry2 mRNA expression is diminished in Erk CKO lens. Based on this, it was thought that the authors should refer to the Etv-FGF feedback scheme in the text.</p><p>3) Figure 5—figure supplement 1: It is advised that the authors discuss the Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-H after Figure 5A-N (subsection “Etv deficiency blocks aberrant but not normal lens differentiation”). In addition, the Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, F, I results should be elaborated after the first paragraph of the subsection “Deletion of Etv genes led to aberrant activation of mTOR signaling and disruption of disrupted nuclei clearance in the lens due to aberrant activation of mTOR signaling”.</p><p>4) Etv4 mRNA expression is abrogated in Fgf (OVE391); <italic>R26<sup>EtvENR</sup></italic> lens, however, Etv1 and Etv5 mRNAs are still expressed. It is possible that Etv4 predominantly regulates its own transcription while having a lesser impact on Etv1 and Etv5 transcription. In this case, <italic>R26<sup>EtvENR</sup></italic>-mediated Etv inhibition may be partially compared with Etv TKO. This possibility may explain why Spry2 expression is still retained in Fgf (OVE391); <italic>R26<sup>EtvENR</sup></italic> lens (Figure 5—figure supplement 1L). The authors should consider discussing this.</p><p>5) Figure 1E, Figure 1J and Figure 3—figure supplement 1B are still of insufficient quality:</p><p>In Figure 1E, there is a pERK positive cell mass between the neural retina and dotted line. Can the authors comment as per what are these pERK-positive cells? Are they lens epithelial cells or ocular blood vessel?</p><p>In Figure 1J (Etv4 mRNA in situ) and Figure 3—figure supplement 1B (Fgfr1, Fgfr3 in situ) brown color noise signals still mask most of the lens fiber area, making it difficult to see blue signals. To corroborate author's conclusions, better quality images should be provided. In addition, the authors should use arrows to show in which subareas Fgfr1, 3 are expressed in the lens.</p><p>6) The description of mouse monoclonal anti-cyclin D1 in key resource table appears to be incomplete. This should be corrected.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51915.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Based on apparent complexity of the interplay between FGF and ERK signaling in Etv TKO lenses, several issues were raised considering data interpretation.

As shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, Fgfr1 and 3 expressions were reduced across the lens area in Etv TKO mutants, but the most prominent decrease occurred in the transitional zone. As we point out in the revised manuscript, it was previously reported that genetic deletion of both Fgfr1 and Fgfr3 did not affect lens growth and differentiation, as the intact Fgfr2 is apparently sufficient to support lens development (Zhao et al., 2008). This explains why the reduction in Fgfr1 and 3 expressions does not affect the increase in phospho-ERK levels in Etv TKO caused by the loss of Spry2. Lastly, we have added Figure 3—figure supplement 1C to show that Spry2 expression is indeed abolished in Erk-CKO lenses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Better characterization of Etv TKO phenotypes is warranted.

To demonstrate that both Erk and Etv are under control of FGF signaling, we have now examined the lens specific knockouts of Fgfr1/2. As shown in the new Figure 1A-H, genetic ablation of FGF receptors disrupted lens vesicle formation, confirming the critical role of FGF signaling in lens development. Importantly, both phospho-ERK and Etv1/4/5 expression are lost in Fgfr1/2 mutants. In addition, we have highlighted in the Discussion a previous study which showed that deletion of Fgf receptors after the lens vesicle stage disrupted phospho-ERK (Zhao et al., 2008). We have also cited our own work that deletion of FGF signaling mediators Frs2 and Shp2 abolished ERK phosphorylation and Etv expression in the lens (Pan et al., 2010 and Li et al., 2014). Altogether, we believe these evidence strongly support that FGF signaling regulates Erk and Etv activities in the lens. Lastly, we have replaced MAPK with ERK throughout the manuscript as the reviewer suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To further strengthen the role of Spry2 downregulation in Etv TKO lens phenotypes, the authors should also determine expression of Etv 1, 4 and 5 and Spry2 in Fgf3 (OVE391) lenses. More specifically, the levels of Etv 1, 4 and 5 and Spry2 in anterior lens epithelium in Fgf3 (OVE391) mice should be determined. Also, is Spry2 downregulated in anterior lens epithelium of Fgf3 (OVE391)/R26<sup>EtvEnR</sup> mice? The authors should also acknowledge that Spry2 is not a 'specific' FGF signaling inhibitor, because it has been shown to suppress other receptor tyrosine kinases.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed RNA situ hybridization the reviewer requested. As expected, Etv1, 4, 5 and Spry2 are upregulated in the anterior lens epithelium in Fgf3(OVE391) mice, but their expressions are attenuated in Fgf3(OVE391)/<italic>R26<sup>EtvEnR</sup></italic> mice (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have also revised the manuscript to refer Spry2 as “inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In experiments using R26<sup>EtvEnR</sup>, the authors presume that Etv functions only as a transcription activator. Monitoring the lens development in R26<sup>EtvVP16</sup> is an important control that is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>Although <italic>R26<sup>EtvVP16</sup></italic> would be a nice control, to our knowledge, this mouse line does not exist. Since it would take considerable time and effort to generate a new mouse line, this control experiment is unfortunately out of scope of the current study. We would like to note that Etv/1/4/5 proteins share a transcriptional activator domain (TAD), suggesting that they most likely behave as transcription activators. Indeed, both in vitro and in vivo studies have confirmed that <italic>R26<sup>EtvEnR</sup></italic> blocks functions of Etv/1/4/5 (Curr. Biol. 11, 1739-1748, and Mao et al., 2009). Therefore, we are reasonably confident that <italic>R26<sup>EtvEnR</sup></italic> is an effective tool to probe Etv functions in lens development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors implicate defects in Notch signaling in Etv TKO phenotypes based on an anterior shift of Foxe3/ Prox1.

Finally, the experiments in Figure 6 should be complemented by those monitoring levels of Notch1-ICD.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the subtle difference between the anterior shift of Foxe3/Prox1 expressions and the relatively normal fiber crystallin patterns. As is now elaborated in the Discussion, we believe that these phenotypes represent the accelerated differentiation of lens progenitor cells controlled by transcription factors Foxe3/Prox1 versus the slightly delayed terminal differentiation of lens fiber cells characterized by crystallin expression. As demonstrated by NICD staining (Figure 6D), Notch signaling is only active in lens progenitor cells, not in fiber cells. As such, it is not surprising that dysregulated Notch signaling in Etv TKO mutants cause the anterior shift of the transitional zone shown by Foxe3/Prox1 staining, but it is not expected to directly affect the fiber cell compartment. On the other hand, the terminal differentiation of the fiber cells may be slightly delayed in Etv TKO mutants, which compensates for the early onset of the lens progenitor cell differentiation. Ultimately, the lens fiber cells proceed to express the crystallin genes at the comparable levels as the wild type controls.</p><p>At the reviewer’s request, we have repeated the western blot experiment in Figure 6 with the additional control of monitoring Notch1-ICD levels. It confirmed that inhibition of Erk activity disrupted Jag1-Notch signaling in lens cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). In addition, we have showed that expression of Notch ligand Jag1 is compromised in Etv TKO mutants and our ChIP experiment demonstrated that Etv binds the Jag1 genomic locus. Although we cannot rule out an indirect role of Erk-Etv in regulating Notch signaling, we believe our results strongly support that the observed defects in Notch signaling are the direct consequence of Etv loss.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The mTOR part of the study was found to be underdeveloped. Considering complexity of feedbacks between Erk and mTOR signaling, the authors should use pharmacological (mTOR inhibitors) approaches to corroborate conclusions that Etv TKO phenotypes are driven by sustained mTOR activation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have attempted to rescue Etv TKO phenotype using the mTOR inhibitor Torin. However, intraperitoneal injection of Torin into the pregnant females failed to disrupt phospho-mTOR and phospho-4EBP staining in the lens of the wild type embryos, suggesting that mTOR signaling was not significantly altered by this approach. This could be due to the inefficient delivery of mTOR inhibitor into the lens via systemic injection. Since we are unable to perform this pharmacological experiment, we have toned down the link between Etv TKO nuclei clearance phenotype and mTOR, changing the subtitle of mTOR section to “Deletion of Etv genes led to aberrant activation of mTOR signaling and disruption of nuclei clearance in the lens”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Several inconsistencies and issue with data quality were observed. These include variable histology of Etv TKO lenses in different images (Figure 2) and peripheral sections through the eye, which may give misleading labeling [e.g. c-Maf in mutants (Figures 5O, P)]. In addition, size differences should not only be quantified for some of the mutants but also for Etv TKO mutants vs. controls. It was also found that it was difficult to appreciate the denucleation effects in Figures 7A, E and I. It is advised that these experiments are repeated using anti-lamin antibody, and calculating the number of nuclei followed by appropriate statistical analysis. Finally, there is apparent high variability of steady state mRNA levels between the replicates (Figure 2B). Herein, additional quality controls (e.g. showing how individual replicates and conditions segregate using PCA) should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced Figure 2A and E with better histological images and Figure 5O and P with central sections. The lens size difference between control and Etv TKO is now quantified in Figure 1I. As presented in Figure 7—figure supplement 1, we performed additional staining of the lens nuclei using both DAPI and anti-Lamin A/C antibody, and quantified the number of nuclei followed by One-way ANOVA test. Finally, we also presented PCA plot in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 to show the segregation of control and Etv TKO mutant RNA sequencing data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Description of certain procedures in Materials and methods section was found to be incomplete. Herein, the authors are encouraged to provide detailed description of how their EdU experiments including statistical analysis were carried out. Especially, in the histogram in Figure 1I where it was found that it is unclear what EdU-positive fraction represents. Is it the percentage of EdU positive cells in lens epithelium or percentage of total lens cells?</p></disp-quote><p>The details for EdU experiments and the associated statistical analysis are now given in the Materials and methods section.
