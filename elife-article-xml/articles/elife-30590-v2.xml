N-degrons, and has emerged as a key regulator of various processes. Viruses manipulate diverse host pathways to facilitate viral replication and evade antiviral defenses. However, it remains unclear if viral infection has any impact on the N-end rule pathway. Here, using a picorna-like virus as a model, we found that viral infection promoted the accumulation of caspase-cleaved <italic>Drosophila</italic> inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (DIAP1) by inducing the degradation of N-terminal amidohydrolase 1 (NTAN1), a key N-end rule component that identifies N-degron to initiate the process. The virus-induced NTAN1 degradation is independent of polyubiquitylation but dependent on proteasome. Furthermore, the virus-induced N-end rule pathway suppression inhibits apoptosis and benefits viral replication. Thus, our findings demonstrate that a virus can suppress the N-end rule pathway, and uncover a new mechanism for virus to evade apoptosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>N-end rule pathway</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>Drosophila C virus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 31522004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Xi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 31600126</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zhaowei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000691</institution-id><institution>Academy of Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 31761130075</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Xi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Basic Research Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 2014CB542603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Xi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic Priority Research Program.

The apoptotic pathway shows sensitivity to various stimuli and can lead to cysteinyl aspartate protease (caspase) dependent proteolytic digestion and further cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benedict et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kumar, 2007</xref>). Various viruses, including vertebrate and invertebrate viruses, can induce apoptosis in infected cells or organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Everett and McFadden, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lamiable et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lannan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nainu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Settles and Friesen, 2008</xref>). Apoptosis is generally considered as an efficient antiviral defense mechanism by clearing virus-infected cells, while many viruses employ different strategies to evade apoptosis at various levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benedict et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Everett and McFadden, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2013</xref>).</p><p>The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has made a great contribution to study the regulation of apoptosis. Similar to other organisms, the caspase proteases are the central executioners of apoptosis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The fly caspase-9 homolog Dronc is the only known initiator caspase that is activated following a variety of apoptotic stimuli and can be activated by auto-cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Muro et al., 2004</xref>). Activated Dronc can further cleave and activate various effector caspases such as DrICE and DCP-1, leading to apoptotic induction. The initiator caspase Dronc and the effector caspases DrICE and DCP-1 are negatively regulated by DIAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hawkins et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wilson et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>DIAP1 shares several properties in structure and function with mammalian X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) and can block cell death in response to multiple stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hay et al., 1995</xref>). As a central cell death regulator, DIAP1 is regulated by several distinct ways. For instance, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Reaper, Hid and Grim (also referred to RHG proteins) can inhibit the apoptosis suppression activity of DIAP1 or induce the degradation of DIAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yoo et al., 2002</xref>). Besides, DIAP1 can be auto-ubiquitylated via its C-terminal RING ubiquitin ligase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wilson et al., 2002</xref>) or be ubiquitylated by other E3 ubiquitin ligases such as DIAP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herman-Bachinsky et al., 2007</xref>), followed by proteasome-dependent degradation. It has also been reported that DIAP1 can be degraded by the N-end rule pathway. In this process, DIAP1 is cleaved at Asp20 by caspase to expose an N-terminal Asn residue. The exposed N-terminal Asn can be recognized and converted into Asp by NTAN1, and further catalyzed by Arginine-tRNA-protein transferase (ATE1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ditzel et al., 2003</xref>). Such Arg-conjugated proteins can be recognized and ubiquitylated by the N-end rule specific E3 ubiquitin ligase, UBR1, and then subject to fast degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ditzel et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The N-end rule pathway is a proteasome dependent proteolytic system that recognizes and degrades proteins containing N-degrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gibbs et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tasaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Varshavsky, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tasaki and Kwon, 2007</xref>). This pathway has been found to be evolutionarily conserved from prokaryotic to eukaryotic organisms, including bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tobias et al., 1991</xref>), yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bachmair et al., 1986</xref>), plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Graciet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoshida et al., 2002</xref>), invertebrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ditzel et al., 2003</xref>), and vertebrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davydov and Varshavsky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2015</xref>). The N-end rule pathway relates the half-lives of proteins with the nature of their N-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gibbs et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tasaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Varshavsky, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tasaki and Kwon, 2007</xref>). A functional N-degron can either be an unmodified destabilizing N-terminal residue or an N-terminally modified (deamidated, oxidized, and/or arginylated) pre-N-degron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Varshavsky, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tasaki and Kwon, 2007</xref>). In the case of DIAP1, caspase cleaves DIAP1 to expose an N-terminal Asn residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ditzel et al., 2003</xref>). This Asn residue is a classical pre-N-degron for N-terminal deamidation by NTAN1, followed by arginylation by ATE1. It has been reported that the N-end rule pathway participates in a large number of important cellular processes, such as G protein signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davydov and Varshavsky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2015</xref>), chromosome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rao et al., 2001</xref>), apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ditzel et al., 2003</xref>), oxygen and nitric oxide sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gibbs et al., 2014b</xref>), degradation of neurodegeneration-associated protein fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brower et al., 2013</xref>) and etc. Moreover, the N-end rule pathway has been reported to interact with some viral proteins. For instance, Sindbis virus nsP4 and HIV-1 integrase are N-end rule substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Groot et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mulder and Muesing, 2000</xref>), and human papillomavirus E7 binds to UBR4, the E3 ligase in the N-end rule pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">White et al., 2012</xref>). However, it remains unclear if viral infection has any impact on this pathway.</p><p>Here, we report that the infection by a picorna-like virus can induce apoptosis in infected <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, and the apoptotic pathway plays an antiviral role in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Intriguingly, we found that the viral infection promoted the accumulation of caspase-cleaved, smaller form of DIAP1, which is potent for apoptosis inhibition, by inhibiting the N-terminal Asn deamidation of the cleaved DIAP1. Moreover, we uncovered that the viral infection could induce the degradation of NTAN1, which catalyzes the N-terminal Asn deamidation of the cleaved, smaller DIAP1. And the virus-induced NTAN1 degradation is independent of polyubiquitylation but dependent on proteasome. Furthermore, our study revealed that the virus-induced N-end rule pathway suppression could efficiently block apoptosis and facilitates viral replication. In summary, our findings demonstrate for the first time that a virus can suppress the N-end rule pathway, and uncover a new mechanism for virus to evade apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Viral infection induces apoptosis in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>Previous studies showed that various viruses, including <italic>Autographa californica</italic> nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV), Flock House Virus (FHV), and <italic>Drosophila</italic> C virus (DCV), can induce apoptosis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells or adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lamiable et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lannan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nainu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Settles and Friesen, 2008</xref>). Among these viruses, DCV, which is a picorna-like virus assigned to the family <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic> of the order <italic>Picornavirales</italic>, is a natural pathogen of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and a classic model virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson and Christian, 1998</xref>). To confirm whether DCV infection can also induce apoptosis in our system, we performed a flow cytometry assay using Annexin V-allophycocyanin (APC)/propidium iodide (PI) double staining in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. Annexin V staining can detect the surface exposure of phosphatidylserine, a hallmark of apoptosis, while PI staining can identify dead cells. Consistent with previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lamiable et al., 2016</xref>), DCV-infected cells showed increased Annexin V and PI staining as infection progressed when comparing with mock infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Moreover, we used terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining to detect apoptotic cells. In this assay, DCV-infected cells also showed an increase in apoptotic cell death comparing with mock infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, previous study has reported that the transcriptions of RHG genes were up-regulated by the AcMNPV or FHV infection in adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Our data showed that DCV infection induced RHG gene transcription in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The level of <italic>reaper</italic> mRNA was significantly induced at 6 hr post infection (h.p.i) of DCV, while a significant induction of <italic>hid</italic> or <italic>grim</italic> mRNA can be detected at 12 h.p.i (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

NTAN1 contains four lysine residues (i.e. K40, K63, K134 and K186). Among them, K186 is conserved in <italic>Diptera</italic> and vertebrate, K40 and K63 are conserved in <italic>Diptera</italic> but not vertebrate, while K134 is not conserved in <italic>Diptera</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). To investigate whether these residues are involved in the virus-induced NTAN1 degradation, we replaced all of the four lysine residues with alanine (NTAN1<sup>4KA</sup>). However, when NTAN1<sup>4KA</sup> was exogenously expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, viral infection was still able to induce the decrease of NTAN1<sup>4KA</sup> protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Furthermore, we conducted CHX degradation assay, and observed that in the absence of viral infection, NTAN1<sup>4KA</sup> is significantly more stable than NTAN1<sup>WT</sup>, while viral infection similarly promoted the degradation of both NTAN1<sup>4KA</sup> and NTAN1<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–H</xref>). These results show that the virus-induced NTAN1 degradation is independent of ubiquitylation.</p><p>Interestingly, NTAN1<sup>4KA</sup> is significantly more stable than NTAN1<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6D, F and H</xref>); additionally, unlike NTAN1<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lanes 1 vs. 5), blocking the proteasome by MG-132 treatment did not show any effect on the protein level of NTAN1<sup>4KA</sup> in the absence of viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lanes 1 vs. 4), suggesting that one or all of these lysine residues and/or polyubiquitylation have some contribution to the protein stability of NTAN1. Moreover, our results showed that NTAN1<sup>WT</sup> but not NTAN1<sup>4KA</sup> can be polyubiquitylated, while the polyubiquitylation of NTAN1 was not affected by viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>Next, we constructed four mutants of NTAN1, that is K40A, K63A, K134A and K186A, to determine which lysine residue(s) are most responsible for the polyubiquitylation-dependent degradation of NTAN1. Our data showed that, similarly with NTAN1<sup>WT</sup>, the MG-132 treatment dramatically enhanced the protein level of exogenously expressed NTAN1<sup>K40A</sup>, NTAN1<sup>K63A</sup> or NTAN1<sup>K134A</sup> in the absence of viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B,C and D</xref>, lanes 1 vs. 4). On the other hand, like NTAN1<sup>4KA</sup>, NTAN1<sup>K186A</sup> is resistant to degradation in the absence of viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>, lanes 1 vs. 4), indicating that K186 is most responsible for the ubiquitylation-dependent degradation of NTAN1 in the absence of viral infection.</p><p>Altogether, our data showed that NTAN1 can be polyubiquitylated, and degraded by both ubiquitylation-dependent and -independent degradation pathways.

Our previous data have shown that the loss of NTAN1 can prevent the degradation of cleaved DIAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Here, we ectopically expressed HA-tagged NTAN1 in virally infected cells.

Our current study uncovered that the infection by a picorna-like virus can suppress the N-end rule pathway by inducing the degradation of its key component NTAN1. This process causes the accumulation of caspase-cleaved DIAP1, which results in apoptosis inhibition and represents a novel mechanism of viral evasion of apoptosis.</p><p>It is interesting that the virus-induced degradation of NTAN1 is dependent of proteasome but independent of ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Protein degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system has been extensively studied. In contrast, the mechanism of the ubiquitin-independent proteolytic activity of proteasomes is poorly understood. It has been reported that the ubiquitin-independent proteolytic activity of proteasomes is involved in the degradation of oxidized proteins, chemically unfolded proteins, and specific natively disordered proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baugh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grune et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoyt and Coffino, 2004</xref>). It is worth to mention that several important regulatory proteins can be degraded by this mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoyt and Coffino, 2004</xref>), including p21/Cip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sheaff et al., 2000</xref>), IκBα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krappmann et al., 1996</xref>), c-Jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jariel-Encontre et al., 1995</xref>) and p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsvetkov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsvetkov et al., 2010</xref>). The N-end rule pathway is normally recognized as an ubiquitin proteasome proteolytic system and employs specific E3 ubiquitin ligases. As a key component of the N-end rule pathway, NTAN1 can be degraded in an ubiquitin-independent manner suggests a connection between these distinct proteasome proteolytic mechanisms, which extends the knowledge about ubiquitin-independent proteolytic activity of proteasome. The future study by us or others should uncover how viral infection induces the ubiquitin-independent NTAN1 degradation.</p><p>The N-end rule pathway plays an important role in various biological processes. According to the different substrates, the N-end rule pathway can be grouped into three types, the Arg/N-end rule pathway targets proteins with N-terminal Arg residue, the Ac/N-end rule pathway targets proteins with N-terminal acetylated residues and the Pro/N-end rule pathway targets proteins with N-terminal Pro residue or a Pro at position 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Varshavsky, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Previous studies have shown the involvement of N-end rule pathway in a large number of important cellular processes. Besides its function in regulating DIAP1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the Arg/N-end rule pathway can also regulate the C-terminal fragments of the Scc1 cohesin subunit that are produced by separase and thus regulates chromosome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rao et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, the N-end rule pathway regulates the mammalian G protein signaling through degrading RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davydov and Varshavsky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2015</xref>). In the N-end rule pathway, NTAN1 is the key component that regulates the half-life of a protein by identifying its N-terminal residue and initiating the process. It has been reported that NTAN1-deficient mice have neurological defects such as impairment of spontaneous activity and spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balogh et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2001</xref>). Our current study found that viral infection can induce NTAN1 degradation, resulting in the suppression of the N-end rule pathway and subsequent evasion of apoptosis.</p><p>It would be intriguing to find out how viral infection induces the degradation of NTAN1. Interestingly, we found that blocking protein synthesis by CHX before viral infection abolished the effect of DCV to induce NTAN1 degradation, indicating that viral protein synthesis and/or viral replication within infected cells, but not the input viral components, are responsible for this process. Viruses in the order <italic>Picornavirales</italic> encode a 3C or 3C-like (3 CL) protease that cleaves viral polyproteins. It has been reported that 3C proteases from multiple mammalian picornaviruses, such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), Hepatitis A Virus, enterovirus 68, and enterovirus 71, are able to cleave and degrade host proteins to manipulate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lei et al., 2013</xref>), leading us to speculate whether DCV 3 CL protease could mediate NTAN1 degradation. However, we failed to observe any effect of exogenously expressed DCV 3 CL on the stability of NTAN1 (data not shown). It is also possible that other DCV proteins are responsible for the virus-induced NTAN1 degradation. Based on the sequence analyses, we have predicted the sequences and boundaries of DCV proteins. Unfortunately, the extreme difficulty to exogenously express other DCV proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells prevented us from further examining these possibilities. In addition, viral infection can induce multiple intracellular signaling pathways, which may induce NTAN1 degradation.</p><p>In summary, our findings demonstrate for the first time that a virus can suppress the N-end rule pathway, and uncover a new mechanism for virus to evade apoptosis. Given the high conservation of the N-end rule pathway from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, it opens up the possibilities that this mechanism can also be employed by other viruses, particularly picornaviruses, to evade apoptosis and/or modulate other cellular processes, which are the targets of N-end rule pathway, in mammals or other organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>cell line (<italic>Drosophila</italic> <break/><italic>melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>S2</td><td>ATCC</td><td>ATCC, Cat# CRL-1963; <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_Z232">CVCL_Z232</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>anti-Flag M2 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Sigma</td><td>Sigma,Cat# F1804; <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_262044">AB_262044</ext-link></td><td>1:2000</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>anti-myc (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>MBL</td><td>MBL, Cat# M192-3; <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_11160947">AB_11160947</ext-link></td><td>1:2000</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>anti-HA (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>ProteinTech</td><td>ProteinTech, Cat# 66006–1-Ig</td><td>1:5000</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>anti-α-Tubulin (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>ProteinTech</td><td>ProteinTech, Cat# 66031–1-Ig; <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_11042766">AB_11042766</ext-link></td><td>1:3000</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>anti-DIAP1 (goat polyclonal)</td><td>Santa Cruz <break/>Biotechnology</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology, <break/>Cat# sc-32414; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_639332">AB_639332</ext-link></td><td>1:200</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>HRP-conjugated anti-GFP</td><td>ProteinTech</td><td>ProteinTech, Cat# HRP-66002</td><td>1:5000</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>anti-ubiquitin (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Cell Signaling <break/>Technology</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology, <break/>Cat# 3936; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_331292">AB_331292</ext-link></td><td>1:2000</td></tr><tr><td>commercial assay <break/>or kit</td><td>Annexin-V-APC/PI double staining kit</td><td>BioLegend</td><td>BioLegend, Cat# 640932</td><td/></tr><tr><td>commercial assay <break/>or kit</td><td>TUNEL staining kit</td><td>Roche</td><td>Roche, Cat# 11684817910</td><td/></tr><tr><td>commercial assay <break/>or kit</td><td>CellTiter-Blue Cell Viability kit</td><td>Promega</td><td>Promega, Cat# G8080</td><td/></tr><tr><td>commercial assay <break/>or kit</td><td>Caspase-Glo 3/7 kit</td><td>Promega</td><td>Promega, Cat# G8090</td><td/></tr><tr><td>other</td><td>z-VAD-FMK</td><td>MedChem Express</td><td>MedChem Express, Cat# HY-16658</td><td>20 μM</td></tr><tr><td>other</td><td>CHX</td><td>Sigma</td><td>Sigma, Cat# C7698</td><td>50 μg/ml</td></tr><tr><td>other</td><td>MG-132</td><td>Sigma</td><td>Sigma, Cat# C2211</td><td>50 μM</td></tr><tr><td>other</td><td>lactacystin</td><td>Merck</td><td>Merck, Cat# 426100</td><td>10 μM</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and DCV oral infection</title><p>All flies used were 3- to 5-day-old adults reared at 25°C on a standard cornmeal/yeast diet.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Wenhui Li (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Yong Tae Kwon (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The N-end rule pathway has not been implicated in viral replication in a major way. A previous study by Ditzel et al. (03' NCB) showed that DIAP1, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> inhibitor of apoptosis, is cleaved by caspase, exposing N-terminal Asn21 which is subsequently deamidated by NTAN1 and arginylated by ATE1 of the N-end rule pathway, leading to ubiquitination by UBR box N-recognins and proteasomal degradation. In this study, the authors show that viral infection induces the degradation of NTAN1 leading to the metabolic stabilization of Asn21-DIAP1 (a short form) and, thus, inhibiting apoptosis of host cells. Moreover, the authors suggest that virus-induced degradation of NTAN1 is mediated by the proteasome in a manner independent from ubiquitination. The topics are of significant importance and novelty in the field of proteolysis and viral infection. Unfortunately, this study suffers from several major issues as summarized below. Overall, this manuscript needs major revision with several additional experiments.</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>1) To determine the metabolic stabilities of DIAP1 and NTAN1 proteins, the authors measured their steady state levels using only immunoblotting analysis. The results from immunoblotting analysis are not sufficient to draw conclusions on protein degradation and should be validated using in vivo degradation assays such as pulse chase analysis. If pulse chase assay is technically impossible, an alternative is cycloheximide degradation assays.</p><p>2) The authors claim that virus induced degradation of NTAN1 is mediated by the proteasome without ubiquitination. In general, such negative conclusion with ubiquitination requires more rigorous validation. For example, in the second paragraph of the subsection “Viral infection promotes the degradation of NTAN1 via the proteasome pathway” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), the authors claim that the mutation of all four lysine residues does not inhibit the degradation of NTAN and suggested that the virus-induced NTAN1 degradation is independent of ubiquitination. This immunoblotting analysis is of poor quality. The decay of NTAN1-4KA should be compared with wild-type NTAN1. In addition, the results should be validated using pulse chase analysis or at least cycloheximide degradation assay. To this reviewer, NTAN1-4KA seems to be significantly stabilized at 9 h.p.i. when compared with all four single lysine mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>3) The authors claim that viral infection induces the degradation of NTAN1 but did not examine the decay rate of endogenous NTAN1 in normally growing cells. It is necessary to compare the degradation rates of NTAN1 under two conditions with or without viral infection using in vivo degradation assays.</p><p>4) One of the major weaknesses of this study is the lack of any mechanistic insight into which viral components are involved in targeting NTAN1. It seems to be reasonably straightforward to consider the effects of the proteins introduced by the virus and perform at least basic tests to see how they could potentially affect NTAN1 stability. The authors offer no insights into this, not even a discussion of the possibilities. While I understand that detailed experiments into this direction may be difficult, I believe the paper would be considerably strengthened by at least a discussion or a model.</p><p>5) Western blots in all panels should be quantified, with sufficient number of repeats. For many panels, only one repeat is shown, making it unclear even how many experiments were done. It is essential to quantify data in triplicates, given the variability of the method itself.</p><p>6) In many panels, a consistent decrease of tubulin level with time post infection is seen. It appears that the virus has an effect on microtubules, which is probably not surprising but this raises the issues of loading controls. A potential loading control could be total protein load, which could also be illustrated by Coomassie Blue staining. There are also other commonly used loading controls like GAPDH or actin – which are, of course, also subject to change per virus infection. This should be addressed.</p><p>7) Along the same lines, quantification of the levels of transfected protein should be accompanied by qPCR data showing the transfection levels, since these can considerably affect the result between cultures. A &quot;quick and dirty&quot; way around it is to split the culture equally after transfection into the wells/dishes used for the collection of the time points. I did not find any experimental details about this in the manuscript.</p><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, additional NTAN1 enhances virus-induced apoptosis and reduced viral replication in cell. How about in NTAN1 knockdown cells? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, ATE1 and NTAN1 knockdown cells by dsRNA shows accumulation of cleaved form of DAIP1. It is important to examine the caspase level or apoptotic state and DCV gRNA in NTAN1 knockdown cells upon DCV infection.</p><p>9) Mechanism of antiviral function by apoptosis is not clear. Increased level of DCV gRNA in cells could be interpreted by many reasons. The viral RNA replication was enhanced in cells by anti-apoptotic DIAPI, viral budding pathway was blocked so that viral RNA was accumulated in the cells, or viral entry was more efficient than other groups, etc. Replicated RNA genome is packaged and newly packaged viral particles should be budded out into culture fluids. One feasible experiment is to analyze viral particles in cultured fluids by either RT-qPCR or any available methods in order to address the increased level of DCV gRNA means more infectious viable DCV.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30590.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Comments:</p><p>1) To determine the metabolic stabilities of DIAP1 and NTAN1 proteins, the authors measured their steady state levels using only immunoblotting analysis.

Following this suggestion, we conducted the CHX degradation assays for both DIAP1, NTAN1, and NTAN1-4KA (the mutant with all of the 4 lysine residues being mutated to Alanine).

Our data show that viral infection could promote the degradation of both 4KA mutant and WT NTAN1 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D-H</xref>; subsection “Viral infection promotes the degradation of NTAN1 via the proteasome pathway”, second paragraph), although NTAN1-4KA is more stable than WT NTAN1 in the absence of DCV infection (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, F and H</xref>). In addition, based on our data and quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, viral infection induced the degradation of NTAN1-4KA at 9 h.p.i, similarly with WT and other mutants. In fact, there are two ways to degrade NTAN1 (Ub-dependent and –independent) at the same time. NTAN1-4KA mutation can completely block the way of Ub-dependent degradation, while a single lysine mutation may not completely block this way. Thus, NTAN1-4KA is expectedly more stable than other single lysine mutants in the presence or absence of viral infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors claim that viral infection induces the degradation of NTAN1 but did not examine the decay rate of endogenous NTAN1 in normally growing cells.

Indeed, we have tried our best to figure out the exact mechanism by which DCV infection promotes NTAN1 degradation. To this end, we have tried to express individual DCV proteins in cultured cells to examine how they can potentially affect NTAN1 stability, as the reviewer also suggested. However, due to the limitation of current knowledge, the exact boundaries of these individual viral proteins in the DCV polyproteins are unclear (DCV genome contains two ORFs that encode two polyproteins, which are subsequently cleaved by DCV 3C-like protease into separate proteins). Based on the sequence analyses and the alignment with other picornaviruses and picorna-like viruses, we have predicted the sequences of these DCV proteins (1A, Helicase, RdRP, 3C-like, VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4) and cloned them into expression vectors. Unfortunately, most of these viral proteins were extremely hard to be expressed in S2 cells (this phenomenon is not unusual for expressing many other viral proteins). We only successfully expressed DCV 3C-like protease (3CL) in S2 cells, which is an ideal candidate as picornavirus 3C protease has been reported to cleave many host proteins. However, we didn’t observe any effect of 3CL on NTAN1 stability (data not shown in the manuscript). Following this reviewer’s suggestion, we have discussed the possible mechanisms that may induce NTAN1 degradation in the revised manuscript (Discussion, fifth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Western blots in all panels should be quantified, with sufficient number of repeats.

All of the Western blotting analyses had been independently repeated for at least three times. Following this suggestion, we have quantified the Western blotting data via densitometry in the revised figures and also described the method in the revised “Materials and methods” section (subsection “Western blots, immunoprecipitation (IP) and antibodies”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In many panels, a consistent decrease of tubulin level with time post infection is seen.

We consistently observed that viral infection could cause decrease of tubulin levels after 24-hr infection. Following this comment, we used total protein loads as loading controls by using Coomassie Blue staining (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and revised the “Materials and methods” section accordingly (subsection “Western blots, immunoprecipitation (IP) and antibodies”, first paragraph). In addition, from our own observation, GAPDH or actin may not be used as good loading control, as their commercial antibodies usually recognize many noise bands in the Western blots of <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cell extracts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Along the same lines, quantification of the levels of transfected protein should be accompanied by qPCR data showing the transfection levels, since these can considerably affect the result between cultures.

Actually, we had already used the &quot;quick and dirty&quot; way suggested by the reviewers in our experiments. In brief, we firstly transfected cells in a 100-mm culture dish. After 24-36 hr transfection, the transfected cells were divided into six or eight wells of 6-well plate, and cultured for 6 more hours. The cells were then subjected to viral infection or other treatments according to experimental requirements. Based on this procedure, the transfection level or efficiency in different wells should be equal. The experimental procedures have been described in detail in the revised manuscript (subsection “Transfection”).</p><p>In addition, following this reviewers’ suggestion, we have quantified the transfection levels using qPCR, and our data show that using the above method, the transfection levels in different samples were similar (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, subsection “Viral infection promotes the accumulation of cleaved DIAP1 in cells”, third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, additional NTAN1 enhances virus-induced apoptosis and reduced viral replication in cell.
