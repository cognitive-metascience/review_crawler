Multiple structures have shown how a helical assembly of subunits binds a single strand of substrate, and indicate that translocation results from the ATP-driven movement of subunits from one end of the helical assembly to the other end.

The peptides bind in a hairpin conformation, with one primary strand equivalent to the single chain peptide ligands, while the second strand returns through the translocation pore without making intimate contacts with Vps4.

Structures of all of these complexes have been determined in an asymmetric, lock-washer conformation in which four or five of the six subunits in the hexamer form a helix that adopts a right-handed helical configuration, while the other one or two subunits are displaced from the helical axis, as if transitioning between ends of the helix.</p><p>These AAA+Â ATPase complexes bind the substrate polypeptide in the central pore in an extended conformation, which in the case of Vps4 has been modeled as a Î²-strand-like conformation whose right-handed helical symmetry (60Â° rotation andÂ ~6.5 Ã displacement every two amino acid residues) matches the symmetry of the helical AAA+Â ATPase subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Monroe et al., 2017</xref>). Although the resolution of currently available AAA+Â ATPase substrate complexes makes it challenging to model precise details of the substrate structure, this conformation is appealing because it allows the substrate to bind the helical AAA+Â ATPase subunits with successive dipeptides of the substrate making equivalent interactions with the enzyme and because it is accessible for almost all amino acid residues. Some variations from the canonical conformation are likely to occur, especially for sequences that contain proline, which has a fixed â60Â° phi angle, and glycine, which is flexible and lacks a side chain, which seems to be important for binding. Interfaces between the helical AAA+Â ATPase subunits are stabilized by binding of ATP at the active site of the first subunit and contacts with the âfingerâ arginine residues of the following subunit. These observations suggest a model in which ATP hydrolysis at the last interface in the helix promotes disengagement to an open, transitioning conformation that allows nucleotide exchange, with ATP binding to the transitioning subunit allowing it to rejoin the growing end of the helical assembly and bind the next dipeptide of the extended substrate polypeptide. Similar structures for multiple AAA+Â ATPase peptide complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfieri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de la PeÃ±a et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deville et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gates et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Monroe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Puchades et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ripstein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">White et al., 2018</xref>) support a general model in which cycles of this process cause theÂ AAA+Â ATPase to âwalkâ along its substrate and thereby translocate the substrate through its central hexameric pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han and Hill, 2019</xref>).</p><p>This model explains how an extended polypeptide substrate might be translocated, but it does not explain the translocation of more complex substrates. For example, the proteasome can process substrates starting from internal loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kraut and Matouschek, 2011</xref>), substrates that are crosslinked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2002</xref>), and substrates that are conjugated to ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shabek and Ciechanover, 2010</xref>). Similarly, Cdc48 can process substrates that are covalently ligated to ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bodnar and Rapoport, 2017</xref>), and ClpXP can process disulfide-cross-linked dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burton et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that the mechanism proposed for linear, extended polypeptides is also compatible with translocation of more complex substrates. Peptides that include a known Vps4-binding sequence were synthesized in linear and circular configurations and shown to bind Vps4 with similar affinities. Structure determination showed that a primary segment of the circular peptide binds indistinguishably from the isolated linear peptide, while a secondary segment packs against it in a Î²-ladder hairpin configuration that passes through the hexamer pore without distorting the Vps4 structure or making intimate contacts with Vps4. These observations indicate that AAA+Â ATPases can translocate two chains of a substrate, such as would occur in crosslinked chains or in ubiquitin conjugates, using the same mechanism as for an extended polypeptide.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Linear and circular peptides bind Vps4 with similar affinity</title><p>The experimental design was guided by our previously reported biochemical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Monroe et al., 2014</xref>) and cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Monroe et al., 2017</xref>) of Vps4 in complex with an 8-residue peptide (DEIVNKVL; peptide F) that was derived from the yeast ESCRT-III subunit, Vps2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2015</xref>). Although this peptide was originally discovered as a relatively tight-binding sequence, we subsequently found that its binding affinity is comparable to a diverse range of peptide sequences (data not shown). This indicates that its complex with Vps4 reflects a canonical translocating state, as does its structural similarity with multiple otherÂ AAA+Â ATPase complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han and Hill, 2019</xref>). ADPÂ·BeF<sub>x</sub> was used as the non-hydrolysable ATP analog because our earlier studies indicated that it stabilizes the Vps4 hexamer and supports peptide binding to a greater extent than AMPPNP or ATPÎ³S, presumably because it is a better mimic of ATP at the Vps4 active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The following peptides were synthesized using Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis with acetylated N-termini and amidated C-termini: F12 (peptide F flanked on both ends by two glycine residues); F30 (peptide F extended by four residues at the N-terminus and 18 residues at the C-terminus; FF30 (F30 but including a second copy of peptide F) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">9</xref>). Most of the additional residues in F30 and FF30 were glycine, alanine, or serine, which are not expected to bind strongly to Vps4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2017</xref>). Lysine was included at position 2 to allow labeling (not used in this study) and at position 29 to promote solubility. An N-terminal cysteine was included in F30 and FF30, and versions of these peptides were also synthesized with a C-terminal hydrazide to facilitate synthesis of the circular cF30 and cFF30 peptides, which are identical to F30 and FF30 except for cyclization through a peptide bond between the N and CÂ terminal residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44071.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Linear and circular peptides bind Vps4 with similar affinities.</title><p>Sequences of the linear and circular peptides used in this study are shown, together with competition fluorescence polarization binding isotherms and calculated <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> and <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> values.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig1sdata1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44071.013</object-id><label>Figure 1âsource data 1.</label><caption><title>Binding of peptides to Vps4 in a fluorescence polarization competition assay related toÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>Â and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-44071-fig1-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44071-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44071.003</object-id><label>Figure 1âfigure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Competitive binding assays.</title><p>Competition binding data for the linear and circular peptides used in this study against Vsp4 and Vps4-Hcp1.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44071-fig1-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44071.005</object-id><label>Figure 1âfigure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Characterization of HPLC purified peptide F by LC-MS.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analytical HPLC trace of peptide F using FortisBIO C4 column (5 ÂµM, 300 Ã, 4.6 Ã 150 mm) at 214 nm.

Moreover, the Vta1<sup>VSL</sup> density is better for the cFF30 structure compared to the cF30 dataset, presumably because the use of Spotiton to prepare cFF30 grids reduced the time to vitrification, which reduced the contacts with the air-water interface that cause complex dissolution and preferred orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dandey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Noble et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In a substantial increase over our previous reconstructions using conventional blotting methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Monroe et al., 2017</xref>),Â ~17% of the particles derived from Spotiton grids contribute density to all six Vta1<sup>VSL</sup> sites on the Vps4 hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2âfigure supplement 8</xref>). Reconstruction of these particles yielded an overall resolution of 4.4 Ã. Distinct densities at each Vps4 subunit interface allowed unambiguous assignment of all four helices in the Vta1 dimers, although their location at the periphery of the Vps4 complex remains a region of relatively low local resolution (~5â8 Ã). This supports the conclusion that Vps4 and Vta1 associate with 6:12 stoichiometry in the fully assembled complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Vta1 promotes Vps4 oligomerization and increases the ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azmi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lottridge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scott et al., 2005</xref>), and enhances ESCRT-III disassembly in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azmi et al., 2008</xref>). These effects likely result from multiple interconnected mechanisms: Association of Vta1âs N-terminal MIT domains with ESCRT-III polymers will reinforce Vps4 recruitment to ESCRT-III complexes; binding of Vta1<sup>VSL</sup> dimers in bridging interactions between adjacent Vps4 subunits will promote formation of the active hexamer; and Vta1<sup>VSL</sup> support the contacts of subunits E and F that may promote ATP hydrolysis at the subunit D active site (above).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Comparison with other AAA+Â ATPase peptide complexes</title><p>Several structures of AAA+Â ATPases that translocate protein substrates have been reported with coordinates of bound peptides deposited in the Protein Data Bank, including Hsp104 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gates et al., 2017</xref>), YME1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Puchades et al., 2017</xref>), TRIP13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfieri et al., 2018</xref>), the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de la PeÃ±a et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dong et al., 2019</xref>), and NSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">White et al., 2018</xref>). In all cases the bound peptides are single, extended strands that pass through the pore and overlap closely with the structure of peptide F in the Vps4 complex, albeit sometimes in the opposite orientation or with local differences in phi/psi angles. Superposition on the pore loop 1 residues of Vps4 shows that the circular Vps4-bound cF30/cFF30 peptide fits reasonably into the YME1, Hsp104, and NSF structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7âvideo 1</xref>). In contrast, superposition on the TRIP13 and proteasome structural models show overlap of pore loop two residues with the returning strand of the cyclic peptides, although in general the pore loop two residues appear to be relatively mobile, which raises the possibility that they may reposition to accommodate a two-stranded substrate. Thus, regardless of whether or not Vps4 binds its substrates in a hairpin conformation in vivo, it seems possible that this mechanism will also be accessible to other AAA+Â ATPases.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44071.036</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Overlap of cyclic peptide structure suggests compatibility with YME1, Hsp104, and NSF.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Vps4 color, YME1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Puchades et al., 2017</xref>) gray.

Our structures also raise interesting questions about directionality. Although it is not yet definitively resolved, the Vps4 structures are most consistent with binding of the primary strand N-terminal residues at the A-end of the Vps4 helix and C-terminal residues at the E-end. This orientation is consistent with the biological role of Vps4 in translocating toward the ESCRT-III N-terminal domain, but other AAA+Â ATPases apparently translocate their protein substrates in the opposite direction (N-to-C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfieri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Puchades et al., 2017</xref>) or in either direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Augustyniak and Kay, 2018</xref>). Indeed, the same mechanism of translocation could be applied to substrates bound with their primary strand in either orientation because side chains make a major contribution to binding, and forward and reversed Î²-strands can superimpose their CÎ± atoms and side chains. Regardless, our structures suggest that substrates might bind the AAA+Â pore in a hairpin conformation that is translocated in both the N-to-C and C-to-N directions at the same time.</p><p>Contexts in which translocation of two polypeptide chains through a AAA+Â ATPase pore might be functionally important include the initiation of translocation from an internal loop, crosslinked substrates, and ubiquitin adducts, as have been indicated for the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kraut and Matouschek, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shabek and Ciechanover, 2010</xref>), Cdc48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bodnar and Rapoport, 2017</xref>), and ClpX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burton et al., 2001</xref>). The model for translocation from an internal loop is illustrated in <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video2">Figure 7âvideo 2</xref> and the model for translocation of a ubiquitylated substrate is illustrated in <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video3">Figure 7âvideo 3</xref>. As shown in these animations, the model for simultaneous translocation of two polypeptide chains through the pore of a AAA+Â ATPases will cause them to rotate with respect to each other, with one complete rotation anticipated for every 12 residues of primary strand translocated. This is because successive dipeptides of the primary strand bind successive Vps4 subunits, which are rotated 60Â° with respect to each other, at the lining of the pore, while the secondary strand continually lies along the center of the pore. The twist that this introduces to the substrate when long stretches of double chains are translocated might be resolved by relative rotation of the AAA+Â ATPase or by periodically switching which strand engages the pore loops and which lies along the open channel. The extent to which simultaneous binding and translocation of two polypeptide chains or a polypeptide with some other adduct actually occurs for the various differentÂ AAA+Â ATPases remains to be determined.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Resource type</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Recombinant protein</td><td>Vps4-HCP1</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28379137">28379137</ext-link></td><td>Addgene (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002037">SCR_002037</ext-link>): 87737</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant protein</td><td>Vta1<sup>VSL</sup></td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28379137">28379137</ext-link></td><td>Addgene (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002037">SCR_002037</ext-link>): 87738</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>GraphPad Prism</td><td>GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, C</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MotionCor2</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28250466">28250466</ext-link></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_016499">RRID:</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_016499">SCR_016499</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>RELION</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23000701">23000701</ext-link></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_016274">RRID:</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_016274">SCR_016274</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>UCSF Chimera</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15264254">15264254</ext-link></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004097">RRID:</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004097">SCR_004097</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Coot</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20383002">20383002</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014222">SCR_014222</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Phenix</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20124702">20124702</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014224">SCR_014224</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Materials used for peptide synthesis</title><p>2-chlorotrityl resin and 1-[Bis(dimethylamino)methylene]â1 H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium-3-oxidhexafluorophosphate (HATU) were purchased from ChemPep.

There were no issues with the technical aspects of the findings.

We hope that you will find their comments useful in moving forward.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Hill and coworkers describe the cryo-EM structure of cyclic peptide-bound Vps4 in complex with ADPÂ·BeF<sub>x</sub> and the VSL domain of Vta1, suggesting how this AAA+ motor may translocate loops or two strands of protein substrates. The authors used circularized 30-mer peptides with one or two copies of the 8-residue segment DEIVNKVL (F peptide) that was derived from the ESCRT-II subunit Vps2, specifically binds to the Vps4 pore, and whose structure bound to Vps4 has previously been solved by the same group. This primary segment of the circular peptides was found to bind indistinguishably from the linear peptide, whereas the secondary segment forms Î²-ladder interactions with the primary segment and passes through the Vps4 pore without making any significant contacts.</p><p>The presented data are of good quality and provide insights into how Vsp4 may simultaneously translocate two polypeptide chains. However, the strong agreement with the previously published structure of linear peptide-bound Vps4 limits the extent of conceptually advances. Due to the use of the specifically-binding F-peptide combined with a low-complexity (G, A, and S-rich) secondary segment, it is not too surprising that affinities and peptide-motor interactions are highly similar or identical to those previously described. The authors strongly generalize their findings and suggest throughout the manuscript, including in the title and abstract, that other AAA+ ATPases may process substrate loops or multiple chains in a very similar manner. However, it is unclear to what extent the observed conformations and interactions are relevant for other AAA+ motors, as the presented structure likely reflects an initiation complex in which a specifically recognized peptide binds with micro-molar affinity to a static, ATP-hydrolysis-deficient Vps4. As acknowledged by the authors, other substrate-bound AAA+ motors do not show peptides in the same Î²-strand conformation with highly ordered subunit contacts, which also makes it unlikely that the secondary strand of a substrate loop forms similar Î²-ladder interactions as observed here for Vps4. Many of these other structures, including the recently published substrate-bound 26S proteasome, suggest less regular, steric interactions of pore-loops with the substrate polypeptide, which may then also involve contacts with a secondary strand when substrate loops are translocated.</p><p>The authors favor a model in which the primary strand binds in C-to-N terminal orientation to the Vps4 subunits A â E, with the secondary strand spared from any interactions. This model would imply that folded domains N-terminal of the motor-bound primary strand would get preferentially unfolded. Biochemical studies of substrate processing by the 26S proteasome (e.g. Piwko and Jentsch, 2006) indicate that initiation on an internal loop can lead to processing of the N-terminal, C-terminal, or both segments, speaking against selective interactions with only the primary strand. It is thus questionable whether the model presented here applies to other AAA+ motors including the proteasome.</p><p>The authors suggest (or imply through their wording) that they identified a new mechanisms of substrate engagement: &quot;Our data indicate a third potential mechanism in which substrate engagement and translocation initiate from an internal segment by binding of a folded hairpin directly within the hexamer pore.&quot; Even though structural data have so far been missing, internal initiation and the translocation of multiple chains had already been well established by extensive biochemical studies, not only for the 26S proteasome, but also for members of the Clp family. These previous studies should be cited and the presented Vps4 structure discussed accordingly.</p><p>Regarding the coupling of ATP hydrolysis and substrate translocation, a similar coordination of conformational changes as described here for subunits F and E has also been observed for subunits of the substrate-engaged 26S proteasome in various stages of the ATPase cycle (de la Pena et al., 2018) and should be discussed.</p><p>The presented structures add some details, but no groundbreaking new findings about the interaction of Vps4 with the VSL domain of the Vta1 activator.</p><p>In summary, even though it is interesting to visualize Vps4 bound to a circular peptide, conceptually new findings are somewhat limited due to the strong similarities to the previously published structures of the linear peptide-bound motor. Since the presented structures likely represent an initiation complex with a tightly binding peptide, it remains unclear to what extent observed interactions apply to processively translocating Vps4 or even other AAA+ motors, especially in light of existing substrate-bound structures that already show deviations in peptide conformations and orientations within the central pore. The authors should try to focus their manuscript primarily on Vps4 and reduce their generalization about the mechanisms of other AAA+ motors. Contrary to the author's suggestion, these structures did not identify a novel mechanism for internal initiation of substrate processing, however, they do represent the first visualization of such a complex. I'll have to leave it to the reviewing editor to decide whether the presented advances are significant enough to consider publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Han, et al. determined a 3.6-Ã structure of the Vps4 AAA+ ATPase, which is essential for dissociating ESCRT complexes, bound to a cyclic peptide containing the Vps2 binding sequence. The significant results are that the peptide is bound in a Î²-ladder hairpin conformation with two strands spanning the Vps4 translocation channel. The Vps2 sequence is bound in the same arrangement with defined pore-loop contacts as previous structures while the returning strand is more flexible and runs along the helical interface without making contact with the hexamer. The structure is important because it shows that two strands can be accommodated in the translocation channel; all previous structures of AAA+ translocases show a single unfolded strand in the channel. The authors model this Î²-hairpin into these previous structures and propose this as evidence that related AAA+s can initiate and translocate internal loops of substrates in addition accessible termini â although this is tenuous given that no experiments directly address this functionally and other AAA+s are not tested. Additionally, the authors are able to increase the occupancy of the Vta1 cofactor subunit and thereby establish its stoichiometry in the complex and improve the reconstruction and modeling of this region compared to previous structures. The work in this manuscript is technically very sound with compelling substrate binding analyses, cryo-EM structure determination and molecular modeling methods. However, two points of concern regarding the functional significance and novelty of these results reduce enthusiasm for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>: (1) These results may be a specific consequence of the experimental setup which includes the use of a cyclic peptide with low-complexity Gly, Ala and Ser residues outside Vps2 that may be required to fit in the channel, use of ADPÂ·BeF<sub>x</sub>, glutaraldehyde crosslinking, and a truncated Vps4 with the VSL domain added for stability. Thus, it is unclear whether a native Vps4 complex could bind the full-length Vps2 substrate by this mechanism or if other AAA+s can translocate multiple strands through the channel. (2) The Vps4 hexamer and bound Vps2 peptide are in an identical configuration and nucleotide state as the two previously published structures (one at higher resolution) by this group and the second strand of the substrate is flexible and passively bound without any specific contacts with the Vps4 channel, thus the insight into the AAA+ translocation mechanism, that Vps4 can accommodate two strands under these conditions, has modest impact to the field.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>-Were other nucleotides tested for binding to the cyclic peptide? Hydrolysable nucleotides, such as ATP or ATPyS, would be worth testing to potentially capture different nucleotide states of the subunits or different translocation intermediates.</p><p>-What is the solution structure of the cyclic peptide? Does it form the Î²-hairpin structure or is this a consequence of Vps4 binding? Perhaps CD spectra of the peptide could be measured.</p><p>-Were other cyclic peptides tested with difference sequences for the hairpin? It seems that this two-stranded Î²-ladder complex may require low complexity or specific amino acids with minimal side chains for the returning strand that is adjacent the Vps2 sequence in order to fit in the channel. Functional significance would be improved if a solution-state Î²-sheet or the full Î±-helix that contains the Vps2 sequence were tested.</p><p>-The occupancy and nucleotide state of the subunits is discussed, but no data is shown in support of this.</p><p>-In their translocation model the authors propose that subunit F, which is disconnected from the substrate and asymmetric with respect to the helical arrangement of the hexamer, moves ~30 Ã to the subunit-A end of the helix during a translocation step. By focussed classification of this region of the hexamer they identify different positions of subunit F. Local resolution for this region is stated to be 4-7 Ã for these classes, however no data is shown. How was the focussed classification performed? Is the cryo-EM density for F improved by focussed classification? Only the Vta1 focussed classification is discussed in the methods. From Figure 4B it is difficult to tell how these positions/conformations of F fit with their translocation model or that &quot;they span a substantial fraction of the path&quot; that is proposed for a translocation step. Please show the range of motion and relative positions of subunit A and E along the channel axis.</p><p>-As rationale for a potential conserved function of AAA+s binding a two-strand Î²-ladder structure the authors make claims that are questionable and not referenced. It is stated &quot;AAA+ ATPases are often thought to initiate substrate engagement from a protein terminus&quot;. Please provide supporting studies for this claim. For AAA+ disaggregases it has been proposed for a number of years that engagement can occur from internal segments (see Haslberger et al., 2008).</p><p>Additionally it is stated that AAA+ hexamerization could occur &quot;around a linear portion of their substrate&quot;, but &quot;this possibility is relevant for family members that show inherently weak hexamerization in the absence of bound substrate but is unlikely to be applicable for robust hexamers like the proteasome and Hsp104&quot;. This claim is inaccurate, and no supporting references are provided. In fact, the &quot;lock washer&quot; helical conformation has only been observed in the presence of substrate for these AAA+s. Crystal structures show a continuous helix, hexamerization is dynamic and dependent on nucleotide state (see DeSantis et al., 2012, Aguado et al., 2015 and Uchihashi et al., 2018) and the substrate-free cryo-EM structures of VAT, ClpB and Hsp104 show an open helical spiral that is an entirely different arrangement and likely incompatible with translocation. Thus, while hexamerization/oligomerization can occur without substrate, these complexes are highly dynamic. Therefore, hexamerization around the substrate or, more likely, passing an internal segment though the seam interface are highly plausible models for engagement of internal segments by the proteasome, Hsp104 and other AAA+s.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Structure of Vps4 with circular peptides and implications for translocation of two polypeptide chains by AAA+ ATPases&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. Although one referee is now in favor of publication, the other (Reviewer 2) raises a few salient points that we feel are worth considering before making a final decision. Please respond to these comments using your best judgement. Once your revised manuscript is received, we will make an editorial decision, with no further input required from the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I appreciate the authors' further discussion about the F-peptide conformation and its similarities to structures observed for related AAA motors. I agree that the overall arrangement and mode of peptide interaction is similar to other motors, as this is largely dictated by the very consistent helical-staircase arrangement of ATPase subunits. The question is about the high regularity of those interactions in Vps4, whether substrates in general have to adopt a defined Î² structure in the pore, and to what extent the observed conformation originates from the tight binding (K<sub>D</sub> = 250 nM) and consequent potential energy minimum of the characterized state. A comparison with peptide conformations in other AAA motors is certainly warranted, but needs careful phrasing, especially because the intermediate resolution of those structures makes an assessment of phi/psi angles difficult. Even for the Vps4 structure presented here, the authors' strong claims about Î² strand conformation is oddly contrasted by their uncertainty about N-to-C or C-to-N directionality of the bound peptide.</p><p>Independent of whether the F-peptide complex is indeed an initiation complex, its high affinity is a bit surprising given the non-specific nature of interactions during substrate translocation. If peptides in general bound with similarly high affinity, as suggested by the authors, I am wondering how Vps4 can maintain a high enough selectivity, and whether the autoinhibitory effect of its MIT domains in the absence of MIM binding would be sufficient to prevent promiscuous, non-specific interactions of all kinds of partially or fully unstructured proteins with the central pore. However, this will have to be addressed in future studies.</p><p>Relevant for the conclusions of this study is to what extent the F-peptide determines the overall conformation and leads to the strong agreement between the linear and circular peptide-bound structures. If this F-peptide binding represents a very general mode with no specific interactions, why do the extended and circular peptides all bind in exactly the same register?</p><p>Some concerns thus remain about the general advance of this study. It is true that a structure of a AAA motor with two polypeptides in the pore has not been described before. Yet, since it perfectly overlays with the previously published linear peptide-bound structure, why is this a &quot;surprising finding for the field&quot;, especially considering that it may largely be determined by the tightly binding F-peptide? The accommodation of a second chain in the central pore is itself not unexpected. If the F-peptide sequence is indeed not &quot;special&quot;, the authors should provide some explanation for why it stays aligned with the motor in exactly the same way for 1 or 2 strands in the pore and all structures analyzed.</p><p>The mechanistic insight of this story would for instance be significantly increased if the authors could reveal whether the motor always selectively interacts with only one strand of particular directionality and spares the other etc.</p><p>Regarding the proposed mechanism for stimulating ATP hydrolysis in subunit D, the authors propose that a subunit F-induced rotation of subunit E's small AAA domain may propagate to the arginine residues to complete coordination of ATP at the subunit D active site. However, this model of arginine engagement does in my opinion not agree with the ambiguous nucleotide density observed at the D-E interface, which was interpreted as ADP or an ADP/ADPÂ·BeF<sub>x</sub> mixture. It is expected that active sites bound to ADP vs. ATP (or ADPÂ·BeF<sub>x</sub>) show significantly different arrangement and distances for the arginine fingers.</p><p>In summary, even though a AAA motor structure with two peptide chains in the central pore has not been presented before, I am not sure whether the mechanistic insight and advance of this manuscript in its current form are high enough for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Han et al., have adequately addressed all reviewer concerns and have made appropriate adjustments to the manuscript text and figures. Some concerns remain about the possibility that the position of the returning strand and hairpin structure in the channel may be specific to the use of these cyclic peptides and Vps4, thereby limiting the potential that this serves as a general translocation mechanism for AAA+s. Nonetheless, I agree with the authors that this work provides the first key structural insight into how AAA+s could potentially initiate from internal segments or translocate through conjugated or crosslinked sites in proteins. Thus, with these changes, I feel this work is sufficient for publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44071.061</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers.

Phyllis Hansonâs lab showed that the human ESCRT-III proteins CHMP2A and CHMP1B contain a segment N-terminal to the MIM sequence that can associate with VPS4 (Shim et al., 2008) and promote ATPase activity (Merrill et al., 2010). We subsequently mapped a relatively tight binding sequence to a 20-residue segment of the yeast CHMP2 homolog, Vps2p (Han et al., 2015), and later found an 8-residue peptide (the F peptide sequence) that maintained similar affinity (Monroe et al., 2017). Although this path would be consistent with having identified an especially tight-binding initiation site, there are multiple reasons to think that the structures do in fact represent the canonical translocating conformation:</p><p>i) Our unpublished studies have now identified multiple unrelated peptide sequences that bind with similar affinity to peptide F, and even one that binds 30 times more strongly. Thus, despite the path that led to its identification, peptide F is not an unusually tight binding sequence.</p><p>ii) The structures show that the residues of peptide F do not make specific interactions. Instead, the structures show that very different side chains bind to a series of essentially identical binding sites (Han et al., 2017). This is exactly the sort of binding mode expected for binding and translocation of the highly diverse sequences found in ESCRT-III subunits.</p><p>iii) The peptide F sequence is not conserved in other ESCRT-III proteins that are substrates for Vps4.</p><p>iv) Finally, <italic><underline>all</underline></italic> of the other AAA ATPase peptide complex structures that have been reported bind peptide in the same manner as we reported for Vps4 (Figure 1). There are a number of points to clarify in this regard:</p><p>Reviewer 1 stated: âMany of these other structures, including the recently published substrate-bound 26S proteasome, suggest less regular, steric interactions of pore-loops with the substrate polypeptide, which may then also involve contacts with a secondary strand when substrate loops are translocatedâ. This is not true. Indeed, the most recent publication of a substrate-bound proteasome cryo-EM structure (Dong et al., 2019), which includes two conformational states that correspond to translocation (third mode), cites our earlier Vps4-subsrate papers in <italic>eLife</italic> in support of their statement: âThe third mode is consistent with the proposed ATP hydrolysis mechanism of several other hexameric ATPase motorsâ. Moreover, overlap on both of the translocating proteasome structures of Dong et al. (PDB 6MSJ and 6MSK) shows very close agreement with the conformation and binding of peptide F by Vps4 (Figure 1). Similarly, overlap on all four of the models deposited for the stalled proteasome complex of de la PeÃ±a et al., (2018) are in close agreement with Vps4substrate coordination (Figure 1). The only deviation from a clear one-to-one match of amino acid residues occurs for one of the four del la PeÃ±a et al. structures (6EF2), where two glycines are modeled in place of one residue of the Vps4-peptide F and the other proteasome structures. This may reflect difficulty of modeling glycine conformations in extended polypeptides at worse than 4Ã resolution, or it may reflect an authentic deviation from the canonical substrate conformation, as might be expected for glycine residues that lack side chains and hence engage only weakly with the AAA ATPase pore (our unpublished data show that Vps4 does not bind polyglycine).</p><p>Even structures that were modeled with the peptide bound in the opposite orientation [YME1 (Puchades et al., 2017; 6AZ0) and TRIP13 (Alferi et al., 2018; PDB 6F OX)] overlap closely with Vps4-peptide F. Although these substrate sequences run in opposite directions, their CÎ± atoms and side chains occupy equivalent positions with respect to the AAA pore loops (Figure 1). Because binding is mediated through side chain interactions, and because CÎ± atoms are superimposable when a Î² strand is modeled in N-to-C or C-to-N directions, the binding geometry and inferred translocation mechanisms are essentially the same as for Vps4.</p><p>Another point of confusion may be that some of the deposited structures [ClpB (Yu et al., 2018, HSP104 (Gates et al., 2017), YME1, and one of the four de la PeÃ±a et al., proteasome models] show one or two residues of the substrate in a non-Î²-strand conformation. Nevertheless, those structures do in fact align closely with Vps4, with the CÎ± atoms and side chains in the equivalent positions (Figure 1). The difference is that one or two non-glycine residues have been built with a positive phi angle in those models, which leaves residues in essentially the same place but does not conform to a Î² conformation. Moreover, given that positive phi angles are improbable for non-glycine residues, we suspect that these structures should be rebuilt and refined in this detail to resemble Vps4 even more closely in details of main chain conformation, in addition to the equivalent positions of side chains that are already apparent.</p><p>In short, there is no reason to think that peptide F binding to Vps4 represents a specialized scenario, and abundant reason to think that it represents a canonical translocating conformation.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The Vps4-peptide F complex superimposes closely with other AAA+ ATPase-substrate complexes.</title><p>Overlap on AAA domains shows that pore loop 1 residues and the C Î± trace of the bound peptides superimpose closely.

One important new insight is the finding that hairpins can be bound, and presumably translocated, using the same mechanism as for a single strand. This is important because, as cited in our manuscript, a number of biochemical experiments [(Lee et al., 2002), (Shabek and Ciechanover, 2010), (Bodnar and Rapoport, 2017), (Burton et al., 2001)] have indicated that two (or more) polypeptide strands can be engaged in the pore of a AAA+ ATPase. Despite this long-standing interest, the mechanism by which this might happen was not indicated by the previous structural studies.</p><p>In order to emphasize this point, the final sentence of the abstract now reads:</p><p>âThese observations indicate a general mechanism by which AAA+ ATPases may translocate a variety of substrates that include extended chains, hairpins, and crosslinked polypeptide chains.â</p><p>Another important conceptual advance follows from our finding that the small domain of subunit E tracks with positions seen by focused classification for subunit F. This indicates a mechanism to trigger ATP hydrolysis specifically at the active site in the final helical subunit interface. Hydrolysis at this site is a fundamental element of the sequential mechanism that has now been proposed by multiple groups, but thus far without an apparent structural basis. Thus, our observation that movement of F (coupled to completion of ATP binding at the subunit F-A interface) displaces the subunit E small domain and hence the subunit E trigger arginine residues that complete the subunit D active site, suggests an elegant structural mechanism that can be explored in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Concern #3: The low complexity of the secondary strand may allow its return through the central pore without making any motor contacts, and that this may not therefore reflect a normal two-strand operation mode of AAA peptide translocases on more complex sequences.</p></disp-quote><p>This concern is valid for one of the two structures that we reported (cF30), but it does not apply to the other structure (cFF30) described in our manuscript. The circular cFF30 peptide includes two complex âFâ sequences separated from each other by 6 residues on one side and 8 residues on the other. The 6residue linker is of low complexity, but the 8-residue linker contains two lysines and a cysteine. Our structure shows the primary strand comprising an F peptide flanked by two additional residues on both sides. Thus, the configurations that most closely match the reviewers concern have a tight, reverse turn starting at the last residue (or going into the first residue) of the primary strand. As shown in Figure 2, these would still put five or six âhigh complexityâ residues within the central region of the pore on the secondary strand. Moreover, the structure shows ample space for large side chains to be accommodated on the secondary strand of the bound cyclic peptide, and their lack of side chain density is explained by high mobility in the unconstrained environment and expectation that multiple sequence registers are represented. In short, the assertion that the secondary strand passes through the pore with low complexity residues is not correct.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>The cFF30 peptide displays âhigh complexityâ residues on both strands in the pore.</title><p>The map shows that a peptide F sequence (red font) binds in the central region of the primary strand and that this is flanked by two ordered glycine residues on each side.

The authors used circularized 30-mer peptides with one or two copies of the 8-residue segment DEIVNKVL (F peptide) that was derived from the ESCRT-II subunit Vps2, specifically binds to the Vps4 pore, and whose structure bound to Vps4 has previously been solved by the same group. This primary segment of the circular peptides was found to bind indistinguishably from the linear peptide, whereas the secondary segment forms Î²-ladder interactions with the primary segment and passes through the Vps4 pore without making any significant contacts.</p><p>The presented data are of good quality and provide insights into how Vsp4 may simultaneously translocate two polypeptide chains. However, the strong agreement with the previously published structure of linear peptide-bound Vps4 limits the extent of conceptually advances.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, an important conceptual advance is that two strands can bind, and presumably be translocated, using the same mechanism as employed for a linear-bound peptide. This insight was not anticipated in previous publications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Due to the use of the specifically-binding F-peptide combined with a low-complexity (G, A, and S-rich) secondary segment, it is not too surprising that affinities and peptide-motor interactions are highly similar or identical to those previously described.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed under concern #3, above, the secondary segment is not low complexity in the case of peptide cFF30.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors strongly generalize their findings and suggest throughout the manuscript, including in the title and abstract, that other AAA+ ATPases may process substrate loops or multiple chains in a very similar manner. However, it is unclear to what extent the observed conformations and interactions are relevant for other AAA+ motors, as the presented structure likely reflects an initiation complex in which a specifically recognized peptide binds with micro-molar affinity to a static, ATP-hydrolysis-deficient Vps4. As acknowledged by the authors, other substrate-bound AAA+ motors do not show peptides in the same Î²-strand conformation with highly ordered subunit contacts, which also makes it unlikely that the secondary strand of a substrate loop forms similar Î²-ladder interactions as observed here for Vps4. Many of these other structures, including the recently published substrate-bound 26S proteasome, suggest less regular, steric interactions of pore-loops with the substrate polypeptide, which may then also involve contacts with a secondary strand when substrate loops are translocated.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed under concern #1, above, it seems unlikely that our structure represents an initiation complex. Moreover, our structure is in fact very similar to essentially all other substrate-bound AAA+ motors, and that deviations in the other substrate complexes likely represent sloppy model building (positive phi angles) or special cases such as localized glycine residues. As indicated under Concern #1, the point has been clarified in the revised manuscript by adjusting wording in the first paragraph of the Results section and Discussion section and by adding a citation to a review that was published since our original submission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors favor a model in which the primary strand binds in C-to-N terminal orientation to the Vps4 subunits A â E, with the secondary strand spared from any interactions. This model would imply that folded domains N-terminal of the motor-bound primary strand would get preferentially unfolded. Biochemical studies of substrate processing by the 26S proteasome (e.g. Piwko and Jentsch, 2006) indicate that initiation on an internal loop can lead to processing of the N-terminal, C-terminal, or both segments, speaking against selective interactions with only the primary strand. It is thus questionable whether the model presented here applies to other AAA+ motors including the proteasome.</p></disp-quote><p>We do favor one orientation of peptide binding for Vps4, but our manuscript makes it clear that we have are unable to definitively determine the orientation of binding from the current data. For example, the âCircular peptides bind the Vps4 pore in a hairpin conformationâ section includes the sentences: âThe map-model correlation coefficients and the EMRinger scores (Barad et al., 2015) all slightly favor the assigned orientation, but are not definitive. This ambiguity is expected for the current 3.6 Ã resolution, and the peptide orientation remains an important question for future studies.â</p><p>We also make it clear that other AAA+ ATPases appear to bind substrate in the opposite orientation and that the same mechanism can apply in either orientation. For example, the subsection âImplications for mechanism and functionâ now includes:</p><p>âThis orientation is consistent with the biological role of Vps4 in translocating toward the ESCRT-III N-terminal domain, but other AAA+ ATPases apparently translocate their protein substrates in the opposite direction (N-to-C) (Alfieri et al., 2018; Puchades et al., 2017) or in either direction (Augustyniak and Kay, 2018). Indeed, the same mechanism of translocation could be applied to substrates bound with their primary strand in either orientation because side chains make a major contribution to binding, and forward and reversed Î²-strands can superimpose their CÎ± atoms and side chains.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors suggest (or imply through their wording) that they identified a new mechanisms of substrate engagement: &quot;Our data indicate a third potential mechanism in which substrate engagement and translocation initiate from an internal segment by binding of a folded hairpin directly within the hexamer pore.&quot; Even though structural data have so far been missing, internal initiation and the translocation of multiple chains had already been well established by extensive biochemical studies, not only for the 26S proteasome, but also for members of the Clp family. These previous studies should be cited and the presented Vps4 structure discussed accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. Accordingly, we have deleted discussion of initiation of translation from an internal loop in the revised manuscript. As suggested, we have retained the discussion of implications for translation of more than one polypeptide chain at a time, and have cited literature reporting this activity of the 26S proteasome, ClpX, and Cdc48.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the coupling of ATP hydrolysis and substrate translocation, a similar coordination of conformational changes as described here for subunits F and E has also been observed for subunits of the substrate-engaged 26S proteasome in various stages of the ATPase cycle (de la Pena et al., 2018) and should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The beautiful paper by de la Pena et al., is cited in the first paragraph of the Introduction, where the similarity between this proteasome structure(s) and structures of other AAA+ ATPase complexes with substrate peptides is used to set up the argument in favor of the sequential, hand-over-hand, conveyer-belt model. The de la Pena et al. paper is also cited in the section âComparison with other AAA+ ATPase-peptide complexesâ. The de la Pena et al., paper is not cited, however, in the section âInsights to coupling of ATPase activity and substrate translocationâ. This is because this section focuses on the question of how ATP hydrolysis is selectively triggered at the subunit D active site given that the subunit A, B, C, and D active sites appear to be essentially identical. Our Monroe et al., 2017 paper was the first to propose subunit D as the site of ATP hydrolysis and, indeed, the directionality of translocation seems to make selective hydrolysis at this site a mechanistic requirement. While the de la Pena et al. paper provides multiple important insights, at our reading it does not seem to address the question of how hydrolysis is selectively favored at the site equivalent to Vps4 subunit D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The presented structures add some details, but no groundbreaking new findings about the interaction of Vps4 with the VSL domain of the Vta1 activator.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these details are not as important as the finding that two polypeptides can bind the pore in the same manner as a single extended chain, and by implication can be translocated using the same mechanism.

Since the presented structures likely represent an initiation complex with a tightly binding peptide, it remains unclear to what extent observed interactions apply to processively translocating Vps4 or even other AAA+ motors, especially in light of existing substrate-bound structures that already show deviations in peptide conformations and orientations within the central pore. The authors should try to focus their manuscript primarily on Vps4 and reduce their generalization about the mechanisms of other AAA+ motors. Contrary to the author's suggestion, these structures did not identify a novel mechanism for internal initiation of substrate processing, however, they do represent the first visualization of such a complex. I'll have to leave it to the reviewing editor to decide whether the presented advances are significant enough to consider publication in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a clear summary of reviewer #1 concerns, each of which was addressed individually above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript Han, et al. determined a 3.6-Ã structure of the Vps4 AAA+ ATPase, which is essential for dissociating ESCRT complexes, bound to a cyclic peptide containing the Vps2 binding sequence. The significant results are that the peptide is bound in a Î²-ladder hairpin conformation with two strands spanning the Vps4 translocation channel. The Vps2 sequence is bound in the same arrangement with defined pore-loop contacts as previous structures while the returning strand is more flexible and runs along the helical interface without making contact with the hexamer. The structure is important because it shows that two strands can be accommodated in the translocation channel; all previous structures of AAA+ translocases show a single unfolded strand in the channel. The authors model this Î²-hairpin into these previous structures and propose this as evidence that related AAA+s can initiate and translocate internal loops of substrates in addition accessible termini â although this is tenuous given that no experiments directly address this functionally and other AAA+s are not tested. Additionally, the authors are able to increase the occupancy of the Vta1 cofactor subunit and thereby establish its stoichiometry in the complex and improve the reconstruction and modeling of this region compared to previous structures. The work in this manuscript is technically very sound with compelling substrate binding analyses, cryo-EM structure determination and molecular modeling methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this summary of the primary findings in our manuscript. We also agree that the modeling with other AAA+ ATPase is necessarily speculative, although we are more confident in the relevance of this comparative analysis than the reviewer, whose concerns may be influenced by misunderstanding about the nature of the Vps4 complexes. As discussed elsewhere, the Vps4 complexes do not appear to be specialized initiation states, but are instead highly representative of translocating complexes of AAA+ ATPases in general.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, two points of concern regarding the functional significance and novelty of these results reduce enthusiasm for publication in eLife: (1) These results may be a specific consequence of the experimental setup which includes the use of a cyclic peptide with low-complexity Gly, Ala and Ser residues outside Vps2 that may be required to fit in the channel, use of ADPÂ·BeF<sub>x</sub>, glutaraldehyde crosslinking, and a truncated Vps4 with the VSL domain added for stability. Thus, it is unclear whether a native Vps4 complex could bind the full-length Vps2 substrate by this mechanism or if other AAA+s can translocate multiple strands through the channel.</p></disp-quote><p>The issues raised in this paragraph are each addressed separately:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(i) Use of a cyclic peptide with low-complexity Gly, Ala and Ser residues outside of Vps2 that may be required to fit in the channel.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above under Concern #3, this concern is not valid for the cFF30 peptide whose binding affinities and Vps4 complex structure are reported in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(ii) Use of ADPÂ·BeF<sub>x</sub>.</p></disp-quote><p>We donât agree that this should be a concern. It is usual for nonhydrolyzable analogs such as ATPÎ³S, AMPPNP and ADPÂ·BeF<sub>x</sub> to be used to visualize the active state of ATPases. If not inhibited with a non-hydrolyzeable nucleotide, ATPases are almost invariably inhibited by mutagenesis or by some other inhibitor (such as inhibition of deubiquitylation by the proteasome. It is curious that we observe peptide binding in the presence of ADPÂ·BeF<sub>x</sub> or ADPÂ·AlF<sub>x</sub> but not in the presence of ATPÎ³S or AMPPNP (Han et al., 2015). However, a good explanation is provided in the same Han et al. 2015 study, which found that ADPÂ·BeF<sub>x</sub> and ADPÂ·AlF<sub>x</sub> are more effective at stabilizing the Vps4 hexamer. This implies that ADP metal fluorides are better mimics of ATP in the Vps4 active site than ATPÎ³S or AMPPNP, which is quite reasonable give the extensive coordination of phosphates in Vps4 active site.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(iii) Glutaraldehyde crosslinking.</p></disp-quote><p>The use of glutaraldehyde crosslinking is commonly employed in many cryo-EM structure determinations to protect the complex against disruptive interactions with the air interface immediately prior to vitrification.

We do not intend for that to be taken as a conclusion of this study, and have clarified this point by modifying the subsection âComparison with other AAA+ ATPase-peptide complexesâ to include the text:âThus, regardless of whether or not Vps4 binds its substrates in a hairpin conformation in vivo, it seem likely that at least some of the AAA+ ATPases may use the same mechanism to translocate linear polypeptides and more complex substrates, such as protein loops, crosslinked substrates, and ubiquitin adducts, as have been indicated for the proteasome (Kraut and Matouschek, 2011; Lee et al., 2002; Shabek and Ciechanover, 2010), CDC48 (Bodnar and Rapoport, 2017), and ClpX (Burton et al., 2001).</p><p>(vi) <italic>â¦ or if other AAA+s can translocate multiple strands through the channel.</italic></p><p>Biochemical studies have already established that other AAA+ ATPase can translocate multiple strands through the channel.

A key point of our paper, therefore, is not that Vps4 does translocate a hairpin structure for any specific substrate, but rather that</p><p>Vps4 and presumably other AAA+ ATPases appear to have the potential to translocate two-strand substrates using the same mechanism as inferred for single strand substrates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Vps4 hexamer and bound Vps2 peptide are in an identical configuration and nucleotide state as the two previously published structures (one at higher resolution) by this group and the second strand of the substrate is flexible and passively bound without any specific contacts with the Vps4 channel, thus the insight into the AAA+ translocation mechanism, that Vps4 can accommodate two strands under these conditions, has modest impact to the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the observation that two strands can bind and (presumably) be processed in the same way as a single strand is a surprising finding for the field. The point is not that a different mechanism of translocation has been found, but that the same mechanism likely applies to a substantially different substrate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>-Were other nucleotides tested for binding to the cyclic peptide? Hydrolysable nucleotides, such as ATP or ATPyS, would be worth testing to potentially capture different nucleotide states of the subunits or different translocation intermediates.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not test different nucleotides in this study. We previously surveyed binding of linear peptides in the presence of multiple different nucleotides (ADP, ATP, ATPÎ³S, AMPPNP, ADPÂ·BeF<sub>x</sub>, and ADPÂ·BeF<sub>x</sub>), and only detected binding to ADPÂ·AlF<sub>x</sub> and ADPÂ·BeF<sub>x</sub> (Han et al., 2015). The absence of binding to ATP makes sense because, unlike a number of the other recently reported AAA+ ATPase structures, the enzyme we are using has the wild type sequence and an intact active site. Therefore, as soon as a short peptide binds in the presence of ATP is expected to be translocated off the enzyme. The absence of binding to the other nucleotides likely reflects the lower stability of the Vps4 hexamer that we see in the presence of those nucleotides as judged by size exclusion chromatography (Han et al., 2015). Our preferred interpretation, therefore, is that ADPÂ·AlF<sub>x</sub> and ADPÂ·BeF<sub>x</sub> are better mimics of non-hydrolysable ATP at the Vps4 active sites. It is possible that altered biochemical conditions would reveal biochemical binding of peptide in the presence of different nucleotides. But we donât consider that possibility to be of sufficient importance to merit further study at this time, especially because our structure of the Vps4 complex resembles structures of multiple other AAA+ ATPases (including Vps4; Su et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2017) determined in a variety of active, inactive, and nucleotide-bound states (Han and Hill, 2019).</p><p>In order to reduce potential confusion over this issue, the first paragraph of the Results section in the revised manuscript now includes âADPÂ·BeF<sub>x</sub> was used as the non-hydrolysable ATP analog because our earlier studies indicated that it stabilizes the Vps4 hexamer and supports peptide binding to a greater extent than ADPPNP or ATPÎ³S, presumably because it is a better mimic of ATP at the Vps4 active siteâ</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-What is the solution structure of the cyclic peptide? Does it form the Î²-hairpin structure or is this a consequence of Vps4 binding? Perhaps CD spectra of the peptide could be measured.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not believe that this proposed experiment would provide an important insight. It seems likely that the cyclic peptide adopts a variety of conformations in solution, include those with some Î²-hairpin character.

Importantly, the Î²-hairpin conformation is an energetically accessible conformation for essentially all sequences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Were other cyclic peptides tested with difference sequences for the hairpin? It seems that this two-stranded Î²-ladder complex may require low complexity or specific amino acids with minimal side chains for the returning strand that is adjacent the Vps2 sequence in order to fit in the channel. Functional significance would be improved if a solution-state Î²-sheet or the full Î±-helix that contains the Vps2 sequence were tested.</p></disp-quote><p>Two different peptides are presented in our manuscript, one of which (cF30) has an extended stretch of low complexity residues, the other of which (cFF30) avoids an extended stretch of low complexity residues specifically to mitigate this concern. We do not believe it would be highly informative to survey a few more individual sequences. Rather, now that we have established the possibility of hairpin structures binding in the same manner as single chains, our focus will be on determining whether or not this can and does occur with the authentic substrates of a variety of AAA+ ATPases. Although resolving that important question is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-The occupancy and nucleotide state of the subunits is discussed, but no data is shown in support of this.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not emphasize this in the submitted manuscript because the observations are essentially identical to our findings with Vps4 in complex with a linear peptide (Han et al., 2017).

Local resolution for this region is stated to be 4-7 Ã for these classes, however no data is shown. How was the focussed classification performed? Is the cryo-EM density for F improved by focussed classification? Only the Vta1 focussed classification is discussed in the methods. From Figure 4B it is difficult to tell how these positions/conformations of F fit with their translocation model or that &quot;they span a substantial fraction of the path&quot; that is proposed for a translocation step. Please show the range of motion and relative positions of subunit A and E along the channel axis.</p></disp-quote><p>The Materials and methods section has been updated to describe how the subunit F data were processed.

It is stated &quot;AAA+ ATPases are often thought to initiate substrate engagement from a protein terminus&quot;. Please provide supporting studies for this claim. For AAA+ disaggregases it has been proposed for a number of years that engagement can occur from internal segments (see Haslberger et al., 2008).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We have removed the claim that AAA+ ATPases are thought to initiate from a protein terminus from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally it is stated that AAA+ hexamerization could occur &quot;around a linear portion of their substrate&quot;, but &quot;this possibility is relevant for family members that show inherently weak hexamerization in the absence of bound substrate but is unlikely to be applicable for robust hexamers like the proteasome and Hsp104&quot;. This claim is inaccurate, and no supporting references are provided. In fact, the &quot;lock washer&quot; helical conformation has only been observed in the presence of substrate for these AAA+s. Crystal structures show a continuous helix, hexamerization is dynamic and dependent on nucleotide state (see DeSantis et al., 2012, Aguado et al., 2015 and Uchihashi et al., 2018) and the substrate-free cryo-EM structures of VAT, ClpB and Hsp104 show an open helical spiral that is an entirely different arrangement and likely incompatible with translocation. Thus, while hexamerization/oligomerization can occur without substrate, these complexes are highly dynamic. Therefore, hexamerization around the substrate or, more likely, passing an internal segment though the seam interface are highly plausible models for engagement of internal segments by the proteasome, Hsp104 and other AAA+s.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the qualifier about robust hexamers from the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>I appreciate the authors' further discussion about the F-peptide conformation and its similarities to structures observed for related AAA motors. I agree that the overall arrangement and mode of peptide interaction is similar to other motors, as this is largely dictated by the very consistent helical-staircase arrangement of ATPase subunits. The question is about the high regularity of those interactions in Vps4, whether substrates in general have to adopt a defined Î² structure in the pore, and to what extent the observed conformation originates from the tight binding (K<sub>D</sub> = 250 nM) and consequent potential energy minimum of the characterized state. A comparison with peptide conformations in other AAA motors is certainly warranted, but needs careful phrasing, especially because the intermediate resolution of those structures makes an assessment of phi/psi angles difficult. Even for the Vps4 structure presented here, the authors' strong claims about Î² strand conformation is oddly contrasted by their uncertainty about N-to-C or C-to-N directionality of the bound peptide.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised text notes the observed similarity between reported structures, why we favor a canonical Î² conformation for bound substrate, the limits of the current structural models, and the likelihood that some variation from the standard Î² conformation. Specifically, we have included the following text in the introduction: âThese AAA+ ATPase complexes bind the substrate polypeptide in the central pore in an extended conformation, which in the case of Vps4 has been modeled as a Î²-strand-like conformation whose right-handed helical symmetry (60Â° rotation and ~6.5 Ã displacement every two amino acid residues) matches the symmetry of the helical AAA+ ATPase subunits (Han et al., 2017; Monroe et al., 2017). Although the resolution of currently available AAA+ ATPase substrate complexes makes it challenging to model precise details of the substrate structure, this conformation is appealing because it allows the substrate to bind the helical AAA+ ATPase subunits with successive dipeptides of the substrate making equivalent interactions with the enzyme and because it is accessible for almost all amino acid residues. Some variation from the canonical conformation is likely to occur, especially for sequences that contain proline, which has a fixed -60Â° phi angle, and glycine, which is flexible and lacks a side chain, which seems to be an important for binding.â.</p><p>The reason we can make stronger claims about Î² conformation than about peptide directionality is two-fold. Primarily, it is much easier to tell from medium resolution maps whether or not a segment is in a Î² conformation than its direction. Unlike helices, for which the direction of the side chain gives a clear indication of directionality, strands lack any such indicator. Indeed, at medium resolution the density for Î² strands is almost exactly superimposable in N to C vs C to N directions. The distinction only becomes apparent when the resolution is sufficient to resolve main chain carbonyl groups. Second, in all of the reported structures, the AAA+ ATPase pore loops that mediate binding display the same symmetry as a Î² strand, thereby providing a chemical rationale for why substrate should bind in a Î² conformation. No equivalent rationale is strongly apparent for a preferred orientation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Independent of whether the F-peptide complex is indeed an initiation complex, its high affinity is a bit surprising given the non-specific nature of interactions during substrate translocation. If peptides in general bound with similarly high affinity, as suggested by the authors, I am wondering how Vps4 can maintain a high enough selectivity, and whether the autoinhibitory effect of its MIT domains in the absence of MIM binding would be sufficient to prevent promiscuous, non-specific interactions of all kinds of partially or fully unstructured proteins with the central pore. However, this will have to be addressed in future studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We note that Vps4 selectivity is currently understood to be maintained by (at least) two mechanisms: MIT autoinhibition (as noted by the review) and assembly. In the former case, our published biochemical studies (Han et al., JBC, 2015) have demonstrated that MIT-mediated autoinhibition is sufficient to block binding of peptides that have comparable affinity to peptide F. In the latter case, binding of the Vps4 N-terminal MIT domain to MIM motifs on ESCRT-III subunits recruits Vps4 to high local concentration at filaments of ESCRT-III subunits. This high local concentration, coupled with the associated high local concentration of the Vta1 cofactor protein, promotes Vps4 assembly to the active hexameric state only when the enzyme is associated with the ESCRT-III substrate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Relevant for the conclusions of this study is to what extent the F-peptide determines the overall conformation and leads to the strong agreement between the linear and circular peptide-bound structures. If this F-peptide binding represents a very general mode with no specific interactions, why do the extended and circular peptides all bind in exactly the same register?</p></disp-quote><p>Register is not rigorously defined because, as acknowledged in the text, we canât confidently determine whether the peptide binds in the N to C or the C to N directions.</p><p>Nevertheless, we can see that all of peptide F is ordered in the previously reported structures with the linear 8-residue peptide. We are confident that this binds in the register modeled â or its reverse or a mixture of both orientations â because the density has the right length to accommodate 8 residues and because the structure presents 8 side chain binding pockets. Alternative registers are presumably avoided because they would lose the binding energy associated with occupying one or more of the 8 available binding pockets.</p><p>Similarly, the cF30 and cFF30 peptides were designed with two glycine residues flanking each of the 8-residue peptide F sequences. Because polyglycine binding to Vps4 is undetectable â which is still unpublished but is anticipated from the structure â the same argument applies: a shift in register will be disfavored because it would result in the loss of favorable interactions with a substrate side chain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some concerns thus remain about the general advance of this study. It is true that a structure of a AAA motor with two polypeptides in the pore has not been described before. Yet, since it perfectly overlays with the previously published linear peptide-bound structure, why is this a &quot;surprising finding for the field&quot;, especially considering that it may largely be determined by the tightly binding F-peptide?</p></disp-quote><p>The revised manuscript does not describe any of the findings as being surprising or unexpected, etc. Nevertheless, we believe it is important because there is clear evidence in multiple systems that AAA ATPases must be able to accommodate two different polypeptide strands (e.g., as when translocating from the middle of a polypeptide substrate or when translocating ubiquitinated substrates), and the structure provides the first visualization of how two polypeptide strands can be accommodated within the central pore of the hexamer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The accommodation of a second chain in the central pore is itself not unexpected. If the F-peptide sequence is indeed not &quot;special&quot;, the authors should provide some explanation for why it stays aligned with the motor in exactly the same way for 1 or 2 strands in the pore and all structures analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason for conserved alignment/register is explained above. Peptide F is âspecialâ in the sense that in the contexts we have studied it is either always flanked by glycines, which do not bind Vps4 detectably, or it exists on its own as just the 8-residue peptide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The mechanistic insight of this story would for instance be significantly increased if the authors could reveal whether the motor always selectively interacts with only one strand of particular directionality and spares the other etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the question of directionality is very interesting, and we are actively pursuing it at this time. However, it is not trivial to resolve at the currently available resolution, and is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the proposed mechanism for stimulating ATP hydrolysis in subunit D, the authors propose that a subunit F-induced rotation of subunit E's small AAA domain may propagate to the arginine residues to complete coordination of ATP at the subunit D active site. However, this model of arginine engagement does in my opinion not agree with the ambiguous nucleotide density observed at the D-E interface, which was interpreted as ADP or an ADP/ADPÂ·BeF<sub>x</sub> mixture. It is expected that active sites bound to ADP vs. ATP (or ADPÂ·BeF<sub>x</sub>) show significantly different arrangement and distances for the arginine fingers.</p></disp-quote><p>The ambiguous nature of nucleotide density at the subunit D active site is an observation (albeit one that is not very satisfying!). This does not alter the facts that the finger arginines are important for ATP binding, that their displacement will be tightly coupled to the hydrolysis reaction, and that apparent movement of subunit F is coupled to finger arginines at the subunit D active site through correlated motion of the subunit E small ATPase domain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, even though a AAA motor structure with two peptide chains in the central pore has not been presented before, I am not sure whether the mechanistic insight and advance of this manuscript in its current form are high enough for publication in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>The question of impact inevitably has a subjective element. We appreciate the thoughtful feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Han et al., have adequately addressed all reviewer concerns and have made appropriate adjustments to the manuscript text and figures. Some concerns remain about the possibility that the position of the returning strand and hairpin structure in the channel may be specific to the use of these cyclic peptides and Vps4, thereby limiting the potential that this serves as a general translocation mechanism for AAA+s. Nonetheless, I agree with the authors that this work provides the first key structural insight into how AAA+s could potentially initiate from internal segments or translocate through conjugated or crosslinked sites in proteins. Thus, with these changes, I feel this work is sufficient for publication.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the positive comments and the assessment that this work is sufficient for publication.</p></body></sub-article></article>
