However, how they coordinate to determine longevity and if they act via separable mechanisms is unclear. Here, we show that neuronal AMPK is essential for lifespan extension from TORC1 inhibition, and that TORC1 suppression increases lifespan cell non autonomously via distinct mechanisms from global AMPK activation. Lifespan extension by null mutations in genes encoding <italic>raga-1</italic> (RagA) or <italic>rsks-1</italic> (S6K) is fully suppressed by neuronal-specific rescues. Loss of RAGA-1 increases lifespan via maintaining mitochondrial fusion. Neuronal RAGA-1 abrogation of <italic>raga-1</italic> mutant longevity requires UNC-64/syntaxin, and promotes mitochondrial fission cell nonautonomously. Finally, deleting the mitochondrial fission factor DRP-1 renders the animal refractory to the pro-aging effects of neuronal RAGA-1. Our results highlight a new role for neuronal TORC1 in cell nonautonomous regulation of longevity, and suggest TORC1 in the central nervous system might be targeted to promote healthy aging.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>TORC1</kwd><kwd>AMPK</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01AG044346</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mair</surname><given-names>William, B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01AG059595</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mair</surname><given-names>William</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Modulating the nutrient sensor TORC1 only in neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is sufficient to regulate systemic longevity via inter-tissue signals that remodel mitochondria networks in non neuronal cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging is the single biggest risk factor for the majority of non-communicable complex diseases, including some of those with the greatest negative impact on human health outcomes worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Escoubas et al., 2017</xref>). Work over the last two decades has uncovered molecular mechanisms that can be manipulated in model organisms to modulate the aging process and reduce overall disease risk in old age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fontana et al., 2010</xref>). Many of these interventions have been linked to nutrient and energy sensing pathways, whose modulation genetically or pharmacologically mimics the effects of dietary restriction on healthy aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fontana and Partridge, 2015</xref>). One classic example of a nutrient sensor linked to longevity is TORC1, which promotes anabolic processes such as protein translation to provide macromolecules for growth and proliferation while inhibiting catabolic activities such as autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert and Hall, 2015</xref>). TORC1 is activated by growth factors and amino acids, the latter of which act through sensors such as the sestrins to facilitate heterodimer formation of the Rag proteins (consisting of RagA, B, C and D in mammals), an essential step for TORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). Suppression of TORC1 both genetically and pharmacologically, via rapamycin feeding, promotes longevity in multiple species from yeast to mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kennedy and Lamming, 2016</xref>). In contrast to TORC1, the conserved kinase AMPK is activated under low energy conditions. AMPK activation promotes catabolic processes that generate ATP, including the TCA cycle, fatty acid oxidation and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burkewitz et al., 2014</xref>), and extends lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apfeld et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mair et al., 2011</xref>) and fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stenesen et al., 2013</xref>). Given the antagonistic roles of TORC1 and AMPK in nutrient-sensing, metabolism and longevity, it is perhaps intuitive that they are mechanistically linked. Indeed, in mammals, AMPK is generally regarded as an upstream suppressor of TORC1 as it phosphorylates the TSC complex and raptor to inhibit TORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gwinn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Inoki et al., 2003</xref>). Conversely, TORC1 signaling has been suggested to inhibit AMPK via p70 ribosomal protein S6 Kinase (S6K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dagon et al., 2012</xref>). However, much of the work elucidating how AMPK and TORC1 interact has been performed in vitro in cell culture studies and it remains unclear in multicellular organisms whether TORC1 and AMPK causally coordinate to modulate the aging process.</p><p>Here, we elucidate the relationship between AMPK and TORC1 in the modulation of aging by discovering a critical role for neuronal AMPK in lifespan extension resulting from suppression of TORC1 components in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We show that neuronal TORC1 pathway activity itself is critical for healthy aging. Restoring either <italic>raga-1</italic> or <italic>rsks-1</italic> (encoding the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologue of S6 Kinase) only in neurons fully suppresses lifespan extension in animals lacking the respective TORC1 component in all other cell types. However, the downstream effectors of AMPK longevity and TORC1 longevity appear separable; constitutive activation of CREB regulated transcriptional coactivator ‘CRTC’−1, which suppresses AMPK longevity, does not suppress lifespan extension by TORC1 suppression. We show that neuronal RAGA-1 regulates metabolic genes in distal tissues and critically requires UNC-64/syntaxin exocytosis to modulate systemic longevity. Using RNA-Seq and in vivo reporters, we identify mitochondrial network state as the downstream mechanism for lifespan regulation by neuronal RAGA-1. Neuronal RAGA-1 activity regulates mitochondrial networks in distal tissues cell nonautonomously and this regulation is required for the effect of neuronal RAGA-1 on the aging process. Together, our data provide key insights into the tissue-specific roles of TORC1 suppression in healthy aging and highlight the nervous system as a putative target site for future pharmacological interventions aimed at the TORC1 pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AMPK is required for longevity mediated by TORC1 suppression</title><p>AMPK is canonically regarded as an upstream suppressor of TORC1.

We measured AMPK activity, using antibodies targeting phosphorylation of the α catalytic subunit at threonine 172, a site in the activation loop that is a hallmark of AMPK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hardie et al., 2012</xref>). This phosphorylation site is conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> on the two AMPKα subunits, AAK-1 and AAK-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apfeld et al., 2004</xref>) and its phosphorylation has been used to measure AMPK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Selman et al., 2009</xref>). To confirm conservation, we generated animals carrying a CRISPR induced threonine-to-alanine mutation at T243 on AAK-2, the residue homologous to mammalian T172.

These data suggest that indeed, neuronal TORC1 modulates lifespan via cell nonautonomous effects on mitochondrial dynamics. In summary, our results highlight a critical role of neuronal TORC1 activity on healthy aging, and suggest that lifespan extension by reduced TORC1 signaling requires a fused mitochondrial network which itself can be modulated via TORC1 activity in neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Taken together, our data suggest that AMPK and TORC1 can coordinate in neurons to modulate systemic organismal aging cell nonautonomously. Although primarily AMPK is regarded as an upstream suppressor of TORC1, our data suggest that for aging, lifespan extension via suppression of TORC1 activates and requires functional AMPK in neurons. However, lifespan extension by TORC1 suppression and AMPK activation in <italic>C elegans</italic> differ in two key aspects. First, expression of CRTC-1<sup>S76A, S179A</sup> in neurons completely suppresses AMPK longevity but has little effect on <italic>raga-1</italic> mutant lifespan. Second, whereas AMPK longevity requires both mitochondrial fusion and fission mechanisms to be functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weir et al., 2017</xref>), lifespan extension by <italic>raga-1</italic> deletion only requires mitochondrial fusion. Therefore, although both AMPK and TORC1 can modulate longevity and mitochondria dynamics cell nonautonomously in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, both the origin of those neuronal signals and the functional role mitochondria play in responding to them appear to differ.</p><p>Many of the described experiments used FUDR, a chemical inhibitor of thymidine synthesis, to block the production of progeny. While the actions of FUDR in postmitotic adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> are thought to act primarily in the germline to inhibit DNA replication in the dividing germ cells, there is also evidence that FUDR can act in somatic tissue and can lead to complex interactions with various genes and treatments in the regulation of lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>). As such, we chose a relatively small dose (40 μM) to use for our experiments, and importantly, verified key findings in lifespan experiments that did not use FUDR.</p><p>Beyond requiring LKB1/PAR-4, how TORC1 suppression activates AMPK in <italic>C. elegans</italic> remains unclear. S6K inhibits AMPK in mouse hypothalamus via S485 (or 491 depending on the isoform) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dagon et al., 2012</xref>). Although our data suggest the conserved serine 551 residue is an inhibitory phosphorylation site in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, phosphorylation of AAK-2 S551 is not required for TORC1 mediated longevity. Several additional mechanisms have been recently identified that modulate AMPK activity, including an increasing number of post-translational modifications of the α subunit, expression levels of γ subunits and recruitment of LKB1 to lysosomal surface by the scaffold protein AXIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hardie, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tullet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). It remains to be tested whether these mechanisms are utilized by TORC1 to modulate AMPK in neurons, and whether they are relevant in the context of aging. Interestingly, <italic>rsks-1</italic> mutants require the creatine kinase, ARGK-1, which is primarily expressed in glial cells, to activate AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McQuary et al., 2016</xref>). S6K1 has also been shown to inhibit AMPK in the hypothalamus in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dagon et al., 2012</xref>). Together these data support a hypothesis that AMPK mediates TORC1 longevity in neurons.</p><p>While AMPK has been shown to act in neurons to promote longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burkewitz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ulgherait et al., 2014</xref>), one highlight of our study is that TORC1 itself has critical functions in neurons to modulate lifespan. It is especially striking that when TORC1 signaling is suppressed in all the major metabolically active tissues in <italic>C. elegans</italic> but active in neurons, animals are not long lived. <italic>raga-1</italic> or <italic>rsks-1</italic> neuronal rescued animals share non-aging related phenotypes with <italic>raga-1</italic> or <italic>rsks-1</italic> mutants, such as smaller body size, delayed development and reduced brood size (data not shown). These results suggest that neuronal TORC1 might modulate lifespan through a specific mechanism that is uncoupled from the broad effects of TORC1 on growth and anabolism, for example via its regulation of insulin-like or other neuropeptides that act systemically to regulate longevity. Understanding where and how RAGA-1 acts in the nervous system and whether suppressing TORC1 signaling only in neurons either genetically or pharmacologically is sufficient to promote healthy aging is now a key future goal.</p><p>Our data suggest that neuropeptide signals may act downstream of neuronal TORC1 to communicate with peripheral tissues. Indeed, we identified two insulin-like peptides, INS-6 and DAF-28, that are regulated by neuronal expression of <italic>raga-1</italic>. Both peptides have been shown to be regulated by food cues, and interestingly, when overexpressed are sufficient to suppress the long lifespan caused by loss of sensory signaling through the TAX-2/TAX-4 cyclic nucleotide gated channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Artan et al., 2016</xref>). Whether these or other neuropeptides mediate the effects of neuronal TORC1 signaling on lifespan remains to be explored. With recent findings that neuropeptides influence aging in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Riera et al., 2014</xref>), our study provides a critical starting point to investigate the identity and regulation of the neuropeptides and/or neurotransmitters that directly modulate TORC1 longevity.</p><p>Rapamycin suppresses TORC1 and alleviates a plethora of age-related pathologies and functional decline in mice, slowing age-related degenerative or neoplastic changes in liver, endometrium, heart and bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flynn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wilkinson et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, short term rapamycin administration has significant anti-aging effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bitto et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, metformin, an anti-diabetic drug which both activates AMPK and inhibits TORC1 via AMPK-dependent and -independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Howell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalender et al., 2010</xref>), extends lifespan in nematodes and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martin-Montalvo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Onken and Driscoll, 2010</xref>). The critical site of action for the anti-aging effects of rapamycin and metformin remain unknown. Our findings raise the exciting possibility that their effects on life- and healthspan could be mediated through their regulation of TORC1 and AMPK in the nervous system.</p><p>Finally, we identified mitochondria as the downstream ‘receivers’ of TORC1 mediated neuronal signals important to directly influence lifespan. Mitochondria are major organelles for energy and intermediate metabolite production, with critical roles in the aging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">López-Lluch, 2017</xref>). Our finding that <italic>raga-1</italic> mutant animals have hyperfused mitochondria is consistent with the in vitro mitochondrial hyperfusion induced by starvation or mTORC1 inhibition, which potentially allows more efficient ATP production and prevents healthy mitochondria from being degraded by mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gomes et al., 2011</xref>). We further show that driving mitochondrial fission blocks the longevity of <italic>raga-1</italic> mutants, and driving fusion de-represses longevity in the presence of neuronal RAGA-1. Our results therefore unravel two critical aspects regarding the role of mitochondrial fusion in TORC1-mediated longevity: first, mitochondrial fission in peripheral tissues can be driven in a cell nonautonomous manner by neuronal RAGA-1; second, mitochondrial fusion is causally linked to <italic>raga-1</italic> longevity.</p><p>These and other recent work highlight how mitochondrial fission and fusion influence aging in a context-dependent manner: several longevity interventions require fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chaudhari and Kipreos, 2017</xref>), while promoting fission can also extend lifespan in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rana et al., 2017</xref>), and dietary restriction and AMPK mediated longevity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> require both fusion and fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weir et al., 2017</xref>). Comparative analysis of the functional roles different mitochondrial network states play in AMPK and TORC1 longevity provide a unique opportunity to dissect out how mitochondrial networks might be modulated to promote healthy aging. Together, our data emphasize the role of TORC1 in the nervous system in modulating whole body metabolism and longevity. Further studies will help to elucidate the molecular identities of the neuronal signals and periphery receptors that underlie neuronal TORC1 activity to influence aging, and whether neuronal TORC1 might modulate aging in organisms beyond <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain <break/>(<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td>N2</td><td>Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td>WB Cat# N2_(ancestral), RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:N2_(ancestral)">WB-STRAIN:N2_(ancestral)</ext-link></td><td>Laboratory reference strain</td></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>VC222</td><td>Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td>WB Cat# VC222, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:VC222">WB-STRAIN:VC222</ext-link></td><td>Genotype:<italic>raga-1(ok386) II.</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Strain <break/>(<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>RB754</td><td>Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td>WB Cat# RB754, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:RB754">WB-STRAIN:RB754</ext-link></td><td>Genotype: <italic>aak-2(ok524) X.</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>WBM997</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>Genotype: <italic>aak-2(wbm20) X.</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Strain <break/>(<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>RB1206</td><td>Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td>WB Cat# RB1206, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:RB1206">WB-STRAIN:RB1206</ext-link></td><td>Genotype: <italic>rsks-1(ok1255) III.</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>WBM536</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>Genotype: <italic>wbmEx238[rab-3p::raga-1 cDNA::SL2::mCherry::unc-54 3'UTR]</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>WBM772</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>Genotype: <italic>wbmEx333 [rab-3p::rsks-1 cDNA::SL2::mCherry::unc-54 3'UTR]</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>WBM1167</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>Genotype: <italic>wbmIs79[eft-3p::3XFLAG::raga-1::SL2::wrmScarlet::unc-54 3'UTR, *wbmIs67]</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>WBM1168</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>Genotype: <italic>wbmIs80[rab-3p::3XFLAG::raga-1::SL2::wrmScarlet::rab-3 3'UTR, *wbmIs68]</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Strain <break/>(<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>WBM650</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>Genotype: <italic>wbmEx271 [ges-1p::raga-1 cDNA::SL2::mCherry::unc-54 3'UTR;

At the start of the experiment, adult hermaphrodites were allowed to lay eggs for ~2 hr, after which, 50 eggs from each strain were picked to each of 2 new plates (100 eggs total) and left to develop at 20°C for 72–73 hr. The developmental stage was scored by eye under a light microscope on the basis of larval and adult stage specific hallmarks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Comparison of body size</title><p>Strains were fed and passaged for multiple generations on NG Carb plates seeded with HT1115 bacteria. To synchronize animals, L4-staged larvae were picked to a new plate and aged for two days at 20°C. Day two adult animals were picked to a new plate and anaesthetized in a drop of 0.4 mg/mL tetramisole for ~15 mins. Once the animals stopped moving, they were aligned into groups according to genotype, and imaged with an Axiocam camera on a Zeiss Discovery V8 dissection microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Worms of desired stage/age were anesthetized in 0.5 mg/mL tetramisole (Sigma, T1512) diluted in M9 and mounted to 2% agarose pads. For imaging of the mitochondrial TOMM-20 reporter in the muscle, images were taken using a Zeiss Imager.M2 microscope. Apotome optical sectioning was used to acquire fluorescence and one picture with best focus was chosen for each worm for quantification (as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weir et al., 2017</xref>). For imaging of mitochondria in neurons and in intestine, images were taken in the Sabri Ulker imaging lab using a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal system (Andor Technology, South Windsor, CT, USA) combined with a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY, USA). Images were taken using a 100x/1.45 oil Plan Apo objective lens, Zyla cMOS (Zyla 4.2 Plus USB3) camera and 488 nm Laser for GFP. Optical slice thickness was 0.2 µm. NIS elements software was used for acquisition parameters, shutters, filter positions and focus control. For images shown of the intestine, images were taken as a z stack and each plane was then threaded together by concatenation of the stack. These concatenated stacks were then rendered into 3d by the 3d viewer function of FIJI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> mitochondrial analysis using MitoMAPR</title><p>The images were analysed using a novel macro called MitoMAPR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>) in ImageJ or FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, worm muscle cells and neurons were selected as ROIs, processed and filtered using the CLAHE plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zuiderveld, 1994</xref>) with median filter and unsharp mask to increase the local contrast and particle distinctiveness. The ROI is then converted to a binary image to generate a 2D skeleton using the Skeletonize3D plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 1994</xref>). This skeleton image is then dissected using the AnalyzeSkeleton function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arganda-Carreras et al., 2010</xref>) in FIJI to generate Tagged and Labelled skeletons. Labelled skeletons allow the program to count distinct mitochondrial objects while the tagged skeleton provides information about junction points, branch counts and other pre-configured attributes. MitoMAPR uses the values obtained from the AnalyzeSkeleton function to quantify previously defined aspects of the mitochondrial network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koopman et al., 2006</xref>). The workflow of the macro is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. Analysis was performed in batch mode using the MitoMAPR_Batch (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>, part B) while keeping all the parameters constant. While the user is required to select a region of interest (ROI) in case of images processed singly, MitoMAPR_Batch imports the saved ROIs generated while cropping the images for cells. A separate macro called CropR (Source code file 1, part C) was written to select and crop large data sets in batch mode. The cropped dataset is then used as a batch input for MitoMAPR_Batch. The codes for the macros can be found as supplementary notes.</p><p>The attributes used here to describe alterations in the mitochondrial architecture are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>. Additionally, to determine the complexity of the mitochondrial network, we focused on the Network and Junction Point attribute. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, greater number of junction points in individual mitochondrial networks point towards higher complexity. The output data is kept as an array in a. CSV file that lists the values of all the above-mentioned attributes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>RNA seq sample collection, RNA extraction and library preparation</title><p>Worms were bleached to HT115 bacteria carrying L4440 vector.

Samples were centrifuged at 2,500 rpm to pellet the worms and washed three times with M9 buffer to remove bacteria. QIAzol lysis reagent (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands, #79306) was added to each sample before snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen.

Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Seung-Jae Lee (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers appreciated the importance of the work, but raised some substantial concerns regarding methodology and interpretation. In particular, the use of extrachromosomal arrays and different genetic backgrounds for various experiments raises potential concerns about technical artifacts. Due to the extensive and open-ended nature of the essential revisions, I felt that it would be difficult or impossible to address these concerns within the timeframe. If you are able to address these concerns, a suitably revised manuscript could be considered again at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Use of extrachromosomal arrays. Most experiments using transgenes were done with extrachromosomal arrays. Minimally, multiple extrachromosomal array lines should be used to verify the results. Extrachromosomal arrays are subject to random segregation between cells and rearrange the DNA fragments in ways that cause unnatural expression of the transgenes, particularly in gut cells; thus the results about gut expression of an extrachromosomal array are not really worth considering until one observes the same thing with an integrated reporter, preferably single copy at some defined, intergenic site in the genome- or a knock-in. Positive results with arrays are more believable than negative results, but both can be misleading. Also, worth considering, extrachromosomal arrays and multicopy insertions into random genomic loci can also cause lifespan-extending dye filling defects in neurons – case and point would be the overexpression sirtuin line that lived a long time, not because of sirtuin overexpression, but because of a dye-filling defect in the neurons.</p><p>2) Inconsistent use of a roller background in some experiments. roller genetic background with their extrachromosomal arrays. Roller animals perpetually twist and do not have the same behavior as wild-type animals. So, comparing animals that are rolling to animals that are not, using extrachromosomal arrays, is riddled with technical concerns.</p><p>3) Use of FUDR without controlling for potential effects of the drug. FUDR inhibits DNA synthesis, including synthesis of mitochondrial DNA. FUDR also increases the lifespan of at least one mitochondrial mutant (<italic>gas-1</italic>). Thus, there is reason to believe that FUDR interacts with mitochondria and that is sufficient to warrant the testing of these phenomena in the absence of FUDR to ensure what they are reporting is not FUDR dependent.</p><p>4) In Figure 4, the authors showed that mitochondrial fusion-defective <italic>raga-1(-); fzo-1</italic>(-) mutants did not live long, suggesting that <italic>raga-1</italic> mutations increase lifespan through elevating fused mitochondria. Please show the mitochondrial patterns of <italic>rag-1(-), raga-1(-); fzo-1</italic>(-), and <italic>raga-1(-); drp-1</italic>(-) mutants to strengthen their findings.</p><p>5) In Figure 4B and C, the authors showed that intestinal <italic>fzo-1</italic> is required for the lifespan extension by <italic>raga-1</italic> mutations. However, they did not test muscles where neuronal <italic>raga-1</italic> rescue restored the mitochondrial dynamics of <italic>raga-1</italic> mutants. They need to test whether muscle-specific <italic>fzo-1</italic> is also required for the lifespan extension by <italic>raga-1</italic> mutations and test whether neuronal <italic>raga-1</italic> rescue restored the mitochondrial dynamics changes by <italic>raga-1</italic> mutations in the intestine as well.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors of this paper have done a great job writing clearly and analyzing the data to genetically investigate how neuronal <italic>raga-1</italic> loss (mTORC1 component) increases longevity. The results are generally interesting in terms of understanding cell nonautonomous regulation of organelles (mitochondria), and important for the field of aging.</p><p>However, my enthusiasm for the manuscript diminished when I discovered the questionable technical quality of the transgene work and use of FUDR without an FUDR-less control to show that the phenomena are not FUDR-dependent. I want this study to be published, and wish the authors great success, but as it stands, the manuscript needs additional work to be sure of the results. Alternatively, they could implement heavy, explicit, technical caveats warning readers of the uncertainties in their results. Given the confident writing style, I believe the authors would/should probably just make better transgenes and try the experiments without FUDR. In worms, they could get their strains in hand in three weeks, split them into different biological replicates and perform a few lifespan experiments in parallel, or in tight sequential fashion in a couple of months without FUDR.</p><p>Most experiments using transgenes were done with extrachromosomal arrays. Extrachromosomal arrays are randomly arranged concatemers of injected DNA that are inherited in a non-mendelian fashion. Positive results are only preliminary and, in the past, before single copy reporter gene technology was available with Mos transposon (2008) and CRISPR based (2012/2013) methods, researchers would integrate the arrays and/or examine multiple insert lines to verify their findings. Minimally, multiple extrachromosomal array lines should have been used to verify the results; we have been given no such data. Extrachromosomal arrays are subject to random segregation between cells and rearrange the DNA fragments in ways that cause unnatural expression of the transgenes, particularly in gut cells; thus the results about gut expression of an extrachromosomal array are not really worth considering until one observes the same thing with an integrated reporter, preferably single copy at some defined, intergenic site in the genome- or a knock-in. Positive results with arrays are more believable than negative results, but both can be misleading. And, in 2018, this dated technology is no longer the standard or sufficient; rather, it should be used as preliminary data. It’s also worth considering that extrachromosomal arrays and multicopy insertions into random genomic loci can cause lifespan-extending dye filling defects in neurons – case and point would be the overexpression sirtuin line that lived a long time, not because of sirtuin overexpression, but because of a dye-filling defect in the neurons. I don't want to see another group get burned because of poor transgene practices. I believe that this group is doing great work and has noble intent, but simply needs a bit of guidance.</p><p>Additionally, they inconsistently use a roller genetic background with their extrachromosomal arrays. Roller animals perpetually twist and do not have the same behavior as wild-type animals. So, comparing animals that are rolling to animals that are not, using extrachromosomal arrays, is riddled with technical concerns. That is a setup for a potential incorrect answer/failure.</p><p>FUDR inhibits DNA synthesis, including synthesis of mitochondrial DNA. FUDR also increases the lifespan of at least one mitochondrial mutant (<italic>gas-1</italic>). Thus, there is reason to believe that FUDR interacts with mitochondria and that is sufficient to warrant the testing of these phenomena in the absence of FUDR to ensure what they are reporting is not FUDR dependent.</p><p>Again, this is a well written paper, and the results may end up being correct, but there is sufficient technical concern to ask for more data before letting the authors publish something that has several potential technical artifacts that could easily be addressed with a few modern transgenes and experiments without FUDR. This is a fantastic lab that seems to be doing great things and I want to see the technical quality of their work reflect their apparent high intellectual capacity.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) are key mediators of longevity in various species. However, how mTOR and AMPK coordinate to promote longevity remains unclear. Here, Zhang et al. suggest that activation of AMPK and inhibition of TORC1 extend lifespan via rather distinct mechanisms. They further showed that neuronal TORC1 regulates lifespan by modulating mitochondrial dynamics in other tissues through activating neuronal AMPK. This is an excellent paper that addressed mechanisms of lifespan extension by TORC1 and AMPK pathways. The experiments were generally rigorously executed and the paper is well written. My specific comments are as follows.</p><p>1) Through the entire paper, the authors claim that AMPK and mTOR regulates lifespan through distinct mechanisms. However, most of the results explain how AMPK acted in mTOR pathways in detail; inhibition of neuronal mTOR pathway extends lifespan possibly through neuronal AMPK. In addition, the lines of supporting evidence for the distinct aging-regulatory mechanisms by CA-AAK and inhibition of mTOR pathway are indirect. Please tone down the claims.</p><p>2) In Figure 4, the authors showed that mitochondrial fusion-defective <italic>raga-1(-); fzo-1</italic>(-) mutants did not live long, suggesting that <italic>raga-1</italic> mutations increase lifespan through elevating fused mitochondria. Please showthe mitochondrial patterns of <italic>rag-1(-), raga-1(-); fzo-1</italic>(-), and <italic>raga-1(-); drp-1</italic>(-) mutants to strengthen their findings.</p><p>3) In Figure 4B and C, the authors showed that intestinal <italic>fzo-1</italic> is required for the lifespan extension by <italic>raga-1</italic> mutations. However, they did not test muscles where neuronal <italic>raga-1</italic> rescue restored the mitochondrial dynamics of <italic>raga-1</italic> mutants. They need to test whether muscle-specific <italic>fzo-1</italic> is also required for the lifespan extension by <italic>raga-1</italic> mutations and test whether neuronal <italic>raga-1</italic> rescue restored the mitochondrial dynamics changes by <italic>raga-1</italic> mutations in the intestine as well.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors seek to 1) establish a relationship between AMPK and neuronal TORC1 activity in the context of longevity, and 2) better understand the mechanism of TORC1 inhibition slowing aging in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. They find that the downstream longevity pathways of AMPK and TORC1 diverge and proceed to investigate the cell nonautonomous pathway initiated by neuronal TORC1 activity. They then investigate the downstream effects of the pathway by characterizing the mitochondrial networks of wildtype and mutants with suppressed neuronal TORC1 activity before associating the differences in the mitochondrial properties with the longevity of the latter animals.</p><p>In the opinion of this reviewer, the claims made by the authors are largely substantiated, including:</p><p>1) AMPK is required for longevity mediated by TORC1 suppression: Substantiated</p><p>2) TORC1 and AMPK act via separable downstream mechanisms: Substantiated.</p><p>3) Neuronal AMPK is required for TORC1-mediated longevity: Mostly substantiated.</p><p>4) TORC1 acts in neurons to regulate aging: Substantiated.</p><p>5) Neuronal RAGA-1 does not reverse known pro-longevity mechanisms induced by global TORC1 suppression: Substantiated.</p><p>6) Neuronal RAGA-1 modulates aging via neuropeptide signaling: Substantiated.</p><p>7) Neuronal RAGA-1 drives peripheral mitochondrial fragmentation in aging animals: Substantiated.</p><p>8) <italic>raga-1</italic> deletion specifically requires a fused mitochondrial network to promote longevity: Substantiated.</p><p>9) Neuronal RAGA-1 suppresses lifespan cell nonautonomously via mitochondrial fission: Substantiated.</p><p>The major question to this reviewer about this manuscript is not whether the data are substantiated but whether the advance is substantial enough for this journal. The authors establish a relationship between AMPK and TORC1 (which was already known to exist but further defined here), but don't really investigate it beyond cursory genetic and biochemical characterization. They then find a cell-specific role for TORC1 and suggest a signaling mechanism (neuropeptides), but do not identify any signals. Finally, they establish mitochondrial dynamics as being necessary, but offer little insight as to how fission and more importantly, fusion, might play a mechanistic role. In short, while the paper is geared towards investigating neuronal TORC1 and how it affects longevity, they don't really progress or analyze the relationship between the two based on their own data. It would be nice to see a couple of the &quot;additional mechanisms&quot; (mentioned in the second paragraph of the Discussion) they favor based off their work.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Neuronal TORC1 modulates longevity via AMPK and cell nonautonomous regulation of mitochondrial dynamics in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Seung-Jae V Lee (Reviewer #1); Scott F Leiser (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that the authors have substantially improved the manuscript from the initial submission and that this will represent a significant contribution. There were some remaining concerns about clarity and interpretation, which I would ask the authors to addressed by modifying the text appropriately.</p><p>Please make sure genetic nomenclature is correct. Following are some examples of errors:</p><p>Figure 5A: <italic>“raga-1, fzo-1</italic>” should be “<italic>fzo-1 raga-1</italic>” without comma.</p><p>Figure 5B: “<italic>raga-1; drp-1</italic>” should be all italic, even the semicolon.</p><p>In some cases it is unclear which experiments were done with extrachromosomal arrays and which were done with new single copy insertions. Please ensure that this is clearly noted.</p><p>The extrachromosomal array prab-3 ex is not listed in the strain list. And the lifespan data does not say which strains were used for which experiments. Therefore, the supplements showing which strains were used seem incomplete and the other lifespan file does not detail which strain was used in which experiment. The lifespan data should say which strains were used – not just the genotype – and indicate if they are single copy insertions or extrachromosomal arrays.</p><p>Please provide the NA of the 100X objective used for imaging. It will be critical for anyone wanting to reproduce this. I'm guessing it's 1.4, but it would be better to know.</p><p>The microscopy in Figure 4 – the images of mitochondrial networks in intestines are of terrific quality. How are these images shown? Are they single image planes? Are they z projections? More detail here would again help people. Even though you may have it in another publication, many would appreciate a sentence or two describing the image plane used for the image cytometry in the methods.</p><p>One reviewer had significant concerns regarding the use of FUDR and the roller background in some experiments. Although these methods are still common in the field, it would perhaps be useful to address these concerns in the text, and if data are available that do not have these potential confounds those could be included as well. In particular, this reviewer noted that FUDR enhances the effects of mitochondrial double mutants (<italic>fzo/drp</italic>) from your prior work and wonders if the use of FUDR could be impacting outcomes in the current study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49158.046</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Use of extrachromosomal arrays.

Current methods for single copy tissue specific rescue involve MosSCI insertion, which invariably requires co-insertion of a rescue marker (usually <italic>unc-119</italic>), which can impact neuronal signaling. Therefore, since no usable technique was available to generate the strains needed to alleviate the reviewer’s concerns, we decided to build one. Since the original submission we have made from scratch and published a CRISPR based strategy – “Single Copy Knock-in Loci for Defined Gene Expression (SKI LODGE) in <italic>C. elegans</italic>” (Silva-Garcia, 2019). Building this system required CRISPR insertion and validation at safe harbor loci in intergenic regions of entire promoter sequences, upstream of a landing pad crRNA target sequence. SKI LODGE strains therefore allow insertion of a cDNA of choice at a known locus under the regulation of an ectopic tissue specific promoter. We are proud of this new system, built in response to the concerns of the reviewers, and have already sent all the strains to many labs on request and the CGC. We therefore hope that this concerted effort and resource will not only allow our data and methodologies to improve now and in the future, but support the whole field. For the purposes of this revision, we then used the pan-neuronal SKI LODGE strain to validate the key point of the paper, namely the neuronal effects of RAGA-1 on longevity. The single copy SKI LODGE neuronal RAGA-1 rescue line expresses stably and only in neurons (Silva-Garcia, 2019). We compared lifespan, growth and development in <italic>raga-1</italic> mutants with single copy SKI LODGE generated rescue in neurons or all somatic tissue (New Figure 2). Critically and supporting the original data, single copy rescue of RAGA-1 in neurons suppressed <italic>raga-1</italic> mutant longevity. These lines have no roller insertion. Expression of <italic>raga-1</italic> in the single copy neuronal rescue was very low compared to the somatic SKI LODGE line or the previous neuronal Ex line (Figure 2E). Strikingly, although single copy neuronal RAGA-1 rescue restored WT longevity, it did not affect body size (Figure 2F) – these data suggest that the effects of TORC1 on growth and lifespan can be uncouple via modulation in discreet tissues.</p><p>2) Inconsistent use of a roller background in some experiments. roller genetic background with their extrachromosomal arrays. Roller animals perpetually twist and do not have the same behavior as wild-type animals. So, comparing animals that are rolling to animals that are not, using extrachromosomal arrays, is riddled with technical concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and hope the SKI LODGE system will alleviate the need for any use of Ex line with roller in the future. We have used SKI LODGE to replicate the key finding of the paper (see above). However, we believe it was beyond the scope of feasibility for us to re-do the entire body of work using SKI LODGE: the original submission was a PhD thesis performed over 6 years, much of it before CRISPR was widely available. However, in the small number of experiments that have used <italic>rol-6</italic> in the manuscript, the key comparison statistically is always between two roller lines. Therefore, we do not believe behavioral differences account for the effects we see.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Use of FUDR without controlling for potential effects of the drug. FUDR inhibits DNA synthesis, including synthesis of mitochondrial DNA. FUDR also increases the lifespan of at least one mitochondrial mutant (gas<sup>-1</sup>). Thus, there is reason to believe that FUDR interacts with mitochondria and that is sufficient to warrant the testing of these phenomena in the absence of FUDR to ensure what they are reporting is not FUDR dependent.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this point and have added new data replicating the effects we see of neuronal RAGA-1 suppression of longevity and <italic>fzo-1</italic> suppression of <italic>raga-1</italic> longevity without FUDR (Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1). All lifespan experiments done during revision did not use FUDR, including those with the SKI LODGE lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 4, the authors showed that mitochondrial fusion-defective raga-1(-); fzo-1(-) mutants did not live long, suggesting that raga-1 mutations increase lifespan through elevating fused mitochondria. Please show the mitochondrial patterns of rag-1(-), raga-1(-); fzo-1(-), and raga-1(-); drp-1(-) mutants to strengthen their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this point and have added new data replicating the effects we see of neuronal RAGA-1 suppression of longevity and <italic>fzo-1</italic> suppression of <italic>raga-1</italic> longevity without FUDR (Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1).

However, they did not test muscles where neuronal raga-1 rescue restored the mitochondrial dynamics of raga-1 mutants. They need to test whether muscle-specific fzo-1 is also required for the lifespan extension by raga-1 mutations and test whether neuronal raga-1 rescue restored the mitochondrial dynamics changes by raga-1 mutations in the intestine as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point.

There were some remaining concerns about clarity and interpretation, which I would ask the authors to addressed by modifying the text appropriately.</p><p>Please make sure genetic nomenclature is correct. Following are some examples of errors:</p><p>Figure 5A: “raga-1, fzo-1” should be “fzo-1 raga-1” without comma.</p><p>Figure 5B: “raga-1; drp-1” should be all italic, even the semicolon.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We have corrected the nomenclature in Figure 5 and in the supporting files describing the strains used for each experiment and their genotypes. In those cases where the genotypes have been abbreviated for simplicity in the figure, we have directed the reader to the full genotype information provided in the Supporting files (Supplementary file 4, Supplementary file 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In some cases it is unclear which experiments were done with extrachromosomal arrays and which were done with new single copy insertions. Please ensure that this is clearly noted.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we have clarified where necessary in the text and have amended the figures to show more explicitly which experiments were done using extrachromosomal arrays and which were done by single copy knock-in. In addition, we have added a column describing the nature of the transgene used in each strain (extrachromosomal vs. integrated multi copy array vs. single copy knock in) in Supplementary file 4 and in Supplementary file 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The extrachromosomal array prab-3 ex is not listed in the strain list. And the lifespan data does not say which strains were used for which experiments. Therefore, the supplements showing which strains were used seem incomplete and the other lifespan file does not detail which strain was used in which experiment. The lifespan data should say which strains were used – not just the genotype – and indicate if they are single copy insertions or extrachromosomal arrays.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the insufficient strain information initially provided in the supplements. We now provide strain numbers for all strains used and note whether the transgene used in each strain is extrachromosomal, an integrated multicopy array, or present as single cope insertion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please provide the NA of the 100X objective used for imaging. It will be critical for anyone wanting to reproduce this. I'm guessing it's 1.4, but it would be better to know.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, the 100x objective we used was an NA of 1.45. We have noted that information in the subsection “Microscopy”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The microscopy in Figure 4 – the images of mitochondrial networks in intestines are of terrific quality. How are these images shown? Are they single image planes? Are they z projections? More detail here would again help people. Even though you may have it in another publication, many would appreciate a sentence or two describing the image plane used for the image cytometry in the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing up this question. We have included the following additional information on how we acquired and processed images of mitochondria in the intestine and in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“For images shown of the intestine, images were taken as a z stack and each plane was then threaded together by concatenation of the stack. These concatenated stacks were then rendered into 3d by the 3d viewer function of FIJI.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One reviewer had significant concerns regarding the use of FUDR and the roller background in some experiments. Although these methods are still common in the field, it would perhaps be useful to address these concerns in the text, and if data are available that do not have these potential confounds those could be included as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and acknowledge that the practice of using FUDR as part of lifespan and other experiments is not ideal. We have amended the text further to address this concern, and in addition added the following to the Discussion section:</p><p>“Many of the described experiments used FUDR, a chemical inhibitor of thymidine synthesis, to block the production of progeny. While the actions of FUDR in postmitotic adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> are thought to act primarily in the germline to inhibit DNA replication in the dividing germ cells, there is also evidence that FUDR can act in somatic tissue and can lead to complex interactions with various genes and treatments in the regulation of lifespan (Anderson et al., 2016). As such, we chose a relatively small dose (40 mM) to use for our experiments, and importantly, verified key findings in lifespan experiments that did not use FUDR.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In particular, this reviewer noted that FUDR enhances the effects of mitochondrial double mutants (fzo/drp) from your prior work and wonders if the use of FUDR could be impacting outcomes in the current study.</p></disp-quote><p>We are unclear what data the reviewer is referring to here. Indeed, in the paper cited (Weir et al., 2017), we performed lifespans of <italic>fzo-1</italic> mutants with and without FUDR and saw little difference between with FUDR and without. As seen previously by us and others, lifespans on HT115 with carb are longer lived than those on OP50 without antibiotics. Therefore, we do not know the result being referred to by the reviewer ‘that FUDR enhances the effects of the <italic>fzo-1; drp-1</italic></p><p>double mutant’.</p><p>However, we also note that we have replicated the key FZO-1 experiment in this study demonstrating that the mitochondrial fusion mutant <italic>fzo-1</italic> blocks <italic>raga-1</italic> lifespan both with and without using FUDR, suggesting it is not an artifact or some complex interaction caused by FUDR use (compare Figure 5A, Figure 5—figure supplement 1). In addition, all of the experiments we conducted using the single copy knock-in strains (lifespans, body size determination, developmental delay) were done without the use FUDR.</p></body></sub-article></article>
