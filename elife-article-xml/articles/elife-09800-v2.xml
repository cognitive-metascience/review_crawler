Agouti related protein (AGRP)-expressing neurons are a key hypothalamic population that is activated during energy deficit and increases appetite and weight-gain. Cell type-specific transcriptomics can be used to identify pathways that counteract weight-loss, and here we report high-quality gene expression profiles of AGRP neurons from well-fed and food-deprived young adult mice. For comparison, we also analyzed Proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons, an intermingled population that suppresses appetite and body weight. We find that AGRP neurons are considerably more sensitive to energy deficit than POMC neurons. Furthermore, we identify cell type-specific pathways involving endoplasmic reticulum-stress, circadian signaling, ion channels, neuropeptides, and receptors. Combined with methods to validate and manipulate these pathways, this resource greatly expands molecular insight into neuronal regulation of body weight, and may be useful for devising therapeutic strategies for obesity and eating disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09800.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09800.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09800.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Humans and other animals must get adequate nutrition in order to survive. As a result, the body has several systems that work side by side to maintain a healthy body weight and ensure that enough food gets eaten to provide the energy that the body needs. Problems with these systems can contribute towards obesity and other eating disorders.</p><p>Certain types of cells in the brain play important roles in controlling weight and appetite, although the genes and cellular mechanisms that underlie these abilities are not well understood. When an animal is deprived of food, so-called AGRP neurons produce molecules that increase appetite and make it easier to gain weight. These neurons also go through structural changes and increase their electrical activity during weight loss. Another group of cells, called the POMC neurons, becomes less active when an animal is deprived of energy.</p><p>Using a technique called cell type-specific transcriptomics, Henry, Sugino et al. have now revealed that the expression of hundreds of genes in AGRP and POMC neurons changes depending on whether mice are well fed or food deprived. Food deprivation also affects more genes in AGRP neurons than has been seen in other types of brain cell, and the AGRP neurons are also more sensitive to a change in food intake than POMC neurons.</p><p>In the future, this gene expression data and knowledge of the pathways affected by the genes could help researchers to develop new treatments for obesity and other disorders that affect appetite. Henry, Sugino et al. then mapped how these changes in gene expression trigger molecular “pathways” in the neurons that alter how the cells work. These affect many parts of the cells, including ion channels, transcription factors, receptors, and secreted proteins. In addition, food deprivation activated pathways in AGRP neurons that protect the cells from damage and death caused by elevated neuron activity and also triggered signaling pathways that increase body weight.</p><p>In the future, this gene expression data and knowledge of the pathways affected by the genes could help researchers to develop new treatments for obesity and other disorders that affect appetite.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09800.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09800.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>body weight</kwd><kwd>feeding</kwd><kwd>arcuate nucleus</kwd><kwd>RNA-Seq</kwd><kwd>transcriptomic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sternson</surname><given-names>Scott M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>098400/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Branco</surname><given-names>Tiago</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council (MRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC-UP-1201/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Branco</surname><given-names>Tiago</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell type-specific transcriptomics in energy homeostasis neurons has identified hundreds of genes and multiple signaling pathways that are regulated by weight loss in mice, as well as several previously unexamined genes that can regulate appetite and body weight.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons that express <italic>Agouti related protein</italic> (<italic>Agrp</italic>) and <italic>Proopiomelanocortin</italic> (<italic>Pomc</italic>) comprise two intermingled molecularly defined populations in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) that mediate whole-body energy homeostasis in conjunction with other cell types. AGRP and POMC neurons positively and negatively regulate body weight, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aponte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>). AGRP neurons transduce circulating signals of energy deficit into increased output of the neuropeptides AGRP and Neuropeptide Y (NPY) as well as the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), each of which contribute to increased appetite and body weight. Correspondingly, weight loss is accompanied by increased <italic>Agrp</italic> and <italic>Npy</italic> gene co-expression in AGRP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hahn et al., 1998</xref>), as well as increased electrical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takahashi and Cone, 2005</xref>) and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, during energy deficit, POMC neurons decrease electrical activity due to inhibitory synaptic input from AGRP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takahashi and Cone, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atasoy et al., 2012</xref>), and <italic>Pomc</italic> neuropeptide gene expression is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schwartz et al., 1997</xref>). AGRP and POMC neurons are thus both associated with sensing and counteracting energy deficit states. Because these neurons play major reciprocal roles in energy homeostasis, investigations of the molecular response pathways for AGRP and POMC neurons to weight-loss are critical for identifying key control points associated with regulation of body weight.</p><p>AGRP and POMC neurons sense energy deficit, in part, through responding to the metabolic hormones ghrelin, leptin, and insulin. Signaling pathways downstream of the receptors for these hormones have been elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Banks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kitamura et al., 2006</xref>), but most of the other molecular processes involved in the cellular response to systemic metabolic challenge in AGRP and POMC neurons remain unexplored. In light of this, a transcriptome-wide view of gene expression changes can provide a foundation for investigating the neuronal cell biology of these energy homeostasis sensing neurons during a state of energy deficit.</p><p>The transcriptional response to food-deprivation has been reported previously using tissue samples from the entire hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guarnieri et al., 2012</xref>) or ARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jovanovic et al., 2010</xref>), but these studies lacked cell type-specificity necessary to understand the molecular response properties of individual neural circuit nodes. Recent approaches employing immunoprecipitation of messenger RNA (mRNA) in molecularly defined and even projection-specific populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heiman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dalal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ekstrand et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allison et al., 2015</xref>) require large numbers of cells, and therefore have been challenging to perform for neurons with small population sizes, such as AGRP and POMC neurons. A transcriptional profile of AGRP neurons has been obtained previously from dissociated tissue in which fluorescently labeled AGRP neurons were sorted and pooled from ∼40 neonatal mice and compared to a similar number of neonatal AGRP neuron-specific <italic>Foxo1</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ren et al., 2012</xref>). In neonatal mice, cells are readily dissociated, but AGRP neurons are not necessary for early neonatal life and their axons are not developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bouret et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Luquet et al., 2005</xref>), thus, the relevance of neonatal gene expression patterns to those in adult mice is uncertain. Moreover, comparing only one sample from two conditions prevents statistical analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEG). Recent technical improvements in cell sorting and transcriptional profiling methods have enabled the generation of high quality gene expression profiles from small numbers of fluorescently labeled neurons (typically 40–250 neurons) from single adult mouse brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sugino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Okaty et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, this permits use of individual animals as replicates for comparing gene expression profiles under different conditions, which is the approach that we used here.</p><p>We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) using AGRP and POMC neurons from ad libitum fed young adult mice as well as from mice after 24-hr food deprivation. We confirmed a small number of previously reported changes in gene expression, and also identified hundreds of additional DEG. These changes in gene expression allowed identification of coordinated signaling pathways that are involved in the response to food deprivation, and we focus here on neuropeptides, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), as well as pathways associated with neuron electrical activity, circadian regulation, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress signaling. This resource, which includes gene expression profiles for AGRP and POMC neurons as well as methods for validating and evaluating the functional significance of these changes, provides a foundation for in depth analysis of the molecular control points for neuron populations involved in energy homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We obtained transcriptional profiles from AGRP and POMC neurons from male young adult mice (6.5–8 weeks old) under ad libitum fed (fed, AGRP, POMC: n = 5 mice each) or 24-hr food deprived (FD, AGRP: n = 6 mice, POMC: n = 5 mice) conditions during the middle of the light phase (percent weight change AGRP.fed: 0.4 ± 1.5%, POMC.fed: 1.0 ± 0.9%, AGRP.FD: −19.4 ± 1.8%, POMC.FD: −17.7 ± 1.6%; mean ± sd).

The differential expression for these primarily non-neuronal markers in our AGRP and POMC neuron samples relative to purified samples of these non-neuronal cell types was at least 300-fold (range: 318- to 8904-fold), indicating a high level of sample purity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>AGRP and POMC neurons are functionally distinct cell types, and gene expression profiles can be used to measure their molecular differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Multidimensional scaling (MDS), which is a method for visualization of similarity in gene expression patterns, showed clear separation between AGRP and POMC neuron populations regardless of deprivation state, and AGRP neurons, but not POMC neurons, were also distinct after food deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The AGRP and POMC neuron cell types from fed mice showed substantial differences, with 694 DEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and see ‘Materials and methods’ for criteria). Consistent with this difference between AGRP and POMC neurons, clear separation of the cell types by MDS was maintained after exclusion of <italic>Agrp</italic>, <italic>Npy</italic>, and <italic>Pomc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), the top 30-most DEG, or even all DEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Therefore, transcriptional profiles indicate that these canonical markers are not required to distinguish cellular identity of AGRP and POMC neurons.</p><p>Both AGRP and POMC neurons have been reported to show alterations of gene expression with food deprivation, but the global transcriptomic response of these two cell populations to an energy deficit state is not known. As expected, <italic>Agrp</italic> (+4.4-fold, q = 3.3e<sup>−6</sup> [q-value is false discovery rate-corrected p-value]) and <italic>Npy</italic> (+3.3-fold, q = 1.5e<sup>−7</sup>) were upregulated and <italic>Pomc</italic> expression modestly decreased (−1.6-fold, q = 0.038) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In addition, members of the <italic>Fos</italic> immediate-early-gene family were upregulated selectively in AGRP neurons from FD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), consistent with elevated AGRP neuron activity in energy deficit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takahashi and Cone, 2005</xref>), and the selectivity of this response also confirmed that dissociation and sorting did not result in cellular activation, similar to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Okaty et al., 2011</xref>). Using our transcriptomic data, we found that gene expression changes in AGRP neurons were much more extensive than for POMC neurons in response to food-deprivation. AGRP neurons showed 826 DEG after food deprivation (51.8% upregulated), but only 47 genes (46.8% upregulated) for POMC neurons, of which 15 genes were in common between the two cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This surprising 17-fold difference in the number of DEG between the two cell types indicates that AGRP neurons are regulated by deprivation states much more strongly than POMC neurons.</p><p>Hierarchical clustering of correlated gene expression patterns can reveal groups of genes that show similar responses to food-deprivation across different conditions and cell types. We identified many clusters of highly correlated genes based on their expression levels in AGRP and POMC neurons from fed and FD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). One small cluster of 15 genes included <italic>Foxo1</italic>, <italic>Agrp</italic>, and <italic>Npy</italic>, which are reported to be in the same pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kitamura et al., 2006</xref>); moreover ghrelin receptor (<italic>Ghsr</italic>) and <italic>Acvr1c</italic>, both of which influence <italic>Npy</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sandoval-Guzman et al., 2012</xref>), were also highly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These data indicate that this resource can be a starting point for investigating patterns of gene regulation in AGRP and POMC neurons.</p><p>Our RNA-Seq data were also consistent with some results that have been obtained previously by transcriptional profiling of the hypothalamus without regard to cell type. For example, transcriptional profiling of whole-hypothalamus tissue samples indicated upregulation of the glucocorticoid-regulated gene <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> (<italic>p21</italic>) with food deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guarnieri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tinkum et al., 2013</xref>).

We confirmed increased <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression in AGRP neurons from FD mice by double-label RNA single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) (p = 1.5e<sup>−53</sup>, Kolmogorov–Smirnov (ks) test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). Similarly, microarray profiling of the ARC has shown <italic>Asb4</italic> was slightly downregulated (−1.25-fold) with food-deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2005</xref>), but, with cell type-specific RNA-Seq we find that <italic>Asb4</italic> is strongly down-regulated selectively in POMC neurons from FD mice (POMC: −5.8-fold, q = 2.2e<sup>−9</sup>; AGRP: +1.1-fold, q = 0.71, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Finally, <italic>Gpr17</italic>, which has been reported to be expressed in AGRP neurons based on transcriptional profiling of cells isolated using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) from neonatal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ren et al., 2012</xref>) was not detected in our samples from either AGRP or POMC neurons from adult mice, possibly indicating developmental differences in gene expression or differences arising from oligodendrocyte cell contamination of neonatal samples. These comparisons illustrate the advantages of using high purity sorted cells from individual adult mice to allow for statistical analysis of gene expression from intermingled cell types under different conditions.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pathway analysis</title><p>In addition to changes in expression of individual genes and gene families such as kinases, phosphatases, and transcription factors that are evident from RNA-Seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>), the coordinate regulation of multiple genes allows predictions to be made about pathways involved in the transition from energy replete to energy deficient physiological states. Gene annotation enrichment analysis highlighted several pathways that were significantly affected by food-deprivation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

This pathway has not been examined previously in AGRP neurons; instead, based on whole hypothalamus analysis, UPR has been primarily associated with overnutrition states and leptin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ozcan et al., 2009</xref>), as opposed to the energy-deficit condition examined here. ER-stress responses occur during high levels of protein translation where unfolded proteins elicit a program of downstream transcriptional responses to increase protein folding and processing in the ER, and this pathway showed the most prominent effect on gene expression that we identified in AGRP neurons. This pattern of differential gene expression was not observed in POMC neurons, indicating that it is not an artifact of the neuronal isolation procedure. Consequently we examined multiple aspects of ER-stress signaling by analysis of our RNA-Seq data, coupled with preliminary evaluation of ER-stress signaling using immunohistochemistry, a cell type-specific UPR pathway reporter, and smFISH.</p><p>ER-localized proteins were significantly overrepresented in the group of food-deprivation-regulated genes in AGRP neurons (p = 8.3e<sup>−16</sup>, hypergeometric-test), and 95% of these DEG were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Two well-established Xbp1s-dependent gene targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2003</xref>) were selectively upregulated in AGRP neurons after food deprivation: <italic>Dnajc3/p58</italic><sup><italic>IPK</italic></sup> (+1.9-fold, q = 0.0007) and <italic>Dnajb9</italic> (+2.2-fold, q = 0.0003). Many other genes regulated by Xbp1s were also increased in AGRP neurons during food-deprivation, including protein folding chaperones of the Hsp40 (Dnaj), Hsp70 (Hspa), and Hsp90 families, <italic>Calr</italic> and <italic>Canx</italic>, as well as protein disulfide isomerases (<italic>Pdia3-6</italic>), which aid in protein folding by catalyzing the formation of disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>Atm</italic> (−3.1-fold, q = 7e<sup>−5</sup>), a DNA damage sensing-enzyme that, when reduced leads to increased <italic>Xbp1</italic> splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2009</xref>), was downregulated with food deprivation. Taken together, Xbp1-splicing and the patterns of downstream gene expression indicate a previously unreported role for Ern1/Ire1 → Xbp1s signaling in the adaptive response of AGRP neurons to energy deficit.</p><p>We also investigated the involvement of two other UPR signaling pathways regulated by ER-bound transmembrane proteins, Eif2ak3 (also called PERK) and Atf6. The Eif2ak3/PERK (AGRP: −2.1-fold, q = 0.23) arm of the UPR pathway is the first to be engaged during ER stress and suppresses translation of most mRNA. We expected that prolonged translational arrest in AGRP neurons was unlikely because it is inconsistent with elevated neuropeptide production in AGRP neurons during energy deficit. Activation of Eif2ak3/PERK leads to mRNAs sequestration into messenger ribonucleoprotein particles that aggregate into stress granules containing the RNA binding protein, TDP43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Colombrita et al., 2009</xref>). To assess stress granule formation, we used anti-TDP43 immunostaining. Elevated stress granule formation was not detected in AGRP neurons from FD mice (p = 0.76, ks-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>), which provides preliminary evidence that Eif2ak3/PERK-mediated translational arrest may not be engaged at this 24-hr food deprivation time-point. Moreover, transcripts for ER protein translocation (<italic>Srp68</italic>, <italic>Srp72</italic>, <italic>Sec61a1, Sec61b1, Sec63, Serp1/Ramp4</italic>) and Golgi trafficking (<italic>Sec14l1</italic>, <italic>Sec22b</italic>, <italic>Sec24d</italic>) were upregulated in AGRP neurons, possibly indicating increased protein translation and folding capacity during energy deficit and consistent with the requirement for increased peptidergic neurotransmission for AGRP neuron function.</p><p>An additional signaling arm of the UPR is mediated through the ER-bound protein Atf6 (AGRP: +2.0-fold, q = 0.0016). In response to ER stress, Atf6 is subject to proteolytic cleavage and releases an N-terminal transcription factor domain that translocates to the nucleus and initiates gene expression to increase protein folding. To examine the extent of Atf6 nuclear translocation in the response of AGRP neurons to food-deprivation, we developed a Cre recombinase-dependent N-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP):Atf6 fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Samali et al., 2010</xref>) reporter of Atf6 cleavage for use in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). After expression in AGRP neurons, we measured the nucleus:cytoplasm ratio of GFP, which was very low and was not significantly increased in FD vs ad libitum fed mice; whereas the ER-stress-inducer, tunicamycin, strongly increased nuclear localization of GFP in AGRP neurons (fed vs FD: p = 0.44, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vs tunicamycin: p = 2.9e<sup>−16</sup>, ks-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–J</xref>). Low nuclear localization indicates minimal activation of the Atf6-signaling arm of UPR in AGRP neurons after 24-hr food deprivation. Consistent with this, a transcript selectively regulated by Atf6, <italic>Herpud1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2003</xref>), was not significantly (q = 0.22) elevated in AGRP neurons from FD mice. However, because many Atf6-regulated genes are also regulated by Xbp1s, a robust ER-stress response can be maintained without Atf6 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Oxidative stress pathways associated with elevated protein production are also increased in AGRP neurons during food deprivation. The transcription factor <italic>Nfe2l2</italic> (also called <italic>Nrf2</italic>) regulates oxidative stress and is normally rapidly degraded in the cytoplasm, in part through association with <italic>Keap1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kobayashi et al., 2004</xref>), which shows reduced expression with food-deprivation (−2.2-fold, q = 0.05).

Nfe2l2/Nrf2 increases other transcripts associated with oxidative stress, such as <italic>Mt1</italic> (+34-fold, q = 0.004), <italic>Mt2</italic> (79-fold, q = 0.004), and <italic>Srxn1</italic> (+17-fold, q = 1.2e<sup>−6</sup>), which are among the most strongly upregulated transcripts in AGRP neurons during food-deprivation. Other oxidative stress transcripts were also upregulated, such as peroxiredoxin 2, <italic>Prdx2</italic> (+1.9-fold, p = 0.0004), the transcription factor <italic>Hif1a</italic> (+1.8-fold, p = 0.005) and the oxidative regulatory enzyme prolyl hydroxylase (<italic>P4hb</italic>, +2.7-fold, p = 8e<sup>−7</sup>). Together, this group of cell type-selectively upregulated genes is consistent with an adaptive response to increased oxidative stress in AGRP neurons during energy deficit.</p><p>UPR also typically leads to ERAD of unfolded proteins. E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme subunits (<italic>Ube2j1</italic>, <italic>Ube2g2</italic>, <italic>Ube2q1, Ube2z, Ube4b</italic>) and the E3 ligase <italic>Park2</italic> were upregulated in AGRP neurons during food-deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>Os9</italic>, a lectin that senses misfolded proteins, and <italic>Edem3</italic> and <italic>Stt3b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which are enzymes that mark unfolded proteins for ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sato et al., 2012</xref>), were also increased. In addition, <italic>Vcp</italic>, a component for retrotranslocation of polyubiquitinylated unfolded proteins for degradation, was elevated in AGRP neurons during energy deficit. Collectively, this pattern of gene expression indicates engagement of ERAD during food-deprivation.</p><p>UPR is protective to cells for short periods of elevated ER-stress, but prolonged activation can result in apoptosis. The pro-apoptotic <italic>Ddit3</italic> (<italic>Chop</italic>) is typically upregulated during UPR, however <italic>Ddit3/Chop</italic> was unchanged in AGRP neurons after 24-hr food deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Instead, a variety of anti-apoptotic transcripts <italic>Bcl2l</italic> (<italic>Bcl-xl</italic>), <italic>Manf</italic>, <italic>Mcl1</italic>, and the caspase inhibitor <italic>Cflar</italic> were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). <italic>Mcl1</italic> upregulation is consistent with a previously established pathway Creb3l2 → Atf5 → Mcl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Izumi et al., 2012</xref>), each member of which is upregulated in food deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). <italic>Irak2</italic> (−4.7-fold, q = 3.7e<sup>−5</sup>) was strongly suppressed, consistent with reports that its reduction is protective against apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Benosman et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the cellular stress-induced transcript <italic>Atf3</italic> (+15.5-fold, q = 0.005) also promotes neuron survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Francis et al., 2004</xref>) and is increased with food deprivation. This pattern of gene expression provides preliminary evidence of a potential role for anti-apoptotic pathways in AGRP neurons during activation in response to energy deficit.</p><p>Taken together, cell type-specific transcriptional profiling, immunohistochemistry, and a cell type-specific UPR reporter construct indicate engagement of ER-stress pathways selectively in AGRP neurons during energy deficit. Increased neuron activity and elevated neuropeptide production associated with food-deprivation is expected to increase the translational-load in AGRP but not POMC neurons, and UPR may serve to cope with elevated neuropeptide and synaptic output. This is due, in part, to Xbp1s signaling and also results in induction of gene expression associated with oxidative stress responses, ERAD, and protection of cells from apoptotic pathways that might otherwise be associated with prolonged ER-stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Regulation of circadian genes by food-deprivation</title><p>Expression of genes associated with circadian regulation was strongly altered by food-deprivation.

To explore this idea, we tested a number of secreted proteins that were downregulated in AGRP neurons after food deprivation and previously had not been examined for regulation of food intake. Based on these criteria, we selected four peptides for further analysis: Pleiotrophin (<italic>Ptn</italic>, −2.3-fold, q = 0.005), a heparin-binding cytokine, which inhibits receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase β/ζ; autotaxin (<italic>Enpp2</italic>, −2.2-fold, q = 0.00013), a secreted enzyme that converts lysophosphatidylcholine into the lipid second messenger lysophosphatidic acid; cerebellin 4 (<italic>Cbln4</italic>, −7.6-fold, q = 2.9e<sup>−5</sup>), a transneuronal regulator of synaptic function; and bone morphogenic protein 3 (<italic>Bmp3</italic>, −17.7-fold, q = 2.0e<sup>−5</sup>), a member of the TGFβ superfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

To test whether these proteins influence food intake, we delivered them by intracerebroventricular injection.

This cell type-specific RNA-Seq resource from AGRP and POMC neurons reveals an extensive program of gene expression changes selectively in AGRP neurons during energy deficit associated with increased protein translation and folding, circadian gene expression, increased neuronal activity and synaptic release of neurotransmitter and neuropeptides, and alterations in secreted protein and cell surface receptor expression. POMC neurons show a much smaller number of changes, and some of these are associated with reduced activity, as would be expected from suppression of POMC neuron function under energy deficit conditions. Therefore, AGRP neurons are much more sensitive to energy deficit states than POMC neurons.</p><p>Differential gene expression in AGRP neurons after food deprivation is also considerably greater than has been observed in other cell types after various perturbations of brain state. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miller et al. (2011)</xref> compared gene expression in fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons from 48-hr muscimol-treated and saline-treated sides of motor cortex, which led to dramatic alteration in firing properties of these neurons but only 13 DEG (q &lt; 0.05). We observed &gt;160-fold more DEG in AGRP neurons after food-deprivation using the analysis criteria as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miller et al. (2011)</xref>. Another strong neuronal perturbation, genetic ablation of the important transcriptional repressor <italic>Mecp2</italic>, only resulted in 10–50% of the number of DEG in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sugino et al., 2014</xref>) compared to AGRP neurons from FD mice using the same analysis criteria. Finally, RNA-Seq analysis of motor neurons in an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mouse model showed only 62 genes differentially expressed (q &lt; 0.05) relative to wildtype motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2013</xref>), which is 34-fold fewer differentially expressed transcripts than from AGRP neurons under food deprivation using the same analysis criteria. The high number of DEG in our dataset is influenced by our study's greater statistical power, use of RNA-Seq (instead of microarrays), as well as high purity and more narrowly defined cell types. However, the relatively small number of DEG measured in POMC under similar experimental conditions indicates that the magnitude of changes in gene expression in AGRP neurons is also based on a selectively tuned response in these neurons to the energy deficit physiological state. Therefore, our results show that neuronal gene expression in vivo can have much greater dynamic changes from alteration of genetic, physiological, or behavioral state than previously reported.</p><p>Many DEG were consistent with ER-stress responses associated with the transition to elevated protein translation in AGRP neurons during periods of increased neuropeptide release. Indeed, secreted proteins are among the most abundant transcripts in AGRP neurons and their abundance increases further during energy deficit. We observed increased splicing of the UPR regulator Xbp1s, as well as multiple protein folding chaperones, transcripts encoding protein degradation machinery, and oxidative stress signaling molecules during food deprivation. This adaptive cellular response to food deprivation in AGRP neurons is different to what has been found using whole hypothalamus analysis, where UPR signaling has been primarily associated with overnutrition states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ozcan et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of Xbp1s in POMC neurons has been shown to facilitate the function of those neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Williams et al., 2014</xref>), and a similar effect may be operating in AGRP neurons. In addition, we found that anti-apoptotic pathways were also prominently increased in AGRP neurons during food-deprivation, which is also indicative of considerable cellular stress and the importance of protecting against cell death for this critical energy homeostasis neuron population.</p><p>We also found reduced expression of E-box-regulated circadian genes during energy deficit in AGRP neurons. AGRP neurons contribute to increased locomotor activity during scheduled feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tan et al., 2014</xref>), which is associated with the food-entrained circadian rhythm. Moreover, E-box genes are expressed primarily during the light period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rey et al., 2011</xref>), when mice normally eat little, and suppression of these genes is similar to the expression level of these genes at night, a time when mice consume the most food. The cause and downstream consequences of this ‘night-like’ pattern of circadian gene expression are an important area for further investigation into the circadian control of AGRP neurons, but transcriptional repression involving <italic>Sfpq</italic> (<italic>Psf</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duong et al., 2011</xref>) is a candidate molecule for this pathway.</p><p>GPCR gene expression was also substantially altered by food-deprivation in both AGRP and POMC neurons. For AGRP neurons, this was largely associated with G<sub>q</sub>- and G<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCR upregulation as well as reduced G<sub>i</sub>-coupled GPCRs. This is in line with activation of AGRP neurons by G<sub>q</sub>-protein-coupled signaling pathways through the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled DREADD hM3Dq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, overexpression of the constitutively active G<sub>s</sub>-protein-coupled <italic>Gpr6</italic> in AGRP neurons led to a significant increase in body weight. A similar role may extend to other constitutively active G<sub>s</sub>-protein-coupled receptors that are upregulated by energy deficit, such as <italic>Gpr3</italic> and <italic>Gpr64</italic>, and this effect is likely enhanced by the concomitant fall in G<sub>i</sub>-protein coupled receptor expression. Interestingly, we noted that <italic>Hrh1</italic> and <italic>Hrh3</italic> are sharply reduced in AGRP neurons during energy deficit, indicating reduced responsiveness to histamine. Because GPCRs are of considerable interest as targets for drug development, this resource of AGRP and POMC neuron-expressed GPCRs provides multiple possibilities for modulating the function of these key energy homeostasis-regulating neuron populations.</p><p>Neuropeptide genes were strongly differentially expressed in AGRP neurons. <italic>Ccl17</italic> has not been functionally investigated in the brain, but it was highly increased by food-deprivation as confirmed by RNA-Seq and smFISH, and overexpression in AGRP neurons increased body weight, consistent with a role in energy homeostasis. Notably, several neuropeptide genes that were strongly downregulated reduced appetite when injected in the lateral cerebral ventricle. For example, the neuropeptide CBLN4 strongly reduced food intake, and <italic>Cbln4</italic> has been implicated in regulating inhibitory synapse function and is thought to play a neuroprotective role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chacon et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, PTN is an inhibitor of receptor tyrosine phosphatase β/ζ, and its reduction might reduce cytokine signaling through tyrosine kinase receptors, which include leptin and insulin receptors.</p><p>Another important application of cell type-specific RNA-Seq data is to investigate the electrical properties of neurons. A list of expressed ion channels and how they are altered with food-deprivation provides a molecular framework for electrical activity in these neurons. Ex vivo and in vivo recordings of AGRP neuron activity have shown elevated activity and indicated the importance of burst firing in AGRP neurons during energy deficit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Betley et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we show that an important contributor to AGRP neuron excitability and burst firing in FD mice is reduced expression of the SK3 channel transcript <italic>Kcnn3</italic>. In fed mice, this calcium-activated potassium channel reduces electrical activity during elevated firing, and we find that SK-channel blockade in AGRP neurons promotes burst firing in brain slices.</p><p>Taken together, the data described in this resource provide a framework for extensive analysis of energy homeostasis circuits as well as other cell type-specific circuit nodes in the brain. Transcriptomic profiling was performed only on male mice, and future work should examine gene expression in female mice. However, these data allow insights into the cell biology of energy deficit-responsive neurons and highlight the remarkable specificity of gene expression responses of AGRP and POMC neurons. Moreover, in light of the intensive focus on new therapies for obesity as well as undereating disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gautron et al., 2015</xref>), this detailed resource of molecular components in key energy homeostasis neurons will be valuable to researchers aiming to devise small molecule and peptide modulators of these circuits. In addition, together with the rapid increase in known genetic variants associated with obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van der Klaauw and Farooqi, 2015</xref>), cell type-specific RNA-Seq data from these and numerous other populations essential for energy homeostasis may strengthen understanding of the cell type basis of obesity found in the human population.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All experimental protocols were conducted according to U.S. National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal research and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Janelia Research Campus (protocol 13-92).

Triturated cells were diluted (25 ml) and poured into a 100 mm Petri dish. After cells settled (5–10 min), labeled neurons were picked using a glass pipette (30–50 μm tip size) and transferred to a clean 35 mm dish containing ACSF with 1% FBS (2 ml). This manual sorting process was repeated two additional times and the final sorted neurons were transferred to a PCR tube containing extraction buffer XB (47 μl) from PicoPure Kit (KIT0204, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, United States), incubated (42°C, 30 min), and the mixture was stored at −80°C until library preparation.

We also estimated that 1 TPM corresponded to 3.2 ± 1.9 copies of transcripts/cell from the ERCC data.

Briefly, the authors manually sorted tagged AGRP and POMC neurons and subjected the cells to RNAseq analysis. Notably, they did this in fed and fasted mice. They provide a comprehensive assessment of gene expression changes, especially in AGRP neurons. They also provide some preliminary functional studies to support the functional significance of some of the changes observed in AGRP neurons. Overall, the studies are well performed and provide abundant novel information. Clearly, the results will be of wide interest. Although several other attempts have been made at collecting and dissecting the most useful transcriptomic information from hypothalamic circuits involved in body weight regulation, this study is offering additional value, mostly due to the scientific rigor applied throughout conceptualization and while conducting these experiments. Several issues remain to be addressed that would strengthen the manuscript:</p><p>Overall, the manuscript represents a useful analysis of gene expression, and one which will serve as a useful resource for researchers that study these neurons. Rather than having one or two large/main conclusions, however, the manuscript consists of many “smaller” conclusions that are touched upon throughout the Results and Discussion sections.</p><p>A major limitation of the manuscript is the contrast between the comprehensive nature of the gene expression changes vs the somewhat preliminary follow up studies. For example, the authors performed some feeding studies following ICV injections of a few candidate peptides that were altered in AGRP neurons. In addition, the authors overexpressed a few candidates (<italic>Ccl17</italic>, <italic>Gpr6</italic> and <italic>Bfp</italic>) in AGRP neurons using an AAV approach and assessed body weight changes. While it is understandable to provide some in vivo physiological validation/extension of the results, the findings are collectively not nearly as persuasive as the RNAseq data itself. In large part these studies distract from the comprehensive data set provided.</p><p>The heat maps as presented are not particularly user-friendly or useful for most readers – nor is their labeling. Converting to a more readable and less formidable format would greatly increase the accessibility of the data.</p><p>Another general criticism is the focus of this work on the “AGRP-neurons”, or more precisely the suggestion that those would somehow be the only important neurons governing systemic energy homeostasis. Although undoubtedly these neurons are involved in that process as shown by ablation studies, they are still representing a random group of cells based on their expression of the AGRP protein. Therefore using AGRP as the one and only guiding signal seems like an overestimation. At a minimum, the authors need to briefly discuss this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09800.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Overall, the manuscript represents a useful analysis of gene expression, and one which will serve as a useful resource for researchers that study these neurons.

However, the reviewers also acknowledge that it is “understandable to provide some in vivo physiological validation/extension of the results”. This latter point was exactly our intention. We wanted some indication of how predictive some of these findings were, which is why we performed a small number of follow-up experiments. Our interpretation of this critique is that the follow up experiments were called “distracting” because of their preliminary nature, which was not always stated clearly in the text by us. Therefore, we have responded to these reviewer concerns by better qualifying the significance of the follow up experiments and emphasizing their preliminary nature.</p><p>In the subsection “Endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways” we state:</p><p>“Consequently we examined multiple aspects of ER-stress signaling by analysis of our RNA-Seq data, coupled with preliminary evaluation of ER-stress signaling using immunohistochemistry, a cell type-specific UPR pathway reporter, and smFISH”.</p><p>“Taken together, Xbp1-splicing and the patterns of downstream gene expression indicate a previously unreported role for Ern1/Ire1→Xbp1s signaling in the adaptive response of AGRP neurons to energy deficit.”</p><p>“Elevated stress granule formation was not detected in AGRP neurons from food-deprived mice (p = 0.76, ks-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>), which provides preliminary evidence that Eif2ak3/PERK-mediated translational arrest may not be engaged at this 24-hr food deprivation time-point. Moreover, transcripts for ER protein translocation (<italic>Srp68</italic>, <italic>Srp72</italic>, <italic>Sec61a1, Sec61b1, Sec63, Serp1/Ramp4</italic>) and Golgi trafficking (<italic>Sec14l1</italic>, <italic>Sec22b</italic>, <italic>Sec24d</italic>) were upregulated in AGRP neurons, possibly indicating increased protein translation and folding capacity during energy deficit and consistent with the requirement for increased peptidergic neurotransmission for AGRP neuron function.”</p><p>“Together, this group of cell type-selectively upregulated genes is consistent with an adaptive response to increased oxidative stress in AGRP neurons during energy deficit.”</p><p>“This pattern of gene expression provides preliminary evidence of a potential role for anti-apoptotic pathways in AGRP neurons during activation in response to energy deficit.”</p><p>“Increased neuron activity and elevated neuropeptide production associated with food-deprivation is expected increase the translational-load in AGRP but not POMC neurons, and UPR may serve to cope with elevated neuropeptide and synaptic output.”</p><p>In the subsection “Regulation of circadian genes by food-deprivation” we clarify:</p><p>“However, detailed examination of pathways that regulate circadian E-box containing genes in AGRP neurons during energy deficit states is required.”</p><p>In the subsection entitled “G-protein coupled receptors”, we added the following:</p><p>“These experiments reveal a potential role for <italic>Gpr6</italic> and G<sub>s</sub>-coupled signaling in AGRP neurons for positive regulation of body weight.”</p><p>Finally, in “Secreted peptides” we stress:</p><p>“More strikingly, chronic viral overexpression of <italic>Ccl17</italic> and GFP in adult mice by selective expression in AGRP neurons (AGRP<sup>Ccl17</sup> mice) resulted in a progressive elevation of weight gain compared to mice expressing a fluorescent protein alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>), providing preliminary evidence that CCL17 may play a role in regulating body weight.”</p><p><italic>The heat maps as presented are not particularly user-friendly or useful for most readers – nor is their labeling. Converting to a more readable and less formidable format would greatly increase the accessibility of the data</italic>.</p><p>We have taken the approach of using colormaps to highlight aspects of the transcriptomic data that we believe will be of interest to the widest range of researchers in the area of energy homeostasis (ion channels, GPCRs, neuropeptides, etc). Of course, all readers have access to the complete data, but we wanted to provide a guide to key classes of transcripts explicitly in the figures to aid what we expect to be the majority of readers who are in the energy homeostasis field and interested in perusing the data but are not comfortable with downloading the data for deep analysis. Moreover, we know that many people would want to see some of the lists that we proved: e.g. top 30 DEG, all POMC neuron differentially expressed genes (DEG), all GPCR DEG, etc. The colormaps that we provided give easy access to important information that we expect to be used by scientists in the field. However, we are concerned by the reviewers’ critique that we have failed to organize or label these colormaps in an intuitive manner. We believe that the three most essential summary data for each category of gene expression are 1) mean expression level, 2) fold-change of expression level, 3) the q-value for differentially expressed transcripts. This is primarily what is shown in the colormaps, which are the most succinct way to represent these three types of summary statistics in a figure. We feel strongly that this information needs to be easily available to researchers. Therefore, based on the reviewers’ comments, we have worked to improve colormap and colorbar labeling to make reading these maps more intuitive:</p><p>a) Only in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> do we show data in the colormaps for individual samples so that the reader has a feel for the within-group variability. Because expression levels vary for different transcripts, these values are normalized to the max expression for that gene. To reduce confusion, for plots showing normalized expression, this is now noted directly on the figure with “Norm. expression” written at the top of these portions of the figure. Also the “max” column for summary data is now labeled max(TPM), which better indicates that it denotes an expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This issue of showing normalized expression is limited to this figure, and it is necessary to show maximum expression as a reference point for the normalized gene expression. We have also more extensively described the organization of the colormaps in the figure legend, in order to aid the reader.</p><p>b) Also, the colorbar labels, which are organized so that one set of colors is needed for all three scales (expression level, fold-change, and q-value), have been reorganized to be more intuitive. Now, the order of the labels reflects the ordering of the data (expression levels, fold-change, q-value). In addition, the label lfc has been changed to log2(fc) so that it exactly corresponds to the colorbar label.</p><p>c) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, the colorbar label is moved directly over the relevant color maps in order to help the reader know what each scale corresponds to.</p><p>d) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref> and all subsequent colormaps in the paper, the left columns show mean expression level of each group and this is now made more clear by including the word ‘mean’ prior to each group label. ‘lfc’ has been replaced with log2(fc), which is now consistent with the label on the colorbar. As above, the colorbar labeling scheme was slightly reorganized so that expression level is shown first, followed by fold change, followed by q value, which now follows to order of the data display in each panels’ colormaps. In addition, the figure legend is now much more explicit in the explanation of the colormap layout.</p><p><italic>Another general criticism is the focus of this work on the “AGRP-neurons”, or more precisely the suggestion that those would somehow be the only important neurons governing systemic energy homeostasis</italic>.</p><p>We entirely agree that AGRP neurons are not the only important neurons governing systemic energy homeostasis, and we have taken steps to avoid this unintended impression by altering the first sentence of the Introduction to read: “Neurons that express <italic>Agrp</italic> and <italic>Proopiomelanocortin</italic> (<italic>Pomc</italic>) comprise two intermingled molecularly defined populations in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) that mediate whole-body energy homeostasis <italic>in conjunction with other cell types</italic>.” The final sentence of the paper is also changed to read: “In addition, together with the rapid increase in known genetic variants associated with obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van der Klaauw and Farooqi, 2015</xref>), cell type-specific RNA-Seq data <italic>from these and numerous other populations essential for energy homeostasis</italic> may strengthen understanding of the cell type basis of obesity found in the human population.” However, we are not sure if the reviewers may be concerned about our discussion points highlighting the dramatically greater sensitivity of differential gene expression in AGRP neurons vs POMC neurons. This is not a statement of the relative importance of the two cell types but instead their relative sensitivity to that particular physiological stimulus. We go on to point out how remarkable this is compared to the magnitude of changes found in other examples of cell type-specific RNA-seq after profound neuronal perturbations.</p><p><italic>Although undoubtedly these neurons are involved in that process as shown by ablation studies, they are still representing a random group of cells based on their expression of the AGRP protein. Therefore using AGRP as the one and only guiding signal seems like an overestimation. At a minimum, the authors need to briefly discuss this</italic>.</p><p>Our data analysis suggests that the neurons marked by <italic>Agrp</italic> expression are not a random group of cells to the extent that they are clearly distinguished molecularly and functionally from intermingled POMC neurons. This point is made in the cluster analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1B</xref> and the MDS analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1G</xref>. Importantly, elimination of <italic>Npy, Agrp</italic>, or <italic>Pomc</italic> from the data still readily allows discrimination of the AGRP and POMC neuron data sets. We go on to show that this even holds if we eliminate all 694 differentially expressed genes between AGRP and POMC neurons (based on the criteria for DEG laid out in the Methods). This means that even the statistically insignificant differences in individual gene expression are collectively still sufficient to distinguish AGRP and POMC neurons. Note that in the third paragraph of the Results section we have written: “Therefore, transcriptional profiles indicate that these canonical markers [referring to <italic>Npy, Agrp</italic>, <italic>Pomc</italic>] are not required to determine cellular identity of AGRP and POMC neurons.” This emphasizes the point that AGRP neurons are not a random cell group defined solely by AGRP expression.</p></body></sub-article></article>
