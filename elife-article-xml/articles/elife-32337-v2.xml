about its precise effect on inhibitory synaptic connections. Here, we show that coinciding with eye opening, the strength of unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents (uIPSCs) from somatostatin-expressing interneurons (Sst-INs) to nearby excitatory neurons, but not interneurons, sharply decreases in layer 2/3 of the mouse visual cortex. In contrast, the strength of uIPSCs from fast-spiking interneurons (FS-INs) to excitatory neurons significantly increases during eye opening. More importantly, these developmental changes can be prevented by dark rearing or binocular lid suture, and reproduced by the artificial opening of sutured lids. Mechanistically, this differential maturation of synaptic transmission is accompanied by a significant change in the postsynaptic quantal size. Together, our study reveals a differential regulation in GABAergic circuits in the cortex driven by eye opening may be crucial for cortical maturation and function.</p></abstract><kwd-group

neocortical development, sensory experience critically inﬂuences neuronal connectivity and synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katz and Shatz, 1996</xref>). In the visual system, maturation of the visual cortex depends on visual afferent activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hensch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hofer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pecka et al., 2014</xref>). The initial visual inputs experienced through closed eyelids are imprecise and diffuse, and followed by patterned visual inputs after eye opening. In general, experience-dependent maturation of the visual cortex is a gradual process, but it accelerates soon after eye opening when the intensity and frequency of afferent visual activity suddenly and rapidly increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu and Constantine-Paton, 2004</xref>). Eye opening in rodents typically occurs over a short period of one to two days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gandhi et al., 2005</xref>). When experimentally synchronized, eye opening drives a rapid series of changes in neuronal activity, protein trafficking, synaptogenesis, synaptic receptor composition, and synaptic transmission and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu and Constantine-Paton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoshii et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, eye opening affects neuronal circuit development in the ascending retinothalamo-cortical pathway at every level: the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tian and Copenhagen, 2003</xref>), superior colliculus (SC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>), lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hooks and Chen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levitt et al., 2001</xref>), and visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoy and Niell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pecka et al., 2014</xref>). For example, the probability and strength of excitatory connections between layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (PCs) in the visual cortex significantly increased after eye opening, and these changes were prevented by dark rearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ishikawa et al., 2014</xref>). Although previous study reported that orientation tuning preferences of fast-spiking interneurons (FS-INs) were dependent on normal visual experience after eye opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuhlman et al., 2011</xref>), whether eye opening shapes inhibitory synaptic transmission in the neocortex during development remains unclear.</p><p>In the mature neocortex, GABAergic INs can be categorized into three main populations based on the expression of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV), the neuropeptide somatostatin (Sst), and the ionotropic serotonin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Sst-expressing INs (Sst-INs), comprising approximately 20 ~ 30% of all neocortical INs, are among the most prominent GABAergic IN subtypes in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>). Sst expression in the superficial neocortex has typically been associated with Martinotti cells (MCs)—GABAergic INs with ascending axons that arborize in cortical layer one and spread horizontally to neighboring columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fino and Yuste, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ma et al., 2006</xref>). A large fraction of Sst-INs preferentially target distal dendrites of PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di Cristo et al., 2004</xref>). In addition to providing lateral inhibition to local PC networks, cortical Sst-INs also precisely control the efficacy and plasticity of glutamatergic inputs by regulating postsynaptic spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, synaptic dynamics, dendritic spike bursts, and transformation of dendritic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Higley, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lovett-Barron et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, cortical Sst-INs not only innervate PCs but also frequently inhibit other cortical INs (disinhibition) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>). PV-expressing FS-INs, which constitute ~40% of cortical GABAergic neurons, form powerful synapses onto the somatic and perisomatic compartments of PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di Cristo et al., 2004</xref>). Although the emergence and maturation of connections from PV-INs to PCs and PV-INs have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lazarus and Huang, 2011</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pangratz-Fuehrer and Hestrin, 2011</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), the development of inhibitory synaptic transmission (including amplitude and connectivity) from Sst-INs to PCs and other IN subtypes remains largely unclear. In addition, accumulating evidence indicates that Sst-INs regulate learning-induced and experience-dependent cortical plasticity through feedforward as well as feedback inhibitions, both during early postnatal development and in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bloodgood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marques-Smith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tuncdemir et al., 2016</xref>). There is also clear evidence suggesting that PV-INs regulate critical-period experience-dependent plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hensch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krishnan et al., 2015</xref>). These observations raise important questions: Does eye opening play a role in the regulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission from Sst-INs and FS-INs to PCs or other types of INs, and if so, what is the synaptic mechanism underlying the regulation?</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that eye opening rapidly weakens the inhibitory synaptic transmission from Sst-INs to PCs, whereas it increases inhibitory synaptic transmission from FS-INs to PCs. Moreover, we show that the maturation of inhibitory synaptic transmission is mediated by differential changes in the postsynaptic quantal size.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rapid weakening of synaptic transmission from Sst-INs onto PCs coincides with eye opening</title><p>To explicitly identify Sst-INs in the neocortex, we crossed the <italic>Sst-IRES-Cre</italic> mice with the loxP-flanked <italic>Rosa26reporter-tdTomato</italic> mice. Sst-INs in the resulting progeny expressed red fluorescent protein tdTomato in the brain, and this facilitated electrophysiological recordings of Sst-INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>). We focused on layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>), we observed that ~5.2% of tdTomato<sup>+</sup> neurons expressed PV (5.2 ± 0.3%, nine slices from three mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Meanwhile, ~17.2% of tdTomato<sup>+</sup> neurons showed the FS properties (36 out of 209, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, FS tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells exhibited the distinctive basket cell morphology (4 out of 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These cells were omitted from further analysis. Non-FS tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells were further characterized by morphological properties, including ascending axonal arborizations with extensive branching in layer one and horizontal collaterals (19 out of 20, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), consistent with those of Martinotti cells as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fino and Yuste, 2011</xref>).</p><p>To study synaptic transmission from Sst-INs to PCs, we performed triple or quadruple whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to record three or four cells in layer 2/3 simultaneously: a tdTomato<sup>+</sup> Sst-IN and two or three nearby PCs whose cell bodies were within ~100 µm apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The PCs were identified by morphological characteristics (i.e., a large pyramidal shaped soma, basal and apical dendrites decorated with spines) and firing properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lazarus and Huang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schubert et al., 2001</xref>). Once all recordings were established, serial action potentials (at least 20 trials) were triggered in tdTomato<sup>+</sup> Sst-IN, and the inward unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents (uIPSCs) were measured in PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). To systematically study the development of synaptic transmission from Sst-INs to PCs (Sst-INs→PCs), we examined 391 Sst-IN→PC pairs at different developmental stages. We found that Sst-IN→PC connections emerged at postnatal day 7–8 (P7–8). The connection probability increased significantly from P7–8 to P9–11 (χ<sup>2</sup> test, p=0.0046; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and remained largely comparable from P9 to P20 (χ<sup>2</sup> test, p=0.149; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a ~65% reduction in the peak amplitude of uIPSCs from P12–13 to P14–15 (P7–8, 17.9 ± 2.9 pA; P9–11, 28.3 ± 5.4 pA; P12–13, 34.3 ± 4.8 pA; P14–15, 11.6 ± 1.8 pA; P16–17, 10.0 ± 1.4 pA; P18–20, 6.0 ± 1.9 pA; one-way ANOVA, <italic>F</italic><sub>(5,185)</sub> <italic>=</italic> 8.788, p=1.7 × 10<sup>−7</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Notably, this dramatic change coincided with the natural eye opening of mice under standard living conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the weakening of Sst-IN→PC uIPSCs may result from eye opening. Although the 10–90% rise time of uIPSCs at P18–20 was significantly longer than that at P7–8 and P12–13, the 10–90% rise time of uIPSCs did not significantly change at P9–17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Furthermore, the half-width of uIPSCs did not show any obvious change at P7–20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In addition, the total length and complexity of both apical and basal dendrites of PCs exhibited no significant difference between P12–13 and P14–15 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B–I</xref>), suggesting that dendritic morphology of PCs remains unchanged during eye opening. Of note, the connection probability and strength of Sst-IN→PC synaptic transmission exhibited similar development properties when we used cesium-based and high Cl<sup>-</sup> internal solution to record the postsynaptic currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32337.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Development of synaptic transmission from Sst-INs onto PCs in layer 2/3 of the visual cortex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schema of a quadruple whole-cell recording from an Sst-IN (red) and three PCs (blue) in layer 2/3.

Similar to Sst-IN→FS-IN uIPSCs, there was no obvious difference in the strength of Sst-IN→Htr3a-IN uIPSCs between P12–13 (before eye opening) and P14–15 (after eye opening) mice (P9–11, 19.1 ± 6.8 pA; P12–13, 21.9 ± 7.4 pA; P14–15, 25.6 ± 8.5 pA; P16–17, 28.6 ± 9.9 pA; one-way ANOVA, <italic>F</italic><sub>(3,37)</sub> = 0.183, p=0.907; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). These results suggest that the strength of Sst-IN→Htr3a-IN synaptic transmission does not change during eye opening.

However, the changes and plasticity of GABAergic circuitry during eye opening are still far from fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gandhi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuhlman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maffei et al., 2004</xref>). In this study, we show the following: (1) eye opening weakens the synaptic transmission from Sst-INs to PCs, but increases the synaptic transmission from FS-INs to PCs; (2) the inhibitory synaptic transmission from Sst-INs to other types of interneurons remains unaltered during eye opening; (3) eye opening-induced alteration of the inhibitory synaptic transmission onto PCs is mediated by changes in postsynaptic quantal size.</p><p>We studied the formation of inhibitory synapses onto layer 2/3 PCs and focused on Sst-INs and FS-INs. Although <italic>Sst-IRES-Cre</italic> line has been widely used to study Sst interneurons in cortical layer 2/3 both in vivo and in vitro, the neurons targeted by this line are heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, we observed that ~5.2% of Sst-tdTomato neurons in cortical layer 2/3 of visual cortex express PV and ~17.2% of Sst-tdTomato neurons show the fast-spiking properties. In spite of this heterogeneity, after removing these fasting-spiking tdTomato<sup>+</sup> neurons, we observed that the vast majority of tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells in cortical layer 2/3 of the neocortex are Martinotti cells (95%, 19 out of 20). We exploited the <italic>Sst-tdTomato::Lhx6-EGFP</italic> line and identified FS-INs by EGFP<sup>+</sup>/tdTomato<sup>-</sup> and fast-spiking properties in this study. Unlike PV-INs that innervate the cell body and proximal dendrites of the layer 2/3 PCs, Sst-INs innervate the distal regions of PCs, including the apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di Cristo et al., 2004</xref>). Notably, the synaptic strength measured in our study represents the strength at the soma of the recorded neuron rather than at the contact sites. These somatic recordings undoubtedly underestimate the distal dendritic tonic currents due to attenuation within the dendrites and limited spatial reach of somatic voltage clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams and Mitchell, 2008</xref>). Since significant differences were observed in neither the total length and complexity of PC dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) nor the rise time and half-width of uIPSCs between P12–13 and P14–15 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>), the relative change in the specific Sst-IN→PC connection strength is unlikely due to space-clamp bias. Moreover, the connection probability and strength of Sst-IN→PC uIPSCs exhibit similar developmental properties when we used a cesium-based intracellular solution (improve space clamp) containing a high concentration of Cl<sup>-</sup> (increase the driving force of uIPSCs) to record the postsynaptic currents.</p><p>We systematically examined the development of synaptic connections from Sst-INs onto PCs in layer 2/3 of the visual cortex. We observed that Sst-IN→PC connections emerge at P7–8, and the probability increases from P7–8 to P9–11. After P11, we found a dense and stable innervation of Sst-INs onto PCs, suggesting their crucial role in network activity. The increase in connection probability (from P7–8 to P9–11) was observed before the decline in peak amplitude of Sst-IN→PC uIPSCs (from P12–13 to P14–15), suggesting that the morphological growth and synapse function may be two independent processes. The average probability of Sst-IN→PC connections (~58% within 100 µm at P12–20) observed in this study agreed with that obtained via paired recordings in layer 2/3 of the somatosensory cortex (~63%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). However, the connection probability (~58%) is lower than those obtained through two-photon photostimulation in layer 2/3 of the frontal cortex (~70% within 200 µm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fino and Yuste, 2011</xref>) and through paired recordings in layer 2/3 of the visual cortex (~100% within 100 µm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>). Nonetheless, the connection probability (~58%) is higher than those reported with double or triple patch-clamp recordings in layer 2/3 (~20%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thomson and Lamy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yoshimura and Callaway, 2005</xref>), layer 4 (~40% at P14–15 and ~20% at P20–22) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miao et al., 2016</xref>), and layer 5 (~3%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Otsuka and Kawaguchi, 2009</xref>) of the visual cortex. These discrepancies may be due to regional differences, layer specificity, or methodological differences.</p><p>In addition, we observed that the development of inhibitory synaptic transmission onto PCs displays several distinct features in layer 2/3 of mouse neocortex. First, the strength of Sst-IN→PC synaptic connections is rapidly reduced by ~65% from P12–13 to P14–15. Although the developmental synaptic transmission from Sst-INs onto PCs has not been quantified systematically, previous work reported that connection strength from low-threshold spiking interneurons (putative Sst-INs) to excitatory spinal neurons increases from P12–13 to P14–15 in layer 4 of the rat somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Long et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, a recent study found that both the connection probability and strength of Sst-IN→PC synaptic connections decrease substantially from P14–15 to P20–22 within layer 4 of the mouse visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miao et al., 2016</xref>). The discrepancies may be due to layer differences (see below). Unlike Sst-IN→PC pairs, our data show that the strength of FS-IN→PC synaptic inputs in layer 2/3 of visual cortex rapidly increases by ~140% from P12–13 to P14–15. However, FS-IN→PC unitary conductance was reported to remain unaltered after P8 in layer 5/6 of mouse visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pangratz-Fuehrer and Hestrin, 2011</xref>). Similarly, Yang <italic>et al</italic>. observed that the strength of FS-IN→PC uIPSCs is not changed after P9 in layer 5/6 of mouse prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). These studies imply that FS-IN→PC synaptic transmission does not change in the cortical layer 5/6 during eye opening. In addition, the rapid change of synaptic transmission from Sst-INs and FS-INs onto PCs coincides with the onset of eye opening. However, we cannot determine the exact temporal sequence of the two events (change of synaptic transmission and eye opening) due to the variability in the timing of eye opening (1–2 d) and synaptic responses. Nonetheless, with a controlled eye opening paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu and Constantine-Paton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoshii et al., 2003</xref>), it will be interesting to further explore the sequence of events within the first 24 hr after eye opening. Lastly, the weakening of Sst-IN→PC synaptic transmission and the strengthening of FS-IN→PC synaptic transmission during eye opening exist not only in layer 2/3 of the visual cortex but also in layer 2/3 of the prefrontal Cg1/2 area. Indeed, eye opening has been shown to affect hippocampal development, and early eye opening accelerated the maturation of synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dumas, 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, it still remains unclear whether these changes are induced by light-mediated factors (vision in general) or vision-related factors (e.g. mobility directly or indirectly induced by the siblings or mother).</p><p>A major finding from our recordings in layer 2/3 of the visual cortex is that natural eye opening regulates synaptic transmission from Sst-INs and FS-INs onto PCs. This conclusion is based on three lines of experimental evidence. Firstly, visual deprivation (dark rearing) at an early postnatal period can prevent the weakening of Sst-IN→PC synaptic transmission. Secondly, eye opening deprivation (binocular lid suture) can efficiently prevent the changes in both of Sst-IN→PC and FS-IN→PC synaptic transmission. More importantly, we controlled the timing of eye opening by artificially opening the lids from the binocular lid-sutured mice two days after natural eye opening (P16) and compared synaptic responses between siblings with and without eye opening. Our data show that artificially opening the eyes decreases Sst-IN→PC synaptic transmission and increases FS-IN→PC synaptic transmission. These results strongly suggest that eye opening can specifically regulate the Sst-IN→PC and FS-IN→PC synaptic transmission in layer 2/3 of the visual cortex. Of note, a recent study found that although the synaptic strength of Sst-IN→PC connection significantly decreases from P14–15 to P20–22 within layer 4 of the mouse visual cortex, dark rearing does not affect the weakening of Sst-IN→PC synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miao et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, it has been reported that brief monocular visual deprivation during the time of eye opening selectively reduces the strength of synaptic transmission from PV-INs to PCs in layer 4 of the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maffei et al., 2004</xref>). These results suggest that visual deprivation-induced change in GABAergic circuits is layer- and cell type-specific. Indeed, accumulating evidence suggests that there are striking differences in morphology, intrinsic electrophysiological properties, and synaptic connectivity between layer 2/3 and layer 4 Sst-INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, no significant changes were observed in the peak amplitude of uIPSCs from Sst-INs onto FS-INs and Htr3a-INs, and from FS-INs onto FS-INs. Moreover, eyelid suture does not change the peak amplitude of Sst-IN→FS-IN uIPSCs and FS-IN→FS-IN uIPSCs. These results suggest that within layer 2/3 of the visual cortex, the inhibitory synapses made by Sst-INs and FS-INs exhibit remarkable speciﬁcity in their strength with speciﬁc targets during eye opening. It should be noted that Htr3a-INs encompass a heterogeneous population of INs, including Vip-INs, Npy-INs, and other types of INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chittajallu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>). It will be interesting to further investigate the development of synaptic transmission from Sst-INs to various subtypes of Htr3a-INs during eye opening.</p><p>Our data suggest that postsynaptic mechanisms may contribute to the developmental change of both Sst-IN→PC and FS-IN→PC synaptic strength. It is well known that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (including different subunits) mediate the majority of inhibitory synaptic transmission in the mammalian cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowery and Smart, 2006</xref>). In addition, different subunits of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor are selectively inserted at specific GABAergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali and Thomson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nusser et al., 1996</xref>). Moreover, previous studies indicated that the expression of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits in neocortex changes significantly during early postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowery and Smart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fritschy et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heinen et al., 2004</xref>). These findings suggest that the changes in subunit expression and/or composition of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor may induce the differential developmental alternations of Sst-IN→PC and FS-IN→PC synaptic strength during eye opening.</p><p>The physiological roles for the differential alterations of inhibitory synaptic transmission onto PCs during eye opening remain unclear. Growing evidence suggests that Sst-INs that densely innervate nearby PC dendrites in mouse cortical layer 2/3 are responsible for controlling the efﬁcacy and plasticity of synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiu et al., 2013</xref>). Given that in early postnatal life, GABAergic transmission is excitatory to immature postsynaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ben-Ari, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Owens et al., 1996</xref>), early emergence of Sst-IN→PC synaptic transmission may enhance the excitability of PCs, thereby promoting their maturation and synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oh et al., 2016</xref>). However, around the time of eye opening, Sst-INs would inhibit PCs. Therefore, decreased Sst-IN→PC inhibition after eye opening could enhance the effect of visual input onto excitatory neurons in the visual cortex by facilitating dendritic events in distal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Contrary to Sst-INs, FS-INs control the spike output of PCs by inhibiting their perisomatic sites. Increased FS-IN→PC inhibition after eye opening is a homeostatic response to the reduction of Sst-IN inhibition and the resulting increase in the excitability of PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bloodgood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). We speculate that such enhanced visual input to the visual cortex gated by Sst-INs and the homeostatic rebalancing of inhibition regulated by FS-INs might be important for visual integration, an essential step in visual perception.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32337.028</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A model depicting how eye opening differentially regulates inhibitory synaptic transmission in developing layer 2/3 of the visual cortex.</title><p>The development of inhibitory synaptic transmission before (<bold>A</bold>) and after eye opening (<bold>B</bold>). Sst-INs (red) primarily innervate distal dendrites of PCs (blue), while FS-INs (green) mainly target and inhibit somatic and perisomatic regions of PCs. Eye opening decreases the inhibition from Sst-INs to PCs. Decreased Sst-IN→PC inhibition after eye opening is predicted to enhance the effect of visual input (stronger signal input depicted by the thicker black arrow) onto excitatory neurons in the visual cortex by facilitating dendritic events. In contrast, synaptic inputs from FS-INs to PCs increase after eye opening. The increase of FS-IN→PC inhibition is speculated to involve in a homeostatic rebalancing of inhibition. The inhibition from Sst-INs to FS-INs remains unchanged during the time of eye opening.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-32337-fig8-v2"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Sst-IRES-Cre</italic></td><td>PMID: 21943598</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:013044">IMSR_JAX:013044</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Htr3a-EGFP</italic></td><td>PMID: 14586460</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MMRRC_000273-UNC">MMRRC_000273-UNC</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Lhx6-EGFP</italic></td><td>PMID: 14586460</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MMRRC_000246-MU">MMRRC_000246-MU</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Rosa-tdTomato</italic></td><td>PMID: 20023653</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:007914">IMSR_JAX:007914</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Red Fluorescent Protein</td><td>Rockland, USA</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2611063">AB_2611063</ext-link></td><td>1:500</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Green Fluorescent Protein</td><td>Aves, USA</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10000240">AB_10000240</ext-link></td><td>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-parvalbumin</td><td>Abcam, USA</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_298032">AB_298032</ext-link></td><td>1:500</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Donkey anti-mouse, Alexa <break/>Fluor 555 conjugated</td><td>Invitrogen, USA</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2536180">AB_2536180</ext-link></td><td>1:200</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Donkey anti-chicken, <break/>DyLight 488 conjugated</td><td>Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2340376">AB_2340376</ext-link></td><td>1:200</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Donkey anti-rabbit, Alexa <break/>Fluor 488 conjugated</td><td>Life Technology, USA</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_141708">AB_141708</ext-link></td><td>1:200</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Cy5-Streptavidin</td><td>Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2337245">AB_2337245</ext-link></td><td>1:500</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Four transgenic mouse lines, including <italic>Sst-IRES-Cre</italic> (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:013044">IMSR_JAX:013044</ext-link>), <italic>Htr3a-EGFP</italic> (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MMRRC_000273-UNC">MMRRC_000273-UNC</ext-link>), <italic>Lhx6-EGFP</italic> (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MMRRC_000246-MU">MMRRC_000246-MU</ext-link>), and tdTomato reporter <italic>Ai14</italic> (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:007914">IMSR_JAX:007914</ext-link>) were used in this study.

To test synaptic connections, we performed quadruple or triple whole-cell recordings. To test unitary transmission, we elicited a presynaptic action potential by injecting a brief suprathreshold current pulse (4–6 ms, 400–600 pA) intracellularly to the presynaptic cell. Postsynaptic cells were held at around −85 mV. Postsynaptic unitary responses were recorded 20–30 repeated sweeps at time intervals of 10 or 20 s. After that, a train of 4 or 10 current pulses (20 Hz) was injected into the presynaptic cell to assay the efficacy of synaptic transmission. After recording, slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS overnight at 4°C.</p><p>Recordings with R<sub>s</sub> &gt;30 MΩ were excluded from statistical analysis. R<sub>s</sub> was compensated during recording. Electrophysiological data were analyzed off-line with Clampfit 10.6 (Molecular Devices). The rise time of uIPSCs was assayed from the 10% to 90% rising phase, and the half-width of uIPSCs was defined as the duration at the half amplitude. Input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>) was the slope of the linear regression of current-voltage response curve. Spike threshold was the membrane potential with a rise rate of 5 V/s. Spike amplitude was the voltage difference between the threshold and the peak of the action potential. Spike half-width was defined as the duration at half-maximum. Afterhyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude was the voltage difference between spike threshold and the maximal hyperpolarization following the spike. For the paired-pulse ratio calculation, the averaged peak amplitude of the first IPSC was defined as the basal level of synaptic strength. The C.V. was assayed from the amplitudes of each sweep. The failure rate was calculated as the percentage of sweeps without postsynaptic response. The fast-spiking physiological properties were identified as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pangratz-Fuehrer and Hestrin, 2011</xref>). For immature neurons (P5–11), fast-spiking properties were characterized by subthreshold oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pangratz-Fuehrer and Hestrin, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The variance-mean analysis was performed as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mitra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scheuss and Neher, 2001</xref>). Recordings were first carried out in ACSF containing 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>/2 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and then the chamber solution was changed to ACSF containing 3.7 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>/0.3 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>/3 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Trains of 3 action potentials at 20 Hz were elicited, and 30–40 repeated sweeps were recorded, with 10–20 s sweep-to-sweep interval. Recordings with stable baseline were used for analysis. The mean (<italic>M</italic>) and variance (<italic>V</italic>) of uIPSC amplitude were calculated for each pulse. The relationship between <italic>M</italic> and <italic>V</italic> was fitted to the parabola <italic>V</italic> = <italic>QM − M</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>N</italic> (<italic>Q</italic>, quantal size; <italic>N</italic>, number of release sites). Quadratic regression was performed with GraphPad Prism five software (GraphPad Software).

Brains were carefully removed from the skull, post-fixed overnight at 4°C. The brains were rinsed in PBS and sectioned into 60 μm thick coronal slices with a VT1000S vibratome (Leica, Germany).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Eye opening selectively modulates inhibitory synaptic transmission in the developing visual cortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Simon J. B. Butt (Reviewer #2) and Alberto Bacci (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The study examines the postnatal maturation of connection probability and the kinetic characteristics of inhibitory signals at synapses of somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SSTI) targeting principal cells (PCs) as well as GABAergic interneurons (Htr3a-INs in layer 2/3 and INs in layer 1). The main observations are that connection probability of SSTIs increases onto both target PCs and INs as a function of postnatal development, in particular between P7/8 to P9/11. Moreover, the amplitude of unitary IPSCs selectively declines in target PCs between P12/13 and P14/15 at times when animals open their eyes (at ~P15). This observation is not selective for the visual cortex but could also be found in prefrontal brain areas. In contrast, peak amplitudes of unitary IPSCs at SSTI-Htr3a synapses and at SSTI-layer 1 IN synapses were unchanged. The authors propose that the decline in IPSC size depends on a reduction in the number of release sites and increase in quantal size. Moreover, pharmacological experiments indicate that additional postsynaptic mechanisms, particularly a decline in the expression of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit alpha5, play a role. The reviewers had major concern related to the technical standards of the recordings and the interpretation of the obtained data. Finally, they requested some additional experiments.</p><p>1) One major criticism was the high range of series resistances (Rs) of the recordings and the low Chloride concentration of the recording pipette solution resulting in a low driving force for chloride. Under these conditions it is very difficult to measure and quantify IPSC kinetics and finally to compare them at different times of postnatal development.</p><p>2. One reviewer was concerned about the lack of citations of new papers in the field relevant for the proposed study (see individual comments of the reviewers).</p><p>3. Concerns were raised in relation to the identity of the SST cells. Morphological reconstructions are missing as well as the proof that the applied SOm-Cre mouse line indeed results in the labelling of SSTs only, and no other types of neurons as recently reported. Physiological identification of the SSTs was also missing. Thus, a better SST-cell identification is required.</p><p>4. One reviewer was concerned with the interpretation of the data obtained from the cingulate cortex. These data allow the hypothesis that the change in the SST-IN to PC synapse is time locked across all cortical areas and NOT related to eye opening. The reviewer was asking whether other factors should also be considered. For completeness, it would have been good to study PV+ cells to examine whether or not the failure to reduce the amplitude of the SST-PC synapse could be compensating for reduced activity-dependent recruitment of this class of interneuron.</p><p>5. A major concern was formulated to data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. They are not completely convincing. Indeed, a proper multiple-probability fluctuation analysis requires changes of extracellular Ca/Mg to estimate quantal synaptic parameters. The fit with a parabolic function of the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> is unconvincing, as all points cluster on the left side of the vertex. Moreover, how did the authors exclude receptor saturation and/or desensitization? This is especially problematic for synapses that are far from the recording sites (as is the case of distal dendritic synapses). Thus, a proper quantal analysis is needed.</p><p>Despite these criticisms, the reviewers judged the study as very interesting and therefore suggested that the authors may consider resubmitting their study once the major concerns have been addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The study examines the postnatal maturation of connection probability and the kinetic characteristics of inhibitory signals at synapses of somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SSTI) targeting principal cells (PCs) as well as GABAergic cells (Htr3a-INs in layer 2/3 and INs in layer 1). The authors focus these studies on the critical period at P14/5 during which eyes of mice are opened for the first time. The main observations are that connection probability of SSTIs increases onto both target PCs and INs as a function of postnatal development, in particular between P7/8 to P9/11. Moreover, the amplitude of unitary IPSCs selectively declines in target PCs between P12/13 and P14/15 at times when animals open their eyes (at ~P15). This observation is not selective for the visual cortex but could also be found in prefrontal brain areas. In contrast, peak amplitudes of unitary IPSCs at SSTI-Htr3a synapses and at SSTI-layer 1 INs, synapses were unchanged. The authors propose that the decline in IPSC size depends on a reduction in the number of release sites and increase in quantal size. Moreover, pharmacological experiments indicate that additional postsynaptic mechanisms particularly a decline in the expression of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit alpha5 play a role.</p><p>1) The mechanisms underlying a decline in IPSC size onto PCs is unclear. The authors propose a decline in the number of presynaptic release sites and at the same time an increase in the quantal content. A decline in the number of release sites should be reflected in an increased failure rate, independent on the quantal size. Moreover, the enhanced quantal content should be reflected in at least a trend to larger mIPSC amplitudes. Please explain.</p><p>2) A decline in the number of release sites is very interesting. However, additional confirmation such as electron microscopical investigations or immunohistochemical labelling of the location and the number of synaptic contact sites would be important to strengthen the conclusions. How does this compare to findings at P19/20 at almost full mature stages? Is there an additional change in synaptic function as proposed by Miao et al., 2016?</p><p>3) The same criticism applies to the alpha5 GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits. Additional confirmation of the pharmacological data would be very helpful in order to confirm the proposed conclusions. How selective is the applied agonist?</p><p>4) An important issue is the fact, that experiments have been performed at a series resistance (Rs) of up to 30 MOhm without Rs compensation. This broad range of Rs and its lacking compensation will have an enormous effect on the size of the measured IPSCs as well as the kinetic properties of IPSCs. The reviewer would therefore strongly recommend reducing the threshold of the Rs to ~15 MOHM and accordingly check whether the data allow the same conclusions.</p><p>5) It remains unclear why whole-cell recordings have been performed with a K-gluconate based intracellular solution containing ~20 mM Cl<sup>-</sup>. What was the experimentally determined reversal potential of IPSCs? It may have been a value of ~-65 mV (estimate of the reviewer). At a holding potential of -85 mV this will result in a driving force of only ~20 mV. This is a very small driving force for Cl<sup>-</sup>, for the main aim to measure differences in IPSC sizes.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref> show that the mean difference in the IPSC size between SST-PC connections at P12/13 and at P14/15 depends on few paired recordings in which the IPSC size at P12/13 was above 50 pA (n = 2 pairs). Please provide data on the distribution of IPSC sizes in both IPSC groups.</p><p>7) Increase in connectivity rises already at P9/11 prior to the decline in IPSC amplitude and reduced number of release sites at P14/15 suggesting that morphological growth and synapse function are here two independent processes. This should be emphasized and discussed in the manuscript.</p><p>8) The here shown data should be discussed in more detail with findings of Miao et al., 2016 who performed at least partly overlapping investigations in the visual cortex during postnatal development. In their study, reduced IPSC size correlated with reduced release sites and increased failure rate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The paper by Yu and colleagues is a worthy endeavour that uses multi-cell patch clamp electrophysiology to interrogate developing synaptic connections between somatostatin (SST)-positive interneurons and other neuronal subtypes, notably pyramidal cells, in the superficial layers of visual cortex. Such electrophysiology investigations are the 'gold standard' as they can provide high-resolution temporal assessment of synaptic kinetics.</p><p>1) The Introduction provides a reasonable summary of the field but the references cited could and should be updated to give the reader a more comprehensive and current view of the field. The following are just a few examples:</p><p>(i) In the first paragraph, it would apt to cite a number of recent papers on the subject of visual refinement post-eye opening, for example, Hoy &amp; Niell, (2015) and work from the Mrsic-Flogel and Hoffer labs among many.</p><p>(ii) The authors state that our knowledge of how eye opening influences inhibitory neurotransmission is limited. However, it would be worth mentioning the work of Kuhlman et al., (2011) who investigated refinement of orientation bias in parvalbumin interneurons as an example of studies that have been performed to date.</p><p>(iii) The list of references cited here should be expanded: (i) include reference to Marques-Smith et al., (2016), who identified an early SST interneuron circuits in somatosensory cortex that forms a transient feed-forward GABAergic connections and (ii) include Oh et al., (2016) who demonstrated that GABA release from SST interneurons can promote synaptogenesis in mouse cortex.</p><p>Following these suggestions the authors might like to reconsider the statement and references cited in the Discussion section that &quot;the changes and plasticity [of GABAergic circuits] during eye opening… has generally been neglected&quot;.</p><p>2) In the Results section: On a number of occasions the authors make vague reference to data that should be included to fully support their conclusions:</p><p>(i) I am uncomfortable with the declaration that the authors &quot;explicitly&quot; identified SST interneurons using the <italic>Sst-ires-Cre</italic> mouse in the absence of further data supporting this claim. There is evidence (Hu et al., 2013) that this GM mouse line labels and can be used to record fast spiking interneurons – typically associated with PV-expressing, basket cells. The authors state that cells were based on morphological and intrinsic electrophysiological data – it is important that this is shown in full.</p><p>(ii) Provide similar full data sets for the pyramidal cells.</p><p>3) Results section: The authors compare P12-P13 with P14-P15 (see for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). Please could they include the other time points recorded to give a more complete picture of the early IPSC kinetics? Comparison of these time points seems odd given the variability in eye-opening reported at P14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>4) Results section: I am intrigued by the data from cingulate cortex. This is largely ignored in the rest of the manuscript – apart from a brief mention in the discussion – but would appear to suggest that the change in the SST-IN to PC synapse is time locked across all cortical areas and NOT related to eye opening? I appreciate that the subsequent data – for example the eye suturing experiments – support the eye opening-dependent hypothesis but perhaps there are other factors not considered? For completeness it would have been good to study PV+ cells to examine whether or not the failure to reduce the amplitude of the SST-PC synapse could be compensating for reduced activity-dependent recruitment of this class of interneuron. I appreciate that the authors suggest that these cells do not change after P9 (Discussion section) but these data are obtained from L5 visual cortex and prefrontal cortex. The argument put forward in the Discussion section for not recording PV+ cells is weak: The Hestrin lab and others have taken advantage of the G42 line to reliably identify putative-PV+ cells in neonatal cortex. A genetic strategy similar to that described on p.15 could have been employed. Indeed, it was likely that a large proportion of the cells labelled with GFP in the GAD-GFP line would have been putative PV+ cells. It is worth noting that Anastasiades et al., 2016 have shown that putative PV+, FS interneurons can be reliably differentiated from SST+, non-FS cells at early neonatal ages on the basis of a combined morphological and electrophysiological assessment.</p><p>5) Results section: The authors should acknowledge that the Htr3a line encompasses a much more diverse population than that studied by Pfeffer et al., (2013). It is important to acknowledge interneuron diversity and not assume that any of the GM lines used provide a homogeneous cohort in the absence of detailed characterization.</p><p>6) Results section: This data could be reasonably condensed or the rationale explained more clearly for why they recorded and separately report data from layer 1, then 2/3 then all the neuronal subtypes together.</p><p>7) Discussion section: This statement about eye-opening and development of other brain regions is not supported by the data presented in the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Guan and colleagues report an interesting observation, namely that SST-positive interneurons of mouse visual cortical layer 2/3 scale down their inhibitory synaptic responses, following eye opening and selectively on pyramidal neurons. The authors go on and show that this is not due to the actual intrinsic development of cortical circuits, but, rather, it depends on visual sensory activity. They conclude that this effect depends on a combination of pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms at GABAergic synapses between SST interneurons and layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons.</p><p>The manuscript is very well written, and the experiments are illustrated with a clear logic. The finding seems robust and quite interesting. The paper has, however, some limitations.</p><p>1) Use of <italic>Sst-IRES-Cre</italic> mouse: whereas this mouse line has been widely used to study SST interneurons in cortical layer 2/3 both in vivo and in vitro, cortical SST cells are heterogeneous (Scheyltjens and Arckens, 2016; Hu et al., 2013; Rossier et al., 2015). The authors claim that they restricted their analysis on Martinotti cells, but the evidence that they provide is anecdotal. Indeed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> shows only one reconstructed neuron: It would be useful to know if that interneuron was representative of the entire sampled population. The authors should include a quantitative morphological analysis of axonal projections on some recorded neurons to corroborate their claim that they are recording Martinotti cells. Likewise, there is no quantification of the firing properties, but only two representative traces are shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). If the authors want to make the point that they consistently record from Martinotti cells, they should provide more solid evidence.</p><p>2) The reduction of SST-P GABAergic synapses induced by eye opening seems to be target specific. This is indeed interesting, and the causal link between eye opening and synaptic weakening, is the core of the article. Importantly, however, potential non-specific effects induced by their manipulations should be ruled out. Target specificity of dark rearing and artificial eye opening at P17 is missing: it would be nice to see that dark rearing and/or eye surgery does not affect the other connections (SST-IN =&gt; L1-IN or SST-IN =&gt; L2/3 Htr3a-IN) as they showed for the developmental characterization.</p><p>3) It is not entirely clear to me why the authors chose layer 1 interneurons and 5-HT3a positive cells as other postsynaptic targets.

The fit with a parabolic function of the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> is unconvincing, as all points cluster on the left side of the vertex. Moreover, how did the authors exclude receptor saturation and/or desensitization?

Moreover, fast-spiking interneuron-mediated signaling increases after eye opening onto PCs. This is caused by postsynaptic mechanisms and expressed as decline vs increase in the quantal content but not by presynaptic mechanisms such as release probability or number of release sites. Although experimentally well done, it remains unclear what factor induces the postsynaptic change in quantal size.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The new data with PV cells are important and add significant impact to the manuscript. The authors show that the developmental change of inhibitory strength from PV cells goes in the opposite direction than that of SST interneurons. The target-specific effects of SST-cell synapses are interesting and this raises the question of whether also PV-PV connections are not affected as PV-PC synapses. Therefore, please perform additional PV-PV paired recordings.</p><p>2) It remains unclear what factor induces the change in synaptic inhibitory strength. Since it is a postsynaptic effect, direct signaling mechanisms induced by the presynaptic interneuron are not likely to be involved (failure rate, release probability are unchanged). Since the main observation was obtained in both the visual and cingulate cortex, it remains unclear whether the here described main phenomenon has indeed something to do with light-mediated factors (vision in general) or vision-related factors such as mobility directly or indirectly induced by the siblings or mother.

The authors focus these studies on the critical period at P14/5 during which eyes of mice are opened for the first time. The main observations are that connection probability of SSTIs increases onto both target PCs and INs as a function of postnatal development, in particular between P7/8 to P9/11. Moreover, the amplitude of unitary IPSCs selectively declines in target PCs between P12/13 and P14/15 at times when animals open their eyes (at ~P15). This observation is not selective for the visual cortex but could also be found in prefrontal brain areas. In contrast, peak amplitudes of unitary IPSCs at SSTI-Htr3a synapses and at SSTI-layer 1 INs, synapses were unchanged. The authors propose that the decline in IPSC size depends on a reduction in the number of release sites and increase in quantal size. Moreover, pharmacological experiments indicate that additional postsynaptic mechanisms particularly a decline in the expression of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit alpha5 play a role.</p><p>1) The mechanisms underlying a decline in IPSC size onto PCs is unclear. The authors propose a decline in the number of presynaptic release sites and at the same time an increase in the quantal content. A decline in the number of release sites should be reflected in an increased failure rate, independent on the quantal size. Moreover, the enhanced quantal content should be reflected in at least a trend to larger mIPSC amplitudes. Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this issue. We agree with reviewer that decline in the number of release sites should be reflected in an increased failure rate (the failure rate in this study is unchanged). We think the conflict should be largely due to the inaccurate quantal analysis/methods using in this study. In the revised manuscript, we used the theoretically expected parabolic relationship between the variance and mean of synaptic responses under different external Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations to obtain the estimates of the presynaptic release sites (N) and the postsynaptic quantal size (Q). Moreover, we used a Cs-based intracellular solution (improve space clamp) containing high concentration of Cl<sup>-</sup> (increase the driving force of uIPSCs) to record the postsynaptic currents. We found that the average values of N at P12–13 and P14–15 were not significantly different in both SST=&gt;PC and FS=&gt;PC synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and 7O</xref>). However, Q of SST=&gt;PC synaptic transmission at P14–15 was significantly lower than that at P12–13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>); whereas we found a significant increase in Q at P12–13 compared with the mice at P14–15 in FS=&gt;PC connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7P</xref>).</p><p>In addition, the quantal content of SST=&gt;PC connections in this study exhibited a decrease rather than an increase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A decline in the number of release sites is very interesting. However, additional confirmation such as electron microscopical investigations or immunohistochemical labelling of the location and the number of synaptic contact sites would be important to strengthen the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we revised the quantal analysis/methods. We found that the average values of the presynaptic release sites at P12–13 and P14–15 were not significantly different in both SST=&gt;PC and FS=&gt;PC synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and 7O</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How does this compare to findings at P19/20 at almost full mature stages? Is there an additional change in synaptic function as proposed by Miao et al., 2016?</p></disp-quote><p>Although we conducted similar quantal analysis as Miao et al., 2016, there are obvious distinctions between two studies. First, Miao et al. analyzed the number of release sites in PC=&gt;SST-IN excitatory synapses, whereas we studied SST-IN=&gt;PC inhibitory synapses. Second, Miao et al. studied the synaptic transmission within layer 4 of the visual cortex, whereas we examined the synaptic transmission in layer 2/3 of the visual cortex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The same criticism applies to the alpha5 GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits. Additional confirmation of the pharmacological data would be very helpful in order to confirm the proposed conclusions. How selective is the applied agonist?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable point. Given that the precise mechanism underlying the changes of SST-IN=&gt;PC and FS-IN=&gt;PC synaptic transmission during eye opening still remains largely elusive, we omitted α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs-related data in the revised manuscript. Instead, we have studied the development of synaptic transmission from fast-spiking PV interneurons (FS-INs) to pyramidal cells (PCs) in layer 2/3 of the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, unlike synaptic transmission from SST interneurons (SST-INs) to PCs, the strength of FS-IN=&gt;PC synaptic inputs in layer 2/3 of visual cortex was rapidly increased by ~140% from P12–13 (before eye opening) to P14–15 (after eye opening) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). More importantly, we further demonstrated that the dramatic increase can be prevented by binocular lid suture and reproduced by artificial opening of sutured lids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) An important issue is the fact, that experiments have been performed at a series resistance (Rs) of up to 30 MOhm without Rs compensation. This broad range of Rs and its lacking compensation will have an enormous effect on the size of the measured IPSCs as well as the kinetic properties of IPSCs. The reviewer would therefore strongly recommend reducing the threshold of the Rs to ~15 MOHM and accordingly check whether the data allow the same conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Indeed, the whole-cell recordings were performed at &lt;30 MOhm Rs, but we compensate it. We clarified it in the revised manuscript (Materials and method section). Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we reduced the threshold of the Rs to ~15 MOhm through using the low resistant recording electrodes (4–6 MOhm). We observed the connection probability and strength of SST-IN=&gt;PC uIPSCs exhibited similar developmental properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It remains unclear why whole-cell recordings have been performed with a K-gluconate based intracellular solution containing ~20 mM Cl<sup>-</sup>. What was the experimentally determined reversal potential of IPSCs? It may have been a value of ~-65 mV (estimate of the reviewer). At a holding potential of -85 mV this will result in a driving force of only ~20 mV. This is a very small driving force for Cl<sup>-</sup>, for the main aim to measure differences in IPSC sizes.</p></disp-quote><p>The theoretical reversal potential (calculated by using the Nernst equation) should be ~−50 mV in intracellular solution containing ~20 mM Cl<sup>-</sup>. Therefore, the driving force should be ~35 mV at holding potential of −85 mV.

I appreciate that the authors suggest that these cells do not change after P9 (Discussion section) but these data are obtained from L5 visual cortex and prefrontal cortex. The argument put forward in the Discussion section for not recording PV+ cells is weak: The Hestrin lab and others have taken advantage of the G42 line to reliably identify putative-PV+ cells in neonatal cortex. A genetic strategy similar to that described on p.15 could have been employed. Indeed, it was likely that a large proportion of the cells labelled with GFP in the GAD-GFP line would have been putative PV+ cells. It is worth noting that Anastasiades et al., 2016 have shown that putative PV+, FS interneurons can be reliably differentiated from SST+, non-FS cells at early neonatal ages on the basis of a combined morphological and electrophysiological assessment.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these comments. We have studied the development of synaptic transmission from fast-spiking PV interneurons (FS-INs) to pyramidal cells (PCs) in layer 2/3 of the visual cortex during the time of eye opening.

The authors show that the developmental change of inhibitory strength from PV cells goes in the opposite direction than that of SST interneurons. The target-specific effects of SST-cell synapses are interesting and this raises the question of whether also PV-PV connections are not affected as PV-PC synapses. Therefore, please perform additional PV-PV paired recordings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this issue. In the revised manuscript, we studied the development of synaptic transmission from fast-spiking PV interneurons (FS-INs) to FS-INs in layer 2/3 of the visual cortex. We found that the connection probability and strength of FS-IN=&gt;FS-IN uIPSCs exhibited no significant difference between the P12–13, P14–15 and P16–19 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, both the connection of probability and strength of FS-IN=&gt;FS-IN synaptic transmission exhibited similar results between P12–13 and P14–15 in sutured mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we systematically studied the development of FS-IN=&gt;PC synaptic transmission in layer 2/3 of Cg1/2. Similar to V1, we observed the peak amplitude of FS-IN=&gt;PC uIPSCs at P14–15, and P17–20 was significantly higher than that at P12–13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), while the connection probability remained comparable among P12–13, P14–15 and P17–20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, we demonstrated that strengthening of FS-IN=&gt;PC transmission in layer 2/3 of Cg1/2 can be prevented by binocular lid suture, and reproduced by artificial opening of sutured lids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Furthermore, no significant changes in the connection probability were observed betweeen P12–13, P14–15 and P17–20 sutured mice, and P17–20 artificially opened mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It remains unclear what factor induces the change in synaptic inhibitory strength. Since it is a postsynaptic effect, direct signaling mechanisms induced by the presynaptic interneuron are not likely to be involved (failure rate, release probability are unchanged). Since the main observation was obtained in both the visual and cingulate cortex, it remains unclear whether the here described main phenomenon has indeed something to do with light-mediated factors (vision in general) or vision-related factors such as mobility directly or indirectly induced by the siblings or mother. Therefore, please discuss more the effect of eye opening in cortical brain regions despite the visual cortex.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for reviewer’s comments.

Since GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit expression in neocortex exhibits significant changes during early postnatal development (Bosman, et al., 2002; Fritschy, et al., 1994; Heinen, et al., 2004), our main hypothesis is that the changes in subunit expression and/or composition of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor may induce the differential developmental changes of SST-IN=&gt;PC and FS-IN=&gt;PC synaptic strength during eye opening.</p></body></sub-article></article>
