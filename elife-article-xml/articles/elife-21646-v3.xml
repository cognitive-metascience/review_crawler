(ZTL) directs circadian timing by degrading clock proteins in plants. Functions hinge upon allosteric differences coupled to the ZTL photocycle; however, structural and kinetic information was unavailable. Herein, we tune the ZTL photocycle over two orders of magnitude. These variants reveal that ZTL complexes with targets independent of light, but dictates enhanced protein degradation in the dark. In vivo experiments definitively show photocycle kinetics dictate the rate of clock component degradation, thereby impacting circadian period. Structural studies demonstrate that photocycle dependent activation of ZTL depends on an unusual dark-state conformation of ZTL. Crystal structures of ZTL LOV domain confirm delineation of structural and kinetic mechanisms and identify an evolutionarily selected allosteric hinge differentiating modes of PAS/LOV signal transduction. The combined biochemical, genetic and structural studies provide new mechanisms indicating how PAS/LOV proteins integrate environmental variables in complex networks.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21646.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21646.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21646.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many living organisms track the 24-hour cycle of day and night via collections of proteins and other molecules that together act like an internal clock. These clocks, also known as circadian clocks, help these organisms to predict regular changes in their environment, like light and temperature, and adjust their activities according to the time of day.</p><p>Plants use circadian clocks to predict, for example, when dawn will occur and get ready to harness sunlight to fuel their growth. A plant called <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> has a light-sensitive protein called ZEITLUPE (or ZTL for short) that helps it keep its circadian clock in sync with the cycle of night and day. Previous studies have shown that light activates this protein causing part of it to change shape and then revert back after a period of about an hour and a half. However, it was unclear if this timing was important for ZEITLUPE to allow plants to keep track of time.</p><p>To help answer this question, Pudasaini et al. set out to identify a specific chemical event behind ZEITLUPE’s changes in shape. A chemical bond forms when light activates ZEITLUPE, and it turns out that how long this bond lasts before it breaks plays an important role in allowing plants to maintain a 24-hour circadian clock. This chemical bond controls the shape changes that guide the protein’s activities and, when Pudasaini et al. modified ZEITLUPE so that it took much longer for this bond to break, they could tune how fast the plant’s internal clocks run. In essence, the time between the bond forming and breaking breaks acts like a countdown on a stopwatch, and it must be precisely timed to keep the clock in pace with the environment.</p><p>These findings improve our understanding of how light can regulate an internal biological clock. This improved understanding could, in the future, allow researchers to manipulate how plants and other organisms respond to their environment. This in turn could change how these organisms develop, and how much they grow. As such, extending these findings into agricultural crops may one day lead to new ways to increase crop yields.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21646.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21646.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>circadian clock</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd><kwd>LOV domain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R15GM109282</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoltowski</surname><given-names>Brian D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008038</institution-id><institution>Herman Frasch Foundation for Chemical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>739-HF12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoltowski</surname><given-names>Brian D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003627</institution-id><institution>Rural Development Administration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJ011175</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Young Hun</given-names></name><name><surname>Imaizumi</surname><given-names>Takato</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB 1613643</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoltowski</surname><given-names>Brian D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM079712</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Imaizumi</surname><given-names>Takato</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM093285</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Somers</surname><given-names>David E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In the plant circadian clock photoreceptor ZEITLUPE, evolutionarily selected residues distinguish photocycle kinetics and allosteric signal transduction pathways to permit proper circadian timing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title id="head_1">Introduction</title><p>Organisms have developed signaling networks to measure and respond to daily (circadian) and seasonal (photoperiodic) alteration in environmental variables. Key to these circadian and photoperiodic responses is measurement of day length through complicated feedback loops involving sensory proteins. These sensory proteins involve members of the Period-ARNT-Singleminded and its Light, Oxygen, or Voltage (PAS/LOV respectively) subclass that couple photic-input to metabolic and stress pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lokhandwala et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sahar and Sassone-Corsi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taylor and Zhulin, 1999</xref>). Currently, how these signaling components are integrated is poorly understood due to a difficulty in decoupling photochemistry from allosteric protein changes and signal transduction. In plants and fungal species, LOV domain containing proteins act at signaling nodes to integrate sensory responses into circadian, reproductive and stress pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lokhandwala et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Imaizumi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Somers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zoltowski et al., 2007</xref>). Central to their function are two key elements of the PAS family: (1) The ability to sense and respond to diverse environmental stimuli, and (2) The presence of multiple interaction surfaces that engage targets in a selective manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The ability to trigger these elements with light has positioned LOV proteins as an allosteric model and enabled the development of LOV optogenetic tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pudasaini et al., 2015</xref>). However, limited understanding of how chemistry is linked to allostery and downstream signaling hampers our understanding of these systems.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21646.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Models of ZTL photochemistry and regulation of circadian period.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In the light, ZTL associates with both GI and degradation targets (PRR5/TOC1). During the day, the strong affinity for GI allows GI, ZTL, TOC1 and PRR5 levels to rise.

A consensus mechanism is summarized. LOV domains are typified by blue-light induced formation of a C4a adduct between a conserved Cys residue and a bound flavin (FAD, FMN or riboflavin) cofactor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zoltowski and Gardner, 2011</xref>). C4a adduct formation then drives rotation of a conserved Gln residue to initiate conformational changes within N- or C-terminal extensions (Ncap/Ccap) to the LOV core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zoltowski and Gardner, 2011</xref>). These N/Ccap elements in turn regulate activity of effector domains or recruit proteins to Ncap, Ccap or β-sheet surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,C,E</xref>). Upon incubation in the dark, or in the presence of UV-A light, the signaling adduct state spontaneously decays on a timescale of seconds to days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zoltowski and Gardner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kennis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pudasaini and Zoltowski, 2013</xref>). In this manner, LOV proteins dictate transiently stable signaling states capable of switching between a distinct on and off state depending on lighting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zoltowski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Halavaty and Moffat, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harper et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zoltowski et al., 2013</xref>). These photoswitchable functions have made LOV proteins targets for optogenetic devices; however, currently we have limited understanding of the role of LOV photocycle kinetics for in vivo function. Genetic and photochemical studies of plant circadian and photoperiodic timing indicate <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> may function as a model organism for delineating the roles of photochemistry and allostery in LOV function.</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, three LOV domain containing proteins ZTL, FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (FKF1), and LOV KELCH PROTEIN 2 (LKP2) act in circadian timing and seasonal flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baudry et al., 2010</xref>). Among them, the genetic functions of ZTL and FKF1 are highly characterized. Recent research indicates that their divergent roles in the circadian clock and photoperiodic flowering may enable interrogation of how chemistry regulates PAS/LOV protein function to select for signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zoltowski and Imaizumi, 2014</xref>).

In addition, the LOV scaffold engages multiple proteins in a selective manner to regulate clock function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zoltowski and Imaizumi, 2014</xref>). Despite conservation of domain elements, ZTL and FKF1 differ in their subcellular localization, degradation targets, and fundamental chemistry, thereby differentiating ZTL and FKF1 in circadian and photoperiodic timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zoltowski and Imaizumi, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Central to their function are key differences in photocycle kinetics.

In FKF1, photon absorption facilitates complex formation with GIGANTEA (GI) through its LOV domain (LOV-GI) to mediate degradation of CYCLING DOF FACTOR 1 (CDF1) and stabilization of CONSTANS (CO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Imaizumi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Song et al., 2012</xref>). Here, selection of degradation or stabilization appears to center on the domain involved in target recruitment, where the Kelch repeat domain (CDF1) specifies degradation and the LOV domain (CO) specifies stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zoltowski and Imaizumi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Song et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, both functions require both light and GI.</p><p>In contrast, constitutive mRNA levels and a fast photocycle for ZTL (τ = 1.4 hr) suggest possible day (light) and evening (dark) functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pudasaini and Zoltowski, 2013</xref>). Light-state ZTL has two primary functions, formation of a LOV-GI complex to allow protein accumulation during the day via enhanced ZTL/GI stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2007</xref>), and ZTL/GI-dependent destabilization of CO in the morning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Song et al., 2014</xref>). The latter results in antagonistic roles of ZTL and FKF1 in the photoperiodic response, and may contribute to a late-flowering phenotype in some ztl mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Somers et al., 2004</xref>). Throughout the night, ZTL mediates rapid degradation of the clock components, TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1) and PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 5 (PRR5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kiba et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fujiwara et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Más et al., 2003b</xref>). TOC1 protein levels contribute to the control of period length of the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zoltowski and Imaizumi, 2014</xref>). Impaired degradation of TOC1 by ZTL mutants lead to accumulation of TOC1 and PRR5 protein and a long-period phenotype consistent with strains harboring additional copies of TOC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Caluwé et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, TOC1 degradation appears to be in competition with GI, occurs with an approximately 2 hr delay following dusk, and is enhanced in the dark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zoltowski and Imaizumi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Más et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Song et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). Current models explain such behavior in TOC1/PRR5 turnover by imparting a differential function between day and night conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Caluwé et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pokhilko et al., 2013</xref>), where TOC1/PRR5 are targeted for degradation by ZTL regardless of lighting conditions, but degradation activity is enhanced in the dark. How this is achieved at the molecular and chemical level is not well understood.</p><p>Herein, we present a comprehensive study of ZTL signaling to develop a broad understanding of blue-light regulation of circadian and photoperiodic timing and to understand the evolutionary basis for divergent functions of ZTL and FKF1. Therein, we tackle two outstanding questions in the PAS/LOV field; (1) What purpose, if any, does the LOV photocycle lifetime play in biological function? Previous research proposed divergent roles for ZTL and FKF1 in the measurement of light intensity and day length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pudasaini and Zoltowski, 2013</xref>), however no experimental validation of such a model has been available. Further, with the exception of a fungal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dasgupta et al., 2015</xref>), the role of LOV lifetimes in biology remains elusive. (2) How do PAS/LOV proteins signal to multiple interaction surfaces to allow signal integration? Based on structural studies of ZTL we have developed protein variants that decouple photocycle lifetimes from signal transduction. In this manner, we show a definitive role of LOV lifetime in circadian timing. Further, we provide an allosteric model of LOV signal transduction enabling selection of diverse protein:protein interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title id="head_2">Results</title><p>Examination of mathematical models of circadian function reveals that ZTL photocycle kinetics may impart phase specific degradation of TOC1 and PRR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Caluwé et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pokhilko et al., 2013</xref>). Namely by replacing indistinct day and night conditions by a difference in activity between light and dark-state ZTL, where the light-state inhibits ZTL activity in regards to degradation. In this manner, dark-state reversion activates ZTL during evening. Incorporating ZTL photochemistry into existing models of PRR5 results in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> (see Mathematical model generation in methods), where c<sub>PRR5</sub> is the concentration of PRR5 protein, k<sub>1</sub> and k<sub>2</sub> the light and dark-state degradation constants and k<sub>3</sub> the rate of adduct decay for ZTL. An analogous equation, with equivalent k<sub>3</sub> dependence, can be derived for TOC1 (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ13">Equation S12</xref>), however, the expression pattern of TOC1 and complex regulation of TOC1 mRNA complicates analysis of TOC1 levels during the circadian cycle. For these reasons, we use the simpler PRR5 degradation data to mathematically test our model and use a qualitative analysis for examining effects of k<sub>3</sub> on TOC1 (see below).<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo> <mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow> <mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Examination of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> provides distinct predictions on the effect of the ZTL adduct decay rate constant (k<sub>3</sub>) on PRR5 and TOC1 levels. If rate-altering variants only affect photocycle kinetics, k<sub>3</sub> would dictate delays in PRR5/TOC1 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Under these conditions a long photocycle would lead to increasing delays in PRR5 and TOC1 degradation leading to progressively longer circadian periods. Unfortunately, testing such predictions is complicated by difficulties in manipulating photochemical kinetics without altering allosteric regulation of ZTL function.</p><p>To delineate these aspects we focused on three residues in close proximity to the flavin active site that differ between ZTL and FKF1. These are G46 (Ser in FKF1) that lies adjacent to the active site Q154 implicated in Gln-flip signal transduction mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zoltowski and Gardner, 2011</xref>), V48 (Ile in FKF1) that sterically interacts with C82 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zoltowski et al., 2009</xref>), and G80 that lies in a GXNCRFLQ motif (X80=G for ZTL, X=R for FKF1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The V48 position is known to alter LOV photocycle kinetics by V/I/T substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zoltowski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">El-Arab et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Christie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lokhandwala et al., 2016</xref>). This site has been exploited in optogenetic tools to tune signal duration under the presumption that it does not affect allosteric regulation of protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strickland et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, to the best of our knowledge, the G80 position has not been exploited for tuning LOV kinetics. This likely is due to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ZTL being unusual amongst LOV proteins in containing a Gly residue at this position. As a consequence of G80, ZTL expresses poorly in <italic>E. coli</italic> and is largely confined to inclusion bodies (see Materials and methods). Since, G80 is unique to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ZTL, and R/Q/K substitutions are permitted in other ZEITLUPE and LOV proteins (see Discussion), it is unlikely to affect allostery and may function as a site to uniquely affect photocycle kinetics.</p><p>Consistent with our predictions, kinetics of V48I and G80R differentiate ZTL and FKF1 type chemistry. Specifically, variants extend the ZTL lifetime from 1.4 hr (WT) to 6.6 (G80R) or 10.7 (V48I) hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Double variants G46S:G80R and V48I:G80R function cooperatively to extend the ZTL photocycle to 21 hr or &gt;65 hr respectively, very similar to WT FKF1 (62.5 hr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pudasaini and Zoltowski, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In addition, the difference in values for k<sub>3</sub> in these variants are sufficient to elicit theoretical differences in PRR5/TOC1 degradation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To verify that rate-altering variants do not also perturb allosteric regulation of ZTL function it is essential to obtain crystal structures of ZTL variants and to map an allosteric trajectory that couples C4a adduct formation to regulation of ZTL function. Towards these aims we solved 2.5 Å, 2.6 Å, and 2.1 Å crystal structures of dark-state WT ZTL, G80R and V48I:G80R (residues 29–165) respectively (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). In addition, the long-lived V48I:G80R variant enabled direct crystallization (2.3 Å) of the light-state adduct allowing for interrogation of signal transduction pathways.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21646.007</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Kinetics of thermal reversion for LOV constructs and variants at 296 K.

structures reveal an unusual mechanism of signal transduction in LOV proteins</title><p>All ZTL variants form solution dimers, crystallize in the same space group (P3121) and demonstrate topologically equivalent structures consistent with PAS/LOV proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). These structures reveal functional differences from all known LOV structures that differentiate the effects of V48I and G80R on ZTL signaling mechanisms. Namely, G80R structures are analogous to WT in all manners. The primary difference is the formation of a π-cation interaction that stabilizes the Dα/Eα linkage and C82 that is necessary for C4a adduct formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Increased rigidity of C82 imposed by the π-cation interaction is consistent with having an effect only on photocycle kinetics. In contrast, examination of V48I containing structures reveals distinct differences that identify allosteric signal transduction mechanisms to the N/Ccap. These mechanisms identify V48I as a residue that disrupts allosteric regulation of ZTL function. Below, we provide detailed analysis of ZTL in dark and light states to highlight these functional differences. We focus on two reported aspects of ZTL group function, LOV:LOV mediated homodimerization and allosteric regulation of Ncap and Ccap elements.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21646.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Structural analysis and LOV dimer formation in ZTL.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) G80R (dark-state, black; light-state (grey), WT (red), V48I:G80R (green), G46S:G80R (blue) all elute as dimers with apparent MWs of 38–41 kDa compared to the expected monomer of 16 kDa.

(<bold>B</bold>) Structure of ZTL active site (yellow) and residues involved in structural or kinetic modulation of signaling (purple). R80 within Dα forms a π-cation interaction with F84 directly above the photoreactive C82, resulting in steric stabilization of adduct formation. The observed steric stabilization through the π-cation interaction is consistent with the longer photocycle in G80R. V48I positions the additional methyl group into a pocket adjacent to N5, C82 and Q154. Comparisons of AsLOV2 structures (white; buried conformation), dark-state ZTL (yellow; exposed conformation) demonstrates that V48I can impact the position of Q154 between buried and exposed conformations. Movement of Q154 correlates with movement of F156 in Iβ. (<bold>C–F</bold>) ZTL monomers are defined by an antiparallel β-sheet flanked by a series of α-helices (Cα, Dα, Eα, Fα). The helices cradle the photoreactive FMN adjacent to C82 (Eα helix). ZTL contains a 9-residue insert linking the E-F helices that accommodates the adenine ring of FAD in some LOV proteins (black) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zoltowski et al., 2007</xref>). N- and C-terminal extensions (Ncap/Ccap; yellow) are largely disordered; however, a short helix within the Ncap reaches across a dimer interface in some molecules to form contacts between the Cα and Dα helices. Two dimer interfaces are formed through the β-scaffold in ZTL. The compact dimer (<bold>C,D</bold>) differs from the elongated dimer (<bold>E,F</bold>) by a 2.0 Å translation along the β-sheet. Key residues in the dimer interface are shown in yellow. The translation disrupts a network of sulfur-π and π-π interactions involving C45 and F47, centered around I151.

Consistent with solution studies, the crystallographic lattice is defined by two sets of anti-parallel dimers formed by extensive contacts along the β-scaffold. We term these interfaces the ‘compact’ and ‘elongated’ dimers based on a 2 Å translation that is coupled to the degree of order present within the Ncap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In the compact dimer, clear density for Ncap residues (31-43) is observed in one molecule that contacts the helical interface of the adjacent monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). In contrast, the elongated dimer contains no density for Ncap residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). A stabilizing element in both dimers is a hydrophobic core composed of a tetrad of Ile residues (l151 and I153).</p><p>Additional contacts along the helical interface define a possible secondary dimer. The helical dimer is parallel in orientation and involves contacts between the E-F helices and associated loop. Specifically, R95 forms a salt bridge with the phosphate moiety of FMN in the neighboring molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, based on two lines of evidence, we conclude that the β-scaffold interface represents the solution ZTL and FKF1 homodimers. First, FKF1 lacking the entire E-F loop and ZTL variants that disrupt R95 contacts remain dimeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakasako et al., 2005</xref>).

Orientations of WT/G80R Q154 are derived from the dark-state G80R ZTL structure with buried and exposed conformations shown for reference from V48I:G80R. WT/G80R and V48I:G80R deviate from typical LOV models (derived from VVD: light PDBID 3RH8, dark PDBID 2PD7) on the position of Q154. WT/G80R ZTL retains a heterogeneous orientation of Q154. We propose that Q154 is heterogeneous regardless of lighting conditions, but biased towards the buried conformation in the light. At dusk adduct decay, with rate constant k<sub>3</sub>, causes the Q154 conformation to be biased towards an exposed conformation, accelerating ubquitination of protein targets. For V48I, I48 selects the exposed conformation in the dark and leads to only partial burying of Q154 (shown in C, (<bold>D</bold>), leading to constitutively high ubquitination activity that mimics the dark-state of WT-ZTL.

The altered conformations contact the Aβ-Ncap hinge through G46 in the CGF motif (Ncap; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Here, Q154 abuts (3.4 Å) the Cα carbon of G46 (Ser in FKF1). The lack of a side chain at G46 permits favorable interactions for Q154 at the flavin O4 position and allows insertion of F156 into the flavin active site. In this manner an unusual orientation of Q154 links the Iβ-Ccap hinge and helical interface through a QFF motif (Q154-F155-F156). In most LOV proteins, the equivalent residue to F156 is hydrophilic and adopts a solvent exposed position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The resulting cavity occupied by F156 is filled by a Met or Leu residue (V69 in ZTL) from Cα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref>). In ZTL, the altered orientation of Q154 clashes with typical orientations of Cα. Steric clashes lead to movement of conserved F66 and rotation of V69 away from Q154 and the FMN binding pocket.</p><p>The combined interactions stemming from Q154 positions it ideally to have concerted conformational changes within Ncap and Ccap elements. Although, the Gln locus has been cited as the primary source of signaling in LOV proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zoltowski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Halavaty and Moffat, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Freddolino et al., 2013</xref>), the lack of interactions near N5 and Aβ is atypical. Thus, it is likely that ZTL does not involve an H-bonding switch in signal transduction and that canonical mechanisms of LOV signaling may not be universally conserved. Rather, we propose that steric interactions involving the flavin O4 position and G46 shift a dynamic equilibrium in the Q154 position to stabilize the ZTL protein in a light-state configuration. We posit that the heterogeneous orientation of Q154 destabilizes ZTL in the absence of covalently attached FMN, consistent with in vitro studies demonstrating a tendency to lose flavin rapidly. Upon light activation, ZTL is stabilized by covalent attachment of FMN (through C82) and results in movement of Q154 that necessitates rearrangement of the CGF, QFF and Cα sites to elicit signal transduction.</p><p>Dark and light state structures of V48I:G80R confirm concerted movement of Q154 that is linked to conformational changes in V/I48. The Q154 conformation is not heterogeneous in V48I:G80R, rather, the Ile side chain sterically directs Q154 to an exposed conformation near O4 that has not been observed in other LOV proteins. Comparing the dark-state to V48I:G80R grown in the light, confirms density for the C4A adduct and confirms direct crystallization of the light-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Difference density maps of the light-state molecule indicate that adduct formation is coupled to rotation of Q154 to a buried position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Unexpectedly, rotation of Q154 requires concerted movement of I48 that reorients the Ncap. Thus, the presence of G46 selects for a heterogeneous conformation of Q154 and V48I biases the heterogeneous Q154 towards the exposed conformation in the dark. In the light, V48I disrupts rotation of Q154 to the buried conformation, thereby leading to a predominantly exposed conformation regardless of lighting conditions. Thus, unexpectedly, V48I is both an allosteric variant and alters photocycle kinetics. In particular, V48I retains an ability to form the covalent C4a adduct, which is more stable than WT (V48I k<sub>3</sub> = 0.094 hr<sup>−1</sup>; WT k<sub>3</sub> = 0.71 hr<sup>−1</sup>). However, in V48I allosteric regulation of the Ncap through Q154 is disrupted leading to V48I selecting for a distinct exposed Q154 conformation despite adduct formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Based on our structural results we can refine our models on how ZTL rate altering variants will perturb ZTL function. G80R does not impact ZTL structure or allosteric regulation of Ncap or Ccap elements. In this manner, G80R acts as a photocycle variant only and allows direct testing of LOV photocycle kinetics on targeted degradation of PRR5 and TOC1 (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>). In contrast, despite being photochemically active and stabilizing the C4a adduct, V48I blocks allosteric regulation of the Ncap through incomplete rotation of Q154 and selection of a distinct exposed conformation of Q154. Thus, we propose that V48I is an allosteric variant that mimics the degradation-active dark state. Combining our proposed mechanism with <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> above and existing literature on light-dark formation of ZTL:GI complexes we make the following testable hypotheses: (1) V48I should demonstrate weaker interactions with GI. (2) V48I should show constitutive activity regardless of lighting conditions in targeting PRR5 and TOC1 for degradation. Thus, PRR5 and TOC1 levels should be constitutively low in variants containing the V48I mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title id="head_6">V48I disrupts ZTL:GI interactions</title><p>We examined ZTL variants for their ability to form light and dark regulated complexes with GI and ARABIDOPSIS SKP1-LIKE 2 (ASK2) of the SCF complex. CoIP results confirm that G80R retains light regulated complex formation with GI comparable to WT. In contrast, Ncap variants G46S and V48I both alter light driven complex formation with GI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Whereas, V48I leads to dampened light-driven formation of the ZTL:GI complex, G46S enhances GI complex formation in both the dark- and light-states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results support our allosteric model of ZTL regulation and demonstrate that Ncap variants decouple allosteric regulation of signal transduction from photochemical formation of the C4a adduct. Further, the data implicates light-driven conformational changes near the Ncap in dictating GI interactions. Specifically, where V48I mimics the weak GI interacting dark-state and G46S mimics the strong GI interacting light state. We note that the G46S results reported here diverge from the effects of the G46E mutation reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al. (2007)</xref>, where G46E abolishes GI interactions due to apparent misfolding of the LOV domain. These results are informative on the nature of mutations at the G46 site, namely the long side chain present in a G46E variant leads to steric clashes and likely would force E46 into a hydrophobic pocket (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We contend such clashes leads to the destabilization of the LOV domain and abolition of GI interactions as reported previously for G46E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, the shorter sidechain in G46S, can be easily accommodated by a subtle rotation of the active site Q154 towards the proposed light-state buried conformation (modeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Such results are consistent with enhanced GI interactions in G46S. Combined, the results implicate the G46/V48 locus in ZTL allostery and regulation.</p><p>In contrast to GI, where G46/V48 mutations affect function in a light/dark manner, all ZTL variants complex with ASK2 in a light-independent manner comparable to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The protein:protein interaction data confirms G80R behaves as WT in known biochemical functions of ZTL and only differs in photocycle kinetics. In contrast, V48I acts as an allosteric variant mimicking the dark-state conformation. Based on these results and previously published in vivo studies showing enhanced degradation activity in the dark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Más et al., 2003a</xref>), we have tools to test the effect of photocycle kinetics (G80R) and Ncap allostery (G46S/V48I). In this manner, G80R variants isolate effects of photocycle kinetics allowing testing of predictions based on <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">equation 1</xref>.</p><p>The decrease in GI affinity in the V48I variant could complicate in vivo phenotypes for these variants. Literature indicates ZTL stability is dictated by GI interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, we could expect low ZTL levels in V48I variants. These low ZTL levels would act in opposition to any increased targeted degradation of PRR5/TOC1 and could mask allosteric phenotypes. Based on our experimental conditions, we do not expect any complications to result. Prior studies indicate that ZTL and GI reciprocally stabilize each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2007</xref>), but increased ZTL stability occurs in a circadian phase dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2003</xref>). Light does enhance ZTL:GI affinity and reciprocal stability by three fold, but ZTL retains some stabilization during the subjective circadian day regardless of lighting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2003</xref>). These previous findings suggest that in consideration of the ZTL:GI equilibrium, GI is limiting except during the subjective circadian day. During the day, GI levels rise sufficiently to shift the equilibrium to saturate the ZTL:GI complex regardless of lighting conditions. Given that our V48I variant retains light-state affinity comparable to WT dark-state protein, GI expression during the subjective day under LL conditions should rescue the decrease in affinity. Concomitant with ZTL-ox, reciprocal stabilization of ZTL/GI should lead to high ZTL levels and ZTL should no longer oscillate. Indeed, under our experimental conditions cycling of ZTL protein is lost and V48I variants show enhanced stability in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), thereby the role of GI in ZTL stability is masked under our conditions and our results likely reflect the effect of ZTL photochemistry (G80R) and allosteric activation of PRR5/TOC1 degradation (V48I) independent of the effects on GI binding.</p><p>Based on the data above we make the following predictions. In comparing G80R-ox to WT-ox under LD conditions, the fast decay of WT-ox will lead to higher populations of the active-dark state early in the evening. In contrast, slower adduct decay in G80R will lead to prolonged population of the less active light-state and delays in ZTL degradation activity. As a result, we should observe an enhanced delay in PRR5/TOC1 degradation in G80R variants as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>.

Combined, G80R confirms a direct role of LOV photocycle kinetics on ZTL activity and that V48I acts in an allosteric switch to enable light-state V48I (adduct formation) to mimic the more degradation active and less GI-binding competent dark-state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title id="head_8">ZTL variants alter circadian period</title><p>Given the effect of V48I, G80R and V48I:G80R on PRR5 and TOC1 degradation, these variants should have predictable effects on circadian period. Previous studies of ZTL-ox variants demonstrate a dose dependent effect of ZTL on circadian period, where high protein levels lead to short-period phenotypes progressing to arrhythmicity and ZTL-nulls having a long-period phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Somers et al., 2004</xref>).

Thus, we predict that despite overexpression the defect in degradation of TOC1 by G80R-ox should lead to WT periods. In contrast, low TOC1 levels in V48I and V48I:G80R should lead to arrhythmic phenotypes under expression levels comparable to WT-ox strains demonstrating normal periods.</p><p>Indeed examination of circadian periods in WT and mutant-ox strains confirms predicted effects of photocycle kinetics (G80R) and the signaling defect (V48I) on circadian period.

Whereas, FKF1 function and transcription is specific to the day, ZTL demonstrates constitutive transcription and distinct functions during the day and night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Song et al., 2014</xref>). These distinct functions allow ZTL to impact photoperiodic flowering through morning specific and GI-dependent destabilization of CO, and circadian function through night specific degradation of TOC1 and PRR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Más et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Song et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kiba et al., 2007</xref>). These results suggest that both light (CO destabilization/GI interaction) and dark (TOC1/PRR5 degradation) activate ZTL for function. Such observations seem paradoxical; however, examination of our structural and kinetic results indicates ZTL may use a divergent allosteric mechanism to enable dual light/dark functions.</p><p>The ability of LOV domains to function as photoswitchable proteins is predicated on LOV proteins specifying a distinct light- and dark-state configuration. In all dark and light-state LOV structures currently in the protein data bank, the active site Gln (Q154 in ZTL) adopts a distinct buried conformation in the dark, with the NH moiety of the Gln side chain near flavin-N5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Halavaty and Moffat, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zoltowski et al., 2007</xref>). Existing light-state structures indicate that C4a adduct formation and N5 protonation induces rotation of the Gln side chain to favor an H-bond between flavin-HN5 and the O moiety of the Gln side chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vaidya et al., 2011</xref>). In those structures, the Gln residue maintains the buried conformation and is only distinguished by the nature of H-bonds. In our ZTL structures this is not the case, rather dark-state structures have a heterogeneous orientation of Q154 that samples orientation near both the buried conformation and an exposed conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). A heterogeneous conformation of the key signaling switch would suggest poor regulation of function under dark-state conditions. This is exactly what is observed in ZTL. ZTL retains fairly robust activity for GI interactions and TOC1/PRR5 degradation in both the light and dark, with light enhancing GI interactions and repressing TOC1/PRR5 degradation by 3–5 fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2007</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). As such, GI-dependent function in CO destabilization is likely not a light-regulated event, but rather is a combined result of constitutive transcription of ZTL, day-specific expression of GI and poor signal amplification following light-dark interconversion due to the heterogeneous orientation of Q154. Thus, the unusual Gln orientations appear to be evolutionarily selected to permit light- and dark-state functions of ZTL and to differentiate ZTL and FKF1.</p><p>Combining our dark- and light-state structures with in vivo data allows construction of a putative signaling mechanism differentiating ZTL from other LOV proteins. Examination of the ZTL structures identifies two key residues involved in regulating ZTL allostery. The heterogeneous conformation of Q154 is permitted by the lack of a sidechain in G46 (model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Introduction of V48I, directs Q154 to a single exposed conformation in the dark. Biasing the Q154 to the exposed conformation results in disrupted interactions with GI and high TOC1/PRR5 degradation, in vivo, consistent with selecting for a distinct dark-state conformation. Further, the light-state V48I:G80R molecule indicates partial Q154 rotation to a buried conformation that is impeded by V48I. This impediment does not allow robust sampling of the buried conformation under any lighting conditions and coincides with constitutively high TOC1/PRR5 degradation in V48I containing variants. Combined we propose a putative model of ZTL signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). ZTL retains functionality in the light and dark due to a heterogeneous orientation of Q154 permitted by G46 and V48. Differences in functionality between dark/light result from subtle biases in the orientation of Q154 between buried and exposed conformations. Based on V48I:G80R structures and activity, we propose that biasing towards the exposed conformation as the dark-state configuration (enhanced PRR5/TOC1 degradation) and biasing towards the buried conformation as the light-state configuration (enhanced GI binding).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title id="head_11">G46 and V48 are evolutionarily selected to differentiate ZTL and FKF1 in plants</title><p>Based on our proposed mechanism distinguishing ZTL signal transduction from other LOV proteins, one would predict evolutionary selection of G46 and V48 in ZTL proteins to permit the heterogeneous orientation of Q154.

The presence of a Q154L substitution is unexpected, since these substitutions abrogate blue light signaling in other LOV proteins due to an inability to undergo the Gln-flip mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zoltowski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nash et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nozaki et al., 2004</xref>). In the proposed ZTL mechanism a Gln-flip is not necessitated and Q→L substitutions are permitted. In this manner, our understanding of a canonical model of LOV signal transduction is incomplete. We propose that evolutionary selections at G46 and V48 tune allostery to the Ncap through the Q154 orientation to differentiate modes of LOV signal transduction. Given the evolutionary selection of A/S residues and permission of V48 substitutions in FKF1, we propose that FKF1 functions in a manner analogous to other LOV proteins, where light activates the biological function (CO stabilization/CDF degradation) of the primarily nuclear FKF1 protein. In this manner, evolutionary selection at position 46 may dictate day functional (FKF1) and day/night functional (ZTL) differentiation, thereby implicating LOV photocycle kinetics as being imperative for proper signal transduction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title id="head_12">ZTL:TOC1/PRR5:GI circuit dictates circadian period through LOV kinetics</title><p>Currently, delays in TOC1 and PRR5 degradation are explained using competition between GI and TOC1/PRR5 for the available ZTL pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Más et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kiba et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fujiwara et al., 2008</xref>). In these models, GI expression during the day both stabilizes and sequesters ZTL. In the evening, GI pools decline leading to active free ZTL. In light of our data, the competition model must be incomplete. In the competition model there should be no differences in the LL/LD characteristics in WT and G80R strains. In the competition model GI expression profiles should dictate delays and these would be unaffected by rate-altering ZTL variants. WT and G80R interact with GI to comparable levels, yet G80R demonstrates enhanced delays in PRR5 and TOC1 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These results are inconsistent with a competition model alone. In contrast, modeling PRR5 degradation using the time dependent conversion of ZTL-light to ZTL-dark can predict with reasonable certainty the extended delay in G80R and predicts distinct differences under LL conditions between the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In this manner, it is clear that ZTL photocycle kinetics are instrumental in dictating delays in PRR5/TOC1 turnover and circadian period.</p><p>Based on all these elements we propose that circadian period is regulated in a complex manner involving a ZTL:TOC1:GI circuit, whereby competitive inhibition and ZTL photocycle kinetics act in concert to dictate ZTL protein levels and ZTL activity in a circadian phase dependent manner. Adduct decay in ZTL then enhances degradation of PRR5 and TOC1, impacting circadian period through two methods: (1) Degradation of PRR5, helps diminish TOC1 levels through increased cytosolic retention and accessibility to ZTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) and (2) Degradation of cytosolic TOC1. Both factors require proper ZTL photocycle kinetics. Thus, LOV photocycle kinetics are instrumental in evolutionary selection for a 24 hr period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title id="head_13">Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title id="head_14">Model generation</title><p>Examination of recent mathematical models of plant circadian clocks reveals a common method of incorporating light-dark dependent degradation of PRR5 and TOC1 by ZTL.

First, PRR5 models suggest that PRR5 can be accurately modeled excluding differences in ZTL expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Caluwé et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pokhilko et al., 2013</xref>), this is consistent with our data showing that WT, WT-ox and G80R-ox all have the same decay rate under LL conditions despite differences in protein levels. Second, in De Caluwe <italic>et al.</italic> the maximum degradation rate constant for PRR5 degradation was fit as 0.78 hr<sup>−1</sup>. Similarly, in Pokhilko <italic>et al</italic>. a max value of 0.5 hr<sup>−1</sup> was obtained for PRR5 and a k<sub>max</sub> of 0.8 hr<sup>−1</sup> for TOC1 by combining all degradation terms. Given the similarity of these maximum values we chose a k<sub>max</sub> for the dark-state of 0.8 hr<sup>−1</sup>. The lowest fit rate constant in mathematical models is m<sub>6</sub> (0.2 hr<sup>−1</sup>) for TOC1 degradation under light-state conditions.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Richard Amasino (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission</p><p>Our decision is that the manuscript requires revision in order to be potentially suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Below are the specific issues that should be addressed in a revision. We also note that the overall clarity and quality of writing should be improved.</p><p>From the Introduction:</p><p>There is little background about the roles of the clock proteins TOC, PPR5 and GI within the plant circadian clock and how their ZTL interactions/stability/signaling affect clock function. More information here would help the reader to understand how ZTL kinetics and TOC/PRR5 degradation could correlate with circadian period (Results, second paragraph). If manuscript length is an issue, the background description regarding LOV chemistry and allostery can be shortened without dropping content by writing some parts in a more precise/less redundant manner. A supplemental figure illustrating the roles of TOC, PPR5, GI, ZTL, FKF1 in the plant circadian clock (or putting <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> into clock context) might also help.</p><p>The first paragraph of the Results should be moved from Results to the Introduction – perhaps after the fifth paragraph, where you describe consequences of FKF1-GI complex formation on CDF1 and CO degradation, but do not say anything about consequences of ZTL-GI interactions.</p><p>From the Results:</p><p>Second paragraph:&quot;… a long photocycle would lead to increasing delays in PRR5 and TOC levels leading to progressively longer circadian phenotypes&quot;. It is more precise to state &quot;TOC degradation&quot; instead of &quot;TOC levels&quot;. Also, the authors should explain or at least provide a reference for the connection between PRR5 and TOC levels and circadian period length.</p><p>Subsection “LOV dimerization”: &quot;ZTL/FKF1 dimer&quot;, this is somewhat ambiguous, as far as we understand that you study ZTL dimers, FKF1 dimers, but no ZTL/FKF1 heterodimers – please clarify.</p><p>Discussion of the G46S mutant (Results, fourth paragraph; subsection “V48I disrupts ZTL:GI interactions”, first paragraph; subsection “ZTL variants alter targeted degradation of clock components”, first paragraph; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>): In the subsection “V48I disrupts ZTL:GI interactions” G46S is reported to &quot;enhance GI complex formation in both the dark and light states&quot;. In the same subsection the authors reference Kim WY et al., Nature 2007 for &quot;strong GI-interactions of the G46S mutant&quot;. However, Kim et al. describe a non-detectable GI interaction for a ZTL(G46E) variant in Co-IP as well as a slower migration, therefore indicating potentially aberrant folding of full-length ZTL(G46E) in plant material. The authors should discuss the opposite effect of the G46E mutation (Kim et al., 2007) and the G46S mutation (this study) on GI interaction.</p><p>In the subsection “ZTL variants alter targeted degradation of clock components”, the authors state that the G46S mutant is not soluble and could therefore not be purified, crystallized or used for UV/Vis kinetics. Hence, mutation of Gly46 (to S or E) is critical for ZTL folding. Could the slower dark recovery kinetics of the ZTL(G46S/G80R) double mutant (time constant 21 h compared to 1.4 h for wt ZTL and 6.6 h for G80R ZTL) be a consequence of reduced protein stability or aberant folding? The authors should assess protein stability and folding of the ZTL mutants (in particular G46S/G80R) e.g. by thermofluor or CD spectroscopy to validate the kinetics and exclude that potential conformation defects affect GI-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>There are distinct migration properties of ZTL mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) on SDS-PAGE. G46S, G46S:G80R and V48I:G80R migrate differently from the WT, V48I and G80R. Do you have a hypothesis as to the basis of these migration differences?</p><p>Can the ZTL-LOV crystal structure explain how the added G80R mutation stabilizes the G80R/G46S mutant compared to the single G46S. It is not intuitive because G80 is on the surface and not close to G46 (and V48). This point is interesting to address, because the correlated G46S, G80R exchange may be a stabilizing co-evolution in the FKF1-LOV domain. Moreover, G80 is only Gly in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> ZTL, but replaced by R/Q in all other ZTL/FKF1/Phot-LOV proteins aligned in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p>From the Discussion:</p><p>There are interesting aspects of your work that should be discussed such as:</p><p>1) Does the crystal structure provide any insights on the co-evolution of G80R and G46S/V48I in FKF1? G80 is Gly only in At-ZTL, this position is R/Q in all other proteins as well as in ZTLs of other species (aligned in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>2) Ncap mutations G46E (Kim et al., 2007) and V48I weaken GI-binding, whereas G46S strengthens GI- binding. This difference, in particular between G46S and G46E should be discussed.</p><p>3) The conformation of Q154 in the dark-state structures of wt and G80R are heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Does this mean that both the exposed and the buried conformation are present in these structures? Or is it a mixture of different &quot;exposed&quot; conformations, as suggested by the dark state model for wt/G80R ZTL shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and in the first paragraph of the subsection “ZTL:TOC1/PRR5:GI circuit dictates circadian period through LOV kinetics”? Also, how is the wt/G80R light-state model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> obtained, since only dark-state structures are available? Some more discussion is needed here. It would be helpful to show a superposition of the wt and G80R dark state Q154 with the V48I/G80R dark- and light-state structures to i) classify the heterogeneous Q154 conformations as exposed or buried and ii) to illustrate the impact of the V48I mutation on the Q154 position. It would also help to describe the heterogeneous G154 conformations of wt/G80R as &quot;exposed/buried&quot; already in the Results section, e.g. the second paragraph of the subsection “N-terminal CGF motif defines a locus of signal transduction that differentiates ZTL from known LOV signaling mechanisms”.</p><p>Subsection “Insight into LOV allostery and conservation in plants”, first paragraph: Please correlate buried/exposed Gln conformation with light/dark state.</p><p>Subsection “Insight into LOV allostery and conservation in plants”, second paragraph: &quot;In ZTL, light activation leads to rotation of Q154 to a buried conformation observed in all other LOV structures&quot;. &quot;all other LOV structures&quot; implies &quot;all light- and dark state structures of LOV domains that have ever been solved&quot;. The authors should be more specific here.</p><p>Your results address the difference in light-regulated target degradation between ZTL and FKF1: FKF1 promotes CDF degradation in the light while ZTL promotes TOC1/PRR5 degradation in the dark. However, in the Discussion it would be helpful to the readers to elaborate on the role of FKF1 in CO stabilization which also occurs in the light as noted in Song et al., PNAS 2014 (and some of the authors of this paper are authors on Song et al., 2014). That FKF1 is involved in stabilization and degradation may be a bit of a mystery, but it is important to note this as a discussion point and, if the structure-function data from this current work lead to any hypotheses as to how light-activated FKF1 stabilizes CO, that would be interesting and valuable for readers.</p><p>From Figures/Tables:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B-E</xref>: It would be easier for the reader to understand this figure if you annotate the ZTL mutants within the graphs and mention the time constants within the figure legend or to refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>: for base catalyses by imidazole, the authors should refer to Pudasaini and Zoltowski, 2013 to allow the reader to better assess the imidazole effect on ZTL.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>: Why was the ZTL (16-165) construct used for MALS instead of ZTL (29-165), which was used for crystallization (Materials and methods) and kinetics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>)?

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>My comments were primarily about the presentation of the work while the Xray crystallography expert had very specific requests about the work and experiments-interpretations.</p><p>In my opinion the new presentation is much improved and I don't have additional major comments or requests.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors have adequately responded to my issues and submitted a significantly improved manuscript in content and clarity.</p><p>I do however regret that my issues regarding the Materials and methods section have apparently not been transmitted to the authors. I would like these parts to be improved before publication, as some method descriptions are too inaccurate or missing. Here, I recapitulate the most important requested changes in Materials and methods, now using line numbers of the revised manuscript:</p><p>Subsection &quot;Structural analyses&quot;:</p><p>How were the crystals for the light state structure of V48I:G80R-ZTL obtained, i.e. what illumination conditions were used to crystallize the light state?</p><p>Subsection &quot;Structural analyses&quot;, second paragraph: Cryo is only mentioned for V48I dark and light, not for WT and G80R ZTL.</p><p>Subsection &quot;Structural analyses&quot;, last paragraph: The authors say that &quot;WT ZTL was used as search model&quot;, presumably for mutant structures. But how was the crystal structure of WT ZTL solved, i.e. which search model was used for MR to get the ZTL WT structure?</p><p>Subsection &quot;Structural analyses&quot;: The authors should explicitly mention that the crystals contain 4 molecules per asymmetric unit. The authors should also describe the final asymmetric unit content, including which residues are undefined/were not build in the model.</p><p>Subsection &quot;Size exclusion chromatography&quot;: I appreciate that the authors added a Materials and methods for analytical SEC and MALS in their revised manuscript. Herein, the buffer composition used for analytical SEC and MALS should also be specified.</p><p>Subsection &quot;Fitting model to experimental data&quot;, third paragraph: &quot;under our lighting conditions&quot; is very imprecise. Please provide a protocol/light source (wavelength/intensity) for ZTL light excitation.</p><p>Subsection &quot;Model generation&quot;:</p><p>Please provide information about the definition and calculation of the time constant k3 that characterizes ZTL dark recovery kinetics. K3 is not introduced in the subsection &quot;Model generation&quot;.

Below are the specific issues that should be addressed in a revision. We also note that the overall clarity and quality of writing should be improved.</italic> </p><p><italic>From the Introduction:</italic> </p><p><italic>There is little background about the roles of the clock proteins TOC, PPR5 and GI within the plant circadian clock and how their ZTL interactions/stability/signaling affect clock function. More information here would help the reader to understand how ZTL kinetics and TOC/PRR5 degradation could correlate with circadian period (Results, second paragraph). If manuscript length is an issue, the background description regarding LOV chemistry and allostery can be shortened without dropping content by writing some parts in a more precise/less redundant manner. A supplemental figure illustrating the roles of TOC, PPR5, GI, ZTL, FKF1 in the plant circadian clock (or putting <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> into clock context) might also help.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the manuscript would benefit from increased discussion of the role of ZTL within the circadian clock. In light of this recommendation as well as others requesting more commentary on the divergent and synergistic roles of ZTL and FKF1 we have reworked both the Introduction and Discussion to better highlight these aspects. We feel that this greatly strengthens the manuscript by placing more emphasis on the evolutionary divergence of ZTL and FKF1 to allow differential function in circadian and photoperiodic clocks.</p><p>By emphasizing the plant biology more, we are also easily able to address the reviewer request for more commentary in the discussion on evolutionary selection of G46 and V48.</p><p>We have also added an additional figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) summarizing the main functions of ZTL in the light and dark.</p><p><italic>The first paragraph of the Results should be moved from Results to the Introduction – perhaps after the fifth paragraph, where you describe consequences of FKF1-GI complex formation on CDF1 and CO degradation, but do not say anything about consequences of ZTL-GI interactions.</italic> </p><p>As noted above, we have reworked the Introduction to better focus on the plant circadian and photoperiodic biology. In doing so, the discussion of ZTL-GI interactions has been moved to the Introduction and expanded upon. It is also summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>From the Results:</italic> </p><p><italic>Second paragraph:&quot;… a long photocycle would lead to increasing delays in PRR5 and TOC levels leading to progressively longer circadian phenotypes&quot;. It is more precise to state &quot;TOC degradation&quot; instead of &quot;TOC levels&quot;. Also, the authors should explain or at least provide a reference for the connection between PRR5 and TOC levels and circadian period length.</italic> </p><p>The correction has been made and references to TOC1 levels on circadian period length have been added to the Introduction.</p><p><italic>Subsection “LOV dimerization”: &quot;ZTL/FKF1 dimer&quot;, this is somewhat ambiguous, as far as we understand that you study ZTL dimers, FKF1 dimers, but no ZTL/FKF1 heterodimers – please clarify.</italic> </p><p>We have changed the wording to “ZTL and FKF1 homodimers” to be more specific.</p><p><italic>Discussion of the G46S mutant (Results, fourth paragraph; subsection “V48I disrupts ZTL:GI interactions”, first paragraph; subsection “ZTL variants alter targeted degradation of clock components”, first paragraph; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>): In the subsection “V48I disrupts ZTL:GI interactions” G46S is reported to &quot;enhance GI complex formation in both the dark and light states&quot;. In the same subsection the authors reference Kim WY et al., Nature 2007 for &quot;strong GI-interactions of the G46S mutant&quot;. However, Kim et al. describe a non-detectable GI interaction for a ZTL(G46E) variant in Co-IP as well as a slower migration, therefore indicating potentially aberrant folding of full-length ZTL(G46E) in plant material. The authors should discuss the opposite effect of the G46E mutation (Kim et al., 2007) and the G46S mutation (this study) on GI interaction.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is an important observation, but were reluctant to be too speculative. We have included new commentary on the differences between G46S and G46E as well as added an additional supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) to highlight the different structural effects that could be predicted based on G46S and G46E mutations. The new commentary is copied below:</p><p><italic>“</italic>We note that the G46S results reported here diverge from the effects of the G46E mutation reported by Kim et al. (Kim et al., 2007), where G46E abolishes GI interactions due to apparent misfolding of the LOV domain. […] Such results are consistent with enhanced GI interactions in G46S. Combined, the results implicate the G46/V48 locus in ZTL allostery and regulation.”</p><p>In regards to Kim et al., 2007, we did not intend on suggesting that Kim et al., discuss G46S, rather we were referencing the difference between light-state and dark-state GI binding. We have removed the reference at that spot to avoid confusion.</p><p><italic>In the subsection “ZTL variants alter targeted degradation of clock components”, the authors state that the G46S mutant is not soluble and could therefore not be purified, crystallized or used for UV/Vis kinetics. Hence, mutation of Gly46 (to S or E) is critical for ZTL folding. Could the slower dark recovery kinetics of the ZTL(G46S/G80R) double mutant (time constant 21 h compared to 1.4 h for wt ZTL and 6.6 h for G80R ZTL) be a consequence of reduced protein stability or aberant folding? The authors should assess protein stability and folding of the ZTL mutants (in particular G46S/G80R) e.g. by thermofluor or CD spectroscopy to validate the kinetics and exclude that potential conformation defects affect GI-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments and apologize that our wording led to some confusion. We do predict that the G46S substitution will have a structural effect and act as an allosteric mutant to affect function (see commentary above and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>); however, we do not believe this is a stability issue.</p><p>Our wording was misleading as it did suggest misfolding/aggregation, but that was not our intention. Rather, the problem is trying to express and purify the protein in <italic>E. coli</italic>. This is a problem with ZTL in general, where working with WT ZTL is nearly intractable and requires 18L of cell pellet or more, for individual experiments. This is exacerbated in the G46S variant, where even with 18L of pellet or more, the protein yield is too poor for biochemical characterization. This is common for most mutations to ZTL, except G80R.</p><p>The G80R variant was the first we made. We made it to restore the π-cation interaction that stabilizes the helical surface of PAS proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Our idea, and it worked, was that G80R would allow reasonably high protein yields from <italic>E. coli</italic> so ZTL could be studied. The G80R substitution also allows access to variants, through similar stabilization. We do not believe the G46S variant on its own is particularly destabilizing, rather, it makes a nearly intractable situation worse. We have added the following to the Methods section to aid in understanding.</p><p>“We note that ZTL is difficult to express and purify from <italic>E. coli</italic> as most WT proteins are confined to inclusion bodies. […] This allows access to G46S:G80R, despite intractable yields of the isolated G46S variant”.</p><p>We have also changed the wording regarding G46S being insoluble to now read:</p><p>“G46S variants were excluded due to poor yields from <italic>E. coli</italic> that render solution or structural information intractable for the isolated G46S variant (see Methods).”</p><p>In regards to CD/thermofluor analysis, we have done thermofluor analysis of WT, G80R and G46S:G80R (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). G46S:G80R actually is significantly more thermostable, which may contribute to the longer photocycle, where G46S:G80R demonstrates a higher Tm (66.0 °C) than WT and G80R (both 62.5 °C). Notably, all Tm’s are considerably outside the range of biological relevance.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21646.024</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21646.024">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21646.024</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21646-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig></p><p>We also note that the temperature (Arrhenius/Eyring) data of ZTL variants also addresses the reviewer’s concerns. We have looked at WT, G80R and G46S:G80R and confirmed that all three demonstrate linear Arrhenius dependency within biologically relevant temperatures (16-40 °C). Further, they all demonstrate the same enthalpy of activation. This is consistent with no gross perturbation of structure/stability throughout biologically relevant temperature ranges.</p><p>Having no major effect on structure, but resulting in stabilization of the protein at high temperature is what we would predict from our models of the effect of G46S on ZTL structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), where G46 has two effects: 1) Reducing dynamics by addition of a Cβ and 2) Formation of a G46S-Q154 H-bond. Both should stabilize the Ncap, leading to increased stability of this key region.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is an important issue to address to verify the LOV domain is not partially unfolded in G46S (like in G46E), particularly given how the initial manuscript was worded in regards to insoluble G46S. However, we do not feel the thermofluor data warrants inclusion in the manuscript and is instead provided here for reviewers and for inclusion in the published response to reviewers. The data itself is better suited to a more comprehensive study of G46S when structures of G46S:G80R and/or FKF1 are available.</p><p><italic>There are distinct migration properties of ZTL mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) on SDS-PAGE. G46S, G46S:G80R and V48I:G80R migrate differently from the WT, V48I and G80R. Do you have a hypothesis as to the basis of these migration differences?</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that there is a subtle, but distinct difference in the migration properties of those mutants. If forced to speculate about a possible hypothesis, I would lean towards subtle reorientation of the Ncap by the presence of G46S and V48I (see the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The G80R may stabilize the helical surface in the double mutants forcing any structural defects to the Ncap.</p><p>One may expect V48I alone to have the same migration difference, however it is possible the lack of R80 allows the stress of V48I to propagate to the helical interface. In such a scenario, the absence of the π-cation interaction stabilizing G80R variants, directs conformational changes to the helices instead of Ncap.</p><p>Given the highly speculative nature of such explanations, and the subtle differences in migration patterns, we refrain from including commentary on these observations in the published text.</p><p><italic>Can the ZTL-LOV crystal structure explain how the added G80R mutation stabilizes the G80R/G46S mutant compared to the single G46S. It is not intuitive because G80 is on the surface and not close to G46 (and V48). This point is interesting to address, because the correlated G46S, G80R exchange may be a stabilizing co-evolution in the FKF1-LOV domain. Moreover, G80 is only Gly in A. thaliana ZTL, but replaced by R/Q in all other ZTL/FKF1/Phot-LOV proteins aligned in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful comment. The reviewers are correct that it is odd that <italic>A. thaliana</italic> ZTL is unique in containing a Gly residue at this site. Indeed, it is R/Q/K in nearly all LOV proteins. As noted above, we have added brief commentary to highlight the effect of G80R on ZTL proteins and the G46S/G80R double mutant, namely enhanced expression/solubility in <italic>E. coli</italic> (see comments above).</p><p>To better address this we have expanded our comments on the initial selection of these sites. We have added the following:</p><p>“In contrast, to the best of our knowledge, the G80 position has not been exploited for tuning LOV kinetics. […] Since, G80 is unique to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ZTL, and R/Q/K substitutions are permitted in other ZEITLUPE and LOV proteins (see Discussion), it is unlikely to affect allostery and may function as a site to uniquely affect photocycle kinetics.”</p><p>We have also added very brief commentary in the beginning of our discussion on ZTL structure:</p><p>“The primary difference is the formation of a π-cation interaction that stabilizes the Dα/Eα linkage and C82 that is necessary for C4a adduct formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Increased rigidity of C82 imposed by the π-cation interaction is consistent with having an effect only on photocycle kinetics.”</p><p>The last line was added to help clarify a structural reason, namely, that restoration of the R80 π-cation interaction, stabilizes C82 (C82-flavin C4a adduct) through steric restraints. Similar comments have been added to the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</p><p>In regards to co-evolution, we do not believe that G80R is involved in coevolution, as most ZTL proteins contain the G80R substitution, but retain G46. We believe this is consistent with the G80 site being specific to kinetics, whereas the G46 position seems to be an allosteric site. As discussed in the text any side chain at position 46 does not allow the exposed conformation of Q154. G46 was evolutionarily selected to allow the unusual Q154 mechanism.</p><p>The reasonable question then is, why G80 in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, if it is destabilizing? The primary effect of G80 appears to be in affecting flavin incorporation, where G80 leads to most ZTL expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, to be apo- and relegated to inclusion bodies. G80R leads to better flavin incorporation and makes ZTL tractable. We currently believe that the G80 selection is specific to <italic>A. thaliana</italic> ZTL to optimize stability and photocycle kinetics under typical <italic>A. thaliana</italic> growth conditions. Any loss in stability/FMN incorporation is likely compensated by the chaperone functions of GI. Such an analysis, though, requires detailed kinetics of ZTL/FKF1 proteins in diverse species as well as diurnal expression profiles and in vivostudies. Unfortunately that is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><p><italic>From the Discussion:</italic> </p><p><italic>There are interesting aspects of your work that should be discussed such as:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Does the crystal structure provide any insights on the co-evolution of G80R and G46S/V48I in FKF1? G80 is Gly only in At-ZTL, this position is R/Q in all other proteins as well as in ZTLs of other species (aligned in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</italic> </p><p>As discussed above, we do not believe that the G80 site is involved in coevolution or is involved in differentiating ZTL and FKF1 beyond affecting photocycle kinetics. We believe such commentary is best suited earlier in the manuscript. As noted above we have expanded commentary in several locations to address the uniqueness of G80 to <italic>A. thaliana.</italic></p><p>In contrast, we believe G46/V48 are evolutionarily selected to differentiate signal transduction mechanisms present in ZTL and FKF1. Both residues are essential to allowing the heterogeneous orientation of Q154. We have rewritten the discussion to focus on the implications for G46/V48 and the heterogeneous environment of Q154 as we think it is an important aspect of plant biology. We also replaced <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, to show coevolution of G46/V48.</p><p><italic>2) Ncap mutations G46E (Kim et al., 2007) and V48I weaken GI-binding, whereas G46S strengthens GI- binding. This difference, in particular between G46S and G46E should be discussed.</italic> </p><p>As noted above, the initial commentary in the Results section has been expanded to highlight this observation. We have also included the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, to highlight structural perturbations expected from these very different mutations.</p><p>In addition, as noted in the preceding comment, we have rewritten the discussion to better highlight the nature of the G46/V48/Q154 site and its role in differentiating ZTL and FKF1 function in plant biology.</p><p><italic>3) The conformation of Q154 in the dark-state structures of wt and G80R are heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Does this mean that both the exposed and the buried conformation are present in these structures? Or is it a mixture of different &quot;exposed&quot; conformations, as suggested by the dark state model for wt/G80R ZTL shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and in the first paragraph of the subsection “ZTL:TOC1/PRR5:GI circuit dictates circadian period through LOV kinetics”? Also, how is the wt/G80R light-state model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> obtained, since only dark-state structures are available? Some more discussion is needed here. It would be helpful to show a superposition of the wt and G80R dark state Q154 with the V48I/G80R dark- and light-state structures to i) classify the heterogeneous Q154 conformations as exposed or buried and ii) to illustrate the impact of the V48I mutation on the Q154 position. It would also help to describe the heterogeneous G154 conformations of wt/G80R as &quot;exposed/buried&quot; already in the Results section, e.g. the second paragraph of the subsection “N-terminal CGF motif defines a locus of signal transduction that differentiates ZTL from known LOV signaling mechanisms”.</italic> </p><p><italic>Subsection “Insight into LOV allostery and conservation in plants”, first paragraph: Please correlate buried/exposed Gln conformation with light/dark state.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the confusion in both the nature of the heterogeneous orientations and in regards to the source of the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>.</p><p>We also thank the reviewer for the comment and related comment on the oddities in ZTL and FKF1 function, where there seem to be mysteries in regards to the ability of these proteins to perform contradictory tasks (FKF1: CO Stabilization; CDF1 Degradation – ZTL: light-state degradation of CO; dark-state degradation of TOC1/PRR5). They are very keen observations and of central importance.</p><p>We have made several edits to address the reviewer’s concerns. First, we have added a <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> that contains all four orientations of Q154 for WT and G80R. This figure contains the dark-state V48I:G80R “exposed” conformation and the buried conformation. We believe this highlight the range of conformations observed in the WT/G80R structure.</p><p>We have also greatly expanded the discussion on our proposed mechanism of ZTL (see section titled “Insight into ZTL function in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>”), where the heterogeneous conformations of Q154 are coupled to the evolutionary selection of G46 and V48.</p><p>The key is that the selection of G46 and V48 permit the heterogeneous environment of Q154 that essentially dampens light-dark regulation of ZTL, and leads to differences compared to all other known LOV structures. This is consistent with ZTL retaining degradation function under both LL and DD conditions. We propose that dark simply biases ZTL towards a state of enhanced degradation activity.</p><p>In V48I, the additional methyl group directs Q154 to the exposed conformation only. No heterogeneity in Q154. Given that dark-state V48I:G80R contains only the exposed conformation and that V48I containing proteins demonstrate high degradation activity, we define this as the dark-state. The buried conformation partially occupied in the V48I:G80R light-state molecule is then consistent with the light-state.</p><p>In WT and G80R proteins, G46 (no Cβ) and V48 (no methyl group) lack elements to direct Q154, thus ZTL can sample all conformations, where the population shifts towards the buried-state in the light. This is consistent with LKP2 and <italic>Brassica</italic> ZTL’s, tolerating a L154 that typically abrogates LOV function.</p><p>We’ve substantially edited <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> to highlight these mechanisms and to reflect the changes in the discussion. We also then address the following important comment (copied from above):</p><p><italic>“Also, how is the wt/G80R light-state model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> obtained, since only dark-state structures are available? Some more discussion is needed here.”</italic></p><p>I had thought about the best way to portray our mechanism for a long time, to allow insight into the mechanism, without being misleading regarding the data source. Typically, I’d avoid using a “sticks” representation of key elements, as it can potentially suggest that it is an actual structure, and the reviewer is correct that we only have dark-state structures of WT/G80R. Based on the reviewer comments, I failed at the first attempt. To avoid confusion, and to address the reviewers concerns and better represent the mechanism summarized above we have redone <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> now contains three elements. 1) The typical LOV model, derived from light- and dark-state structures of VVD, where the Gln is always buried and only changes H-bond partners. 2) Actual structure derived from WT/G80R showing heterogeneous orientation of Q154. We include either the buried/exposed orientation for reference and use an arrow and text to emphasize selection of bias towards the exposed/buried conformations. 3) The actual structures of V48I:G80R.</p><p>We feel this best portrays all aspects of the model. We’ve expanded the legend to include references to all source material.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Insight into LOV allostery and conservation in plants”, second paragraph: &quot;In ZTL, light activation leads to rotation of Q154 to a buried conformation observed in all other LOV structures&quot;. &quot;all other LOV structures&quot; implies &quot;all light- and dark state structures of LOV domains that have ever been solved&quot;. The authors should be more specific here.</italic> </p><p>Indeed, the buried conformation is the orientation of the active site Gln in all light and dark-state structures that have been solved to date. The conformation and mechanism is now also included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>.</p><p>The exposed conformation in ZTL is exceptionally unique highlighting the evolutionary selection of G46/V48. We have rewritten the Discussion entirely to better clarify the uniqueness and role of G46/V48/Q154 in plant biology. The relevant sentence has been edited to better specify that “all known” structures contain the buried conformation.</p><p>“In all dark and light-state LOV structures currently in the protein data bank, the active site Gln (Q154 in ZTL) adopts a distinct buried conformation in the dark, with the NH moiety of the Gln side chain near flavin-N5 (Zoltowski et al., 2007, Halavaty and Moffat, 2007)”.</p><p><italic>Your results address the difference in light-regulated target degradation between ZTL and FKF1: FKF1 promotes CDF degradation in the light while ZTL promotes TOC1/PRR5 degradation in the dark. However, in the Discussion it would be helpful to the readers to elaborate on the role of FKF1 in CO stabilization which also occurs in the light as noted in Song et al., PNAS 2014 (and some of the authors of this paper are authors on Song et al., 2014). That FKF1 is involved in stabilization and degradation may be a bit of a mystery, but it is important to note this as a discussion point and, if the structure-function data from this current work lead to any hypotheses as to how light-activated FKF1 stabilizes CO, that would be interesting and valuable for readers.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for their astute observations. As noted above, we have reworked the Introduction and Discussion to better address such mysteries, as we believe they are very relevant to the evolutionary selection of G46/V48 and the heterogeneous Q154.</p><p>We now address the following seeming contradictions based on our structures and proposed mechanism in the Discussion:</p><p>ZTL/GI destabilizes CO in the light ZTL degrades TOC1/PRR5 in the dark</p><p>FKF1 only has light-state functions</p><p>As discussed in the edits, we believe that ZTL having light/dark functionality vs. FKF1 only light is a direct result of G46/V48.</p><p>We address the question regarding CO stabilization/CDF degradation in the Introduction. The seeming discrepancy here resides in another layer of ZTL group protein regulation, the fact that both the Kelch repeat and LOV domains are involved in protein:protein interactions. It would appear that for FKF1 CO recruitment by the LOV domain, stabilizes CO; whereas CDF is targeted through degradation through the Kelch domain. We envision such competition between domains is likely a large area of regulation and will be a very rich area of study moving forward.</p><p><italic>From Figures/Tables:</italic> </p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B-E</xref>: It would be easier for the reader to understand this figure if you annotate the ZTL mutants within the graphs and mention the time constants within the figure legend or to refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>: for base catalyses by imidazole, the authors should refer to Pudasaini and Zoltowski, 2013 to allow the reader to better assess the imidazole effect on ZTL.</italic> </p><p>Each panel is now annotated with a label indicating the mutant. The time constants are now added to the legend along with a reference to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>Pudasaini and Zoltowski, 2013 is now indicated in the legend.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>: Why was the ZTL (16-165) construct used for MALS instead of ZTL (29-165), which was used for crystallization (Materials and methods) and kinetics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>)? Which constructs were used for analytical gel filtration studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>)?</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity in constructs used in SEC experiments. With the exception of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>/B, all constructs used in experiments are ZTL 29-165.</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>/B, we do use ZTL 16-165 to allow direct comparison of the equivalent ZTL, FKF1 and LKP2 constructs. All previous characterizations of FKF1 use a 28-174 construct equivalent to ZTL/LKP2 16-165. Due to stability issues involving FKF1 we have to use 28-174 and thus, felt it best to use the equivalent ZTL and LKP2 constructs for the comparison figure.</p><p>The apparent MW’s from elution volumes in SEC (now included in the legends for all SEC traces) are large, ~60 kDa, and more consistent with a trimer/tetramer, compared to that of the smaller 29-165 construct (~40 kDa; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Given the tetrameric unit cell, we conducted MALS, panel B, to rule out tetramer formation in the longer constructs. MALS confirms a dimer indicating elongation of the ZTL/FKF1 dimer. We have also done MALS on 29-165 to confirm dimerization and the MW from MALS experiments is now referenced in the figure legends.</p><p>We want to point out a change to the text though in reference to LKP2 in the figure legend. Over the past 2-3 months we have turned our attention to examining LKP2 structure/function. It has become clear that LKP2 can dimerize in a manner consistent with ZTL/FKF1, but that dimerization is of much lower affinity and highly sensitive to buffer conditions. In this regards, LKP2 may not generate a physiological dimer, to avoid being possibly misleading, we changed the text regarding LKP2 to read:</p><p>“LKP2 (16-165 apparent MW=33 kDa) adopts a much smaller hydrodynamic radius indicating distinct differences in oligomeric structure and/or affinity.”</p><p>As the manuscript does not discuss LKP2 at all, we considered removing the LKP2 SEC trace, but feel that this distinction may be of interest to the biological community and felt it should remain. The updated wording better emphasizes the current state of the data until a separate comprehensive study is finished.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>/C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>: For analytical gel filtration studies, please state which SEC columns were used (e.g. S200/S75 10/300, 16/60 etc.) and add elution volumes of standard proteins for reference.</italic> </p><p>We apologize that his information was not included.

Formation of the light-state adduct in LOV proteins leads to a bleaching of the 280 nm absorption band of the FMN/FAD cofactor. Typically, this is not observed if the data is reported as normalized absorbance at 280 nm (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Please comment on this.</italic> </p><p>Legends for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B/C</xref> have been separated. Panel B is included to show electron density for FMN and to show clear electron density for C4a adduct formation. This confirms that we did directly crystalize the light state. This orientation does not allow for clear visualization of the alternative conformations of I48/Q154. Panel C is rotated to allow visualization of the alternative conformations and clear visualization of the Fo-Fc electron density. For this to be clear the electron density for FMN, present in panel B, is excluded. We feel providing both orientations allows the best visualization of all electron density, adduct formation and alternative conformations.</p><p>In regards to the distortion of FMN, this is expected. C4a adduct formation induces sp3 hybridization of the C4a carbon and loss of planarity of the isoalloxazine ring. Such distortion is observed in the light- state structures of VVD (Vaidya et al., 2011, Science Signaling; PtAu1a (Heintz and Schlichting, 2016, <italic>eLife</italic>) and PpsB1 (Circolone et al., 2012, J. Mol. Biol.).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>: for WT and G80R only dark-state structures are available.

It would be more accurate to state that &quot;activation&quot; means dark-recovery of ZTL, i.e. generation of the dark state of ZTL.</italic> </p><p>The legend has been edited to reflect the requested changes above:</p><p><italic>“</italic>Predicted divergent ZTL model of allostery and signal transduction based on the integrated structural, mutational and in vivodata. […] For V48I, I48 selects the exposed conformation in the dark and leads to only partial burying of Q154 (shown in C, D), leading to constitutively high ubquitination activity that mimics the dark-state of WT-ZTL.”</p><p>We note that we have changed the wording to reflect that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> WT/G80R light-state is predicted based on integrating the observed structural, mutational and in vivodata. We summarize the logic here and have rewritten the Discussion. As noted in a previous comment, we also have modified the figure considerably, to ensure that the model is clearly portrayed and the source material of any structural information is well defined. We address this above, in regards to a previous comment, but add more commentary here to describe our logic.</p><p>We have clear structural evidence indicating an unusual heterogenous orientation of Q154. We also have clear data showing V48I:G80R selects for the unusual exposed conformation of Q154, the site of protein allostery in all characterized LOV proteins. We have solved the crystal structure of the light state using a long-lived mutation similar to what was used to obtain the VVD light-state structure (Vaidya et al., Science Signaling) that enables direct crystallization of the light-state. The light-state molecule shows partial rotation of Q154 that is impeded by the presence of I48. We proposed based on this insight that the light-state adduct drives rotation of Q154 from the exposed to the buried conformation. The latter is present in all solved structures of LOV proteins, now represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. For WT/G80R there is no selection for a distinct conformation, rather we propose activity is based on altering the population of heterogeneous conformations between the buried and exposed conformations. This is consistent with ZTL retaining light/dark functions in vivo, as discussed in the expanded Discussion.</p><p>This led to several testable hypotheses. 1) The exposed conformation is essential to dark-state activity and mutations to G46 that allow the conformation would have a functional effect. Indeed G46 leads to enhanced interaction with GI in the dark, consistent with disruption of dark-state signaling. 2) Disruption of rotation of Q154 by I48 would lead to constitutively high dark-state like activity of photoactivated V48I mutants.</p><p>This hypothesis is confirmed via both reduced interactions with GI and by enhanced degradation of PRR5 and TOC1 in the light. These effects are physiologically relevant as they alter circadian period. 3) If Q154 is rotating following light exposure, G46 and V48 should have been co- evolutionarily selected for to differentiate ZTL signaling from other LOV proteins. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> suggest this to be true for both dicots and monocots. Combined, we feel that the updated model of ZTL signaling depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">figure 4D</xref> is the most consistent mechanism for ZTL function and signaling.</p><p>We note that no mechanism can be definitive and have changed the wording to “predicted” to represent that fact. Ideally we would obtain light-state structures of the WT and G80R, unfortunately this is not technically feasible as the lifetimes of the light-state are too short to allow direct crystallization in the absence of continuous light. Exposure to continuous light leads to protein damage and the inability to crystalize ZTL. Such problems have been highlighted in (Vaidya et al., 2011, Science Signaling; and Heintz and Schlichting, 2016, <italic>eLife</italic>) and in some cases can abolish direct light-state crystallization. The alternative is to use mutations to stabilize the light state and use an integrative approach to validate the structural mechanism. Although non-ideal, we feel our data firmly supports our model that indicates a unique-divergent mechanism for ZTL proteins that is evolutionarily selected. Further, we outline new functional roles of LOV chemistry instrumental to plant growth and development.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>: For easier understanding, please define D = dark, L = light and label WT and G80R structures as &quot;dark&quot;.

Was there a radiation damage or an adduct cleavage problem during data collection? Please comment.</italic> </p><p>In general collecting light-state LOV structures is complicated by radiation damage that leads to cleavage of the photo-adduct (see Zoltowski et al., Science, 2007 and Heintz and Schlichting. <italic>eLife</italic> 2016;5:e11860). The radiation damage can lead to difficulties in properly evaluating a light-state structure. Ideally, multiple data sets are collected at different spots along the same crystal and merged to maintain completeness without damaging the adduct. For the ZTL light state crystal we can only collect data at one spot due to crystal size and morphology. That left the data set of lower than ideal completeness upon truncation to 60-frames, similar as to what is observed for light-state VVD (Zoltowski et al., Science, 2007). To verify that data truncation was not altering our structural conclusions, we did solve the structure with the complete data set (96% complete) using more frames. There are no structural differences between truncating the data set and using the full data set. The only effect is in regards to clearly observing the electron density for the covalent adduct that is reduced upon further radiation exposure. As this is essential to confirming direct crystallization of the light state, the truncated data set (less complete) is used.</p><p><italic>General Comment:</italic> </p><p><italic>Standardize the amino acid nomenclature (1 or 3 letter code?).
