from barrel-specific blood flow in the rodent somatosensory cortex to the human cortex, where BOLD-fMRI reveals numerous functional borders. However, it appears that the distribution of blood capillaries largely ignores these functional boundaries. Here we report that, by contrast, astrocytes, a major player in blood-flow control, show a striking morphological sensitivity to functional borders. Specifically, we show that astrocyte processes are structurally confined by barrel boundaries in the mouse, by the border of primary auditory cortex in the rat and by layers IIIa/b and Cytochrome Oxidase (CO)-blobs boundaries in the human primary visual cortex. Thus, astrocytes which are critical elements in neuro-hemodynamic coupling show a significant anatomical segregation along functional boundaries across different mammalian species. These results may open a new anatomical marker for delineating functional borders across species, including post-mortem human brains.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15915.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15915.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15915.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain is subdivided into many specialized regions that each has distinct roles. A key aim of brain research is to define the boundaries of these areas. Researchers have attempted to map the transitions between brain regions by identifying changes in the properties and activity of neurons (the cells that transmit information around the brain). However, these approaches cannot be used in some circumstances, such as when studying the living human brain, where only non-invasive experimental techniques can be used.</p><p>Cells other than neurons are also present in the brain. Astrocytes (a sub-type of glia cells) are support cells that have an extensive array of branches that project from each astrocyte’s cell body, often giving it a characteristic star shape. Now, using high-magnification light microscopy, Eliam et al. show that the branches of individual astrocytes tend to avoid crossing the borders of brain regions with different roles. These changes in crossing densities define measurable boundaries between such subdivisions.</p><p>These density-change boundaries formed by the astrocytes are present in multiple species – mouse, rat and human – and in multiple systems: touch, auditory and visual. This discovery could provide a new window into the functional organization of the brain. It may also offer insights into how the brain optimizes its blood-flow control across different subregions.</p><p>The results of this study raise an additional question: is the confinement of astrocytes to single regions of the brain shaped by experience or is it present from birth? Exposing animals to different sensory experiences at different developmental stages will hopefully shed further light on this phenomenon.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15915.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15915.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>functional architecture</kwd><kwd>astrocytes</kwd><kwd>barrel fields</kwd><kwd>somatosensory cortex</kwd><kwd>auditory cortex</kwd><kwd>striate cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001735</institution-id><institution>Weizmann Institute of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Krenter Institute - Equipment grant support</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eilam</surname><given-names>Raya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EU EP7 VERE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malach</surname><given-names>Rafael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005386</institution-id><institution>Israeli Centers for Research Excellence</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Israel Science Foundation grant No.51/11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malach</surname><given-names>Rafael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structural morphology of astrocyte processes is constrained by functional boundaries in the mouse, rat and human cortex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cerebral cortex has a remarkable capacity to regulate its own blood supply according to local neuronal activity demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buxton and Frank, 1997</xref>). This mechanism is of great interest, since it is the basis of optical imaging of intrinsic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vanzetta and Grinvald, 1999</xref>) as well as BOLD-fMRI imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>). In particular, blood flow modulations have been used to demarcate functional columnar boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blasdel and Salama, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grinvald et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lieke et al., 1989</xref>). A particularly striking example of such modulation has been found across the boundaries of the rodent's vibrissae related 'barrels' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cox et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Derdikman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petersen and Sakmann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Woolsey et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Woolsey and Van der Loos, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 1997</xref>). Given the tight coupling between columnar neuronal activation and blood flow, one could envision that the cortical vascular architecture should show anatomical shaping according to these boundaries. Such structural confinements by columnar boundaries were previously demonstrated in the dendritic and axonal arbors of barrel field neurons. These dendrites and axons appear to be 'repulsed' as they approach the barrel's boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brecht and Sakmann, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lendvai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Petersen and Sakmann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shepherd et al., 2005</xref>). However, detailed analysis of the micro-vascular organization in rodent barrel fields has failed to reveal such structural barrel-related modifications in the vascular capillary bed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blinder et al., 2013</xref>). Similar failure of anatomical confinement was additionally reported in the primate visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2015</xref>), including human cytochrome oxidase blobs evident in layers 2–3 of striate cortex, which constitute a robust example of functional 'mosaics' in the primate striate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Livingstone and Hubel, 1984</xref>). While the capillaries are a critical component in controlling blood circulation, another major constituent that is hypothesized to play a crucial role in the coupling between neurons and blood flow are glial cells, particularly astrocytes. These cells provide a crucial bridge between neuronal activity and vascular blood circulation. The basic concept is that astrocyte branches are capable of sensing the level of neuronal synaptic communications, integrate this information and then transmit it to the blood vessels, with which they are in contact. It has previously been proposed that signals related to neuronal activity levels can control the capillary’s diameter through astrocytes in this manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attwell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haydon and Carmignoto, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Petzold and Murthy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takano et al., 2006</xref>). Importantly the role of astrocytes in blood flow control has recently been demonstrated using Ca<sup>2</sup>+ imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Otsu et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, this research emphasized the importance of astrocytes' processes in blood flow control. Indeed, such control can be exquisitely precise, reaching sub-millimeter resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fukuda et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Another interesting aspect of astrocyte morphology is the tight coupling between the neuronal and astrocyte processes. In particular, recent evidence has demonstrated the existence of tight anatomical co-localization of astrocyte processes and neuronal synapses in what has been termed a 'tri-partite synapse' formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araque et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Halassa et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perea et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Santello et al., 2012</xref>). Such links further suggest that astrocyte morphology may follow boundaries defined by neuronal functional compartments.</p><p>Finally, previous research has uncovered that in parallel to the neuro-vascular coupling- astrocytes play a significant role in activity dependent astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle for the supply of metabolic substrates to neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pellerin et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Given the crucial functional role of astrocytes in neuro-vascular coupling and other aspects of neuronal modulations, we hypothesized that the astrocytes, rather than the blood vessels, may show anatomical remodeling over time according to persistent functional boundaries. Indeed, in the case of olfactory bulb glomeruli were neuronal connectivity is highly ordered, dye coupling experiments highlight a preferential communication between astrocytes within glomeruli but not between astrocytes in adjacent glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roux et al., 2011</xref>). To examine this hypothesis, we stained the entire astrocyte population in three species (mouse, rat and human) and in four functional boundaries (barrel field, auditory cortex, layer IIIa/b and Blob-interblob of human striate cortex), using an immunohistochemical procedure on thin paraffin sections. Superimposing the astrocytes onto the functional boundaries revealed a significant structural relationship. Thus, astrocyte processes showed a significant anatomical confinement at the functional boundaries. This finding raises the possibility of using such astrocyte formations as an anatomical marker for the identification of functional boundaries across different cortical areas and species, including post-mortem human tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reductions in the density of astrocyte processes are tightly localized to the barrel boundaries (septa)</title><p>Our examination of barrel field tissue was based on 154/146 (barrel/septa) measurements conducted in 4 sections in five left hemispheres of five mice (sectioned at 8 µM) and on 56/54 (barrel/septa) measurements calculatedin two additional left hemispheres (sectioned at 4 µM).

This staining revealed the branching patterns of individual astrocyte processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). An example of the branching of astrocyte processes is shown at intermediate (40x) and high (60x and 100x) magnifications in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,G and H</xref> respectively. The spread of astrocyte processes was not uniform, but tended to be highly modulated, forming patches of dense and sparse regions.

As can be clearly seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E,G and H</xref>, reductions in the density of astrocyte processes were not randomly distributed, but overlapped the barrel boundaries (e.g. see arrows-heads <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–H</xref> and dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1H</xref>).

To examine how general this phenomenon is, we examined the density of astrocyte processes in the auditory cortex of the rat.

Thus, examining the density of astrocyte processes may offer a novel 'window' into functional boundaries that may be revealed even in post-mortem tissue. To explore the possible extension of our hypothesis to the human cortex, we examined the boundaries of sub-laminae IIIa/IIIb of human primary visual cortex V1. Previous research has uncovered functional distinctions between these two sub-layers in the primate cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sceniak et al., 2001</xref>). We analyzed coronal sections from the right hemisphere of one human post-mortem brain (age 35). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> depicts the orientation of the sections relative to the occipital pole. To reveal the IIIa/IIIb border we used non-phosphorylated neurofilament (NPNF) immunostaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell and Morrison, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Preuss et al., 1999</xref>) and related this border to inter-laminar astrocyte processes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Astrocyte processes were not uniformly spread in layer III, but appeared to be constrained by the border of IIIa/IIIb. To quantitatively examine this effect, we manually drew the distribution of astrocyte processes at high magnification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Measuring the density of astrocyte processes between the two sublayers revealed a dramatic and sharp reduction in the density (66 ± 4%) at the border of layer IIIb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, left). The number of astrocyte branches crossing straight lines (375 µm length, see Materials and methods) at both sides of the border was also calculated in 4 neighboring sections (interval of about 20 µm between sections, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, right).

In that sense, the astrocyte processes appear to be more similar to dendritic arbors of barrel neurons, which were also reported to show a clear anatomical restriction in relation to barrel borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brecht and Sakmann, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldmeyer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lendvai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lubke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Petersen and Sakmann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shepherd et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to layer IV, where barrel boundaries were clearly demarcated, the columnar segregation in supra- and infra-granular layers was less distinct. This is reflected both in structural segregation and in neuronal signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldmeyer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lubke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petersen and Sakmann, 2001</xref>). It is interesting to note that such boundary 'blurring' was also reflected in the astrocyte geometry, since our quantitative analysis revealed a significant reduction in the anatomical confinement by barrel boundary, both in supra- as well as infra-granular layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Importantly, a significant, albeit smaller decrease in border crossing was observed in these layers as well. This result suggests that the level of anatomical border confinement could be a gradual process rather than an all or nothing categorical 'toggle' of a columnar confinement process.</p><p>However, a word of caution should be noted here regarding the methodological accuracy of barrel border definition. In layer IV, such demarcation was straightforward, since barrel boundaries were easily demarcated in this layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Welker and Woolsey, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Woolsey and Van der Loos, 1970</xref>). Thus, determining the septa and core boundaries could be achieved with great accuracy. By contrast, defining barrel borders outside layer IV was less accurate, relying on vertical extrapolations from layer IV borders by alignment of some of the penetrating arterioles. Such extrapolation may have introduced some inaccuracies in our border delineations. Therefore, the estimates of border crossings in the upper and lower layers should be considered less accurate compared to our layer IV results.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Astrocyte processes anatomically confined to functional boundaries: rat and human cortex</title><p>Our study reveals a significant dissociation between capillary distribution, which appears to ignore columnar boundaries, and the anatomical shaping of astrocyte processes. However, it could be argued that this observation was unique to the mouse barrel fields which indeed show a particularly striking functional segregation. To examine whether the astrocyte structural confinement may reflect a more general phenomenon, we extended our analysis to additional species (rat and human) and to additional functional boundaries (A1/A2 sub-layer IIIa/IIIb and blob/inter-blob organization respectively). In all cases (with the exception of CO-blob boundaries, which are not precisely defined to begin with, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Malach, 1992</xref>), we found a significant and abrupt reduction in astrocyte processes near the regional boundaries (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>).</p><p>It could be argued that the staining of astrocyte processes was not complete although our procedure (thin sections, antigen retrieval, long time incubations) enhanced the staining sensitivity. While we cannot rule out this possibility, such limited staining could not account for the selective drop in the density of astrocyte processes that was observed near functional boundaries, and not away from them as seen in all three cases studied (see histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref>).</p><p>Thus, we can safely conclude that astrocyte process morphology can be confined by regional and columnar boundaries across species and systems. Of course, our limited sample does not prove that all cortical boundaries should have a similar impact on astrocyte structure, but the observed phenomenon opens a potentially informative direction of future research, in which such astrocyte boundaries could be mapped in great detail across species and brain areas.</p><p>It should be noted that a number of previous studies have demonstrated that astrocyte activity may be modulated according to the functional properties of the modules, within which they reside. For example, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schipke et al., 2008</xref>) have demonstrated barrel specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in astrocytes. However, it is important to emphasize that such functional distinctions, while offering a possible source for the morphological restructuring reported here, do not on their own constitute a demonstration of such anatomical reshaping. For example, in the Schipke et.al. experiment, the astrocyte selectivity was rapidly abolished by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist application, while the astrocyte process' reshaping clearly operates (if at all) on much slower time scales.</p><p>Similarly, previous studies have demonstrated synaptic and molecular selectivity of astrocytes- for example Houades et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Houades et al., 2008</xref>) have shown that gap junction density may be modulated along barrel boundaries, while Voutsinos-Porche et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Voutsinos-Porche et al., 2003</xref>) have shown a transient selective appearance of glutamate transporter in barrels which disappeared in the adult cortex. These prior studies further confirm the potential functional selectivity of astrocytes. However they are not relevant to the issue of the astrocyte morphology. Thus, selective aggregation of gap junctions may occur with or without anatomical confinement of astrocyte processes reported here.</p><p>Astrocytes have been suggested to play a critical role in neurovascular coupling, controlling the blood flow upon an increase in neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attwell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haydon and Carmignoto, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Petzold and Murthy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takano et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, Astrocyte processes have been demonstrated to manifest tight anatomical formations with neuronal dendrites and the activity of the brain actually arises from the coordinated activity of a network comprises of both neurons and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araque et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Halassa et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perea et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Santello et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, a number of recent studies have demonstrated a principle of overlap-avoidance among individual astrocytes. Thus, astrocyte processes appear to form no-overlapping domains which may endow each astrocyte with a unique functional coupling to the neighboring neuronal population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Halassa et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nedergaard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oberheim et al., 2006</xref>). An attractive hypothesis, suggested by the present results, could be that long term and habitual confinement of neuronal activation to specific functional domains may have gradually adapted the individual astrocyte arbor domains to the neuronal functional boundaries in parallel with the dendritic and axonal confinement.</p><p>It is important to emphasize that the astrocyte confinement does not necessarily preclude blood flow across functional boundaries- since the capillaries themselves freely cross these boundaries. However, the confinement may allow a more efficient, precise and localized direction of blood flow to functional domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petersen and Sakmann, 2001</xref>). Compatible with this suggestion, optical imaging of blood flow during vibrissae activation reflects a clear confinement of blood supply within the barrel's borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Derdikman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Woolsey et al., 1996</xref>). Indeed, as has been thoroughly examined in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blinder et al., 2013</xref>), it appears that the highly localized functional selectivity reflected in intrinsic optical imaging is likely due to direct and localized modulation at the level of the microvessels, while more pathological blockage of penetrating arterioles and venules can lead to a more wide-spread vascular effects.</p><p>The mechanism that brings about astrocyte structural restriction is currently unknown. If, indeed such confinement serves an adaptive role, an interesting possibility is that this anatomical confinement reflects a dynamic plasticity process. In such a process, the distribution of astrocyte processes may reflect the level of sustained co-activation across neighboring neuronal assemblies, analogous to a Hebbian learning process. Relevant to this hypothesis, previous research has demonstrated activity-dependent dynamic changes in the coupling between astrocyte processes in the case of olfactory glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roux et al., 2011</xref>). It is noteworthy that this hypothesis reverses the causal chain. We do not propose that the morphological shaping of astrocytes somehow endows the underlying tissue with its functional boundaries. Rather, we hypothesize that the astrocyte processes are shaped by the functional selectivity of the underlying neuronal population. Finally, one cannot rule out a more interactive shaping, in which both systems remodel each other.</p><p>More generally the finding that astrocyte processes respect functional boundaries could open the way to a variety of plasticity experiments. For example, examining astrocyte remodeling during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diamond et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Olavarria et al., 1987</xref>), or studying the impact of functional deprivation, such as removing a single or a row of vibrissae on astrocyte morphology. Furthermore, global parameters such as age and pharmacological factors can be examined.</p><p>Finally, the generality of the astrocyte confinement requires further examination. It should be noted that previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colombo and Reisin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oberheim et al., 2009</xref>) showed that human astrocytes that populate the superficial cortical layer are larger in diameter (2.6 fold) and show a more complex organization compared to rodents. However, despite these striking differences, our results revealed such confinement in all three systems, including human cortex. It will be interesting to examine whether similar anatomical astrocyte confinements can be observed in other well defined functional boundaries, and the parameters that determine the level of astrocyte confinement in different systems. Our demonstration that astrocyte density modulation can be revealed in micro-structures in human V1 opens the exciting possibility that the non-homogeneity in astrocyte spread could be employed as a new marker for additional areal, columnar and functional discontinuities in the human brain. This is particularly important since the currently available information about such functional boundaries in post-mortem brain tissue is confined to more basic anatomical and histological aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lorenz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zilles and Amunts, 2010</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6 mice and Wistar rats were used in this study.

To form one large image of the total barrel field area, auditory cortex or V1 cortex, digital images at intermediate magnifications (20x) were collected and stitched together automatically, using NIS element software (Leica). Each large image of the barrel field consists of 60–120 tiles.</p><p>In addition, to demonstrate the fine processes of astrocytes reaching the barrel border, some sections were imaged with a confocal scanning microscope (LSM 700, Zeiss).

In addition we examined the distribution of astrocyte processes in blobs/inter-blobs zones. A set of vertical lines (500 µm length) were drawn at the center of blobs, the center of inter-blobs and at the left margin of the inter-blobs.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Christian Giaume and a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sabine Kastner as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports a morphometric analysis of astrocytes in cortical brain regions from mouse and human where functional boundaries are known to occur. This work is well conducted and data are strongly convincing.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Given the straightforward nature of the study the manuscript is laborious. The story could easily be told in fewer pages and with fewer figures. For example, all of the supplementary figures are impressive but essentially repeat what is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> to 5. Please condense and remove supplementary figures.</p><p>2) The story is told from an angle that appears infused by the assumption that the parcel-specific distribution of astrocytes is shaped by neuronal activity within a functional area. This might be so, but the study provides no evidence for the idea other than that the density of astrocyte processes varies with parcel-borders. Although stated at the outset that anatomical remodeling&quot; occurs over time there is no experimental investigation of such a process. Thus, please eliminate all of the suggestive terminology that refers to: &quot;shaped&quot;, sculpting, remodeling, and reshaping. All of these terms are interpretations and are better suited for the Discussion section.</p><p>3) The authors consider the astrocytes distribution and shape only in term of blood flow control, however, it is now well established that the processes of these glial cells also establish close contacts with synapse and form the so called &quot;tri-partite synapse&quot;. Consequently, these specific features of astrocytes described here should also be discussed in term of neuroglial interaction.</p><p>4) In addition, it is now well established that astrocytes occupy domains that do not overlap. Consequently, the authors should discuss their results also in reference to these particularities that are not shared with neurons. There is a real need to present the data in reference to the literature.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15915.010</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) Given the straightforward nature of the study the manuscript is laborious.

Indeed the present data does not resolve the mechanism that brings about the astrocyte confinement. Following the reviewer's suggestion we have now replaced all the ambiguous terms with the more anatomically descriptive terms &quot;confinement&quot; or &quot;restriction&quot;.</p><p> <italic>3) The authors consider the astrocytes distribution and shape only in term of blood flow control, however, it is now well established that the processes of these glial cells also establish close contacts with synapse and form the so called &quot;tri-partite synapse&quot;. Consequently, these specific features of astrocytes described here should also be discussed in term of neuroglial interaction.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that neuro-vascular coupling is not the exclusive source of neuron-astrocyte interaction. We have now added the following paragraph in the Introduction:</p><p>&quot;Another interesting aspect of astrocyte morphology is the tight coupling between the neuronal and astrocyte processes. In particular, recent evidence has demonstrated the existence of tight anatomical co-localization of astrocyte processes and neuronal synapses in what has been termed a &quot;tri-partite synapse&quot; formation (Araque et al., 1999; Halassa et al., 2007a; Perea et al., 2009; Santello et al., 2012). Such links further suggest that astrocyte morphology may follow boundaries defined by neuronal functional compartments.&quot;</p><p>And in the Discussion:</p><p>&quot;Furthermore, astrocyte processes have been demonstrated to manifest tight anatomical formations with neuronal dendrites and the activity of the brain actually arises from the coordinated activity of a network comprises of both neurons and astrocytes (Araque et al., 1999; Halassa et al., 2007a; Perea et al., 2009; Santello et al., 2012).&quot;</p><p><italic>4) In addition, it is now well established that astrocytes occupy domains that do not overlap. Consequently, the authors should discuss their results also in reference to these particularities that are not shared with neurons. There is a real need to present the data in reference to the literature.</italic></p><p>Following the reviewer's comment we have now added the following paragraph in the Discussion:</p><p>&quot;Interestingly, a number of recent studies have demonstrated a principle of overlap-avoidance among individual astrocytes. Thus, astrocyte processes appear to form no-overlapping domains which may endow each astrocyte with a unique functional coupling to the neighboring neuronal population (Halassa et al., 2007b; Nedergaard et al., 2003; Oberheim et al., 2006). An attractive hypothesis, suggested by the present results, could be that long term and habitual confinement of neuronal activation to specific functional domains may have gradually adapted the individual astrocyte arbor domains to the neuronal functional boundaries in parallel with the dendritic and axonal confinement.&quot;</p></body></sub-article></article>
