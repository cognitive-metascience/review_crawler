and ion and lipid homeostasis. Previous work demonstrated that the highly conserved yeast Ltc/Lam sterol transporters localize and function at ER MCSs. Our analysis of the human family members, GRAMD1a and GRAMD2a, demonstrates that they are ER-PM MCS proteins, which mark separate regions of the plasma membrane (PM) and perform distinct functions in vivo. GRAMD2a, but not GRAMD1a, co-localizes with the E-Syt2/3 tethers at ER-PM contacts in a PIP lipid-dependent manner and pre-marks the subset of PI(4,5)P2-enriched ER-PM MCSs utilized for STIM1 recruitment. Data from an analysis of cells lacking GRAMD2a suggest that it is an organizer of ER-PM MCSs with pleiotropic functions including calcium homeostasis. Thus, our data demonstrate the existence of multiple ER-PM domains in human cells that are functionally specialized by GRAM-domain containing proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>membrane contact site</kwd><kwd>ER-PM contact sites</kwd><kwd>cortical ER</kwd><kwd>GRAMD proteins</kwd><kwd>store operated calcium entry</kwd><kwd>PIP lipids</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32GM117689</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Besprozvannaya</surname><given-names>Marina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM062942</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nunnari</surname><given-names>Jodi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM097432</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nunnari</surname><given-names>Jodi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Functionally distinct ER-PM domains in human cells are defined by conserved GRAM domain containing proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotic cells is a vast and distributed intracellular network of membranous tubes and sheets with essential roles in ion and lipid homeostasis. It exerts many of its functions through intimate membrane contact sites (MCSs) with other organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prinz, 2014</xref>). MCSs are regions where organelles typically come within 10 to 30 nm of one another and are thought to be specialized âmicrodomainsâ that selectively localize lipid and protein effectors that function in signaling pathways and organelle dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eisenberg-Bord et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murley and Nunnari, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saheki and De Camilli, 2017a</xref>).</p><p>MCSs between the ER and the plasma membrane (ER-PM) are a highly conserved feature of eukaryotic cells and have emerged as key regulators of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang and Liou, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dickson et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eisenberg-Bord et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saheki and De Camilli, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stefan et al., 2013</xref>). In particular, in metazoan cells the store operated calcium entry pathway (SOCE) is critical for maintaining cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and is activated by the depletion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores in the ER, which triggers extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the PM at ER-PM contact sites to refill ER lumen Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrasco and Meyer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lewis, 2011</xref>). <underline>S</underline>tromal-<underline>I</underline>nteracting <underline>M</underline>olecule <underline>1</underline> (STIM1) protein is an integral ER protein that regulates SOCE in response to luminal ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>. A decrease in intraluminal ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> is sensed by STIM1, which undergoes conformational changes that expose domains that promote oligomerization and transport/targeting to pre-existing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) enriched ER-PM MCSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrasco and Meyer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">VÃ¡rnai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). At PI(4,5)P2-enriched ER-PM contacts, STIM1 directly recruits and activates PM Orai1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, which replenish ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrasco and Meyer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang and Liou, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MalÃ©th et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Highly conserved ER-PM tethers have been described and include the yeast tricalbins/human extended synaptotagmins (E-Syt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giordano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Manford et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saheki and De Camilli, 2017b</xref>). Mammalian E-Syt1/2/3 are anchored to the ER via an N-terminal hydrophobic hairpin and possess repeating cytosolic C2 domains, which directly mediate contact between the ER and the PM via interactions with PM-enriched PI(4,5)P2 lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giordano et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, they contain <underline>S</underline>ynaptotagmin-like, <underline>M</underline>itochondrial and lipid-binding <underline>P</underline>rotein (SMP) domains, which mediate their homo- and hetero-oligomerization and facilitate glycerolipid transport â a function implicated during PLC activation in the transport and recycling of diacylglycerol from the PM to the ER in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">FernÃ¡ndez-Busnadiego et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saheki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schauder et al., 2014</xref>). E-Syt2/3 tether the ER to the PM at resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, while E-Sty1 is recruited to ER-PM in a manner dependent on conditions of high intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as observed during SOCE where E-Syt1 stabilizes and expands Ca<sup>2+</sup>-specific microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MalÃ©th et al., 2014</xref>). During SOCE, STIM1 and Orai1 are recruited to a subset of E-Syts-containing ER-PM contact sites; however, the E-Syts are not required for any events in the SOCE pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giordano et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, cells lacking all three known E-Syts (1/2/3) still possess 50% of the ER-PM contact area relative to wild type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giordano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saheki et al., 2016</xref>). These observations suggest that additional ER-PM tethers exist and potentially function to specialize ER-PM contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saheki and De Camilli, 2017a</xref>).</p><p>A highly conserved family of ER membrane Ltc/Lam proteins was recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elbaz-Alon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gatta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murley et al., 2015</xref>) which, within yeast cells, localize to MCSs where they facilitate the intermembrane transfer of sterol lipids via VaST domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elbaz-Alon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gatta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murley et al., 2015</xref>). In yeast, Ltc1/Lam6 localizes to ER-mitochondria and ER-lysosome/vacuole contacts via physical interactions with the protein partners, Tom70/71 and Vac8, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gatta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murley et al., 2015</xref>). Ltc3/Lam4 and Ltc4/Ysp2 paralogs are localized to ER-PM MCSs, where they have been implicated in the retrograde transport of sterols from the PM to the ER and in regulation of PM TORC2 activity to coordinate sterol and sphingolipid homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gatta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murley et al., 2017</xref>). Here we examined the functions of the uncharacterized human Ltc/Lam protein orthologs, GRAMD1a and GRAMD2a.

Using phylogenetic analysis and structure prediction programs, we identified the uncharacterized GRAM-domain containing proteins, GRAMD1a-c, GRAMD2, and GRAMD3 as human Ltc orthologs.

To test this, we examined their localization relative to an ER marker, mCherry-Sec61Î², or PM marker, lyn-mCherry. Consistently, analysis of Z stack images and Z-stack reconstructions of cells indicate that peripheral GRAMD1a-eGFP and GRAMD2a-eGFP foci co-localized with ER and PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1âvideo 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video4">4</xref>).

Previously, it was shown that the GRAM domain of yeast Ltc1 is required for mitochondrial localization of Ltc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murley et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that the GRAM domain is a critical determinant of MCS localization. Consistent with this model, variants of GRAMD1a and GRAMD2a lacking their GRAM domain (GRAMD1aÎGRAM-eGFP and GRAMD2aÎGRAM-eGFP, respectively) exhibited diffuse ER localization and were not observed to localize in focal structures at ER-PM MCSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>, respectively). These data indicate that GRAMD1a and GRAMD2a are targeted to the PM via their GRAM domains and further suggest that this targeting mechanism is a general feature of the family.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>GRAMD1a and GRAMD2a localize to distinct ER-PM MCSs</title><p>To further characterize GRAMD1a and GRAMD2a cortical structures, we examined their relationship to each other. In cells co-expressing both GRAMD2a-mCherry and GRAMD1a-eGFP, no co-localization of GRAMD2a and GRAMD1a labeled foci was observed as onlyÂ ~8% of total GRAMD2a-eGFP fluorescence pixels overlapped with GRAMD1a-eGFP fluorescent pixels and visa versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These data suggest that GRAMD1a and GRAMD2a mark distinct ER-PM contact sites. To test this idea, we examined the relationship of GRAMD2a and GRAMD1a marked cortical foci to the localization of E-Syts2/3, which are well characterized ER-PM tethers that hetero-oligomerize and localize to ER-PM contacts via interaction with PM PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lipid domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">FernÃ¡ndez-Busnadiego et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giordano et al., 2013</xref>). Analysis of cells expressing GRAMD2a-eGFP and either mCherry-E-Syt2 or E-Syt3-mCherry revealed that a majority of the GRAMD2a-eGFP fluorescence signal co-localized with mCherry-E-Syt2 and E-Syt3-mCherry signals (75.9 Â± 2.5% and 85.7 Â± 3.3% respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>). Consistently, line-scan analysis indicated that GRAMD2a-labeled foci were co-localized with E-Syt3-labeled regions and also with a significant fraction of E-Syt2-lableled regions at the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom panel). Additionally, TIRF imaging of cells expressing ER marker BFP-Sec61Î² with GRAMD2a-eGFP and either mCherry-E-Syt2 or E-Syt3-mCherry demonstrated that co-localized regions of GRAMD2a-eGFP with either mCherry-E-Syt2 and E-Syt3-mCherry corresponded to regions of cortical ER at the cell periphery, consistent with a shared localization at ER-PM contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Although GRAMD2a extensively co-localized with E-Syt2 and E-Syt3 at ER-PM MCSs, a similar GRAMD2a-eGFP punctate localization pattern at cortical ER in both wildtype and E-Syt1/2/3 triple knock out HeLa cells was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). These data indicate that GRAMD2a is targeted to ER-PM MCSs independent of E-Syts. In contrast to GRAMD2a, GRAMD1a-eGFP fluorescence was not significantly co-localized with either mCherry-E-Syt2 or E-Syt3-mCherry fluorescence at the cell cortex (8.9 Â± 1.8% and 8.9 Â± 1.0% respectively and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D and E</xref>).

Thus, given the co-localization of GRAMD2a with E-Syt2 and E-Syt3, we asked if GRAMD2a targets to PM MCSs in cells in a manner dependent on PIP lipids. To test this, PI(4,5)P2 was depleted from the PM by stimulating phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) using the muscarinic agonist oxotermorine-M (OxoM) in cells transfected with the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dickson et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giordano et al., 2013</xref>).

As previously described, in the absence of TG, mCherry-STIM1 was diffusely distributed throughout the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grigoriev et al., 2008</xref>). Upon TG addition, mCherry-STIM1 rapidly re-distributed to discrete regions marked by GRAMD2a-eGFP at the cell cortex, which, based on previous observations, represent ER-PM contact sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, top panel two panels, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5âvideo 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video2">2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Consistently, after TG treatment total cortical fluorescence of mCherry-STIM1 increased significantly whereas the fluorescence intensity of cortical GRAMD2a-eGFP remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lower panel). To assess whether STIM1 and GRAMD2a co-localized at the cell cortex, we performed line scans of fluorescent intensity across GRAMD2a-eGFP foci before and after addition of TG. As expected, in the absence of TG, line scans indicated no significant co-localization of mCherry-STIM1 fluorescence with cortical GRAMD2a-eGFP foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Initially after TG addition, line scans indicated significant co-localization of mCherry-STIM1 fluorescence with GRAMD2a foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>, T50-T150) and, subsequently, regions of mCherry-STIM1 cortical fluorescence resolved from, but remained spatially linked to GRAMD2a-eGFP foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>, T150-T250).

The percentage of overlapping fluorescence pixels of mCherry-STIM1 with GRAMD2a-eGFP initially increased following TG addition, but as more mCherry-STIM1 translocated to the PM, the percentage of overlapping mCherry-fluorescence pixels of mCherry-STIM1 with GRAMD2a-eGFP decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5âsource data 1</xref>). Although areas of STIM1 and GRAMD2a fluorescence spatially resolved at later time points of TG treatment, line scan analysis the ER using ER marker BFP-Sec61Î² revealed that STIM1 and GRAMD2a remained co-localized to a shared ER-PM contact site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast to GRAMD2a, STIM1 did not significantly co-localize with cortical GRAMD1a foci following TG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D</xref>).

Given that GRAMD2a binds PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2, we examined PM PI(4,5)P2 lipids utilizing YFP-PH-PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>. Line scans and quantification of relative YFP-PH-PLC<sub>Î´1</sub> intensity at the PM indicated that there were no apparent differences between wild type and GRAMD2a KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1G</xref>), indicating that loss of GRAMD2a does not grossly alter PM PI(4,5)P2. We also examined whether loss of GRAMD2a affected PM cholesterol as alterations in PM cholesterol have significant effects on plasma membrane composition, architecture and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chierico et al., 2014</xref>). To examine cholesterol distribution in cells, we utilized the cholesterol biosensor mCherry-D4H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maekawa and Fairn, 2015</xref>), which binds cholesterol in the cytosolic leaflet of the PM and organelles and observed similar localization patterns in wild type and GRAMD2a KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1H</xref>). In addition, we examined the distribution of Caveolin-1 (Cav1), an essential component of caveolae, which specifically binds PM cholesterol, and observed that Cav1-GFP localization was also similar in wild type and GRAMD2a KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1I</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tagawa et al., 2005</xref>). Finally, we examined the steady state localization of the E-Syt ER-PM tethers. Steady-state localization of constitutive E-Syt ER-PM tethers, mCherry-E-Syt2 and mCherry-E-Syt3, was not apparently different between wild type and GRAMD2a KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In comparison, the localization of the Ca2+-dependent ER-PM E-Syt tether, E-Syt1, was significantly altered in GRAMD2a KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giordano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Idevall-Hagren et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, in wild type U2OS cells, as previously reported, in nominally zero external Ca2+, mCherry-E-Syt1 localized diffusely in the ER and upon TG-induced SOCE localized to punctate structures at ER-PM contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, top panel, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1J</xref>, left panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Idevall-Hagren et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, in GRAMD2a KO cells in nominally zero external Ca2+, mCherry-E-Syt1 was constitutively localized at ER-PM contacts and this distribution pattern was not altered by TG-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, bottom panel, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1J</xref>, right panel). Western Blot analysis indicated that mCherry-E-Syt1 protein levels were comparable in wild type and GRAMD2a KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1E</xref>, right panel), indicating this localization difference was not a consequence of different expression levels of E-Syt1 in these cells. The punctate localization pattern of mCherry-E-Syt1 in GRAMD2a KO cells was abolished upon extracellular Ca2+ depletion and chelation with EGTA and mCherry-E-Syt1 was localized throughout the ER, indicating that E-Syt1 localization ER-PM contacts in GRAMD2a KO was dependent on cytosolic Ca2+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1K</xref>). This observation suggests the possibility that the constitutive localization of E-Syt1 at ER-PM contacts in GRAMD2a KO cells is a consequence of elevated cytosolic Ca2+ relative to wild type cells.

In contrast, GRAMD1a, a tether containing both GRAM and VaST domains, interacts with the PM in a PIP lipid independent manner, raising the possibility that it may have a proteinaceous PM partner and/or be targeted via another PM lipid species, such as cholesterol given the characterized role of the VaST domain in sterol transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gatta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horenkamp et al., 2018</xref>). In this context, the localization of GRAMD1a to ER-PM contacts is cell-type specific; GRAMD1a-marked ER-PM contacts are present in Cos7, Hek293, HeLa, and Arpe19, cells but absent in U2OS or HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31019.029</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of GRAMD2a function.</title><p>GRAMD2a is a constitutive PI(4,5)P2-dependent ER-PM tether that localizes to a subset of E-Syt2/3 contacts.

Consistent with their distinct composition and spatial resolution, GRAMD1a and GRAMD2a-marked ER-PM contact sites also play discrete functional roles at both the cellular and physiological level. The cellular function of GRAMD1a ER-PM contacts sites is currently not known, but the presence of yeast Ltc/Lam-related VaST domain, which mediates inter-membrane sterol transport, suggests GRAMD1a, similar to the yeast Ltc3/4 homologs, may play a role in the regulation of sterol homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gatta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murley et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our data show that GRAMD2a functions as a constitutive tether that pre-marks and specifies ER-PM contact sites destined for SOCE, providing an explanation of previous work demonstrating that only a subset of E-Syt2/3-marked ER-PM contacts are utilized by STIM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrasco and Meyer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giordano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">VÃ¡rnai et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with a role for GRAMD2a in SOCE, in its absence we observed that the kinetics and extent of STIM1 translocation to ER-PM contacts during SOCE was significantly altered. However, loss of GRAMD2a did not significantly affect the number of STIM1 puncta or the SOCE Ca2+ response in cells, emphasizing the redundancy of ER-PM tethers, such as E-Syt1/2/3 and oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)/OSBP-related proteins in the maintenance or ER-PM contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saheki and De Camilli, 2017a</xref>). Although the SOCE Ca2+ response was not apparently affected in cells lacking GRAMD2a, the Ca2+-dependent ER-PM E-Syt1 tether was abnormally localized to ER-PM contacts under conditions in which the internal ER Ca2+ stores were full. Relatively small changes in basal cytosolic Ca2+ are sufficient for E-Syt1 PM recruitment, raising the possibility that loss of GRAMD2a alters cytosolic Ca2+ in a range or spatial manner not detected by Fura-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Idevall-Hagren et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, altered E-Syt1 PM localization in GRAMD2a KO cells suggests that there is a constitutive engagement of E-Syt1âs functions at the PM, which include Ca2+-dependent E-Syt1-mediated lipid transport and PI(4,5)P2 maintenance, which, in turn, likely alter cellular physiology, including Ca2+ homeostasis. This raises the possibility of a compensatory Ca2+ homeostatic mechanism at ER-PM contact sites in cells lacking GRAMD2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Idevall-Hagren et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Together with our observation that GRAMD2a pre-marks sites of SOCE, our data suggest a model in which GRAMD2a serves as a constitutive master tether at MCSs with pleiotropic functions including STIM1 recruitment and Ca2+ homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Consistent with this model, GSEA analysis linked GRAMD2a to a variety of calcium pathways in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lower panel). Mechanistically, given its domain structure and size, GRAMD2a is likely to create a tight ER-PM junction, which may uniquely be required to organize this putative domain and facilitate STIM1 recruitment, consistent with the observed preference of STIM1 for the relatively narrow junction created by E-Syt1 over E-Syt2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">FernÃ¡ndez-Busnadiego et al., 2015</xref>). Our cytological data also indicate that upon ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion, GRAMD2a and STIM1 initially are co-localized at ER-PM contacts but subsequently become spatially resolved within a contact, suggesting that GRAMD2a may also play a role in the formation of distinct microdomains within ER-PM contacts during SOCE, which would represent an additional level of complexity in the biogenesis and functionality of MCSs. In the absence of GRAMD2a, we speculate that this domain is altered, resulting in compensatory changes in calcium regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DÃ©liot and Constantin, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Based on our observations from yeast and mammalian cells, we speculate that members of the Ltc/GRAM superfamily are ER tethers whose partner specificity is coded by their conserved GRAM domain â the defining family feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murley et al., 2015</xref>). The shared ER localization of the Ltc/GRAM proteins in cells raises the possibility that combinatorial intermolecular interactions may occur between family members within the ER to further regulate their localizations and functions beyond ER-PM contacts within the ER-contact site network. As such, our work forms the basis for future experiments aimed at understanding the molecular machinery that regulates cross-talk and interaction between ER and other organelles in a dynamic cellular environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>6s-His Tag monoclonal antibody</td><td>Western Blot antibody</td><td>ThermoFisher (His.H8)</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_557403">AB_557403</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>STIM1 monoclonal antibody</td><td>Western Blot antibody</td><td>ThermoFisher (CDN3H4)</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2197884">AB_2197884</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>GAPDH polyclonal antibody</td><td>Western Blot antibody</td><td>SigmaAldrich (G9545)</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_796208">AB_796208</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>anti-mCherry polyclonal antibody</td><td>Western Blot antibody</td><td>ThermoFisher (PA5-34974)</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2552323">AB_2552323</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies</td><td>Western Blot antibody (DyLight 800 <break/>and DyLight 680)</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Oxotremorine M</td><td>Non-selective muscarinic <break/>acetylcholine receptor agonist</td><td>SigmaAldrich</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Thapsigargin</td><td>Non-competative SERCA inhibitor</td><td>Invitrogen/Life-technologies</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Fura-PE3 AM</td><td>Ratiometric cytosolic calcium indicator</td><td>Teflabs</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Lipofectamine2000</td><td>Tissue culture transfection reagent</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Lipids</td><td>All lipids used for liposome binding assays</td><td>Avanti Lipids</td><td/></tr><tr><td>COS7 cells</td><td>Cercopithecus aethiops kidney cell line</td><td>G.

COS7 and U2OS cells lines were kind gifts from G. Voeltz (University of Colorado, Boulder). ARPE19 cells were purchased from ATCC (CRL-2302).</p><p>cDNA clones of human GRAMD1a and GRAMD2a/GRAMD2 were obtained from Origene (GRAMD1a: RC226692, GRAMD2a: RC220145) and cloned into pAcGFP1-N1 and pAcmCherry-N1 vectors. YFP was replaced with mCherry in pEX-SP-YFP_STIM1 to generate pEX-SP-mCherry_STIM1 using AgeI and NotI restriction cloning; poly-K domain of STIM1 was deleted from pEX-SP-mCherry_STIM1 using Gibson Assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>CRISPR genome editing</title><p>CRISPR genome editing was performed using donor vector pX330, a human codon-optimized SpCas9 and chimeric guide RNA expression plasmid, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haeussler et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, primers coding for six different guide RNA sequences were cloned into pX330 with two overlapping primers each. U2OS cells were co-transfected with these vectors and pAc-GFP vector. Two days post transfection, individual GFP-expressing cells were FACS sorted into 96-well plates and clonal isolates were grown up. PCR-based genotyping was performed onÂ ~80 clones and several candidate clones were identified with mutations in the GRAMD2a ORF. These clones were further analyzed by PCR-based genotyping. Guide 3 resulted in 4-nucleotide deletion in Exon 4 as selected for analysis. GRAMD2a exon 4 guide 3 (5â GTTTAAGGATGTTCCCTTGG AGG) was cloned into pX330 with two overlapping primers (Forward_Exon4_Guide 3â5' CACCGTTTAAGGATGTTCCCTTGG and Reverse_Exon4_Guide 3â5' AAACCCAAGGGAACATCCTTAAAC).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Co-localization analysis: ImageJ was used for analysis of co-localization for fluorescently labeled proteins. Confocal time series were exported to ImageJ, a background subtraction performed, and thresholded. Resulting images were made to look as similar as possible to the original confocal micrographs. Binary masks were created of all fluorescent pixels within thresholded images. Masks of fluorescent proteins were subtracted from each other and % pixel overlap was calculated. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, the mask for GRAMD2a-GFP fluorescence was subtracted from the mask for Ch-E-Syt2 and visa versa, which resulted in the co-localization values presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>. At least 10 cells were quantified, imaged on at least two separate days (biological duplicates) are quantified. Two-tailed t-tests were performed wherever appropriate to access statistical significance. Percent fluorescence of YFP-PH-PLC<sub>Î´1</sub> at PM was determined using the following formula: % Fluorescence at PM = (Total integrated fluorescence density of whole cell â integrated fluorescence density of cytosol) / (Total integrated fluorescence density of whole cell) x 100 using ImageJ plugins. At least 10 cells were quantified, imaged on at least two separate days (biological duplicates) are quantified.</p><p>Kinetic analysis: ImageJ was used for analysis of time series kinetics. Briefly, cells were background subtracted and a region of interest (ROI) was drawn around the entire TRIF footprint. Resulting time points were then exported to IGOR Pro Software or GraphPad prism for visualization and quantification of data. At least 6 cells, imaged on at least two different days were analyzed.</p><p>Measurement of STIM1 puncta size: Confocal time series were exported to ImageJ, a background subtraction performed, and thresholded. It should be noted that care was taken to ensure the resulting images were similar to the original confocal micrographs. Following this step, thresholded images were converted into binary masks and area of cluster size calculated and a frequency histogram generated using GraphPad Prism. At least 8 cells, imaged on at least two different days were analyzed.</p><p>Affinity of GRAMD2ÎTM for liposomes: Western blot scans were analyzed using Image Studio Lite software. In order to standardize quantification, a standard box was created to encompass the largest band and, subsequently, this box was used to quantify the total intensity of each band, after background subtraction. Intensity of total protein in a reaction was calculated by adding the intensity of the pellet band with the supernatant band from each reaction. % binding was calculated by dividing intensity of pellet band by intensity of total protein. Each type of liposome binding experiment was performed with all controls (reaction that contained 1 â no liposomes, 2 â PC/PS liposomes) at least 4 times on four different days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Gene set enrichment analysis</title><p>Transcript expressions from human liver of 234 male and 193 female individuals were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the accession number GSE9588 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schadt et al., 2008</xref>).

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;GRAM domain proteins specialize functionally distinct ER-PM contact sites in human cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Tobias Meyer (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The study by Besprozvannaya and colleagues describes the discovery of a new group of GRAM-domain containing proteins. This work is important as it shows a clear role, particularly of GRAMD2a, in controlling the localization and translocation of STIM1 proteins. The findings in the study strongly argue that GRAMD2a is part of a core machinery that sets up and regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup>/STIM1 signaling and potentially lipid transport at ER-PM junctions. The authors make the additional interesting observation that GRAMD1a and GRAMD2a localize to different ER-PM membrane contact sites. The authors further demonstrate that GRAMD2a pre-marks PI(4,5)P2-enriched ER-PM membrane contact sites for store-operated calcium entry, while GRAMD1a does not co-localize with PI(4,5)P2 regions.</p><p>The manuscript is overall interesting and in principle suitable for publication in <italic>ELife</italic>. Nevertheless, the characterization of GRAMD2a KO needs to be made in some more detail, showing whether basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the cytosol and receptor or thapsigargin-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is altered. Also, a statistical analysis of some of the observations in the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> needs to be made more quantitatively. While the authors quantify some images they do not quantify other results and still make quantitative statements about them in the text (e.g. significant). Replicates of the individual experiments are, for the most part, not included, and at one point they state data not shown which should be added in Supplementary figures. There are also a few controls missing. Additionally, the authors do not adhere to the order of the figures in the text, which makes it very difficult for the reader to find the piece of data that the text refers to.</p><p>Specific Revisions:</p><p>1) GRAMD2a KO cells need more characterization.</p><p>a) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the single clone could have reduced amount of STIM1 and rescue by GRAMD2a overexpression could result from expansion of MCSs, so please show images to demonstrate normal looking MCSs and document protein levels.</p><p>b) Please measure SOCE responses in the KO cells compared to WT</p><p>2) The claim that GRAMD2a facilitates or is required for STIM1 recruitment to contact sites seems premature. Please quantitate the analysis to show that most or all of the recruited STIM1 overlaps with GRAMD2a (using total pixel overlap) and provide proper statistical analysis throughout.</p><p>3) The localization patterns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and 2C</xref> need to be quantitated and additional quantitation is needed throughout (see point 2).</p><p>4) Does GRAMD2a bind to the PM via a GRAM domain-PIP-lipid interaction? To address this they need to show that deleting or mutating the GRAM domain inhibits binding.</p><p>5) Please show something about how the STIM1 separates itself from GRAMD2a during its accumulation at the PM; i.e., are they really part of the same ER structure? Perhaps coexpressing Sec61 marker would suffice. Also, the criteria for judging that GRAM proteins were localized to MCSs was never explicitly stated. Some EM could help a lot here, though it would likely take more than 2 months. A fluorescent marker (MAPPER, or a luminal ER marker) to mark these sites should be tried.</p><p>Points that could probably be handled by discussion in the text:</p><p>1) Please offer possible explanation as to why STIM1-deltaK forms puncta in cells not overexpressing Orai, contrary to previous studies. For someone in the field, this result will look very suspicious.</p><p>2) They should also discuss why GRAMD2a KO does not reduce number of puncta if it acts as a tether.</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>This study shows that GRAMD1a and GRAMD2a localize to distinct ER-plasma membrane contact sites in human cells. Targeting of GRAMD2a to contact sites is dependent on PIP2 and the cytoplasmic domain of GRAMD2a was found to bind PIPs in vitro. GRAMD1a targeting does not seem to be dependent on PIP2. The study goes on to investigate the role of GRAMD2a in store operated calcium entry (SOCE). It shows that GRAMD2a marks contact sites where STIM1 is recruited during SOCE and it is suggested that GRAMD2a is required for the efficient PM translocation of STIM1. Overall, this is very well done and clearly presented study. However, the claim that GRAMD2a plays a role in STIM1 enrichment at contact sites, which is the most interesting aspect of this work, is not yet convincing.</p><p>1) A trivial explanation for the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref> could be that STIM1 levels are significantly reduced in GRAMD2a KO cells compared to control cells. This could explain why the average size and intensity of STIM1 puncta is reduced in GRAMD2a KO cells but the total number of puncta is not reduced.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> shows two examples of STIM1 recruitment to the plasma membrane following TG treatment. In both cases, roughly half of STIM1 puncta form at sites that do not appear to be marked by GRAMD2a. Of course, it is possible that the amount of GRAMD2a at these sites is below the level of detection but it is just as likely that GRAMD2a is not necessary for STIM1 recruitment. Since STIM1 puncta at sites that not do contain GRAMD2a seem about as bright and large as the others, the claim that GRAMD2a facilitates or is required for STIM1 recruitment to contact sites seems premature.</p><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>The study by Besprozvannaya and colleagues describes the discovery of a new group of GRAM-domain containing proteins. This work is important as it shows a clear role, particularly of GRAMD2a, in controlling the localization and translocation of STIM1 proteins. The findings in the study strongly argue that GRAMD2a is part of a core machinery that sets up and regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup>/STIM1 signaling and potentially lipid transport at ER-PM junctions. The authors make the additional interesting observation that GRAMD1a and GRAMD2a localize to different ER-PM membrane contact sites. The authors further demonstrate that GRAMD2a pre-marks PI(4,5)P2-enriched ER-PM membrane contact sites for store-operated calcium entry, while GRAMD1a does not co-localize with PI(4,5)P2 regions.</p><p>The manuscript is overall interesting and in principle suitable for publication in <italic>ELife</italic>. Nevertheless, the characterization of GRAMD2a KO needs to be made in some more detail, showing whether basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the cytosol and receptor or thapsigargin-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is altered. Also, a statistics analysis of some of the observations in the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> needs to be made more quantitatively. While the authors quantify some images they do not quantify other results and still make quantitative statements about them in the text (e.g. significant). Replicates of the individual experiments are, for the most part, not included, and at one point they state data not shown which should be added in Supplementary figures. There are also a few controls missing. Additionally, the authors do not adhere to the order of the figures in the text, which makes it very difficult for the reader to find the piece of data that the text refers to.</p><p>Major Concerns:</p><p>- A main piece of data that should be added is a functional characterization of the GRAMD2a KO. As mentioned above, they should measure both basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and Ca<sup>2+</sup> kinetics in KO and control cells.</p><p>- The authors state that GRAMD1a-eGFP is observed in focal structures at the periphery of cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. In the images, however, it looks like especially the co-localization of GRAMD1a-eGFP and GRAMD2a-eGFP with Sec61beta-Ch is rather at the center of the ER structures. This is also true for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>. To be able to make this conclusion, the authors need to quantify the co-localization at the center and the periphery separately, analyzing the percentage of GRAMD1a and GRAMD2a with BFP-Sec61beta and Lyn-Ch. After quantification of the images the authors should add in the text more clearly how many repetitions they did (independent experiments/wells/images). The authors do not comment on the fact that the ER maker in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref> and 1C looks very different. Are there morphology changes in cells overexpressing GRAMD1a-GFP?</p><p>- The authors claim that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref> the co-localization corresponds to regions of cortical ER. To make this point it would be important to include a non-cortical ER co-localization and then quantify both conditions.</p><p>- The distances on the line scan are quite large. Some puncta the authors report are 5Âµm in size according to the data the authors present, is this correct? Is this only in cells that overexpress a lot of the respective proteins? (i.e. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>- The authors state that a similar localization pattern is observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and in 2C. Such a statement can only be made if the authors include a quantification of the co-localization pattern.</p><p>- The levels of GRAMD1a-GFP expression in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> (and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B and D</xref>) are low and not comparable with the levels of expression of GRAMD2a-eGFP. Could that be the reason why no significant co-localization with E-Syt3-Ch is observed?</p><p>- In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> the localization of GRAMD2a-Ch/GRAMD1a-Ch is very different from CFP-PH-PLC. Since E-Syt2/3 are also known to localize at PI(4,5)P2-enriched ER-PM contact sites, it might be useful to add this marker for the co-localization analysis.</p><p>- The authors use a liposome binding assay to assess whether GRAMD2a biding of PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2 is specific. This assay seems to lack a non-binding control protein. The authors may include GRAMD1a-Ch as a control since it is not supposed to bind these lipids (as claimed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Another useful control for in vitro binding comparison could be E-Syt2/3.</p><p>- In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> the assay seems non-specific for 15% pf PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2. The authors do not comment on that observation. Do they think it is a charge interaction mostly or a specific PIP2 binding interaction?</p><p>- The authors state that GRAMD2a binds to the PM via a GRAM domain -PIP-lipid interaction. To make this claim, they need to delete the GRAM domain and show a failure of binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>- The sentence that GRAMD2a uniquely marks SOCE-specific ER-PM MCSs (subsection âGRAMD2a pre-marks ER-PM contacts specialized for SOCE<bold><italic>â</italic></bold>) is not backed by data shown up to this point. The conclusion can only be made later.</p><p>- Throughout the manuscript the authors prefer to show representative images of their results rather than a quantification of biological replicates. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> the authors do not show any images and only show quantification of the results. To get a better understanding of the results in 7B the authors should include representative images of the quantified area. They also should perform throughout the study quantifications of images if they want to be able to use the term &quot;significant&quot;.</p><p>Reviewer #3</p><p>This is an interesting paper that proposes a role for GRAM-domain proteins in specializing ER-plasma membrane contact sites (MCSs) for store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). The molecular signature of MCSs that regulate SOCE is a topic of wide interest. Previous work by De Camilli's group has shown that the E-Syt proteins act as tethers to stabilize MCSs where the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor STIM1 localizes. Surprisingly, E-syt knockdown reduced the number of MCSs without significantly reducing SOCE, suggesting there may be a subset of E-Syt+ sites that are specialized to conduct Ca. This paper proposes that GRAMD2a is a MCS tether that serves this function. The authors show that GRAMD2a colocalizes with E-Syt2/3 at MCSs in a PIP2-dependent way. After store depletion STIM1 is recruited initially to GRAMD2a sites, while GRAMD2a KO is associated with reduced STIM1 recruitment. On this basis they conclude that GRAMD2a pre-marks and specializes a subset of MCSs for SOCE.</p><p>Overall, these studies have been carefully done and are well presented. The non-overlapping localization of GRAMD1a and 2a and their different dependencies on PIP2 are clear. However, based on the data presented I am not convinced of the specific role of GRAMD2a in marking sites of SOCE, and have a number of questions related to the main conclusions that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) The presence of GRAMD1a and 2a at ER-PM contacts needs to be demonstrated by EM. The conclusion is currently based on TIRF which only has a resolution of 100-200 nm and cannot resolve MCSs. EM is the standard for establishing the presence of specific proteins at ER-PM contacts, and was used in the initial studies of E-Syts and STIM proteins (Giordano et al., 2013; Wu et al., JCB 174:803, 2006). In addition, this would help test the authors' speculation that GRAMD2a recruits STIM1 to MCSs by enforcing a particular geometry on the junction.</p><p>2) The authors conclude the GRAM domain mediates the interaction of GRAMD2a with PIPs in the PM, but do not directly test this by mutating or deleting the domain. This should be done, especially as GRAMD1a does not require PIP2 for its localization.</p><p>3) GRAMD2a is referred to as an ER-PM tether, but the only direct evidence for this is that its overexpression increases the size of ER-PM contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). At presumably much lower levels of endogenous expression, does it actually have this function? In the GRAMD2a knockout cells, the number of MCSs is not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), which does not add support to its function as a tether. A possible complication here is that STIM1 was also overexpressed, which is known to distort ER-PM contacts. Does GRAMD2a KO reduce the number of MCSs when STIM1 is not expressed? MAPPER or a luminal ER marker might be useful here.</p><p>4) A major point is that GRAMD2a helps recruit STIM1 to MCSs, but the underlying mechanism is completely unknown. Some additional information is needed, especially since the colocalization of the two proteins declines with time. Does GRAMD2a bind to STIM1, either directly or as part of a complex? Are the two proteins actually part of the same MCS? If so, does the MCS expand after arrival of STIM1, with STIM1 entering the new area? This could be investigated with an ER marker or a marker for ER-PM contacts (e.g., MAPPER). Again, EM would be very helpful here.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> shows reduced recruitment of STIM1 in a single GRAMD2a KO clone, suggesting that endogenous GRAMD2a helps recruit STIM1 to the MCSs. The only argument against this being a clonal artifact is that the STIM1 response is &quot;rescued&quot; by transient transfection with GRAMD2a-GFP. However, this overexpression may compensate for the low recruitment in the KO by increasing MCS size. The authors need to show that GRAMD2a expression does not alter the size of the MCSs and is thus a true rescue of function.</p><p>6) To support a role for GRAMD2a in SOCE, it is essential to compare Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in response to store depletion in GRAMD2a WT and KO cells, without overexpressing STIM1. This will provide the strongest test of whether endogenous GRAMD2a is actually essential for SOCE.</p><p>7) It is very surprising that Ch-STIM1deltaK forms puncta in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Several studies (e.g., Liou et al., 2007; Park et al., 2009) have shown that STIM1-deltaK by itself does not localize to ER-PM contacts; if Orai is also present it binds STIM1-deltaK and the proteins trap each other. It seems highly unlikely that COS7 cells express enough endogenous Orai to account for the puncta, so the question is, what do they represent and are they actually at the PM? A more interpretable experiment would be to coexpress Orai1 so that STIM1-deltaK/Orai complexes can form without the need for PIP2, and ask whether the clusters fail to colocalize with GRAMD2a.</p><p>8) To conclude that &quot;GRAMD2a pre-marks sites of STIM1 localization at ER-PM contacts&quot;, it is necessary to show that most or all of STIM1 that ends up at the PM is recruited to GRAMD2a-positive sites. Otherwise, STIM1 may be responding to something else which happens to partially colocalize with GRAMD2a. How much STIM1 localizes to puncta that are not associated with GRAMD2a?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;GRAM domain proteins specialize functionally distinct ER-PM contact sites in human cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as Reviewing Editor and Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Tobias Meyer (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor drafted this decision in the hopes that you can prepare a revised submission. We hope you will be able to submit the revised version within two months that highlights the stronger aspects of the current story and addresses the comments here from Reviewer #1. We try hard not to support multiple rounds of reviews, but this expert referee's comments seemed serious enough that additional revision is required. Overall, this reviewer was less convinced now that GRAMD2a specifically marks ER-PM MCSs for SOCE, as the paper concludes. Specifically:</p><p>1) The first question was whether expression of the mCh-STIM1 (not endogenous STIM1 â subsection âGRAMD2a facilitates STIM1 recruitment during SOCEâ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1C</xref>) was lower in the single GRAMD2a KO clone. It is not possible to judge this from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> because the data are all normalized to initial fluorescence. STIM1 overexpression increases the area of MCSs and this is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B</xref>; reduced expression of mCh-STIM1 in the KO clone could potentially explain the decreased STIM1 puncta area. The second question was whether GRAMD1a overexpression could have increased the size of MCSs beyond control size, which might account for the increased recruitment of mCh-STIM1 to the PM. Please address these questions.</p><p>2) The new calcium measurements have serious problems and overall the results are not consistent with the evidence that GRAMD2a knockout greatly inhibits STIM1 accumulation at ER-PM contact sites, and do not support the contention that GRAMD2a KO affects Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis more generally. The authors see a slight decrease in SOCE in GRAMD2a KO cells when measured by GECO-Orai1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and conclude this is consistent with the inhibition of STIM1 localization. There are a couple of problems here. First, the difference between control and KO is very slight. Given the profound inhibition of STIM1 translocation in 7A, and the fact that SOCE is a highly nonlinear function of STIM1 binding to Orai1, one would expect a nearly complete elimination of SOCE in KO cells. More importantly, overexpressing Orai1 without coexpressing STIM1 actually inhibits SOCE, presumably because an excess of Orai1 &quot;dilutes&quot; the pool of endogenous STIM1 and reduces the STIM1:Orai1 binding stoichiometry below the level needed to open the channel (see Hoover and Lewis, PNAS 108:13299, 2011; Li Z et al. J Biol Chem 282:29448, 2007; Soboloff et al. J Biol Chem 281:20661, 2006). Such a dilution effect would explain why Ca influx is slightly reduced with GECO-Orai1 overexpression, but not when Ca is measured by Lck-GCaMP or fluo-4 (and endogenous Orai and STIM levels are maintained). Thus, the slight inhibition of SOCE with GECO-Orai1 cannot be attributed to the absence of GRAMD2a.</p><p>The authors report an increase in SOCE in GRAMD2a KO cells, when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is measured by Lck-GCaMP or fluo-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), and suggest that GRAMD2a may affect Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis more generally. However, the measurements of SOCE appear flawed. The classic hallmark of SOCE is that after stores are depleted with TG and Ca<sup>2+</sup> is readded, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> level overshoots the baseline. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1D</xref>, the apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> level in control cells actually drops below baseline after Ca readdition. In the supplementary figure, the baseline Ca is also not stable, precluding a simple interpretation. Overall, these measurements are not convincing.</p><p>We suggest repeating these measurements in control and KO cells using a ratiometric indicator like fura-2, which is much more resistant to artifacts from differential dye loading, bleaching, illumination fluctuations, stray light, etc. Show that the control response is consistent with SOCE. If the KO response is larger than control, then further experiments will have to be done to reconcile the result with the apparent inhibition of STIM1 translocation.</p><p>Based on the evidence at this point, the reviewers felt that the conclusion that GRAMD2a really acts as a &quot;master tether&quot; that specifies a subset of E-syt MCSs for SOCE is overstated (Discussion section paragraph two). In the absence of GRAMD2a there are still many STIM1 puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B</xref>); apparently, GRAMD2a is not required for STIM1 recruitment, although it may help promote it in some way. The new Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data do not show a strong inhibition of SOCE in the absence of GRAMD2a. Taken together, a role of GRAMD2a in specifying sites for SOCE seems questionable at this stage.</p><p>Subsection âGRAMD2a pre-marks ER-PM contacts specialized for SOCEâ, final paragraph.

Your article has been reviewed by one peer reviewer, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. While we hate to ask for any additional work after revision, the key reviewer felt very strongly that the conclusions are not supported by the current data and a single experiment has the potential to quickly rectify this issue.</p><p>First, the reviewers felt that you have responded in a satisfactory way to points 1 and 2.</p><p>Regarding Point 3: The scientific basis for rating the quality as low was Ca<sup>2+</sup> below baseline even when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is re-added to WT in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> left, and the lack of a steady Ca<sup>2+</sup> baseline at the start of the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> right.</p><p>In the revision, the authors now conclude that Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is somehow different in U2OS cells compared to other cells like HEK or HeLa. This is not justified based on the sparse data that are presented. U2OS cells show very similar TG responses to HEK and HeLa; see Chen et al., Sci. Reports 6:22142, 2016; Supplementary Figure S1B. So this is not a cell type difference, but more likely has something to do with the way the cells have been treated. In the experience of the expert reviewer with many different cell types, basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> can become elevated simply by plating cells on polylysine-coated coverslips, or flowing solutions past them, and one has to be careful not to stimulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling through these manipulations. The new fluo-4 data from HEK293 cells look great, but they do not validate the aberrant U2OS responses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. Also, the low P values comparing responses in WT vs. KO cells do not indicate that the &quot;data are solid&quot;; they merely indicate the two response are significantly different, but not why they differ. If one set of measurements is flawed, significant differences can occur, but they do not necessarily result from the KO. So this is still a problem that needs to be fixed to enable a meaningful comparison of WT and KO responses.</p><p>The new E-syt1 experiment is interesting, and does suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> may be elevated in KO cells in the resting state. A likely explanation for both the TG and E-syt1 results is that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores in the U2OS cells after plating are relatively empty, which prevents TG from releasing any more Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER while stimulating tonic influx through SOCE. This also explains why Ca<sup>2+</sup> drops inside when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is removed outside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). It is unfortunate the authors did not take the suggestion of recording Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses using fura-2, which would have indicated any differences in basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> and allowed them to compare resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> in WT vs KO in a direct way. (An elevated basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not detectable in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> because the data are all normalized to the initial fluorescence).</p><p>The reviewers believe that the story will elicit substantial interest and further work to determine the underlying mechanisms. However, the SOCE data in U2OS cells cannot yet be interpreted. We suggest the following single experiment to clear this up (and to avoid misconceptions about Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in U2OS cells): Please measure the SOCE responses using fura-2, as suggested before. This should not be difficult: it should only take a few days and will go far to clarify the conclusions of this story.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31019.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific Revisions:</p><p>1) GRAMD2a KO cells need more characterization.</p><p>a) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the single clone could have reduced amount of STIM1 and rescue by GRAMD2a overexpression could result from expansion of MCSs, so please show images to demonstrate normal looking MCSs and document protein levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We examined endogenous STIM1 levels using Western analysis with an anti-STIM1 monoclonal antibody in control U2OS and GRAMD2a KO cells.

Specifically, given its small size and simple domain structure, GRAMD2a is likely to create a tight ER-PM junction, which may facilitate STIM1 recruitment, consistent with the observed preference of STIM1 for the relatively narrow junction created by E-Syt1 over E-Syt2/3 (Fernandez-Busnadiego et al., 2015).â</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor drafted this decision in the hopes that you can prepare a revised submission. We hope you will be able to submit the revised version within two months that highlights the stronger aspects of the current story and addresses the comments here from Reviewer #1. We try hard not to support multiple rounds of reviews, but this expert referee's comments seemed serious enough that additional revision is required. Overall, this reviewer was less convinced now that GRAMD2a specifically marks ER-PM MCSs for SOCE, as the paper concludes. Specifically:</p><p>1) The first question was whether expression of the mCh-STIM1 (not endogenous STIM1 â subsection âGRAMD2a facilitates STIM1 recruitment during SOCEâ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1C</xref>) was lower in the single GRAMD2a KO clone. It is not possible to judge this from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> because the data are all normalized to initial fluorescence. STIM1 overexpression increases the area of MCSs and this is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B</xref>; reduced expression of mCh-STIM1 in the KO clone could potentially explain the decreased STIM1 puncta area.</p></disp-quote><p>Measuring endogenous STIM1 made a lot of sense to us and in fact there seems to be a slight elevation in the STIM1 levels in the GRAMD2a KO cells. Nevertheless, we performed Western blots on both endogenous and overexpressed mCherry-STIM1 extracts from wild type and GRAMD2a KO cells under conditions where we observed defective STIM1 translocation in the KO cells and did not observe any significant difference in the expression levels of mCherry-STIM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1D and E</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second question was whether GRAMD1a overexpression could have increased the size of MCSs beyond control size, which might account for the increased recruitment of mCh-STIM1 to the PM. Please address these questions.</p></disp-quote><p>We selected cells that had apparently normal ER-PM contacts site density and area. This is documented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> low expression (0.1 ug/dish) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> high expression (1.0 ug). Under both these conditions we observe that GRAMD2a pre-marks contacts where STIM1 is recruited in cells. Also, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> documents that under resting conditions with GRAMD2a low expression (low expression was used in all experiments with the exception of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) STIM1 is diffusely localized to the ER, indicating that overexpression of GRAMD2a is not sufficient for STIM1 recruitment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The new calcium measurements have serious problems and overall the results are not consistent with the evidence that GRAMD2a knockout greatly inhibits STIM1 accumulation at ER-PM contact sites, and do not support the contention that GRAMD2a KO affects Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis more generally. The authors see a slight decrease in SOCE in GRAMD2a KO cells when measured by GECO-Orai1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and conclude this is consistent with the inhibition of STIM1 localization. There are a couple of problems here. First, the difference between control and KO is very slight. Given the profound inhibition of STIM1 translocation in 7A, and the fact that SOCE is a highly nonlinear function of STIM1 binding to Orai1, one would expect a nearly complete elimination of SOCE in KO cells. More importantly, overexpressing Orai1 without coexpressing STIM1 actually inhibits SOCE, presumably because an excess of Orai1 &quot;dilutes&quot; the pool of endogenous STIM1 and reduces the STIM1:Orai1 binding stoichiometry below the level needed to open the channel (see Hoover and Lewis, PNAS 108:13299, 2011; Li Z et al. J Biol Chem 282:29448, 2007; Soboloff et al. J Biol Chem 281:20661, 2006). Such a dilution effect would explain why Ca influx is slightly reduced with GECO-Orai1 overexpression, but not when Ca is measured by Lck-GCaMP or fluo-4 (and endogenous Orai and STIM levels are maintained). Thus, the slight inhibition of SOCE with GECO-Orai1 cannot be attributed to the absence of GRAMD2a.</p><p>[â¦]</p><p>Based on the evidence at this point, the reviewers felt that the conclusion that GRAMD2a really acts as a &quot;master tether&quot; that specifies a subset of E-syt MCSs for SOCE is overstated (Discussion section paragraph two). In the absence of GRAMD2a there are still many STIM1 puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B</xref>); apparently, GRAMD2a is not required for STIM1 recruitment, although it may help promote it in some way. The new Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data do not show a strong inhibition of SOCE in the absence of GRAMD2a. Taken together, a role of GRAMD2a in specifying sites for SOCE seems questionable at this stage.</p></disp-quote><p>To address concerns that the system we used for measuring Ca<sup>2+</sup> is somehow fundamentally flawed, we measured the SOCE response in the HEK293 cell line, in which the conical SOCE has been defined. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1F</xref>, we can reproduce the stereotypical SOCE response in this line using our experimental conditions, which indicates that the trivial explanations provided above do not account for the different response observed in U2OS cells. As expressed in our rebuttal letter dated November 12th above, we are also willing to share all of our raw data, which is compiled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1F</xref>. In the raw movies, it is apparent that there are no âbleaching, focus drift, movement, etcâ issues. Also, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses between wild type and GRAMD2a KO cells are significantly different (p values 10-5)-see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> legend for details, which indicates that our data are âsolidâ. We have also added a new experiment examining E-Syt1 localization, which represents an independent approach to test the validity of our Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurement data. It has been documented that under resting conditions E-Syt1 is localized diffusely in the ER but upon elevated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (independent of SOCE) it translocates to ER-PM contacts (Idevall-Hagren et al. 2105). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1G</xref> shows that under resting conditions, in contrast to wild type cells, E-Syt1 is constitutively localized at ER-PM contacts in GRAMD2a KO cells in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent manner, further substantiating our Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements and indicating that loss of GRAMD2a significantly alters the composition of ER-PM contacts.</p><p>We removed the GECO-Orai data because of the complication in interpretation resulting from overexpression of Orai. As stated above, we have performed additional experiments to address the specificity of the STIM1 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> phenotypes in GRAMD2a knockout cells. We observe an additional defect in E-Syt1 localization, consistent with abberant Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis but we did not observe any apparent differences in PM PIP or cholesterol lipids or in E-Syt2/3 localization. Together we feel these data are consistent with a model in which GRAD2a functions as a ER-PM tether that organizes a PM domain devoted to Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection âGRAMD2a pre-marks ER-PM contacts specialized for SOCEâ, final paragraph.

This is not justified based on the sparse data that are presented. U2OS cells show very similar TG responses to HEK and HeLa; see Chen et al., Sci. Reports 6:22142, 2016; Supplementary Figure S1B. So this is not a cell type difference, but more likely has something to do with the way the cells have been treated. In the experience of the expert reviewer with many different cell types, basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> can become elevated simply by plating cells on polylysine-coated coverslips, or flowing solutions past them, and one has to be careful not to stimulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling through these manipulations. The new fluo-4 data from HEK293 cells look great, but they do not validate the aberrant U2OS responses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. Also, the low P values comparing responses in WT vs. KO cells do not indicate that the &quot;data are solid&quot;; they merely indicate the two response are significantly different, but not why they differ. If one set of measurements is flawed, significant differences can occur, but they do not necessarily result from the KO. So this is still a problem that needs to be fixed to enable a meaningful comparison of WT and KO responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the expert reviewer for this full explanation and for pointing out published SOCE data in U2OS cells. Based on these comments and data, we recruited a collaborator to help us conduct the Fura-2 measurements as we do not have the appropriate instrumentation. In the course of the Fura-2 experiments, we determined that Fluo-4 and Llk-GcAMP3G data were indeed flawed as a consequence of technical issues and have been removed. As you will see in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, using Fura-2, we did not observe a significant change in the SOCE response between WT and GRAMD2a KO cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The new E-syt1 experiment is interesting, and does suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> may be elevated in KO cells in the resting state. A likely explanation for both the TG and E-syt1 results is that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores in the U2OS cells after plating are relatively empty, which prevents TG from releasing any more Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER while stimulating tonic influx through SOCE. This also explains why Ca<sup>2+</sup> drops inside when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is removed outside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). It is unfortunate the authors did not take the suggestion of recording Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses using fura-2, which would have indicated any differences in basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> and allowed them to compare resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> in WT vs KO in a direct way. (An elevated basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not detectable in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> because the data are all normalized to the initial fluorescence).</p></disp-quote><p>Our Fura-2 data (not normalized to initial fluorescence â only non-dye-loaded cell background subtracted) suggest that basal cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not significantly different between the WT and KO cells. The increased constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent ESyt1 PM localization in GRAMD2a KO cells suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> may be altered proximal to the PM. This aberrant localization is likely a compensatory response to altered ER-PM contacts and may normalize Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. At this point, we are hesitant to revisit Llk-GcAMP3G experiments given the general concern that the probe may not be a neutral reporter. Thus, the exact basis of the STIM1 and E-Syt-1 localization defects in GRAMD2a KO cells and their relationship to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (and Ï (4,5)P2) homeostasis will require additional experimentation beyond the scope of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
