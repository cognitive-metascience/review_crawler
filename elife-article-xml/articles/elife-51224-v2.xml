H<sup>+</sup>-coupled exchangers and Cl<sup>-</sup> channels, and mutations causing their dysfunction lead to genetic disorders. The CLC exchangers, unlike canonical 'ping-pong' antiporters, simultaneously bind and translocate substrates through partially congruent pathways. How ions of opposite charge bypass each other while moving through a shared pathway remains unknown. Here, we use MD simulations, biochemical and electrophysiological measurements to identify two conserved phenylalanine residues that form an aromatic pathway whose dynamic rearrangements enable H<sup>+</sup> movement outside the Cl<sup>-</sup> pore. These residues are important for H<sup>+</sup> transport and voltage-dependent gating in the CLC exchangers. The aromatic pathway residues are evolutionarily conserved in CLC channels where their electrostatic properties and conformational flexibility determine gating. We propose that Cl<sup>-</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> move through physically distinct and evolutionarily conserved routes through the CLC channels and transporters and suggest a unifying mechanism that describes the gating mechanism of both CLC subtypes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>active transport</kwd><kwd>membrane protein</kwd><kwd>ion channels</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM128420</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Accardi</surname><given-names>Alessio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS104617</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahern</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP00P3_139205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernèche</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Yanyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combined simulations and electrophysiological experiments show that the CLC channels and exchangers form physically distinct and evolutionarily conserved pathways through which Cl<sup>-</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> ions move when crossing biological membranes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The CLC (<underline>C</underline>h<underline>L</underline>oride <underline>C</underline>hannel) family is comprised of Cl<sup>-</sup> channels and H<sup>+</sup>-coupled exchangers whose primary physiological task is to mediate anion transport across biological membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Accardi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jentsch and Pusch, 2018</xref>).

This pathway is defined by three anionic binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dutzler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dutzler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Accardi and Picollo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Park et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The external and central sites, S<sub>ext</sub> and S<sub>cen</sub>, are alternatively occupied by the permeant anions or by the negatively charged side chain of a conserved glutamic acid, Glu<sub>ex</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Extensive functional work suggests that cycling through these conformations underlies the Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange cycle in the CLC transporters and gating in the CLC channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lísal and Maduke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basilio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khantwal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vien et al., 2017</xref>). All proposals accounting for the CLC exchange cycle suggest that these transporters do not utilize a classical ‘ping-pong’ mechanism of antiport, where the transporter sequentially interacts with one substrate at a time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Picollo et al., 2012</xref>). Rather, the CLCs were proposed to simultaneously bind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Picollo et al., 2012</xref>) and translocate Cl<sup>-</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> through partially congruent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accardi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zdebik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The H<sup>+</sup> pathway is delimited by two glutamic acids that are conserved in the CLC transporters: Glu<sub>in</sub> serves as the intracellular proton acceptor and is distal from the Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation pathway, while Glu<sub>ex</sub> is the extracellular intersection between the H<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accardi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zdebik et al., 2008</xref>). Several models have been proposed for the exchange cycle of the CLCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miller and Nguitragool, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basilio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khantwal et al., 2016</xref>). However, none provided a molecular mechanism describing how the Cl<sup>-</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> ions bypass each other while moving in opposite directions through the permeation pathway. These proposals share the critical assumption that protonation of Glu<sub>ex</sub> within the pathway destabilizes its binding to S<sub>cen</sub> and/or S<sub>ext</sub>, favoring its exit from the pathway. While this mechanism readily explains outward H<sup>+</sup> transfer, it requires that during H<sup>+</sup> influx a protonated and neutral Glu<sup>0</sup><sub>ex </sub>outcompetes the negatively charged Cl<sup>-</sup> ions bound to the anion-selective S<sub>ext</sub> and S<sub>cen</sub> sites. This is an energetically unfavorable transition, which should result in intrinsic rectification of transport. Indeed, free-energy calculations show that a protonated Glu<sub>ex</sub> encounters a high energy barrier to enter the Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuang et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, the CLC exchangers function with comparable efficiency in the forward and reverse directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matulef and Maduke, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leisle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Stefano et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that the entry and exit of the protonated Glu<sub>ex</sub> from the Cl<sup>-</sup> pathway are equally favorable. Another free-energy calculation study shows that the reaction rates of deprotonation of Glu<sup>0</sup><sub>ex</sub> in both directions of the H<sup>+</sup> pathway are comparable to each other, while both reactions are coupled to Cl<sup>-</sup> at S<sub>cen</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Further, the mechanisms regulating the release of ions from S<sub>ext</sub> and S<sub>cen</sub> and their coupling to the movement of Glu<sub>ex</sub> and of H<sup>+</sup> through the protein are unknown. While biochemical evidence suggests that ion release is rate-limited by a conformational step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Picollo et al., 2009</xref>), no release mechanism has been identified. Therefore, two key mechanistic features at the heart of the H<sup>+</sup>:Cl<sup>-</sup> exchange mechanism of the CLCs, the pathways and the coupling mechanism of the substrates, remain unknown.</p><p>Here we combined molecular dynamics simulations with biochemical and electrophysiological measurements, and atomic mutagenesis to investigate the mechanism of H<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup> exchange. We find that, contrary to previously proposed models, a protonated Glu<sub>ex</sub> does not move through the Cl<sup>-</sup> pore. Rather, we identify two highly conserved phenylalanine residues that form an aromatic slide which allows the protonated (neutral) Glu<sub>ex</sub> to move to and from S<sub>cen</sub> without directly competing with Cl<sup>-</sup> ions for passage through the anion-selective pathway. Further, we show that the rotational movement of the central phenylalanine residue, that enables the formation of the aromatic slide, is an important regulator of ion movement within the pathway, providing the molecular mechanism for the coupled exchange of H<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> by the CLC transporters. Mutating these residues in prokaryotic and mammalian CLC exchangers severely impairs transport indicating that the role of these aromatic side chains is evolutionarily conserved. Since these phenylalanine residues are highly conserved throughout the CLC family, we hypothesized the role of the aromatic slide might be evolutionary conserved also between CLC channels and exchangers. Indeed, we found that they play important roles in the gating of the prototypical CLC-0 channel. Using atomic-scale mutagenesis, we probed how the aromatic slide residues interact with Glu<sub>ex</sub> in CLC-0, and found that the central phenylalanine interacts electrostatically with the gating glutamate, and that its conformational rotation is necessary for channel gating. We propose a novel mechanism for CLC mediated H<sup>+</sup>:Cl<sup>-</sup> exchange, where the Cl<sup>-</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> pathways are distinct and intersect only near the central ion binding site.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Molecular dynamic simulations suggest F357 controls entry and release of Cl<sup>-</sup> from S<sub>cen</sub></title><p>We used molecular dynamics simulations to probe the energetic landscape of ion movement through the permeation pathway of CLC-ec1 to ask whether it is regulated by conformational rearrangements of the pore. The first state we considered is one with Glu<sub>ex</sub> protonated and out of the pathway, an E148Q-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dutzler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), so that all binding sites are accessible to ions.

Unexpectedly, our calculations suggest that simultaneous binding of Cl<sup>-</sup> to S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>ext</sub> does not correspond to a local free energy minimum, i.e. to a (meta-)stable state. The doubly occupied state, identified by an asterisk on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, is unfavorable by 4 to 6 kCal mol<sup>−1</sup> in comparison to the binding of a single ion to S<sub>ext</sub> or to the doubly occupied configuration with ions in S<sub>int</sub> and S<sub>ext</sub>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Energetic landscapes of ion movement through the permeation pathway of CLC-ec1 reveal two rotameric states of F357 that correlate with ion occupancy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The PMF calculation describes the energetics of two Cl<sup>-</sup> along the permeation pathway, with the protonated Glu<sup>0</sup><sub>ex</sub> positioned on the extracellular side of the pore (E148Q-like conformation). For both ions, the reaction coordinate consists in the position along the Z-axis (Z1, Z2). The position of the different binding sites along the Z-axis is indicated.

Circles represent Cl<sup>-</sup> ions identified with numbers (1, 2) that correspond to the axis labels (Z1, Z2) of the PMF plots; the labels at the top (i, ii) refer to the transitions indicated in panel A. The doubly occupied state S<sub>cen</sub>/S<sub>ext</sub> (*) is essential for ion transport but is not observed as a stable state in the PMF calculation of panel A.

Analyzing the conformational sampling underlying the PMF calculations, we noted that simultaneous occupancy of S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>ext</sub> correlated with fluctuations of the rotameric state of F357 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). This residue forms part of the Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation pathway of the CLC channels and transporters by coordinating ions in S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>ext</sub> with its backbone amide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Park et al., 2017</xref>). In our simulations, we find that the F357 side chain exists in equilibrium between two rotameric states with χ1 angles of −160° (‘up’), as seen in the crystal structures of WT and mutant CLC-ec1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dutzler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dutzler et al., 2003</xref>), and of −70° (‘down’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To test whether this conformational rearrangement affects Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation, we restrained χ1 (F357) to the ‘up’ or ‘down’ rotamers and determined the energetic landscape of ion binding in these conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). We find that when F357 is in the ‘down’ state, a free energy barrier of ~12 kCal mol<sup>−1</sup> opposes ion movement within the pore, and the S<sub>cen</sub>/S<sub>ext</sub> double occupancy state remains unstable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, when F357 is constrained to the ‘up’ conformer, two Cl<sup>-</sup> ions can simultaneously bind to S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>ext</sub>, and the different stable states along the permeation pathways are separated by free energy barriers of ~2–4 kCal mol<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Reciprocally, the ion occupancy state directly impacts the conformation of F357: the ‘down’ state is favored when no ions occupy the pathway or when only S<sub>ext</sub> is occupied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>), ion occupancy of S<sub>cen</sub> or of S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>ext</sub> simultaneously favors the ‘up’ state of F357 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). This suggests that the F357 transition between the ‘up’ and ‘down’ rotamers is critical for allowing ion permeation. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether the dynamics of F357 are affected by the introduction of a crosslink between A399 and A432 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), which inhibits transport of CLC-ec1 by preventing a conformational rearrangement involved in coupling between the intra- and extra-cellular gates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basilio et al., 2014</xref>). We found that constraining the relative movements of A399 and A432 inhibits the transition of F357 between its rotamers by adding a free energy barrier of ~6 kCal mol<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that this transition is part of the transport cycle. Taken together, these results suggest that the rearrangement of F357 is a critical determinant of the energy barrier height for ion movement within the CLC pore: the ‘up’ conformer of F357 is compatible with ion transport while its ‘down’ conformer disfavors ion transitions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Rotation of F357 enables the formation of an aromatic slide</title><p>We next asked how Cl<sup>-</sup> and Glu<sub>ex</sub> interact along the transport cycle.

Interestingly, in the case of the protonated Glu<sub>ex</sub>, a free energy well is also observed at the level of S<sub>cen</sub>, initially occupied by the carboxylate group of Glu<sup>0</sup><sub>ex</sub>. Inspection of the sampled structures reveals that, when S<sub>ext</sub> is occupied by a Cl<sup>-</sup>, the Glu<sup>0</sup><sub>ex</sub> only partially occupies S<sub>cen</sub>. Its carboxylate group moves sideway toward F357 and away from the Cl<sup>-</sup> pathway. Two key conformations are observed. A first one in which a proton wire composed of two water molecules forms spontaneously between Glu<sup>0</sup><sub>ex</sub> (E148) and Glu<sub>in</sub> (E203) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), potentially allowing the deprotonation of Glu<sup>0</sup><sub>ex</sub>. In this conformation, the carboxylate group of Glu<sup>0</sup><sub>ex</sub> also forms a hydrogen bond with Y445. A second conformation reveals the possibility for Glu<sup>0</sup><sub>ex</sub> to form a π-dipole interaction with the aromatic ring of F357 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The displacement of Glu<sup>0</sup><sub>ex</sub> toward F357 allows the bound Cl<sup>-</sup> to reach S<sub>cen</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The upward movement of F357 would bring the carboxylate group of Glu<sup>0</sup><sub>ex</sub> in the vicinity of F190. These calculations suggest that the conformational rearrangement of F357 enables the formation of an aromatic slide through which a protonated Glu<sup>0</sup><sub>ex</sub> can move to and from S<sub>cen</sub> without having to compete with the bound ions in the ion pathway.</p><p>It is important to note that in these calculations do not capture the full complexity of the energetic landscape of the interactions between ions in the CLC-ec1 pathway and F357, a task that would at minimum require a multidimensional PMF calculation involving at least three reaction coordinates: the position of the two Cl<sup>-</sup> ions and χ1(F357) angle. Additional reaction coordinates would likely be required such as the conformation and protonation state of E148, which interacts with both the ions and aromatic ring of F357, or that of conformational rearrangements taking place in CLC-ec1 during transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chavan et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, our calculations focus on the two key degrees of freedom of the system: (1) how the conformation of F357 affects ion occupancy of the CLC-ec1 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and (2) how ion occupancy influences the rotameric arrangement of F357 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, while both conformers of F357 are accessible on the time scale of the simulation, χ1(F357) is a slow degree of freedom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), so that that the transition along this degree of freedom is not fast enough to be thoroughly sampled in absence of a biasing potential, especially when ions enter or exit the S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>ext</sub> binding sites. Thus, special care must be taken in interpreting the sampling of the conformations of F357 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p><p>While our finding that an inhibitory crosslink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basilio et al., 2014</xref>) prevents the rearrangement of F357 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), provides an initial validation of the mechanistic inferences of our MD simulations, the hypothesis that F190 and F357 play a critical role in determining Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> coupling and control a rate-limiting barrier for ion transport in CLC-ec1 requires experimental probing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The aromatic slide residues are essential for Cl<sup>-</sup>:H<sup>+</sup> coupling and exchange in CLC-ec1</title><p>To test these hypotheses, we mutated them to alanine and determined the unitary transport rate and stoichiometry of the Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange cycle. Both mutations slow the turnover rate and degrade the exchange stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The F190A mutant slows transport ~4 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), while it severely impairs the transport stoichiometry to ~8.6:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The F357A mutant reduces the transport rate ~9 fold and alters the Cl<sup>-</sup>:H<sup>+</sup> stoichiometry to ~4.3:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As the F357 backbone lines S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>ext</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dutzler et al., 2002</xref>), we tested whether an alanine substitution affects the integrity of the binding sites in two ways. First, we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to measure Cl<sup>-</sup> binding to the F357A mutant and found that it has a WT-like affinity of ~0.7 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Second, we introduced the F357L substitution, which preserves side chain hydrophobicity and volume but removes the aromatic ring. We found that F357L affects the turnover rate and exchange stoichiometry like F357A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Thus, the effects of the F357A mutant reflect the absence of the aromatic side chain rather than a structural disruption of the ion pathway. Taken together our functional results are consistent with the insights from our MD simulations and indicate that F190 and F357 play a key role in coupling and transport of CLC-ec1 by modulating the movement of Glu<sub>ex</sub> in and out of the pathway. To test this conclusion, we reasoned that the F190A and F357A mutations should not impair transport when introduced on the background of the H<sup>+</sup>-uncoupled E148A mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Accardi and Miller, 2004</xref>). The E148A mutant alone reduces Cl<sup>-</sup> turnover ~3 fold compared to WT to ~974 ion s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Walden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The E148A/F357A mutant transports Cl<sup>-</sup> at a similar rate of the parent E148A construct,~582 ion s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Remarkably, the double E148A/F190A mutant ‘rescues’ the transport defect of the E148A parent single mutants and has a WT-like transport rate of 3,494 ions s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The non-additivity of the effects of the F357A and F190A mutations with that of the E148A mutant qualitatively supports the idea that these Phe residues may interact with Glu<sub>ex</sub> during transport. Notably, F190 and F357 are among the highest conserved residues throughout the CLC family, respectively at ~94% and~76% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that their functional role might be evolutionarily conserved.

These effects could reflect either a reduction in turnover, as caused in CLC-ec1 by the corresponding mutations, or a reduced plasma membrane expression of the mutant transporters. Both mutations also left-shifted the voltage dependence of CLC-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>); with the F301A mutant decreasing rectification so that measurable currents could be seen at negative potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The slow activation kinetics of WT CLC-7 prevent a precise determination of its V<sub>0.5</sub>, an osteopetrosis-causing mutant with accelerated kinetics was used to estimate the V<sub>0.5</sub> of CLC-7 to around +80 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leisle et al., 2011</xref>).

The corresponding mutations in the ClC-5 exchanger, F255A (Phe<sub>ex</sub>) and F455A (Phe<sub>cen</sub>), have qualitatively similar effects to those seen in CLC-7: the F255A mutant reduces voltage-dependent gating, resulting in measurable currents at negative voltages, and the activation threshold of the F455A mutant is left-shifted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Opening of CLC-0 channels is regulated by two processes: individual pores open and close independently in a process called single-pore gating and cooperatively during common-pore gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Accardi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jentsch and Pusch, 2018</xref>). Single-pore gating is thought to entail rearrangements of Glu<sub>ex</sub> similar to those underlying the exchange cycle of the transporters, while the mechanistic underpinnings of common-pore gating remain poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Accardi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jentsch and Pusch, 2018</xref>). In the CLC-0 channel, single-pore gating is activated by depolarizing voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,D</xref>), while common-pore gating is hyperpolarization activated and occurs on much slower time scales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,H</xref>). In the F214A and F418A mutants, the single-pore gate exhibits nearly voltage-independent open probabilities over the voltage range tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>), suggesting that these mutations favor the open conformation of Glu<sub>ex</sub> (E166 in CLC-0). The voltage dependence of the common-pore gate is also affected in these mutants, as the minimal open probability increases, the gating charge decreases and V<sub>0.5</sub> shifts to more positive values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–H</xref>). These results suggest that Phe<sub>ex</sub> and Phe<sub>cen</sub> are shared determinants of the voltage dependence of the common- and single-pore gating processes of CLC-0. These findings are consistent with the results of the MD simulations on the CLC-ec1 exchanger that the carboxyl group of Glu<sup>0</sup><sub>ex</sub> interacts with the aromatic-slide residues to enter the pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Lastly, we note that the qualitative effects of the Phe<sub>ex</sub> mutants are conserved between CLC-7, CLC-5 and CLC-0, as in all three homologues the voltage dependence of the currents at negative voltages is drastically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref>).

In the available structures of CLC channels and exchangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dutzler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dutzler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accardi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Accardi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lobet and Dutzler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jayaram et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basilio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Park et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Last et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), Phe<sub>cen</sub> is in the ‘up’ rotamer suggesting this conformation is likely the most stable. However, our combined simulation and functional data suggest that Phe<sub>cen</sub> can adopt two distinct rotamers around its χ1 angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and that this rearrangement determines the energy barrier for Cl<sup>-</sup> movement within the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) and enables Glu<sup>0</sup><sub>ex</sub> to reach or leave S<sub>cen</sub> via the aromatic slide pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Further, we show that the aromatic slide residues play an evolutionarily conserved key role in the CLC exchange cycle and in CLC channel gating. Our conventional mutagenesis underscores the conserved importance of Phe<sub>cen</sub> and Phe<sub>ex</sub> in transporter and channel gating: alanine substitutions at these positions impair the absolute transport rate, the voltage dependence and the exchange stoichiometry of the transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), and nearly abolish the voltage dependence of channel gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We used atomic scale mutagenesis to test the prediction of our MD simulations that formation of the aromatic slide entails a rotation of the side chain of Phe<sub>cen</sub> around its C<sub>α</sub>-C<sub>β</sub> bond. When we replace Phe<sub>cen</sub> with 2,6diMet-Phe, a Phe derivative that specifically constrains this rotational rearrangement, we find that opening of the single- and common-pore gates in the CLC-0 channel is impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, the aromatic slide forms an evolutionarily conserved structural motif that might enable movement of a protonated Glu<sup>0</sup><sub>ex</sub> in and out of the pathway in both CLC channels and transporters, consistent with the finding that some CLC channels mediate some residual H<sup>+</sup> transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Picollo and Pusch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lísal and Maduke, 2008</xref>). The low functional expression of the CLC-5 and −7 transporters encoding the non-canonical amino acid prevented a similar test in these homologues. Moreover, for CLC-ec1, the technology for incorporation of these particular unnatural amino acids is currently not available for prokaryotic expression systems.</p><p>Our results also suggest that Phe<sub>ex</sub> and Phe<sub>cen</sub> interact differently with Glu<sub>ex</sub>. The aromatic ring of Phe<sub>ex</sub> appears to play a structural role in helping position Glu<sub>ex</sub> where it can interact with Phe<sub>cen</sub> in the ‘up’ conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Indeed, removal of the aromatic ring of Phe<sub>ex</sub> severely affects voltage dependent gating of CLC channels and transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), while selective manipulations of its electrostatic properties have only minor effects on channel gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,D</xref>), possibly because this residue lines a water-accessible extracellular vestibule in the CLCs. In contrast, the electrostatic properties of the aromatic ring of Phe<sub>cen</sub> are essential determinants for Glu<sub>ex</sub> movement in the CLC-0 channel: elimination of the π-electrons of Phe<sub>cen</sub> favors the closed state of the single-pore gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), while their re-localization to the proximal edge promotes opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These findings are consistent with the location of Phe<sub>cen</sub> within the core of the protein where changes in electrostatics are likely to have more impact, and with our MD simulations suggesting that Glu<sub>ex</sub> forms a π-dipole interaction with the aromatic ring of Phe<sub>cen</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Indeed, the interaction between the buried aromatic Phe<sub>cen</sub> and Glu<sub>ex</sub> could account for the observed shifts in the pKa of Glu<sub>ex</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Robinson et al., 2017</xref>) in CLC channels and transporters to keep Glu<sub>ex</sub> protonated during its transition through the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanke and Miller, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Niemeyer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Picollo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Picollo et al., 2012</xref>). Our results are in harmony with the recent proposal that Glu<sub>ex</sub> can adopt a conformation where it directly interacts with Phe<sub>cen</sub> in a fluoride selective CLC antiporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Last et al., 2018</xref>), in a mutant mimicking a fully-protonated CLC-ec1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chavan et al., 2019</xref>) and in the CLC-1 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A mechanism for Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange</title><p>Our finding that two Phe residues form an evolutionarily conserved secondary pathway that enables movement of the protonated Glu<sub>ex</sub> in and out of the ion transport pathway allows us to propose a 7-state mechanism for the CLC transporters that explains the stoichiometry of 2 Cl<sup>-</sup>:1 H<sup>+</sup>, is fully reversible, and accounts for previous results. Our findings provide structural and mechanistic grounds to explain how Glu<sub>ex</sub> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions can swap places in the CLC permeation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jentsch and Pusch, 2018</xref>). For simplicity of representation, we consider that an ion in the S<sub>ext</sub><sup>*</sup> site is out of the pathway and as such, in our scheme we do not show ions bound to this site. As a starting configuration, we consider a state where Glu<sub>ex</sub> and Glu<sub>in</sub> are de-protonated, Glu<sub>ex</sub> occupies S<sub>cen</sub>, Phe<sub>cen</sub> is in the ‘up’ position and no Cl<sup>-</sup> ions are bound to the pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, I). After a Cl<sup>-</sup> ion binds to S<sub>int</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, II), opening of the intracellular gate, formed by Ser<sub>cen</sub> and Tyr<sub>cen</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basilio et al., 2014</xref>), allows the ion to move into S<sub>cen</sub>, displacing Glu<sub>ex</sub> to S<sub>ext</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, III). Binding of a second ion to S<sub>ext</sub> favors protonation of Glu<sub>ex</sub>, and is accompanied by the displacement of Glu<sup>0</sup><sub>ex</sub> out of the pathway and closure of the internal gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, IV). The protonated Glu<sup>0</sup><sub>ex</sub> diffuses toward the aromatic slide and interacts with Phe<sub>ex</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, V). Movement of Glu<sup>0</sup><sub>ex</sub> along the aromatic slide allows the interdependent rearrangement of Phe<sub>cen</sub> to the ‘down’ state and release of a Cl<sup>-</sup> ion, i.e. release from S<sub>ext</sub> to the extracellular milieu and the transfer of the second ion from S<sub>cen</sub> to S<sub>ext</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, VI). This conformation, where Glu<sup>0</sup><sub>ex</sub> interacts with Phe<sub>cen</sub> on the side of the Cl<sup>-</sup> pathway and S<sub>ext</sub> is occupied, favors the formation of a water wire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, VI), which enables proton transfer from Glu<sup>0</sup><sub>ex</sub> to Glu<sub>in</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, VII). Deprotonation of Glu<sub>ex</sub> allows it to move into S<sub>cen</sub>, favoring the release of the second Cl<sup>-</sup> from S<sub>ext</sub> to the outside, and of the proton from Glu<sup>0</sup><sub>in</sub> to the intracellular solution, returning to the starting configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, I). We note that the Cl<sup>-</sup> binding affinity to S<sub>int</sub> is low as there is no free energy barrier preventing the release of the ion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Accardi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lobet and Dutzler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Picollo et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, when the transporter is in states IV through VII it is likely that Cl<sup>-</sup> ions will bind to and unbind from S<sub>int</sub>. However, as long as the intracellular gate remains closed these events would not participate in the permeation process. Thus, for simplicity we have omitted them from the gating scheme. In sum, we propose that the Cl<sup>-</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> ions bypass each other while moving in opposite directions through a CLC transporter by taking physically distinct routes: the Cl<sup>-</sup> ions move through the anion selective pore while the H<sup>+</sup> moves along a pathway comprised of a water-wire and the aromatic slide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The distinct routes for Cl<sup>-</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> allow for a complete reversibility of the cycle.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanism for the 2 Cl<sup>-</sup>: 1 H<sup>+</sup> CLC exchangers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the 2 Cl<sup>-</sup>: 1 H<sup>+</sup> CLC exchange cycle.

We propose that the aromatic slide in CLC-0 could provide a conserved pathway that enables the residual H<sup>+</sup> transport associated with the common-pore gating process of the CLC-0 channel to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lísal and Maduke, 2008</xref>). Indeed, the role of Phe<sub>cen</sub> in CLC function is also supported by the finding that mutations at this position severely affect CLC-1 channel gating and conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Estévez et al., 2003</xref>) and cause dominant myotonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Imbrici et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, our proposed exchange mechanism for the CLC transporters also captures the key rearrangements that underlie gating of the CLC channels. In this framework, rapid ion conduction would be enabled by the disruption of the intracellular gate, a hypothesis justified by the widened intracellular vestibule seen in the recent structures of the bCLC-K and hCLC-1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Park et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular system</title><p>The molecular systems, based on the CLC-ec1 crystal structure (PDB: 1OTS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dutzler et al., 2003</xref>), were assembled using the CHARMM-GUI web service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jo et al., 2008</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Leon D Islas as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Pusch (Reviewer #2); Merritt Maduke (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. A fourth expert on MD simulations was also consulted.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by the Accardi group proposes a new molecular mechanism to explain chloride and proton transport in CLC-class transporters and channels.</p><p>Using a combination of molecular dynamics, electrophysiology and non-canonical aminoacid substitutions, the authors find two phenylalanine residues that facilitate the movement of a protonated external glutamate involved both in gating and chloride permeation. This conformational change is different from the previously proposed one where the external glutamate occupies a chloride binding site and competes with the ion. This is an original and exciting paper and it constitutes an important contribution to understanding CLC channels/transporters.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In Figure 2—figure supplement 1F, the authors report PMF calculations that show that the preferred state of Phe357 for the Scen-Sext configuration is the 'up' rotamer. This is the rotamer observed in multiple crystal structures, e.g. ion-bound WT, E148Q, E148A EcCLC, WT apo EcCLC and WT CmCLC. Accordingly, one can see in Figure 2—figure supplement 1AB that the umbrella-sampling simulations that underlie the PMF in Figure 2A probe this 'up' rotamer when Z1 ~ 0 and Z2 ~ 5 A, i.e. the Scen-Sext configuration.</p><p>The reason why the Scen-Sext configuration is not a metastable state in the PMF in Figure 2A cannot be, therefore, that Phe357 is in the 'wrong' rotamer; to the contrary, the PMF in Figure 2A samples the 'correct' rotamer for Scen-Sext, according to the data provided in Figure 2—figure supplement 1AB. The reason must be instead that other configurations, and in particular those with Z1 &lt; 0 and Phe357 'down', are more favored energetically when examined in simulation. Consistent with this, when Phe357 is artificially fixed in place in the 'up' rotamer (Figure 2D), the states with Z1 &lt; 0 are strongly penalized.</p><p>It would seem that the central and clear prediction from this simulation data is that Scen-Sext with Phe357 up is an energy barrier for the mechanism of ion motion through EcClC, at 4-6 kcal/mol, and is strongly disfavored relative to e.g. Sint-Sext with Phe357 down (Figure 2-figure supplement 1B). Yet, the latter state is not included in the mechanistic diagram shown in Figure 8, which instead depicts the former as an intermediate (states V and VI), despite the PMF in Figure 2A. This is not internally consistent. More importantly, isn't this result/prediction counter to the E148Q structure (Phe357 up) and the analysis of relative ion occupancies therein (as well as in WT and E148A) by Lobet and Dutzler 2005? Also, isn't it at odds with the interpretation of the ITC experiments in Picollo et al., 2012 (&quot;Our data suggest that protonation of Glu148 is unfavorable with no ions in the transport pathway, that protonation of the gating glutamate is favored by binding of a Cl− ion to Scen and is greatly stabilized by a second Cl− in Sex&quot;). The authors should clarify if Scen-Sext with Phe357 up is a true free-energy minimum. The PMF in Figure 2A shows that Sint-Scen is not a metastable state either. Like Scen-Sext, it falls in the 4-6 kcal range, and is in a downhill gradient in free energy, which seems to suggest the ion in Sint isn't stable. This could be explained by the lower affinity of this site, but at 150 mM KCl, the simulation is well above saturating conditions.</p><p>A PMF calculation analogous to Figure 2A for E148Q with ions occupying Sext and Scen would help to alleviate these concerns – assuming it shows that the experimentally determined structure is a stable configuration.</p><p>2) The authors should provide an explanation of what factors cause Phe357 to favor a different rotamer when the ion configuration changes from Scen-Sext to Sint-Sext (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B) and from Scen-Sext to Sext only (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D), but somehow not from Scen-Sext to Scen only (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E). It is difficult to envisage how the sidechain of Phe357, which projects away from the chloride pathway and does not directly interact with the ions, nevertheless responds to the occupancy of the binding sites. Is this due to changes in the conformation of the structure?</p><p>3) What ion configuration was equilibrated for 100 ns before the PMF in Figure 2A was calculated? Were other starting conditions tested? How were the PMF calculations shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-F initiated?</p><p>4) In regard to the proposed dipole-pi interaction between protonated Glu148 and the aromatic rings of Phe190 and Phe357: what is the magnitude of this interaction, as represented by the simulation forcefield, compared with e.g. a hydrogen-bond, all other factors being equal? Are the snapshots in Figure 3 anecdotal observations, or do they reflect statistically representative states? If the latter, how were they selected?</p><p>5) Mutants of Fext in CLC-5 (F255A) and CLC-7 (F301A) show rather voltage-independent currents, including steady state inward currents. There is a suspicion that they may be contaminated significantly by endogenous leak currents. Therefore, the authors have to provide positive evidence that these (inward) currents are real. Otherwise these data should be removed.</p><p>6) The fact that Gluex in CLC-1 structures seems to be in a position out of the Cl permeation pathway could be due to radiation damage in cryoEM data acquisition, to which glutamate residues are particularly sensitive. This should be discussed.</p><p>7) In a paper from 2003 (in which one of the lead authors of this manuscript is a co-author as well), Fcen of CLC-1 has been quite extensively characterized. For example, in addition to dramatic effects on gating, the F484A mutant showed a reduced single channel conductance. Also, in more recent papers from the Desaphy group, mutants of Fcen that cause myotonia have been characterized. This work should be discussed.</p><p>8) In the same 2003 paper (Estevez et al., 2003), Fcen was proposed to be part of an inhibitor binding site. This, together with recent structural data on the CLC-1 channel, should be discussed (e.g. could binding of these inhibitors impede the movement of Gluex?).</p><p>9) The outward movement of the protonated Gluex without interference somehow reminds me of a kinetic mechanism proposed for CLC antiporters (Jentsch and Pusch, 2018), in which a hypothetical &quot;swap&quot; between protonated Gluex and a Cl ion was proposed. This might be discussed.</p><p>10) Regarding the Sext Cl site, the recent paper from Park et al., from the Lim group should be discussed.</p><p>11) The experimental tests of the role of F190 and F357 in the CLC mechanism are not convincing. In CLC-ec1, the authors show that mutations at these positions decrease turnover rates and increase Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> coupling stoichiometry. While this result can be called &quot;consistent&quot; with the MD simulations, it would also be consistent with any number of other mechanisms. Moreover, it is likely that mutating any other similarly conserved residue (for example F199) would cause similar changes in function. So, it is not clear that these results validate predictions of the MD simulations. Similarly, mutations on CLC-7 and CLC-0 could have many different interpretations. Unfortunately, it is not obvious what experimental tests could be done to specifically test predictions of the MD simulations. One experiment that would help would be to put F190 and F357 mutations into the CLC transporters in an uncoupled (E148A in CLC-ec1) background. Since the Phe residues are predicted to predominantly affect the H<sup>+</sup>-transport branch of the mechanism, they should have little or no effect (on Cl<sup>-</sup> transport) in such a background. Ideally, it would be best if the authors could think of additional specific tests of predictions. If that is not feasible, it is important to remove a lot of overstatements that have been made with respect to interpretations of the experimental results. For example, most of the effects of the mutants are not &quot;drastic&quot; or &quot;extreme&quot; but are actually rather modest effects on function and much smaller than effects of other known CLC mutations. Also, the concluding sentence (…&quot;our results show that the aromatic slide forms an evolutionarily conserved structural motif that is…&quot;) would need to be toned down.</p><p>12) The reduced current levels for the F301A and F514A mutants cannot be distinctly ascribed to the reduced transport rate observed in CLC-ec1. The effect of the mutant could also be a reduced expression level. The voltage-clamp experiments do not distinguish between these possibilities. The authors should provide evidence for similar expression levels or tone down this assertion.</p><p>13) The effects of the alanine substitutions in both external and central phenylalanines seem to be an enhancement of gating (current measurable at every voltage), without too drastic changes in voltage-dependence (z for WT and F514A is the same). Alternatively, could the inward current in the mutants be carried by protons? This would be a similar behavior to omega currents in the voltage sensor domain proteins. This distinction is important because the effects of atomic mutagenesis are divergent with those of alanine substitution. Substitutions of the central phenylalanine make gating more difficult, while alanine substitutions seem to enhance gating.</p><p>14) It would have been nice if non- canonical aminoacid incorporation experiments were carried out in the CLC-ec1 transporter, for which the MD simulations were performed. Is there a reason for this? Although it seems that the effects are conserved, it seems also that gating and permeation effects of mutagenesis are mixed in the CLC channels, while transport could be better characterized in CLC-ec1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51224.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In Figure 2—figure supplement 1F, the authors report PMF calculations that show that the preferred state of Phe357 for the Scen-Sext configuration is the 'up' rotamer.

First, we would like to emphasize that in our PMF calculation shown in Figure 2A, F357 visits both the down and up states. Thus, it is not in the “right” or “wrong” conformer, but samples both. This illustrates that both conformers of Phe357 are accessible on the time scale of the simulation. However, the plots of Figure 2—figure supplement 1AB reveal that χ1(F357) is a slow degree of freedom, i.e. that the transition along this reaction coordinate is not fast enough to be thoroughly sampled in absence of a biasing potential, especially when ions enter or exit the Scen and Sext binding sites. Thus, special care must be taken in interpreting the sampling of the conformations of F357. In theory, this could be investigated with an exhaustive PMF calculation that would involve three reaction coordinates: the position of the two Cl<sup>-</sup> ions and the χ1(F357) angle. However, such 3D PMF is computationally expensive, not strictly required and likely insufficient as other factors such as the influence of the protonation state of E148 on the interactions with the aromatic ring of F357 or that of conformational rearrangements (such as those recently reported by Chavan et al., 2019) would also need to be considered. Such an expansive set of additional calculations, while interesting, is beyond the scope of the present manuscript. The reason we believe the 3D calculation is not strictly required is that our present set of calculations identifies the 2 key degrees of freedom of the system: (1) how the conformation of F357 affects ion occupancy of the CLC pathway (Figure 2), and (2) how ion occupancy influences the rotameric arrangement of F357 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Additionally, we validate these inferences by showing that an inhibitory crosslink prevents the rearrangement of F357 (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). These 1D and 2D PMFs correspond to key degrees of freedom in the 3D PMF discussed above. This point is now discussed in subsection “Rotation of F357 enables the formation of an aromatic slide”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reason why the Scen-Sext configuration is not a metastable state in the PMF in Figure 2A cannot be, therefore, that Phe357 is in the 'wrong' rotamer; to the contrary, the PMF in Figure 2A samples the 'correct' rotamer for Scen-Sext, according to the data provided in Figure 2—figure supplement 1AB.

Figure 2C-D reveal that Phe357 ‘up’ stabilizes the 2-ion state S<sub>cen</sub>- S<sub>ext</sub> without excessively destabilizing other states like S<sub>cen</sub>-S<sub>ext</sub>* or S<sub>int</sub>-S<sub>ext</sub>, while Phe357 ‘down’ destabilizes the S<sub>cen</sub>-S<sub>ext</sub> configuration. The opposite effect of the ‘up’ and ‘down’ conformers on the ion occupancy state is central to the regulation of ion transport. In a transporter, at each cycle, the transition from the ‘up’ to the ‘down’ conformer would favor the release of the ions and the proton. The PMFs of Figure 2C-D are compatible with this view, although the ‘up’ conformer slightly destabilizes some ion configurations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would seem that the central and clear prediction from this simulation data is that Scen-Sext with Phe357 up is an energy barrier for the mechanism of ion motion through EcClC, at 4-6 kcal/mol, and is strongly disfavored relative to e.g. Sint-Sext with Phe357 down (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B).

This is not internally consistent.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. However, the binding affinity to S<sub>int</sub> is low as there is no free energy barrier preventing the release of the ion, which is in equilibrium between the binding site and the bulk solution. Accordingly, an ion could bind to S<sub>int</sub> from the intracellular milieu in states IV-V-VI-VII, but as long as the intracellular gate remains closed it would not participate in the permeation process. In the counterclockwise transition from state (VI) to (V), an ion enters from the extra-cellular side (not the internal side), and thus the ion S<sub>int</sub> would be released without ever reaching S<sub>cen</sub>. This is now discussed in subsection “Formation of an aromatic slide is essential to Glu<sub>ex</sub> movement”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More importantly, isn't this result/prediction counter to the E148Q structure (Phe357 up) and the analysis of relative ion occupancies therein (as well as in WT and E148A) by Lobet and Dutzler 2005?

Thus, our PMF calculations presented in Figure 2 are coherent with the analysis by Lobet and Duztler, 2005 and Picollo et al., 2012.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The PMF in Figure 2A shows that Sint-Scen is not a metastable state either. Like Scen-Sext, it falls in the 4-6 kcal range, and is in a downhill gradient in free energy which seems to suggest the ion in Sint isn't stable.

Indeed, at 250 mM Br<sup>-</sup> the anomalous electron density of the S<sub>int</sub> site is ~88% of that of S<sub>cen</sub>, suggesting that even at this very high concentration S<sub>int</sub> might not be fully saturated (Accardi et al., 2006). Thus, our results are consistent with the data in the literature. However, PMF calculations describe the energetics of interaction between the restrained ions and the protein, but not the equilibrium between ions in the bulk and those in the pore (there is no exchange between the two ensembles). The ion concentration in the PMF calculations is set so that the overall energetics is as close to experimental conditions as possible, though the PMF is mostly independent of the ion concentration. Addressing the question of the saturation of a binding site at a given concentration would require Brownian dynamics simulations on an energy surface represented by the PMF (e.g. Bernèche and Roux, 2003), which, while interesting, are outside the scope of our current work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A PMF calculation analogous to Figure 2A for E148Q with ions occupying Sext and Scen would help to alleviate these concerns – assuming it shows that the experimentally determined structure is a stable configuration.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the helpful suggestion. However, we note that the structure used for the PMF of Figure 2A is equivalent to that of the E148Q structure: the E148 side chain is protonated, and out of the pathway in a conformation modeled on that of the E148Q crystal structure. Starting the PMF calculation with ions in S<sub>cen</sub>-S<sub>ext</sub> with Phe357 in the ‘up’ state would show a more stable S<sub>cen</sub>-S<sub>ext</sub> configuration simply because the sampling of the Phe357 ‘up’ state would be increased. However, the calculation would not necessarily converge because, as discussed above, χ1(F357) fluctuates between two conformers. To avoid any uncertainty on the conformational sampling, the best approach is to control the χ1(F357) with a harmonic restraint, as presented in Figure 2B and 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should provide an explanation of what factors cause Phe357 to favor a different rotamer when the ion configuration changes from Scen-Sext to Sint-Sext (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B) and from Scen-Sext to Sext only (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D), but somehow not from Scen-Sext to Scen only (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E). It is difficult to envisage how the sidechain of Phe357, which projects away from the chloride pathway and does not directly interact with the ions, nevertheless responds to the occupancy of the binding sites. Is this due to changes in the conformation of the structure?</p></disp-quote><p>The key element is whether Scen is occupied by an ion or not: When only one ion is present in either S<sub>cen</sub> or S<sub>ext</sub>, the backbone NH group of Phe357 reorient itself to interact with that ion. When both S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>ext</sub> are occupied, the NH group of Phe357 interacts mostly with the ion in S<sub>cen</sub>. The same applied to the neighboring Ile356 residue. Thus, the ion occupancy state of S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>ext</sub> impacts on the backbone conformation of residues Ile356 and Phe357, which at its turn modifies the free energy landscape of the F357 side chain. This is now discussed in the legend to Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What ion configuration was equilibrated for 100 ns before the PMF in Figure 2A was calculated? Were other starting conditions tested? How were the PMF calculations shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-F initiated?</p></disp-quote><p>The starting configuration for the PMF of Figure 2A involves ions in sites S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>ext</sub>. Other starting conditions were tested but typically led to bigger hysteresis (free energy difference between the S<sub>int</sub>/S<sub>ext</sub> and S<sub>ext</sub>/S<sub>ext</sub><sup>*</sup> states). The PMF of Figure 2—figure supplement 1 were initiated with ions at positions specified in the different panels and with the F357 side chain in the down state (-70º). We have repeated the calculations starting in the up state (-160º), which led qualitatively to the same results. We have replotted the PMF showing both calculations. This is now detailed in the legend to Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In regard to the proposed dipole-pi interaction between protonated Glu148 and the aromatic rings of Phe190 and Phe357: what is the magnitude of this interaction, as represented by the simulation forcefield, compared with e.g. a hydrogen-bond, all other factors being equal?</p></disp-quote><p>Using the charmm36 force field, we calculated that the interaction between a protonated glutamate side chain and the aromatic ring of a phenylalanine is -5.0 kcal/mol (for an optimized conformation in vacuum). For comparison, the interaction between a protonated glutamate and a serine side chain is -5.8 and -7.2 kcal/mol, depending if the unprotonated or the protonated oxygen of the carboxylate group is involved. These number are in line with ab initio calculations by Du et al., (2013), who reported interactions on the order of -2.4 to -7.1 kcal/mol. This is now added to the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are the snapshots in Figure 3 anecdotal observations, or do they reflect statistically representative states? If the latter, how were they selected?</p></disp-quote><p>The snapshots of Figure 3 appear spontaneously in PMF calculations for which the positions of ions were controlled. The illustrated side chain and water wire conformations are observed in at least 3 sampling windows and remain stable for most of the 500 ps sampling time of a given window. This is now mentioned in the legend to Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Mutants of Fext in CLC-5 (F255A) and CLC-7 (F301A) show rather voltage-independent currents, including steady state inward currents. There is a suspicion that they may be contaminated significantly by endogenous leak currents. Therefore, the authors have to provide positive evidence that these (inward) currents are real. Otherwise these data should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important concern. Several lines of evidence suggest that the observed currents are indeed mediated by the expressed mutant proteins:</p><p>i) In oocytes batches where we expressed WT and mutant CLC-5 and CLC-7 constructs, no significant inward currents could be detected in oocytes injected with the WT constructs. As an example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A-B</xref> shows average I-V relationships from multiple oocytes from independent batches for CLC-7 WT and F301A and from 1 batch for CLC-5 WT and F255A.</p><p>ii) If the currents measured in oocytes expressing CLC-7 F301A and CLC-5 F255A were contaminated by linear leak currents, then we would expect that (i) the shape of the I-V for these mutants should be more variable than that of the WT counterpart, and (ii) the rectification index R=I(+80mV)/I(-80mV) should vary in these mutants as a function of the total current. Neither is the case. Figure 5E, Figure 5—figure supplement 2D show that the errors in the normalized I-V relationships for the WT and mutant CLC-7 and CLC-5 constructs are comparable. Further, there is no clear correlation between the rectification index R and the value of the current measured at -80 mV, which is where the leak should be most significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1C-D</xref>).</p><p>iii) We measured how CLC-7 F301A depends on [Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> and [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>. We reasoned that if the effects of the F301A mutation in CLC-7 mirrored those seen in CLC-ec1 then we would expect that the V<sub>rev</sub> of the currents should depend on Cl<sup>-</sup>, and only minimally on H<sup>+</sup>, due to the degraded exchange stoichiometry. This is indeed the case: when [Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> is reduced from ~103 mM to ~17 mM we observe a reduction of the current at positive voltages, an increase of the current at negative voltages and a right shift of V<sub>rev</sub>, consistent with the idea that Cl<sup>-</sup> is the main charge carrier of the observed currents. Conversely, a 10-fold decrease in [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> elicits only a ~5-10 mV left-shift of V<sub>rev</sub> of the CLC-7 F301A currents and a ~10% increase in the steady state current at +90 mV (as opposed to the ~30-40% increase in current seen in the WT protein). These findings are consistent with the idea that this mutant degrades H<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup> coupling. The inherent difficulties in controlling the intracellular [Cl<sup>-</sup>] and [H<sup>+</sup>] concentration in oocytes prevent us from precisely determining the exchange stoichiometry of the F301A mutant, but these results are in qualitative agreement with the effects seen with CLC-ec1 F190A. This additional data is now shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, B and discussed in subsection “The role of Pheex and Phecen is conserved in mammalian transporters” of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Lastly, we note that the effects of the Phe<sub>ex</sub> mutants are qualitatively conserved across CLC-7, CLC-5 and CLC-0, as in all three homologues the voltage dependence of the currents at negative voltages is drastically reduced (Figure 5B,E,F; Figure 5—figure supplement 2B,D; Figure 6B,D). This is now mentioned in subsection “Pheex and Phecen are important for CLC channel gating”.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Inward currents elicited by CLC-7 and CLC-5 Phe<sub>ex</sub> mutants are not due to conductances endogenous to the expression system.</title><p>Comparison of normalized I-V relationships of CLC-7 WT and F301A (A) as well as of CLC-5 WT and F255A (B) are shown for individual, independent batches of <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes.

However, in the CLC-1 map (EMD-7544) the density corresponding to E232 is well-defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>), so we feel confident in leaving our statement in without additional disclaimers.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Close up view of the density map (gray) in the CLC-1 pore allows placement of the E232 side chain (cyan, ball and stick).</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51224-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In a paper from 2003 (in which one of the lead authors of this manuscript is a co-author as well), Fcen of CLC-1 has been quite extensively characterized. For example, in addition to dramatic effects on gating, the F484A mutant showed a reduced single channel conductance. Also, in more recent papers from the Desaphy group, mutants of Fcen that cause myotonia have been characterized. This work should be discussed.</p><p>8) In the same 2003 paper (Estevez et al., 2003), Fcen was proposed to be part of an inhibitor binding site. This, together with recent structural data on the CLC-1 channel, should be discussed (e.g. could binding of these inhibitors impede the movement of Gluex?).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out.

In CLC-ec1, the authors show that mutations at these positions decrease turnover rates and increase Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> coupling stoichiometry. While this result can be called &quot;consistent&quot; with the MD simulations, it would also be consistent with any number of other mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the effects of each individual mutant by itself does not validate the predictions of the MD simulations. However, the results of multiple mutants across 4 different CLC proteins show comparable effects. Moreover, the incorporation of the rotationally restricted Phe derivative 2,6diMeth-Phe at Phe<sub>cen</sub> of CLC-0 impaired the opening of the single-pore gate (Figure 7C), providing a direct test of the MD predictions that the rotational movement of Phe<sub>cen</sub> facilitates the movement of Gluex in and out of the Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation pathway. This point is now clarified in subsection “Pheex and Phecen are important for CLC channel gating”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, it is likely that mutating any other similarly conserved residue (for example F199) would cause similar changes in function. So, it is not clear that these results validate predictions of the MD simulations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this point. We did test the effects of the F223A mutant of CLC-0, which corresponds to F199 in CLC-ec1. The single-pore gate G-V of the F223A mutant is slightly right-shifted compared to that of the WT channel, the Boltzmann function parameters are: V<sub>0.5</sub> = -47±3 mV, z = 0.7±0.03, <italic>P</italic><sub>min</sub> = 0.02±0.02 (data not shown). Thus, while Ala substitutions at Phe<sub>ex</sub> and Phe<sub>cen</sub> keep the fast gate open, the F223A mutation promotes pore closure, supporting the specificity of the effects of Phe<sub>ex</sub> and Phe<sub>cen</sub>. The F223A mutation has a drastic effect on the common pore gate, consistent with its location near the dimer interface. These results are beyond the scope of the present manuscript and thus we would prefer not to include them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, mutations on CLC-7 and CLC-0 could have many different interpretations. Unfortunately, it is not obvious what experimental tests could be done to specifically test predictions of the MD simulations. One experiment that would help would be to put F190 and F357 mutations into the CLC transporters in an uncoupled (E148A in CLC-ec1) background. Since the Phe residues are predicted to predominantly affect the H<sup>+</sup>-transport branch of the mechanism, they should have little or no effect (on Cl<sup>-</sup> transport) in such a background.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have now tested the effects of the F190 and F357 mutants in the background of the E148A mutant of CLC-ec1. As the reviewers predicted, the F357A/E148A mutant has the same Cl<sup>-</sup> transport rate as the single E148A mutant (Figure 4E-F). Remarkably, the double F190A/E148A mutant “rescues” the transport defect of the parent single mutants and has WT-like transport rates. The non-additivity of the effects of the F357A and F190A mutations with that of the E148A mutant qualitatively supports the idea that these residues interact during transport. This new data is now shown in Figure 4 and discussed in subsection “The aromatic slide residues are essential for Cl<sup>-</sup>:H<sup>+</sup> 216 coupling and exchange in CLC-ec1”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ideally, it would be best if the authors could think of additional specific tests of predictions. If that is not feasible, it is important to remove a lot of overstatements that have been made with respect to interpretations of the experimental results. For example, most of the effects of the mutants are not &quot;drastic&quot; or &quot;extreme&quot; but are actually rather modest effects on function and much smaller than effects of other known CLC mutations. Also, the concluding sentence (…&quot;our results show that the aromatic slide forms an evolutionarily conserved structural motif that is…&quot;) would need to be toned down.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that our results suggest that the aromatic slide plays a key role in transport, rather than demonstrate such a role. We have toned down our conclusions throughout the manuscript and provided additional experimental evidence supporting our mechanistic inferences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The reduced current levels for the F301A and F514A mutants cannot be distinctly ascribed to the reduced transport rate observed in CLC-ec1. The effect of the mutant could also be a reduced expression level. The voltage-clamp experiments do not distinguish between these possibilities. The authors should provide evidence for similar expression levels or tone down this assertion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. We have removed this statement from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The effects of the alanine substitutions in both external and central phenylalanines seem to be an enhancement of gating (current measurable at every voltage), without too drastic changes in voltage-dependence (z for WT and F514A is the same). Alternatively, could the inward current in the mutants be carried by protons? This would be a similar behavior to omega currents in the voltage sensor domain proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing up this interesting hypothesis. We now show that the F301A mutant impairs H<sup>+</sup> transport by CLC-7 and the majority of the current is carried by Cl<sup>-</sup> (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B), consistent with our results on CLC-ec1. The F514A mutant on the other hand has minimal inward current and therefore could not be tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This distinction is important because the effects of atomic mutagenesis are divergent with those of alanine substitution. Substitutions of the central phenylalanine make gating more difficult, while alanine substitutions seem to enhance gating.</p></disp-quote><p>We note that while two unnatural amino acid substitutions at Phe<sub>cen</sub> make channel opening more difficult by inducing a right shift in the G-V (Cha and 2,6diMeth-Phe) the third (2,6F<sub>2</sub>-Phe) induces a left shift in G-V and thus makes channel opening easier, in the same direction as the Ala substitution (Figure 7C). A similar pattern holds true for the effects of the substitutions on the common-pore gate (Figure 7E). Thus, we do not agree that there is a general divergence between the effects of the canonical and non-canonical substitutions. The differential effects of the ncAA substitutions on gating reflect the different nature of the introduced manipulations and highlight the ability of this approach to perturb specific interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) It would have been nice if non- canonical aminoacid incorporation experiments were carried out in the CLC-ec1 transporter, for which the MD simulations were performed. Is there a reason for this? Although it seems that the effects are conserved, it seems also that gating and permeation effects of mutagenesis are mixed in the CLC channels, while transport could be better characterized in CLC-ec1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this interesting suggestion. Unfortunately, there are no available tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetase pairs for prokaryotic expression systems that enable the specific incorporation of the Phe derivatives used here, thus preventing us from carrying out these experiments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
