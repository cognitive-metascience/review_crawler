involved in stability, transport and organization in the cell. The building blocks, the α- and β-tubulin heterodimers, form protofilaments that associate laterally into the hollow microtubule. Microtubule also exists as highly stable doublet microtubules in the cilia where stability is needed for ciliary beating and function. The doublet microtubule maintains its stability through interactions at its inner and outer junctions where its A- and B-tubules meet. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy, bioinformatics and mass spectrometry of the doublets of <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> and <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>, we identified two new inner junction proteins, FAP276 and FAP106, and an inner junction-associated protein, FAP126, thus presenting the complete answer to the inner junction identity and localization. Our structural study of the doublets shows that the inner junction serves as an interaction hub that involves tubulin post-translational modifications. These interactions contribute to the stability of the doublet and hence, normal ciliary motility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic></kwd><kwd>inner junction</kwd><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>doublet microtubule</kwd><kwd>acetylation</kwd><kwd>axoneme</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-156354</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bui</surname><given-names>Khanh Huy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2016-04954</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bui</surname><given-names>Khanh Huy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2018-04813</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vargas</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007631</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institute for Advanced Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Arzieli Global Scholar Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bui</surname><given-names>Khanh Huy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ichikawa</surname><given-names>Muneyoshi</given-names></name><name><surname>Kubo</surname><given-names>Shintaroh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation for Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Al Ghurair STEM program scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Khalifa</surname><given-names>Ahmad Abdelzaher Zaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>950-229792</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trempe</surname><given-names>Jean-François</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2017-04649</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bechstedt</surname><given-names>Susanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A structure of the ciliary inner junction at 3.6 Å resolution permits atomic modeling of six inner junction proteins and their interactions with acetylated lysine 40 loops of alpha tubulins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cilia and flagella are highly conserved organelles present in protists all the way to humans. They are commonly classified into two forms: motile and non-motile cilia. Motile cilia are responsible for mucus clearance in the airway, cerebrospinal fluid circulation and sperm motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Satir and Christensen, 2007</xref>). The non-motile cilia, namely primary cilia, function as the cellular antennas that sense chemical and mechanical changes. Cilia are essential for growth and development and therefore human health. Defects in cilia often result in abnormal motility or stability, which lead to cilia-related diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, retinal degeneration, hydrocephalus and polydactyly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hurd and Hildebrandt, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Both cilia types are comprised of a bundle of nine specialized microtubule structures termed doublet microtubules (doublets). Ciliary components, important for motility such as the outer and inner dynein arms, radial spokes and the dynein regulatory complex (DRC) are assembled onto the surface of the doublet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bui et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bui et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heuser et al., 2009</xref>). Inside the doublets, is a weaving network of proteins, termed microtubule-inner-proteins (MIPs), that bind to the inner lumen surface of the doublet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ichikawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ichikawa et al., 2019</xref>). These MIPs act to stabilize the doublet and possibly regulate the ciliary waveform through interactions with the tubulin lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ichikawa et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Doublets consist of a complete 13-protofilament (PF) A-tubule, similar to a 13-PF cytoplasmic microtubule and a partial 10-PF B-tubule forming on top of the A-tubule (naming of the PF number is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To this day there still exists a long-standing question of how the junctions between the two tubules are formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tilney et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Linck and Stephens, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nicastro et al., 2011</xref>). The recent high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the doublet shows that the outer junction is formed by a non-canonical tubulin interaction among PF B1, A10 and A11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ichikawa et al., 2017</xref>). The inner junction (IJ), which bridges the inner gap between the B-tubule and A-tubule is formed by non-tubulin proteins. Both primary and motile cilia have been observed to contain the IJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nicastro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sun et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The IJ structures of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> doublet.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Surface renderings and schematics of the 48 nm repeat cryo-EM maps of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<bold>A, B</bold>) and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> (<bold>C, D</bold>) doublets viewed from the tip of the cilia.

More recently, the B-tubule-like hook can be achieved by adding purified tubulins onto existing subtilisin-treated microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schmidt-Cernohorska et al., 2019</xref>). However, these hooks are not closed and appear to be flexible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schmidt-Cernohorska et al., 2019</xref>). This supports the notion that the IJ is composed of non-tubulin proteins that are indispensable to the stability of the IJ.</p><p>The IJ is composed of FAP20 as shown through cryo-electron tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yanagisawa et al., 2014</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dymek et al. (2019)</xref> reported that PArkin Co-Regulated Gene (PACRG) and FAP20 proteins form the IJ. PACRG and FAP20 are arranged in an alternating pattern to form the IJ linking the PF A1 of A-tubule and PF B10 of the B-tubule. In addition, both FAP20 and PACRG are important components for motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yanagisawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dymek et al., 2019</xref>). Both PACRG and FAP20 are conserved among organisms with cilia, suggesting a common IJ between species.</p><p>PACRG shares a bi-directional promoter with the Parkinson’s disease-related gene parkin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kitada et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">West et al., 2003</xref>). Knockdowns of PACRG genes in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> and <italic>Xenopus</italic>, lead to defects in the doublet structure and, therefore, impaired flagellar motility. In vertebrates, defects in left-right body symmetry and neural tube closure were observed from knockdowns of PACRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thumberger et al., 2012</xref>). In mice, PACRG knockout results in male sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lorenzetti et al., 2004</xref>) and hydrocephalus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilson et al., 2010</xref>). FAP20 knockout mutants in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> have motility defects and frequent splaying of the axoneme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yanagisawa et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, FAP20 knockdown in <italic>Paramecium</italic> has an altered waveform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laligné et al., 2010</xref>). A recent report identified other MIPs near the IJ, namely FAP52 and FAP45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Owa et al., 2019</xref>). Knockouts of FAP52 or FAP45 lead to an unstable B-tubule in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. Double knockouts of FAP52 or FAP45 together with FAP20 lead to severe damage of the B-tubule. The gene deletion of the human homolog of FAP52 has been shown to cause heterotaxy and <italic>situs inversus totalis</italic> in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ta-Shma et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Cryo-EM structures of isolated doublets from <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> show that there are different tethering densities that connect the B-tubule to the A-tubule aside from the IJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ichikawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ichikawa et al., 2019</xref>). However, the identity of such protein remains unknown to date. Taken together, these data suggest that there is a complex interaction at the IJ region involving multiple proteins in addition to PACRG, FAP20, FAP45 and FAP52. These interactions may play a role in regulating ciliary motility via stability.</p><p>Despite all the phenotypes known about these IJ proteins, there are not yet any high-resolution structures to explain the molecular mechanism of the B-tubule closure and the IJ stability. In this study, we present the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the IJ region from the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> doublet. Using a combination of bioinformatics and mass spectrometry, we were able to identify two new IJ proteins, FAP276 and FAP106, and a new IJ-associated MIP, FAP126.

Despite having a good resolution in the A-tubule, the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> doublet has a significantly lower resolution in the IJ area of the B-tubule.</p><p>Inside the B-tubule of both species, it is clear that the IJ region is held up by many tether densities along the doublet connecting the B-tubule to PF A13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>). First, the B-tubule is held up by Tether density 1 (red, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), referred to as MIP3b previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ichikawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ichikawa et al., 2019</xref>). Tether density 1 connects the PF B9/B10 and A13. The second connection is named Tether density 2 (red, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>), projecting from the proximal lobe of the FAP52 density (referred to as MIP3a previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ichikawa et al., 2017</xref>) and connecting to PF A13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, there is another Y-shaped density (purple) cradling the FAP52 proximal lobe and projecting into the gap between the IJ PF and PF B10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>FAP45 is referred to as MIP3c previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Owa et al., 2019</xref>).

In both species, the L-shaped FAP45 contacts FAP52 once every 48 nm.

All the tether densities described above repeat with 16 nm.</p><p>The IJ PF is formed by a pair of PACRG and FAP20 repeating every 8 nm with the same repeating unit as tubulin dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This is to be expected as the purpose of the IJ PF is to bridge the tubulin dimers from PFs B10 and A1. In the 48 nm <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> doublet map, there is one PACRG unit with a less defined density compared to the others (dashed box, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Since our doublet map is a 48 nm repeat unit, the less defined density of PACRG corresponds to the average from one unit of PACRG and one missing unit, that is half the signal. This missing unit of PACRG in the 96 nm repeat allows the basal region of the DRC to anchor onto the doublet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heuser et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>).</p><p>The entire IJ filament of PACRG and FAP20 is previously reported missing in the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> structure, probably due to salt wash and dialysis treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ichikawa et al., 2019</xref>).

FAP276 itself forms different contacts with tubulin with both of its N- and C-termini, thus it provides strong anchorage for FAP52 to the tubulin lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, the IJ complex is made up of two copies of PACRG and FAP20, one copy of FAP52 and FAP276 and one copy of Tether density 1 and 2 per 16 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This represents a high stoichiometry compared to other proteins in the axoneme such as CCDC39 and CCDC40, which have only one copy per 96 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oda et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>PACRG has an alpha solenoid architecture coupled with a long unstructured N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The alpha solenoid architecture is also contained in the microtubule binding TOG domain, which is present in many microtubule polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brouhard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leano and Slep, 2019</xref>). However, the binding orientation of PACRG to the surface of tubulin is completely different from that of the TOG domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leano and Slep, 2019</xref>). FAP20 has a beta jelly roll architecture, which consists of mainly β-sheets with a small α-helix. The C-terminus of FAP20 is located at the outside of the doublet, in agreement with a tomographic study of FAP20 <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> mutant with a Biotin Carboxyl Carrier Protein tag at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yanagisawa et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>PACRG and FAP20 have two potential microtubule-binding sites, one on the surface of the A-tubule and the other on the lateral side of the B-tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). The lateral binding site is unique and has never been observed in previously known microtubule-associated proteins. PACRG binds to the inter-dimer interface of PF B10 in the region of MEIG1 binding loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khan et al., 2019</xref>). In this loop, H136 from PACRG is conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khan et al., 2019</xref>) and likely interacts with D127 and C129 of α-tubulin from PF B10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). FAP20 is sandwiched by the tubulin dimer from PF B10 and the α-tubulin from PF A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>).</p><p>The interactions of PACRG and FAP20 with tubulin from PF A1 appear to be electrostatic. The outside surfaces of α- and β-tubulins are highly negatively charged while the corresponding interacting surfaces of PACRG and FAP20 are positively charged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the interactions highlighted above, we also observed the possible interaction of the β-tubulin C-terminus from PF A1 with PACRG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,H</xref>). The C-termini of α- and β-tubulins are a hot spot for post-translational modifications such as polyglutamylation and polyglycylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wloga et al., 2017</xref>). However, due to its flexibility, densities for the α- and β-tubulin C-termini are usually not visible in cryo-EM reconstructions of the microtubules. This is also the case for the outside of the A- and B-tubules in our ex vivo structure. However, in the lumen of the B-tubule, the β-tubulin C-terminus from PF A1 appears to be stabilized by contacts with PACRG and FAP20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). These contacts stabilize the β-tubulin C-terminus forming a helical turn in segment E432-F436, which otherwise would not be present due to its flexibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p>The structure of the β-tubulin C-terminus in PF A1 appears to be the result of the steric proximity with the N-terminus of PACRG. This interaction is important in maintaining the stability of the IJ by preventing steric clashing between the two. It could also be an indication of further post-translational modifications that occur in this region, which could have a potential role in IJ formation and stability.</p><p>In our structure, we also observe that the distance between FAP20 and the proximal PACRG is closer compared to the distal PACRG, thus PACRG and FAP20 likely form a heterodimer in the axoneme instead of a continuous filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), except for one missing PACRG unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>).

Residue K229 of FAP52 is within favorable distance to form hydrogen bonds with the backbone of D39 and T41 of α-tubulin from PF B10. It is also possible that there is a hydrophobic interaction between L226 and I42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Residue R225 of FAP52 and D39 of α-tubulin are in an environment where they could interact; however, the side chain densities for both residues are not well-resolved. At the second tubulin contact point, FAP52 segment G142-P144 is in the close proximity of the α-K40 loop from PF B9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In the lower region of FAP52, the loop V268-L279 is in close proximity with the N-terminus of PACRG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The density of the aforementioned loop is not present in the FAP52 structure in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> doublet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

The interaction of this loop with <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> PACRG suggests that it is a <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>-specific feature that contributes to additional stabilization of PACRG and, hence the IJ PF.</p><p>We then investigated the α-K40 loops from <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> doublets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>). When there is no interacting protein, this loop is flexible consistent with previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eshun-Wilson et al., 2019</xref>). Despite having low resolution in the B-tubule in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, we still observed the α-K40 loop of PF B9 and B10 interacts with FAP52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

The conformation of the α-K40 loop appeared to be different depending on its corresponding partner. This suggests that the α-K40 loop might have a role in MIP recognition and binding. Given the numerous interactions of FAP52 with all the proteins in the IJ, FAP52 is likely to function as an interaction hub, which could play an important role during IJ assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>FAP106 is the Tether loop, consisting of Tether densities 1 and 2</title><p>We were able to trace the Tether density in the 16 nm averaged map.

We identified two new members of the IJ, FAP106 and FAP276. FAP276, a <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>-specific protein, anchors and mediates FAP52’s binding onto tubulins from PF B9 and B10. FAP106 tethers the B-tubule to the A-tubule, through its interactions with the PF A12 and A13, FAP52 and FAP276, while the IJ PF, composed of PACRG and FAP20, closes the IJ gap. For the doublet to withstand the mechanical strain during ciliary beating, it needs proper structural supports.

However, no filamentous density corresponding to tektin was found at the IJ PF in our <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> map.

One hypothesis is that FAP52, FAP276 and FAP106 would bind onto PF A12 and A13. FAP45 and other fMIP proteins would then be incorporated inside the B-tubule, which fixes the proper curvature so that PF B9 and B10 can interact with other IJ proteins.

Therefore, the IJ PF is necessary to dock the B-tubule onto the A-tubule. In our <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> doublet, in which most of the IJ PF was washed away, even with the presence of FAP52 and FAP106, the doublet is still flexible which can be seen by the lower resolution of the B-tubule compared to the A-tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In addition, the B-tubule can be subjected to depolymerization when the IJ PF is not fully formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Owa et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the IJ PF serves as an anchor, which might protect the B-tubule from depolymerization by shielding the lateral side of PF B10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Because of the complexity of interactions and the diverse protein composition of the IJ complex, it is reasonable to assume that the IJ is assembled after the outer junction nucleates and expands toward the IJ. The IJ complex might be assembled or co-assembled at the same time as PF B10 for the closure of the B-tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>During doublet assembly, the unorderly binding of PACRG and FAP20 to any of the PFs in the B-tubule lateral interfaces would lead to an incomplete B-tubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khan et al., 2019</xref>). To ensure a successful IJ assembly, chaperones might be needed for the transport of PACRG and FAP20. PACRG forms a complex with MEIG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khan et al., 2019</xref>). Even though MEIG1 is not present in lower eukaryotes and the MEIG1 binding loop is not conserved between <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and humans, a chaperone similar to MEIG1 can function to target PACRG to the lateral interface of the PF B10. There is a possibility that PACRG and FAP20 form a heterodimer before their transport and assembly into the cilia. FAP20 shows a similar fold and mode of binding to a class of proteins called carbohydrate-binding modules. Carbohydrate-binding modules form a complex with carbohydrate-active enzymes and are known to have a substrate targeting and enzyme-concentrating function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hervé et al., 2010</xref>). This supports the role of FAP20 as an assembly chaperone in a FAP20-PACRG complex. Furthermore, both studies from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yanagisawa et al. (2014)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dymek et al. (2019)</xref> show reduced endogenous PACRG in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> FAP20 knockout mutant. In the latter study, it was shown that the assembly of exogenous PACRG was less efficient in the FAP20 knockout compared to conditions where FAP20 was intact. This implies that PACRG assembly might indeed depend on FAP20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yanagisawa et al., 2014</xref>). However, since the expression patterns of PACRG and FAP20 have surprisingly low correlation compared to the rest of the IJ proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and homolog of FAP20 exists in non-ciliated organisms such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, FAP20 might have an additional function outside the cilia.</p><p>Furthermore, our atomic models could explain the severe motility phenotypes observed in PACRG and FAP20 mutants compared to FAP52 mutant. Mutants in either PACRG or FAP20 might affect the stability of the DRC, which can severely affect the regulation of ciliary beating. This is supported by the fact that FAP20 mutant is prone to splaying of the cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yanagisawa et al., 2014</xref>). Our results could also explain how the double knockout of FAP20 along with FAP45 or FAP52 can affect B-tubule stability at the IJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Owa et al., 2019</xref>). In such conditions, both the IJ PF and the FAP52 or FAP52-mediated anchorage between the A- and B-tubules will be completely lost.</p><p>By comparing <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, we show that the conserved IJ components are PACRG, FAP20, FAP45, FAP52 and FAP106. There are also species-specific proteins such as FAP276 and FAP126 in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and Tether density 3 in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>. Tether density 3 clashes with a superimposed <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> FAP276 structure, suggesting that it takes over its role in mediating the interactions between FAP52 and tubulin in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>. This suggests that there is a common framework for the IJ complex in all species. Species-specific proteins may then fine-tune this framework according to the survival needs of the organisms.</p><p>In this study, we revealed that FAP106/ENKUR, an important protein for sperm motility, is a MIP and an IJ protein. Knockout of ENKUR leads to the asymmetric waveform of sperm flagella while mutations in ENKUR disturb the left-right symmetry axes in vertebrates. It is shown that ENKUR knockout shows a loss of Ca<sup>++</sup> responsiveness while wild-type sperm shows highly curved flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jungnickel et al., 2018</xref>). The IQ domain responsible for Ca<sup>++</sup> binding of ENKUR is not conserved in the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> sequence, although an alternative means of Ca<sup>++</sup> binding or inducing a Ca<sup>++</sup>-mediated response is still possible.</p><p>We also identified FAP126, an IJ-associated MIP. The homolog of FAP126 in human and mouse, the FLTOP protein, exists in the cilia and basal bodies and is thought to function in the positioning of the basal body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gegg et al., 2014</xref>). In Flattop knockout mice, cilia formation in the lung is significantly affected. In the inner ear, Flattop interacts with a protein called Dlg3 in the process of basal body positioning to the actin skeleton in the inner ear. Therefore, it is possible that FAP126 might perform both functions (i) as a MIP that stabilizes the basal body in the same fashion as shown here in the cilia and (ii) in basal body positioning and planar cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gegg et al., 2014</xref>). The high correlation of FAP126 and FAP106 co-expression, and also with FAP52 in different human tissue suggests they might function similarly or co-operatively in cilia assembly. <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, which lacks FAP126, probably implements an alternative mechanism to substitute for FAP126 functions.</p><p>Our study demonstrates that all the protein components associated with the IJ complex such as PACRG, FAP20, FAP52, FAP126 and FAP106 in the IJ complex is of high importance for the assembly and proper motility of the cilia. Multiple studies have indeed showed the implication of such proteins in human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lorenzetti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ta-Shma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stauber et al., 2017</xref>). Remarkably, these proteins are MIPs existing inside the doublet except for PACRG and FAP20. In addition, the structures of the IJ components such as PACRG and FAP126 also highlight the unique roles of the MIPs in curvature induction or sensing as shown previously with Rib43a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ichikawa et al., 2019</xref>). FAP126 binds tightly to the wedge PF A12 and A13 while the N-terminus of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> PACRG penetrates the wedge between PF A13 and A1 and forces the PF pairs into a high-curvature conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). From our curvature analysis of the doublet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), this region of PF A12-A1 contains extreme high and low curvatures compared to the 13-PF singlet. Alternatively, the curvature might be enforced by MIPs inside the A-tubule. This inter-PF curvature could help to facilitate the specific binding and anchoring of FAP126 and PACRG to the correct position. It has been shown that doublecortin can sense the curvature of the 13-PF microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bechstedt and Brouhard, 2012</xref>). The <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>-specific Tether density 3 might act as a high curvature inducer/sensor or an IJ complex stabilizer.</p><p>Post-translational modifications in tubulin are known to be important for the activity of the cilia. There have been many studies about the effect of acetylation on the properties of microtubule such as stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Portran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). In 3T3 cells, the K40 acetyltransferase, αTAT1 promotes rapid ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friedmann et al., 2012</xref>). The absence of acetylating enzymes has indeed been shown to affect sperm motility in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kalebic et al., 2013</xref>) while SIRT2 deacetylation decreases axonemal motility in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alper et al., 2014</xref>). A recent cryo-EM study of reconstituted acetylated microtubules showed, using molecular dynamics, that the acetylated α-K40 loop has less conformational flexibility, but a full α-K40 loop in the cryo-EM map has not been visualized due to its flexibility. In this work, we show that the acetylated K40 loop binds to FAP52 and forms a fully structured loop. This loop remains flexible and unstructured when there is no protein interacting with it. This suggests that the α-K40 loop has a role in protein recruitment and interactions, especially, MIPs. We hypothesize that the acetylation disrupts the formation of an intra-molecular salt bridge between K40 and D39, which affects the loop’s sampling conformations and allows D39 to take part in atomic interactions with other proteins. This, in turn, improves the stability of the doublet and therefore, correlates with axonemal motility. In neurons, microtubules are also highly acetylated and are known to be stable. Our hypothesis suggests that in neuron microtubules, there might exist MIPs with a similar stabilizing effect as in the doublet. Previous studies on olfactory neurons demonstrate that there are densities of proteins inside the microtubule, suggesting the existence of MIPs inside cytoplasmic microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burton, 1984</xref>).</p><p>Another interesting insight from our study is the structured C-terminus of β-tubulin. The C-termini of tubulin in the doublet normally have polyglycylation and polyglutamylation, in particular, the B-tubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lechtreck and Geimer, 2000</xref>). In reconstituted microtubules and other places in the doublet, the C-termini are highly flexible and cannot be visualized. However, we observed the C-terminus of β-tubulin in PF A1 which appears to interact with PACRG and FAP20. In addition, the position of FAP126 and FAP106 binding on top of tubulin molecules also suggest they are interacting with the C-termini of tubulins. In vitro study shows that the C-tails of tubulins must be suppressed for the outer junction to be formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schmidt-Cernohorska et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests that the C-terminus might have a role in the assembly and or stability of the doublet. Defects in tubulin polyglutamylase enzyme have indeed led to partially formed B-tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pathak et al., 2007</xref>). This could indicate a role for polyglutamylation in the interaction and recruitment at the IJ PF, specifically PACRG and FAP20. Lack of polyglutamylation can lead to an easily detachable PACRG and FAP20 and hence the partial assembly of the B-tubule. Finally, it is possible that MIPs can act as readers of tubulin post-translational modifications for their orderly recruitment and assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation of doublet samples</title><p>WT <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells (cc124) were obtained from <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> source center and cultured either on Tris-acetatephosphate (TAP) media with shaking or stirring with 12 hr light-12 hr dark cycle.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This is elegant work where several experimental and computational approaches are combined to identify and locate novel axonemal components. The authors use cryo-electron microscopy to visualize, at high resolution, the structure of proteins that form the inner junction between the A-tubule and the B-tubule of the microtubule doublet in the two species <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>. The comparative analysis revealed subtle difference in the inner junction organization between the two species. The authors then use a combination of bioinformatics and mass spectrometry of wild-type and mutant cells to reveal proteins that compose the inner junction and fit them to the cryo-EM structure.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The inner junction complex of the cilia is an interaction hub that involves tubulin post-translational modifications&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers noted that a structure of a <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> axonemal double was reported by Ma et al. while your work was under consideration. This does not affect the fact that your manuscript is a major contribution to our understanding of the microtubule doublet, which is a fundamental component of every cilium.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>No experimental revisions are required. The reviewers found parts of the manuscript difficult to follow and suggest work is required to improve the text and figures. The suggestions are listed below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>While much of the structural data in the paper is at high resolution and informative, some of the conclusions drawn from it are not well supported by the data. Words like 'unambiguous' and 'leaves no doubt' are used on several occasions. The fits of the individual proteins into the EM densities are quite convincing, but none of the proteins have been validated structurally using appropriate mutants of tagging of the newly identified IJ proteins.</p><p>Another major problem with the manuscript concerns the components that are present in the tomography structures, but absent here. Are the IJ protofilament components not present in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, are they missing after the salt wash, or are they at partial occupancy? There are several conflicting sentences throughout the manuscript that make the situation quite confusing:</p><p>A) In the third paragraph of subsection “Multiple tether proteins exist at the IJ”, &quot;no IJ PF <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>&quot; Please clarify that this could be due to the biochemical purification used in this study here.</p><p>B) Subsection “Multiple tether proteins exist at the IJ” paragraph seven, first sentence: this sentence is contradictory to previous sentences: FAP20/PACRG is present in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, but with lower occupancy and also appear to have different occupancy throughout the 96nm repeat.</p><p>C) Subsection “PACRG, FAP20, FAP52 and FAP276 form an IJ complex” third sentence: this sentence appears to repetitive to the sentence in the third paragraph of subsection “Multiple tether proteins exist at the IJ”</p><p>D) Discussion paragraph two: &quot;in which the IJ PF was washed away…&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>My general comment is that the quality of figures should be improved. From some of figures, I am not really convinced that structural models and protein-protein interactions described in the paper are correct. These concerns should be cleared by adding more details in figures and explanations in the main text. Here are details:</p><p>1) FAP276 model and interactions. &quot;… the side chain agrees unambiguously with the density signature in this region&quot;. Which sequence and density did you use to assign FAP276 to the Y-shaped density? It is unclear from Figure 2—figure supplement 1G and H. Also, the authors described &quot;FAP276 itself forms numerous interact with tubulin&quot;. How do they interact? I would like to see their interaction details in a figure.</p><p>2) PACRG and FAP20 interactions. Figure 2E and H, do the authors want to show details of protein-protein interactions? Fitness of side chains? It is not clear from these figures. The authors should make magnified views of side-chain / side chain interactions and describe how they exactly interact (e.g. by lines). For instance, in Figure 2H, it is unclear how side chains shown in the figure contribute to the protein-protein interactions between β-tubulin and PACRG and FAP20. Also, where are E432 and F437? These labelled in Figure 2H do not clearly point where they are. Also, the authors described &quot;The PACRG and FAP20 binding interface appears to involve multiple hydrogen bonds…&quot;. However, they did not show details of these hydrogen bonds in Figure 3A, B and C. It is particularly important to show how the FAP20-binding loop of PACRG interacts with FAP20, and residues of FAP20 that interact with the loop are conserved (related to Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><p>3) PACRG model. Figure 2I, there is a missing region in the red model. How did the authors conclude these two red segments are from the same protein?</p><p>4) FAP52 interactions. The authors described &quot;FAP52 segment G142-P143 appears to interact with T41 of a-tubulin from PF B9&quot;. If residues of these regions have been associated, these interactions should be shown in a figure. Also in Figure 4F, the positions of residues are unclear, nitrogen atoms in R225 are not blue so it was hard to identify the residue. From this figure, I'm not convinced that R225 makes salt bridge with D39.</p><p>5) FAP106 model. First paragraph subsection “FAP106 is the Tether loop, consisting of Tether density 1 and 2”, how did the authors conclude that these two separated densities are from the same protein instead of two? Without seeing the connectivity of the densities and knowing the identity of the proteins (upto this point), it is not convincing their conclusion. The loop in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> looks connected. Did they use this as a support? If so, please explain clearly. Also, subsection “FAP106 is the Tether loop, consisting of Tether density 1 and 2” paragraph four, the authors did not show &quot;the density signature&quot;, which must be shown in a figure with the FAP106 model with side chains.

Words like 'unambiguous' and 'leaves no doubt' are used on several occasions. The fits of the individual proteins into the EM densities are quite convincing, but none of the proteins have been validated structurally using appropriate mutants of tagging of the newly identified IJ proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comments and we fixed all the texts to make sure it is not over-claimed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another major problem with the manuscript concerns the components that are present in the tomography structures, but absent here. Are the IJ protofilament components not present in Tetrahymena, are they missing after the salt wash, or are they at partial occupancy?</p></disp-quote><p>Our salt wash definitely affects the stability of specific MIPs. The stability of specific MIPs are not the same in different species. For example, there are many MIPs in the A-tubule of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> is not present. For PACRG and FAP20, almost all PACRG and FAP20 are not present in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>. This should be due to salt wash. Only one pair of PACRG and FAP20 is still there as we reported. This is likely due to a specific interaction within the 96-nm repeat of this pair. We do see some density around this specific pair in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, however, since our map is only 48-nm repeating unit, this density is very weak to show.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are several conflicting sentences throughout the manuscript that make the situation quite confusing:</p><p>A) In the third paragraph of subsection “Multiple tether proteins exist at the IJ”, &quot;no IJ PF Tetrahymena&quot; Please clarify that this could be due to the biochemical purification used in this study here.</p><p>B) Subsection “Multiple tether proteins exist at the IJ” paragraph seven, first sentence: this sentence is contradictory to previous sentences: FAP20/PACRG is present in Tetrahymena, but with lower occupancy and also appear to have different occupancy throughout the 96nm repeat.</p><p>C) Subsection “PACRG, FAP20, FAP52 and FAP276 form an IJ complex” third sentence: this sentence appears to repetitive to the sentence in the third paragraph of subsection “Multiple tether proteins exist at the IJ”</p><p>D) Discussion paragraph two: &quot;in which the IJ PF was washed away…&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We rewrote the text to clarify this point.</p><p>“On the other hand, the IJ region bridging PF B10 and A1 of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> doublet remained intact (Figure 1A-D).

From some of figures, I am not really convinced that structural models and protein-protein interactions described in the paper are correct. These concerns should be cleared by adding more details in figures and explanations in the main text. Here are details:</p><p>1) FAP276 model and interactions. &quot;… the side chain agrees unambiguously with the density signature in this region&quot;. Which sequence and density did you use to assign FAP276 to the Y-shaped density? It is unclear from Figure 2—figure supplement 1G and H. Also, the authors described &quot;FAP276 itself forms numerous interact with tubulin&quot;. How do they interact? I would like to see their interaction details in a figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed the word “unambiguously” to make sure we are not overclaiming. We added details about sequence for all proteins now in Materials and methods now.</p><p>Also, to illustrate the interaction from FAP276 with tubulins, we replaced Figure 2C with a new one, showing how FAP276 insert into the tubulin lattice. In order for not overinterpreting the interaction, we wrote now “FAP276 itself forms different contacts with tubulin with both of its N- and C-termini, thus it provides strong anchorage for FAP52 to the tubulin lattice (Figure 2C).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) PACRG and FAP20 interactions. Figure 2E and H, do the authors want to show details of protein-protein interactions? Fitness of side chains? It is not clear from these figures. The authors should make magnified views of side-chain / side chain interactions and describe how they exactly interact (e.g. by lines).</p></disp-quote><p>We improved Figure 2E, F and H for this purpose. The new Figure 2E is swapped with Figure 2G. Also, with the purpose to not overinterpret the map at this resolution, we highlighted the H136 as important residues for interaction with B10’s tubulin since H136 is conserved from different species (Khan et al., 2019) while other residues in this loop are not conserved. We also reflected this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For instance, in Figure 2H, it is unclear how side chains shown in the figure contribute to the protein-protein interactions between β-tubulin and PACRG and FAP20. Also, where are E432 and F437?</p></disp-quote><p>We labelled the tubulin now more clearly. Also, to not overinterpret, indicate the potential residues in the interaction in the figures and said it in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These labelled in Figure 2H do not clearly point where they are. Also, the authors described &quot;The PACRG and FAP20 binding interface appears to involve multiple hydrogen bonds…&quot;. However, they did not show details of these hydrogen bonds in Figure 3A, B and C. It is particularly important to show how the FAP20-binding loop of PACRG interacts with FAP20, and residues of FAP20 that interact with the loop are conserved (related to Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p></disp-quote><p>To illustrate the interaction of FAP20 and PACRG, we now include a new Figure 3B showing the detail interaction region. We also highlight the region of FAP20 interaction with PACRG in its sequence alignment in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. Here is what we write now about this interaction in the text:</p><p>“The PACRG and FAP20 binding interface involves complementary surface charges, suggesting a specific and strong interaction (Figure 3B-D). The loop N225-I260 of PACRG forms a β sheet stacking like interactions with the strand H33-R36 of FAP20 (Figure 3B). In addition, residue Q264 of PACRG forms a hydrogen bond with residue T38 of FAP20.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) PACRG model. Figure 2I, there is a missing region in the red model. How did the authors conclude these two red segments are from the same protein?</p></disp-quote><p>They are part of the same protein because 1) all the surrounding densities have been assigned to the α-β-tubulin dimers, 2) There is a 101 long segment of the PACRG N-terminus that is still unassigned to density and 3) the density signature downstream and upstream of the gap matches the sequence identity of the PACRG N-terminus as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1B.</p><p>We included this in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) FAP52 interactions. The authors described &quot;FAP52 segment G142-P143 appears to interact with T41 of a-tubulin from PF B9&quot;. If residues of these regions have been associated, these interactions should be shown in a figure. Also in Figure 4F, the positions of residues are unclear, nitrogen atoms in R225 are not blue so it was hard to identify the residue. From this figure, I'm not convinced that R225 makes salt bridge with D39.</p></disp-quote><p>We improved Figure 4F and G to reflect the suggestions. We removed the text above and wrote the new text as follows. We did not observe the side chain for D39 or T41 due to low resolution in this region. Therefore, we can only speculate about the interaction based on proximity.</p><p>We rewrote as follow:</p><p>“The density of the α-K40 loop of PF B10 is more complete, allows us to hypothesize that residue K229 of FAP52 interacts with the backbone of D39 of α-tubulin from PF B10. It is also possible that there is a hydrophobic interaction between L226 and I42 (Figure 4E). Residues R225 of FAP52 and D39 of α-tubulin are in an environment where they could form an interaction. However, the side chain densities for both residues are not well-resolved. At the second tubulin contact point, FAP52 segment G142-P143 is in the close proximity of the α-K40 loop from PF B9 (Figure 4B). In the lower region of FAP52, the loop V268-L279 is in close proximity with the N-terminus of PACRG (Figure 4B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) FAP106 model. First paragraph subsection “FAP106 is the Tether loop, consisting of Tether density 1 and 2”, how did the authors conclude that these two separated densities are from the same protein instead of two? Without seeing the connectivity of the densities and knowing the identity of the proteins (upto this point), it is not convincing their conclusion. The loop in Tetrahymena looks connected. Did they use this as a support? If so, please explain clearly. Also, subsection “FAP106 is the Tether loop, consisting of Tether density 1 and 2” paragraph four, the authors did not show &quot;the density signature&quot;, which must be shown in a figure with the FAP106 model with side chains. Is a &quot;[FHY]xWxxKxx[FHY]&quot; (subsection “FAP106”) motif the density signature? If so, please show the density of the motif and its model in a figure panel.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the Tetra as the support for the connectivity of this region. We reflected this now in the Materials and methods.</p><p>We added the motif &quot;[FHY]xWxxKxx[FHY]&quot; of the density signature as Figure 5—figure supplement 1A now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) FAP126 model. Subsection “FAP126, a FLTOP homolog, interacts with the tether loop, FAP106” paragraph two, the authors mentioned &quot;WPxxxxxW&quot;. Please show a magnified view of this density with a model in a figure panel.</p></disp-quote><p>We added Figure 6—figure supplement 1C to show the density of the motif to search for FAP126 identity.
