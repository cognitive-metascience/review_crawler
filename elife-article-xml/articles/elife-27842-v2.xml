homeostasis is maintained by resident populations of adult stem cells. These cells both self-renew to maintain a constant pool of pluripotent cells and differentiate into a variety of cell types to replace cells that are lost to either natural wear and tear or to acute injury and insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuchs et al., 2004</xref>). As tissues age, the ability of adult stem cells to replenish tissues is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schultz and Sinclair, 2016</xref>). As a result, tissue function declines, leading to a number of different age-related deficits: grey hair is a result of impaired melanocyte maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nishimura et al., 2005</xref>), decreased immunity results from reduced hematopoietic stem cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Linton and Dorshkind, 2004</xref>), and decreases in neuron production has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of different neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s Disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donovan et al., 2006</xref>). However, the mechanisms that govern the regenerative competence of aging adult stem cells remain unclear. Of particular importance is the period when age-related declines first begin to manifest – when baseline stem cell function is preserved, yet, the ability to recover from injury may be impaired.</p><p>One of the most prevalent causes of injury in adult stem cells is genotoxic stress, such as that induced by exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). The fly is a particularly interesting model organism with which to examine stem cell survival post IR because recent work has demonstrated that there are several cell populations that display differing levels of resistance to ionizing radiation. Previous work in the young fly has shown a remarkable ability of <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline stem cells (GSCs) to survive IR, even when their progeny undergo rapid apoptosis. GSCs are resistant to the apoptotic effects of ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xing et al., 2015</xref>): when flies are exposed to low doses of ionizing radiation GSCs survive, while their progeny, the transiently amplifying cells, do not. Dying GSC daughter cells secrete the ligand Pvf1, which signals via the Tie receptor and microRNA bantam to inhibit the apoptotic machinery in GSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bilak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xing et al., 2015</xref>). After a period of quiescence, the GSCs re-enter the cell cycle and, ultimately, regenerate the germline. Knockdown of Pvf1, a Tie ligand, in differentiating daughter cells rendered stem cells sensitive to IR, suggesting that differentiating daughter cells send survival signals to protect stem cells for future repopulation. Similar pools of IR-resistant cells have also been identified in other tissues. For example, in the larval imaginal disc, there is a population of IR-resistant cells that are able to generate viable adult tissues, even when exposed to high levels of radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Verghese and Su, 2016</xref>). Today, however, the ability of aging adult stem cells to maintain their resistance to ionizing radiation remains unexamined. Gaining a better understanding of stem cells' ability to recover from ionizing radiation will provide valuable insight into a wide range of physical phenomena, ranging from development of cancer therapeutics to improved aging remedies.</p><p>Stem cells in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> are a versatile system with which to study age related changes in regenerative potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lucchetta and Ohlstein, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fabian and Brill 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Resende et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Resnik-Docampo et al., 2017</xref>). Defects in GSC function in aged flies have been identified and are in line with hypothesized defects in aging human stem cells: decreased proliferative capacity, accumulation of DNA damage, and eventual loss of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kao et al., 2015</xref>). However, the initiation of the aging process, and, particularly, how GSCs early in the aging process respond to injury, remains an open area of investigation. Furthermore, the ability of aging GSCs to regenerate their resident tissue following injury has not been fully elucidated. Since a hallmark of aging stem cells is the inability to properly regenerate tissue following injury and insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sharpless and DePinho, 2007</xref>), it is critical to understand the relationship between the initiation of aging and the ability of stem cells to recover from injury, such as following exposure to ionizing radiation.</p><p>Here, we identify and mechanistically dissect a regeneration defect in aging GSCs following exposure to ionizing radiation. Aging GSCs survive exposure to radiation, but exhibit a defect in cell cycle reentry upon completion of DNA repair. We further show that young GSCs enter a 24 hr period of quiescence following exposure to ionizing radiation before reentering the cell cycle and beginning to regenerate the germline. In our investigation of the mechanisms governing this process, we identify the <italic>foxo</italic>-encoded transcription factor and the human mTOR ortholog, <italic>Tor</italic> as important regulators for GSC entry and exit of quiescence following exposure to ionizing radiation, respectively. Lastly, we show that the regeneration defect of aging GSCs can be rescued by knockdown of <italic>foxo</italic>, suggesting that misregulation of <italic>foxo</italic> may underlie the regenerative decline with age.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Aging germline stem cells survive exposure to ionizing radiation, but fail to re-enter the cell cycle in a timely fashion</title><p>In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary, at the apical tip of each germarium are two to three germline stem cells (GSCs) in direct contact with their somatic niche (Spradling 1993). These GSCs undergo asymmetric rounds of self-renewing divisions to give rise to a new stem cell and to a transiently amplifying cell (cystoblast) that undergoes four incomplete divisions generating an interconnected 16 cell cyst, of which one cell will eventually become an oocyte. Intricate interactions between GSCs and somatic cells allow for GSC maintenance in the niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuchs et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ward et al., 2006</xref>). Germline stem cells can be identified by their proximity to the cap cells in the niche and the prominent foci of adducin staining, labeling the subcellular structures called spectrosomes, while progeny can be identified by a branched focus of adducin, known as the fusome, in cells that do not reside within the niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.). As GSCs progress through the cell cycle, they alternately have an elongated or a round spectrosome, the morphology of which can be used to identify dividing GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Cuevas and Spradling, 1998</xref>). GSCs in the female <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovariole lose replicative capacity with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kao et al., 2015</xref>), however, the early steps in aging and GSC ability to survive exposure to ionizing radiation during the early aging process has not been probed.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27842.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Aging GSCs survive exposure to IR, but do not regenerate the germarium.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top: Schematic diagrams of 4 week old vs. 6 week old germaria one week following IR.

Since it has been shown that young GSCs survive exposure to IR and are able to regenerate the germline by one week following exposure to IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xing et al., 2015</xref>), we probed the system to identify the earliest time points where we could observe a defect in the aging GSCs’ ability to recover from exposure to IR. We found that at 4 weeks, recovery from IR and regeneration was normal, while a defect could be observed when 6 week old animals were irradiated. We exposed 4- and 6 week old wild type flies to 50 Grays of radiation and quantified the number of GSCs in unirradiated flies and compared them to the number of GSCs in germaria of flies one week following irradiation. We found that, although 4 and 6 week old germaria lose a small number of GSCs one week post IR the majority of 4 and 6 week old germaria still had 1 to 2 GSCs one week following irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that the Tie-mediated protective mechanism remains mainly intact in aging germaria. Next, we assayed the level to which the GSCs were able to regenerate the germarium following exposure to ionizing radiation. We visualized GSC progeny with adducin staining and compared the number of germaria that had four or more progeny to those that had fewer than four progeny in unirradiated flies and in germaria of flies one week following exposure to irradiation. We found that, while at 4 weeks, the number of germaria with progeny was not significantly different before and after exposure to irradiation, at 6 weeks, the number of germaria with progeny one week following irradiation was significantly lower than in the germaria of unirradiated flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This suggests that, while aging GSCs are able to survive exposure to irradiation, they are unable to re-enter the cell cycle and regenerate the germarium in a timely manner. We confirmed that regeneration was impaired by assaying the percentage of GSCs with elongated spectrosomes, which is an indication of GSC division. We found that levels of spectrosome elongation were similar before and after irradiation in the 4 week old animals, however, in the 6 week old animals, there was a significant decrease in the percentage of GSCs with elongated spectrosomes one week after irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We further confirmed that regeneration was impaired in 6 week old animals by comparing the number of adults produced by 4 and 6 week old irradiated animals. We found that while irradiated 4 week old animals produced less adults than unirradiated animals of the same age , this defect was much more pronounced in irradiated 6 week old animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that aging GSCs are able to survive exposure to low IR, but are unable to reenter the cell cycle and regenerate the germline.</p><p>To assay the general fitness of the 6 week old flies, we compared the survival rates of 6 week old flies, both irradiated and unirradiated.

We have now identified the earliest time at which aging <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline stem cells lose the ability to appropriately recover from exposure to sublethal doses of ionizing radiation (IR) and dissect the mechanism for this process. Following exposure to IR, most aging GSCs survive, but fail to reenter the cell cycle and regenerate the germline, a process that is activated in young flies post IR. This is not due to a defect in DNA damage repair, as DNA damage repair concludes in a timely manner, even though the aging GSCs fail to return to the cell cycle. We have now identified two key regulators for IR induced quiescence: <italic>foxo</italic> and <italic>Tor</italic>. These two genes have opposing roles in regulating GSC cell cycle, exit and reentry after IR, respectively. Furthermore, <italic>Tor</italic> inactivation by RNAi or Rapamycin treatment induces a premature GSC aging phenotype, impairing <italic>Tor-</italic>dependent regeneration post injury. Conversely, knocking down <italic>foxo</italic> in aging animals rescues the aging phenotype, allowing GSCs to regenerate the germline, as observed in young flies. Finally, we show that <italic>foxo</italic> and <italic>Tor</italic> have opposing patterns of expression in the germarium and depletion of <italic>foxo</italic> leads to increases in <italic>Tor</italic> activity. This suggests that <italic>foxo</italic> regulates post-IR quiescence and cell cycle reentry by regulating <italic>Tor</italic> activity. Importantly, we show that loss of <italic>foxo</italic> rescues the GSC age-related regeneration phenotype due to IR. Overall, this study shows that IR induced quiescence is regulated by <italic>foxo</italic> and the mTOR ortholog, <italic>Tor</italic>, and suggests that upregulation of <italic>foxo</italic> and misregulation of <italic>Tor</italic> signaling in aging adult stem cells may be responsible for the decline in regenerative capacity following injury or insult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>Aging adult stem cells are unable to regenerate injured tissue as effectively and efficiently as young stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schultz and Sinclair, 2016</xref>). However, it has remained an open area of investigation as to whether this is due to a loss of adult stem cells with age or whether this is due to a decrease in the ability of adult stem cells to regenerate appropriately. Our work shows that the anti-apoptotic protective mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xing et al., 2015</xref>) that shield adult stem cells from death remain mainly intact, but the aging GSCs are unable to reenter the cell cycle following IR-induced quiescence.</p><p>Aging is a complex process, involving the cumulative decline of multiple cell types. Defects in the replicative potential of old GSCs have been reported by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tseng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rauschenbach et al., 2015</xref>). However, our work expands our understanding of the onset of aging in a unique way. Here, we identify the earliest time point at which defects can be detected in GSC proliferation in an injury model. Before the induction of IR-mediated quiescence in our aging flies, rates of GSC division, as well as the number of GSCs per germaria were similar to that seen in young, healthy flies. Defects were only readily observed following exposure to IR. This suggests that baseline levels of GSC function remain unperturbed, however, the GSCs are unable to recover successfully from insult. This leads us to believe that we have identified a defect early in the initiation of the aging process. Therapeutically, this is a very important window, as it allows us to identify times when an intervention may be useful in helping to slow the progression of aging, or prevent it from initiating in the first place, rather than attempting to reverse it late in the process.</p><p>High doses of irradiation have been shown to lead to GSC loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). We specifically utilized a relatively low dose of ionizing radiation, in order to induce damage, but not lead to GSC loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xing et al., 2015</xref>) and to probe the ability of aging stem cells to recover from an injury that should be surmountable were the cells functioning properly. We were able to identify critical roles for two known proteins involved in tissue homeostasis: Foxo for cell cycle withdrawal and Tor for cell cycle reentry. <italic>foxo</italic> has been well documented as a regulator of stem cell self-renewal and quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demontis and Perrimon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xing et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eijkelenboom and Burgering, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gopinath et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xing et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, <italic>foxo</italic> tends not to be active during normal physiology, but rather during stressful conditions, when it responds to and counteracts a stressor in order to maintain homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kenyon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eijkelenboom and Burgering, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that <italic>foxo</italic> activity is required in <italic>Drosophila</italic> GSCs in order for them to withdraw from the cell cycle following exposure to ionizing radiation. There are multiple ways that Foxo may be able to sense the damage caused to the cell by irradiation. In response to the presence of reactive oxygen species, JNK-mediated phosphorylation of Foxo can cause its translocation to the nucleus(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van den Berg and Burgering, 2011</xref>). Foxo can also be the target of multiple pathways that are responsive to DNA damage: Foxo is a target of phosphorylation by ATM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matsuoka et al., 2007</xref>) and the MAPK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kress et al., 2011</xref>) both of which have been shown to be activated by DNA damage. Lastly, Foxo is capable of directly sensing cellular redox status via oxidation and reduction of amino acids, particularly cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dansen et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>CHK2, a highly conserved checkpoint kinase, controls DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis following DNA damage. The fly CHK2 ortholog, <italic>loki</italic>, has been shown to mediate GSCs’ self-renewal and differentiation following high doses of ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). Here we show that depletion of <italic>loki</italic> in the germline prevents GSCs from entering quiescence following exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation. Loki’s ability to sense DNA damage and interact with Foxo via the ATM-CHK2-p53 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2012</xref>) could explain how GSCs know to activate Foxo and withdraw from the cell cycle following IR-induced double stranded breaks. Notably, p53, another component of the ATM-CHK2-p53 complex, has also been shown to regulate GSC irradiation-induced quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wylie et al., 2014</xref>) although how p53 interacts with Foxo in this context remains unclear. It is possible that any of these, or the combination of multiple of these systems sense the damage to the GSCs caused by the ionizing radiation and translocate Foxo to the nucleus, initiating IR-induced quiescence.</p><p>Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling has been implicated in a number of different age-related functions, from extension of lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vellai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjedov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bitto et al., 2016</xref>) to germline stem cell self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">LaFever et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2010</xref>), induction of a diapause like quiescent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2016</xref>) and muscle satellite cell activation following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rodgers et al., 2014</xref>). We found that <italic>Tor</italic> signaling was required in order for GSCs to reenter the cell cycle and regenerate the germline following exposure to IR. The sensitivity of wild type GSC proliferation to treatment with rapamycin after IR indicates that this could be mediated via the Tor complex 1 (TORC1) since rapamycin preferentially targets TORC1. We cannot completely rule out a role for Tor complex 2 (TORC2) in GSCs’ quiescence since rapamycin treatment has been shown to affect TORC2 activity by keeping Tor associated with TORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sarbassov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lamming et al., 2012</xref>). Further studies will focus on investigating the roles of both TORC1 and TORC2 downstream effectors in GSC quiescence.</p><p>GSCs with decreased levels of <italic>Tor</italic> activity are unable to reenter the cell cycle post-IR, which is unlikely to be a general consequence of <italic>Tor</italic> inhibition inhibiting GSC division. In a number of different experiments, we observed a more pronounced defect in GSC proliferation in the context of recovery from injury post-IR than at baseline. This indicates that, while <italic>Tor</italic> might play a role in regulating stem cell division and self-renewal under normal physiological conditions, it likely has an additional injury-specific role in helping to replenish adult tissues that have been damaged, either by natural wear and tear or due to disease or injury. Given Tor’s ability to regulate translation, nucleotide synthesis, autophagy, lipid synthesis, and proteasome assembly, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>) it will be important to dissect which of these or other cellular processes are required for GSCs’ exit from quiescence. It is also quite striking that inhibition of <italic>Tor</italic> resembles the defect observed in aging GSCs, while at an organismal level, inhibition of <italic>Tor</italic> increases lifespan, suggesting a slowing of the aging process. This would indicate that <italic>Tor</italic> inhibition, albeit beneficial at an organismal level, may damage stem cells’ capacity to regenerate tissue after injury. This is a particularly important implication of our findings, given the increasing number of anti-aging studies involving rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bitto et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Mutations in insulin receptor (<italic>InR</italic>) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) in mice, result in Foxo activation and significant lifespan extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clancy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tatar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bluher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holzenberger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Webb et al., 2016</xref>). In humans, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FOXO3 locus have been associated with extraordinarily long lifespans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morris, 2005</xref>), though the mechanism for this remains elusive. Our study identifies a novel <italic>foxo</italic>-dependent stem cell defect in aged animals in which elevated <italic>foxo</italic> activity prevents GSCs from re-entering the cell cycle and regenerating the germline after a challenge. In contrast to other studies showing the benefits of high levels of <italic>foxo</italic> activity, we show, for the first time, that elevated levels of <italic>foxo</italic> activity, albeit beneficial in terms of lifespan extension, are detrimental to stem cell function in the context of tissue regeneration during aging. There are several reasons why pathologically high levels of <italic>foxo</italic> might prevent tissue regeneration in old animals. A meta-analysis of mouse Foxo targets that change with age has revealed that several cell cycle genes, such as the evolutionarily conserved cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4), which controls the G1 to S transition, and several ribosomal proteins, which are directly involved in protein translation, are misregulated in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Webb et al., 2016</xref>). In our study, we show how, after IR exposure, <italic>foxo</italic> and <italic>Tor</italic> have opposing patterns of expression in young animals. We also demonstrate how reducing <italic>foxo</italic> levels via RNAi increases p-S6 levels in young and aging animals. This strengthens the idea that <italic>foxo</italic> and <italic>Tor</italic> signaling interact with one another to regulate GSC division following injury and that misregulatin of this crosstalk might contribute to stem cell aging.</p><p>Our study shows how Foxo misregulation may impair aging GSCs’ regeneration potential. <italic>foxo</italic>’s ability to repress <italic>Tor</italic> could shed light on aging GSCs’ inability to resume division following insult. Though the mechanism with which <italic>foxo</italic> and <italic>Tor</italic> interact in the context of aging remains elusive, previous studies have already probed the relationship between these signaling pathways. Foxo has been shown to repress <italic>Tor</italic> signaling by allowing TSC (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex) to localize to the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Menon et al., 2014</xref>). At the lysosomal membrane, TSC is then able to inhibit Rheb, an essential activator of mTORC1. Other studies have shown that Foxo is able to inhibit mTORC1 by reducing Raptor levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jia et al., 2004</xref>) or by promoting the transcription of Sestrin 3 and Rictor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, <italic>Tor</italic> signaling can also inhibit Foxo activity by upregulating SGK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>), an AGC-kinase shown to inhibit Foxo. This suggests the possibility of a negative feedback loop between these signaling pathways. In the future, it will be of vital importance to dissect the crosstalk between <italic>foxo</italic> and <italic>Tor</italic> signaling to understand why GSCs lose their regeneration potential with age.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and culture conditions</title><p>The following stocks were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center at Indiana University: w[1118] (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_3605">BDSC_3605</ext-link>), P[UAS-Dcr-2.D]1, w1118; P[GAL4-nos.NGT]40 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_25751">BDSC_25751</ext-link>), UASp-<italic>foxo</italic><sup>RNAi</sup> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_32427">BDSC_32427</ext-link> and RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_32993">BDSC_32993</ext-link>), UASp-<italic>Tor</italic><sup>RNAi</sup> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_35578">BDSC_35578</ext-link>), UASp-<italic>Thor</italic><sup>RNAi</sup> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_36815">BDSC_36815</ext-link>), UASp-<italic>dm</italic><sup>RNAi</sup> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_43962">BDSC_43962</ext-link>), UASp-<italic>dap</italic><sup>RNAi</sup> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_36720">BDSC_36720</ext-link>), UASp-<italic>Loki</italic><sup>RNAi</sup> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_64482">BDSC_64482</ext-link>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Loss of FOXO rescues stem cell aging in <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline stem cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Kreipke et al. examine the mechanism by which exposure of germline stem cells (GSC) to ionizing radiation (IR) leads to a transient block in cell cycle progression followed by subsequent regeneration of the germline in young fruit flies. In contrast IR triggers a permanent inhibition of germline production in older flies but does not eliminate the GSC, suggesting that there is some form of regulation of exit and re-entry of the cell cycle for young but not older germlines. Using a combination of RNAi knock-downs and histochemical staining the authors analyze the mechanistic basis for the regulation of the GSC entry/exit from the cell cycle and find that the stress induced transcription factor Foxo and the metabolic homeostasis/aging pathway regulator Tor play key opposing roles in this process. Following IR exposure Foxo levels increase and inhibit Tor signaling. Tor signaling is required for post-IR treated quiescent GSCs re-entering the cell cycle, while Foxo induces exit into the quiescent state. Perhaps the most interesting result, which has potential practical implications for combatting Tor-dependent aging, is that RNAi knock-down of Foxo can rescue quiescent GSC in older flies resulting in regeneration of a germline. These conclusions are well supported by high quality data and should be of broad interest to readers in the fields of stem cell biology and aging.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Below are listed minor revisions that the reviewers request in order to improve the clarity of the paper.</p><p>1) In the second paragraph of the subsection “Aging germline stem cells survive exposure to ionizing radiation, but fail to re-enter the cell cycle in a timely fashion”, the authors indicate that the majority of germaria still had GSCs 7 days after irradiation. This is correct but at both 4 and 6 weeks a decrease in numbers of GSCs is evident. Can the authors please comment?</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> the authors show a decrease in germaria with &gt;4 progeny. Why is this not 100% in unirradiated germaria?</p><p>3) The loss of GSCs after irradiation in germaria with ectopic Delta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) should be quantified.</p><p>4) It would be informative if Tie activation could be shown only in cells that border daughters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (if such an assay is possible).</p><p>5) The way data are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref> does not provide an opportunity for the reader to determine the decrease in WT GSCs with elongated spectrosomes – how can the reader compare foxoRNAi to WT to determine that foxoRNAi GSCs keep dividing at a normal rate? This could be fixed by presenting scatter plots with mean values.</p><p>6) The increase in Foxo staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref> appears to be mainly in 8-16 cell cysts. Is there an increase in GSCs?</p><p>7) The increase in p-S6 staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref> appears slight and would benefit from quantification.</p><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, panels C and D it would be helpful to include controls for foxo&gt;RNAi without GAL4 for comparison.</p><p>9) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> the authors show a very simple but compelling phenotype in which old IR treated females had virtually no offspring as judged by the generation of pupa. Did the authors observe rescue of this phenotype by Foxo RNAi? If so, perhaps they could show that result and if not, perhaps they could mention this fact and discuss possible reasons for why not (e.g., other effectors might also be essential for full germline regeneration?)</p><p>Further points:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> shows baseline expression not 2 days post irradiation as indicated in the subsection “Foxo represses Tor in GSC after IR”.</p><p>2) Foxo staining should always be referred as &quot;Foxo&quot; not &quot;foxo&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27842.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the second paragraph of the subsection “Aging germline stem cells survive exposure to ionizing radiation, but fail to re-enter the cell cycle in a timely fashion”, the authors indicate that the majority of germaria still had GSCs 7 days after irradiation.
