In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, the ER membrane-resident kinase/endoribonuclease Ire1 utilizes a mechanism of selective degradation of ER-bound mRNAs (RIDD) to maintain homeostasis. We used a genetic screen to identify factors critical to the Ire1-mediated UPR and found several proteins, Dom34, Hbs1 and Ski complex subunits, previously implicated in ribosome rescue and mRNA no-go-decay (NGD). Ribosome profiling in ER-stressed cells lacking these factors revealed that Ire1-mediated cleavage of ER-associated mRNAs results in ribosome stalling and mRNA degradation. Stalled ribosomes iteratively served as a ruler to template precise, regularly spaced upstream mRNA cleavage events. This clear signature uncovered hundreds of novel target mRNAs. Our results reveal that the UPR in <italic>S. pombe</italic> executes RIDD in an intricate interplay between Ire1, translation, and the NGD pathway, and establish a critical role for NGD in maintaining ER homeostasis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29216.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most proteins need to fold into a specific shape in order to work properly. As such, cells have developed a number of ways to sense and respond to stressful conditions that cause their proteins to fold incorrectly. One place this happens is within a network of tubes inside the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum; this is where proteins that are destined for the cell surface or other compartments in the cell become folded. The endoplasmic reticulum has a limited capacity to fold proteins. When it is overwhelmed, the cell temporarily stops making the proteins that use up this capacity. This action makes up part of a larger set of responses collectively referred to as the “unfolded protein response”.</p><p>During the unfolded protein response, the production of some proteins is turned off when an enzyme called Ire1 cuts the transcript molecules that contain the instructions to build these proteins. Cutting these transcripts, however, creates a problem: it interrupts the translation of the transcript by the ribosome, the molecular machine that reads the genetic code to build proteins. Usually, a ribosome only comes off of a transcript when it arrives at a specific stop signal. Yet, ribosomes that run to the ends of broken transcripts never reach this signal and instead have to be rescued. If left without rescue, these stalled ribosomes could never be used again for translation of other transcripts, and the cell would lose the ability to make more proteins.</p><p>Guydosh, Kimmig et al. searched for new genes in the yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> that are involved in the part of the unfolded protein response that occurs after the actions of the Ire1 enzyme. This search revealed that cells missing so-called ribosome rescue proteins (namely Dom34 and Hbs1) grow slowly under conditions that cause proteins to fold incorrectly. Guydosh, Kimmig et al. then looked to see where on the transcripts the ribosomes stall and remain un-rescued in the absence of these ribosome rescue proteins. These sites corresponded to places that were cut by Ire1, the majority of which were previously unknown. Together these findings indicate that ribosome rescue is a key part of the unfolded protein response in <italic>S. pombe</italic> because it removes ribosomes that stall at the broken ends of transcript molecules cut by the Ire1 enzyme.</p><p>An efficient and well-controlled response to conditions that cause proteins to fold incorrectly is important for human health. Loss of this control can lead to disorders as diverse as atherosclerosis, cancer and neurological diseases. By revealing that the unfolded protein response uses the ribosome rescue pathway, the findings improve our understanding of these health conditions and may open the door to new research and treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proteostasis</kwd><kwd>RNA decay</kwd><kwd>ribosome stalling</kwd><kwd>endonuclease</kwd><kwd>ribosome footprinting</kwd><kwd>ribosome quality control</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM 059425</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guydosh</surname><given-names>Nicholas R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kimmig</surname><given-names>Phillip</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A critical component of the cellular response to unfolded proteins is the widespread rescue of ribosomes that stall on endonucleolytically-cleaved mRNA transcripts.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Membrane and secreted proteins fold and mature within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before they are delivered to other compartments in the secretory pathway or to the plasma membrane. An imbalance between the protein folding load and the protein folding capacity in the ER leads to an accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins, a condition referred to as ‘ER stress.’ ER stress triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), a network of signal transduction pathways that drive transcriptional programs to expand the ER’s protein folding capacity and reduce protein influx into the organelle through translational and mRNA degradative mechanisms, thereby ensuring that the organelle remains in or returns to homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In metazoans, the UPR is orchestrated by three ER-resident sensors/signal transducers: the membrane tethered transcription factor ATF6 and the transmembrane kinases PERK and IRE1 (‘Ire1’ in accordance with the yeast nomenclature) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>). Each sensor activates a downstream transcriptional gene expression program of UPR target genes. In addition to the transcriptional response, the PERK branch induces cell-wide attenuation of translation by phosphorylating the general eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), reducing the protein folding load of the ER.</p><p>IRE1 catalyzes signaling through the most phylogenetically conserved branch of the UPR. It is a bifunctional transmembrane kinase/endonuclease activated by ER stress. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (and metazoans), Ire1 catalyzes the unconventional splicing of the mRNA encoding the transcription factor Hac1 (XBP-1 in metazoans) that activates a comprehensive transcription program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta-Alvear et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calfon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cox and Walter, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Travers et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, as first demonstrated in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, Ire1 initiates a reaction termed regulated Ire1-dependent mRNA decay, or RIDD, the selective decay of ER-bound mRNAs, thereby reducing the load of protein entering the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</xref>). Conceptually, the effects of this reaction resemble that of PERK’s translational attenuation that reduces the ER’s protein folding load. RIDD occurs in mammalian cells and plants, but not in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, where the <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA splicing reaction is the sole output of UPR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Niwa et al., 2005</xref>). In striking contrast, in <italic>S. pombe</italic> RIDD is the sole output of Ire1. Transcriptional regulation and the otherwise conserved mRNA splicing reaction are entirely absent. <italic>S. pombe</italic> Ire1 has been shown to induce the decay of a few dozen mRNAs, cleaving them between the G and C residues of a short consensus sequence UGC (UG/C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kimmig et al., 2012</xref>). This motif is too low in information content to specify engagement of select mRNAs with Ire1, and thus other, still unidentified features need to contribute to bring appropriate mRNAs into juxtaposition and facilitate their engagement with Ire1.</p><p>During RIDD, mRNAs that are endonucleolytically severed by Ire1 rapidly decay through the combined actions of cellular exoribonucleases (XRNs) in the 5’→3’ direction and the exosome with the associated Ski complex in the 3’→5’ direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kimmig et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, virtually all Ire1 cleavage sites in <italic>S. pombe</italic> mRNAs are located within the coding sequences (CDSs). This observation is surprising, as mRNAs nicked within their CDSs are bound to induce translational stalls as ribosomes encounter the 3’ ends of the truncated mRNAs. This notion predicts that ribosomes stalled at the end of truncated mRNAs must be rescued by an active clearance mechanism, such as the ribosome rescue/mRNA decay pathway known as ‘no-go decay’ (NGD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doma and Parker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shoemaker and Green, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tsuboi et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Recent biochemical and genome-wide ribosome foot-printing studies of NGD in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> showed that the Dom34/Hbs1 complex in cooperation with Rli1 promotes dissociation of stalled ribosomes on truncated mRNAs (a form of ribosome recycling termed ‘rescue’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guydosh and Green, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pisareva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shoemaker et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, the NGD pathway triggers endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA upstream of the stalled ribosomes carried out by a still unidentified endonuclease (which we here refer to as ‘NGDase’), liberating ribosome-free mRNA fragments accessible to exonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doma and Parker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tsuboi et al., 2012</xref>). NGD is critical for rescuing stalled ribosomes and therefore maintaining ribosome homeostasis and is connected to the degradation of incomplete protein products through ubiquitylation and proteasome digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shen et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, NGD serves as an important quality control mechanism, responding to premature polyadenylation events in ORFs, as translation of the poly(A) tail stalls ribosomes and triggers subsequent decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guydosh and Green, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we discovered that in <italic>S. pombe</italic> the NGD machinery Dom34/Hbs1 and the exosome-associated Ski-complex are critical players in the UPR, acting downstream of Ire1-catalyzed mRNA cleavage. Further, using short-read ribosome profiling methodology, we identified hundreds of novel mRNA targets of Ire1. The precise and widespread nature of these target sites allowed us to show that stalled ribosomes serve as a ruler to template regularly spaced upstream mRNA cleavage events. Our results reveal that the UPR in <italic>S. pombe</italic> executes RIDD in an intimate interplay between Ire1, translation, and the NGD surveillance pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A genetic screen reveals novel factors critical to RIDD in <italic>S. pombe</italic></title><p>To identify additional genes involved in the UPR in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, we performed a quantitative, genome-wide screen for mutants resulting in altered fitness compared to wild type (WT) cells when grown on limiting concentrations of tunicamycin (Tm), a widely used UPR inducer that acts by inhibiting N-glycosylation in the ER lumen.

To this end, we performed ribosome profiling in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, sequencing ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (‘footprints’) ranging from 15 to 34 nucleotides in length. In our experiment, we included WT, <italic>dom34</italic>Δ, <italic>ski2</italic>Δ, and <italic>dom34</italic>Δ/<italic>ski2</italic>Δ strains in the presence and absence of DTT, which induces the UPR by disrupting disulfide bond formation in the ER lumen. Since <italic>ski2</italic>Δ <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells show a severe growth defect upon Tm treatment (e.g., see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), we performed ribosome foot-printing after a short exposure of DTT (60 min) to catch early events and minimize pleiotropic effects. We confirmed that at this early time point the Ire1 endonuclease was active by monitoring the accumulation of the cleavage product of <italic>gas2</italic> mRNA as a reporter RIDD target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As is customary in ribosome profiling experiments, we controlled for changes in mRNA abundance by simultaneously performing mRNA-Seq on the same samples.</p><p>Consistent with previous observations of ribosome footprint size distribution in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>), we found in the <italic>dom34</italic>Δ/<italic>ski2</italic>Δ strain that most of the ribosome footprints (~75%) were in the canonical range of 28–31 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We also observed smaller populations of footprints either 20–22 nts in length (~5% of the population; corresponding to ribosomes predicted to be in an alternative state of the translation cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lareau et al., 2014</xref>]) or 15–18 nts in length (~10% of the population; predicted to be stalled on truncated mRNA ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guydosh and Green, 2014</xref>]). As we further elaborate below, the population of footprints also reports on the formation of ‘disomes’ (stacked ribosomes in direct contact with each other) because RNase 1, which is used to generate protected ribosome footprints, can only partially digest the mRNA between two closely-stacked ribosomes, thus yielding a larger footprint size.

In these examples, and in all profiling data shown in this work, we assigned the counts of mapped ribosome footprints according to their 3’ ends.

When we turned our analysis to the regions upstream of the UG/C target sites, we noticed a striking periodicity in the 15–18 nt dataset: peaks repeated roughly every 14 nt, decreasing in abundance as one moves upstream of the initial cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, orange lines). To confirm the accuracy of this distance measurement, we computed the power spectrum of the autocorrelation of the repeat region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), which revealed a strong correlation every 14 nucleotides and, to a lesser extent, every 28 nucleotides (discussed further below). The regularity in spacing of these peaks can be accounted for by a model wherein a ribosome that is stalled at a UG/C motif initiates NGD through endonucleolytic cleavage immediately upstream of it. This cleavage event, in turn, stalls the next ribosome behind it, generating another peak just 14-nucleotides upstream. In this way, the ribosome serves as a ruler that templates the repeat pattern.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Disomes form at sites of Ire1 cleavage</title><p>As suggested by the power spectrum peak at 28 nucleotides, the 14-nucleotide repeat pattern appeared to be superimposed by a 28-nucleotide repeat pattern, resulting in peaks with a higher amplitude at alternating 14-nucleotide positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, alternating height of orange lines). This trend is also visible in the data upstream of all UG/C cleavage sites (908 total sites, including both strong and weak stalls) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). A simple explanation for this observation is that two ribosomes occasionally stack — forming ‘disomes’ — when a tail-gating translating ribosome rear-ends a ribosome stalled at a mRNA truncation site before the NGDase cleaves the mRNA. This notion is supported by the analyses of the averaged dataset of the long, 25–34 nucleotide footprint data that reveal a dominating peak positioned precisely where we expect two ribosomes to collide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, purple line). In this scenario, the upstream ribosome in the disome protects the mRNA from cleavage at the site of the 2<sup>nd</sup> NGD site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, orange dot), thereby accounting for the reduced amplitude in arrested short-footprint ribosomes at that position. The evidence for a continued (though diminishing) pattern of alternating strong and weak peaks further upstream suggests that higher-order ribosome structures (i.e. mass-collisions leading to trisome, quadrasome, etc.) can form at a UG/C site. Alternatively, disome formation may be followed by cleavage, creating a new end on which the process repeats, leading to successive disome formation at upstream sites of no-go cleavage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Molecular model for Ire1-triggered NGD during ER stress in <italic>S. pombe</italic></title><p>We provide strong support for the coupling of NGD with Ire1-triggered endonucleolytic mRNA cleavage during the UPR in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. Our observations suggest a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) wherein initial Ire1-triggered cleavage at UG/C sites in ER targeted mRNAs results in ribosome arrest at the truncated end of the mRNA, generating short footprints in ribosome profiling experiments. Ribosomes stalled at the end of the truncated mRNAs can trigger stalling of trailing ribosomes by a ‘fender-bender’ type collision, causing them to stack as disomes and perhaps larger stacks. Single ribosomes and ribosome stacks trigger the endonucleolytic cleavage events of the NGD pathway. Our model posits that ribosome stalling and mRNA cleavage is then reiterated until the upstream mRNA is degraded into short ribosome-associated fragments and longer ribosome-free 5’ mRNA fragments subject to unobstructed 3’→5’ mRNA decay by the cytosolic exosome.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29216.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of Ire1 mRNA cleavage of leading to no-go decay.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Initial Ire1 cleavage of a target mRNA at UG/C sites within the open reading produces a truncated mRNA lacking its poly(A) tail. (<bold>B</bold>) Ribosomes continue to elongate until they reach the end of mRNA fragment and stall with an empty A-site. The stalled ribosome recruits NGDase, which cleaves the mRNA immediately upstream of the ribosome as part of the no-go decay process. Dom34/Hbs1 then recycle the ribosome. In their absence, ribosomes protect a short nucleotide (‘S-nt’), which we identify experimentally. If NGDase cleavage is slow enough to allow another ribosome to stack onto the leading one, a disome is formed. The trailing ribosome protects a long nucleotide (‘L-nt’). The tendency to form disomes (or perhaps even larger stacks) in vivo will depend on the relative kinetics governing elongation, NGDase cleavage, and ribosome recycling. (<bold>C</bold>) The process can repeat as more ribosomes arrive at newly generated 3’ ends. (<bold>D</bold>) Finally, the exosome degrades the mRNA fragments and any intact piece of 5’ mRNA that do not have a stalled ribosome protecting their 3’ end.

While the clearest evidence for enrichment of periodic short footprint ribosomes emerges in the <italic>dom34</italic>∆/<italic>ski2</italic>∆ mutant cells, weaker trends are seen in either single mutant alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that both the NGD/ribosome rescue pathway (Dom34/Hbs1/NGDase) and the 3’→5’ mRNA decay pathway (exosome/SkiX) are critical for the elimination of the Ire1 cleavage products in WT cells. It is striking that the effects of either single knockout on ribosome stalling and upstream NGD were small compared to the effects of the double knockout. These observations suggest that the two pathways can partially substitute for each other.</p><p>This finding is bolstered by the phenotypic assay showing loss of either pathway results in less tolerance for ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The assay, in particular, showed that both Ski2, a component of the Ski complex, and Ski7, are involved. While Ski7 interacts with the Ski complex and the RNA exosome, it has been suggested to have additional effects on translation and to bolster tolerance to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jamar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kowalinski et al., 2016</xref>). Ski7 would therefore be an interesting candidate for further mechanistic studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Implications to the general mechanism of NGD</title><p>Unlike previous studies of NGD at less-well defined ribosome stall sites (i.e. poly(A) stretches or long stem-loops), the endonucleolytic cleavage sites detected here were precise and thus offer the opportunity to more clearly examine the mechanism of long-distance NGD-cleavage events. Based on the dimension of the ribosome and positional registration of the mRNA footprint gleaned from previous ribosome profiling studies, we can infer mechanistic details regarding the still unknown and highly sought-after NGDase. For example, in the analysis of the repetitive pattern of protected fragments upstream of the primary UG/C cleavage site, we found that peaks were separated by only 14 nucleotides, which is different from a distance corresponding to the 15–18 nucleotide range observed in the footprint distributions created after RNase 1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This observation implies that the NGDase does not cleave flush against the upstream face of the ribosome, as occurs during experimental preparation of the 15–18 nt footprints. Instead, these data suggest that NGDase cleavage must occur <italic>inside</italic> the ribosome, at a position that is found one or two nucleotides within the channel from which the mRNA emerges the ribosome. It is also possible that the structure of ribosomes stalled in this way may be more flexible and therefore allow NGDase access to this site without having to reach inside the ribosome. This conclusion is consistent with our findings that NGD cleavage events show frame bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and previously in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guydosh and Green, 2017</xref>]), reinforcing the notion that the no-go cleavage events take place on the ribosome.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The Ire1 RIDD pathway collaborates with NGD to maintain ER homeostasis</title><p>By identifying ribosomes stalled on mRNAs that are cleaved by Ire1 upon ER stress, our data reveal that the scope of RIDD upon UPR induction is far broader than appreciated to date. By comparison to the cohort of 39 RIDD target mRNAs identified previously by mRNA-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kimmig et al., 2012</xref>), we here identified 471 mRNAs whose degradation is induced by Ire1-mediated cleavage at UG/C sites. This group of 471 mRNAs includes 34 of the 39 previously identified mRNAs (three could not be evaluated due to little or no read depth; the other two were successfully identified by cleavage at non-UG/C sites), thus expanding the set of Ire1 substrates by over ten-fold. Almost all (91%) of the identified mRNAs encode proteins that bear an ER-directed signal sequence or transmembrane domain and thus are predicted to be translated on the ER membrane in which Ire1 resides. The target list contains many mRNAs encoding proteins with functions in the secretory pathway and lipid metabolism, indicating that the regulation of these proteins’ biosynthesis may serve to fine-tune ER homeostasis, perhaps by adjusting the lipid composition of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Volmer and Ron, 2015</xref>). We also found that Ire1 appeared to cleave its own mRNA, suggesting a potential autoregulatory mechanism to limit production of this endonuclease once a threshold level is reached. We note that our method of detecting mRNA cleavage via the presence of a stalled ribosome limits our ability to detect cleavages outside canonical coding regions. It has previously been shown that Ire1 can target the 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kimmig et al., 2012</xref>), and it is therefore reasonable to assume that additional cleavage sites may be found in the 5’UTR or 3’UTR regions.</p><p>We also identified 816 mRNAs that are cleaved upon UPR induction, even though the cleavage sites did not correspond to UG/C motifs. While 193 of these mRNAs include sites matching UG/C with only a single base change and are therefore putative targets of Ire1, the remaining 623 mRNAs exhibit ribosome stalling solely at other classes of endonucleolytic cleavage sites that are induced upon UPR induction. One possible explanation is that Ire1 or another, yet to be identified endonuclease that is activated by ER stress, can cleave at these other sites. While UG/C sites were strongly enriched in the set of Ire1 target mRNAs, the vast majority of UG/C motifs that we evaluated did not meet our threshold criteria for inclusion: reads representing only 7.9% of the mRNAs containing UG/C motifs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> (left panel) were enriched &gt;10 x (i.e., fell above the green line) when the UPR was induced. It is possible that this number could be increased with improved methodology for cleavage site detection; yet it seems more plausible that other features of these sites are critical in determining the efficiency of Ire1 target selection. From the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, it seems unlikely that such features lie in the immediate sequence context of the site. Other possibilities that could offer an explanation include higher-order mRNA structural features, mRNA localization to the ER, a specific complement of RNA binding proteins, or features in the nascent polypeptide chains. Since it is clear that ER-associated factors are enriched in the set of targeted mRNAs, we asked whether the ER-associated mRNAs that manage to escape cleavage showed any particular functional enrichment. We were unable to reveal any trend, further implying that additional properties of these transcripts are involved in specifying targeting.</p><p>The biological importance of this broadened spectrum of Ire1 RIDD targets is underscored by the genetic screen that identified components in ribosome rescue and nonstop decay in an unbiased fashion. In particular, mutants in which the Ski-complex was defective showed strong sensitivity to ER stress. One potential explanation for why the failure to clear truncated mRNAs at the ER membrane may be so severe is that the stalled ribosomes may clog translocons and limit protein flux into the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arakawa et al., 2016</xref>), including that of newly synthesized chaperones and other factors required to restore ER homeostasis. If this were the case, we expect these findings will apply to higher eukaryotes where the RIDD pathway is also active and, as such, have broad implications for human disease. The UPR triggers the integrated stress response (ISR), and many recent reports have suggested that chronic ISR activation by unfolded proteins or other stresses can lead to a number of diseases, including atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tufanli et al., 2017</xref>) and many forms of neurological dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Scheper and Hoozemans, 2015</xref>). The ribosome recycling and mRNA decay pathways that we have shown here to be intricately intertwined are likely to be important for maintaining fitness of the proteome and human health.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>GEO accession codes</title><p>All high throughput data have been deposited with NCBI GEO with accession number GSE98934.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strain creation</title><p>Standard cloning and yeast techniques were used for construction, transformation and gene deletions as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moreno et al., 1991</xref>).

All RNA size separation gels were cut as a single slice from 15 to 34 nt for footprints and 40–60 nt for mRNA-Seq.

Total mRNA for mRNA-Seq was isolated from cells using hot SDS/acid phenol and chloroform, as previously described. Footprint samples here were subject to rRNA subtraction by using a yeast Ribo-Zero kit (Epicentre). Subtraction of rRNA for all footprint samples was performed prior to linker ligation with the exception of the <italic>dom34</italic>Δ/<italic>ski2</italic>Δ strains where it was performed after linker ligation. This change was implemented because the RiboZero kit introduces a variety of short sequences that map at random across the genome, leading to occasional spikes in the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guydosh and Green, 2017</xref>). Samples for mRNA-Seq were subject to subtraction after purification of total RNA (mRNA-Seq). The 50°C incubation step for standard footprint preparation was skipped in the Ribo-Zero-modified protocol, as recommended by the manufacturer.

The PomBase ASM294 v2.22 genome assembly was the reference genome used for analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wood et al., 2012</xref>). De-multiplexed sequences were processed to remove reads with any position with Phred score &lt;20 or assigned N as a quality filter step. Following a search for the linker and sorting of reads into short (15–18 nt) or long (25–34 nt) populations, contaminating ladder oligonucleotides were removed and alignment to a database of rRNA and tRNA spliced genes was performed. Following this step, a second round of subtraction for short, 15–18 nt, reads was performed by aligning to all the tRNA gene sequences plus extension with CCA on their 3’ ends. This enhanced the removal of cytoplasmic tRNA fragments. The remaining reads were mapped to the genome and those that failed to match were aligned to a custom transcriptome, created by splicing together annotated exons. Read lengths were assessed with the FastQC software (Babraham Bioinformatics).</p><p>All reads that aligned to multiple coding sequences were discarded. Read occupancy was determined by giving one count per read at its 3’ end and in some cases shifted to align with various active sites in the ribosome (i.e. start of the P site) as described below. However, reads were assigned to 5’ ends for mRNA-Seq analysis. These mRNA-Seq reads were also trimmed of 3’ consecutive As after alignment and remapped to include those near poly(A) tails, as was done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guydosh and Green, 2014</xref>). Read counts were then normalized by dividing by the total number of million mapped reads in a sample. Alignments were performed with Bowtie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>) and included the parameters: -y -a -m 1 --best --strata. All footprint alignments to coding sequences allowed for no mismatches; mRNA-Seq alignments allowed two mismatches. All other analysis software was custom coded in the Python 2.7 programming language and Biopython (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

Total gene ribosome occupancy was quantitated into density units of reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (rpkm) by taking reads mapping to an annotated sequence and dividing by the gene length in kilobases. The reads from the first and last five amino acids were not included to prevent known artifacts around start and stop codons from skewing results.</p><p>Ratio analysis was performed by taking the ratio at every point in the transcriptome between datasets from yeast with and without DTT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

There were no read density thresholds in the –DTT dataset but positions without any reads were assigned one read (0.244 rpm) so that a lower limit to the ratio could be computed. For some analyses, these thresholds were raised higher as noted. These ratios were corrected for changes in mRNA levels (using mRNA-Seq) between the two datasets.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Regulated Ire1-dependent mRNA decay requires no-go mRNA degradation to maintain endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis in <italic>S. pombe</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Nahum Sonenberg is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Guydosh and colleagues here show that, in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, primary Ire1-dependent cleavage of mRNAs encoding secreted proteins lead ribosomes to stall at cleavage points, triggering secondary cleavage through the no-go decay (NGD) pathway. Rapid, IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) of ER-associated transcripts provides the major unfolded protein response in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and has been observed in animal systems as well. This work provides a comprehensive catalogue of target transcripts, enhanced by genetic inactivation of downstream ribosome-dependent decay pathways. It also demonstrates a major physiological role for cycles of ribosome-dependent cleavage occurring on truncated mRNAs.</p><p>The basic phenomenon described by the authors is well supported by ribosome footprint profiling data, and is broadly consistent with previous work on RIDD and NGD. The connection between these two processes, and the discovery of a large class of physiological NGD substrates, will likely attract broad interest.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors show a strong enrichment for transmembrane and secreted proteins among the list of direct RIDD targets, but they don't comment on the converse: are classes of ER-associated mRNAs spared from RIDD, and can we rationalize which transcripts escape cleavage? Likewise, is there a functional enrichment for ER chaperones, etc. among the non-target mRNAs?</p><p>2) UG/C sites in the 5' UTR should block initiation and destabilize the mRNA, rather than triggering elongation stalls and progressive NGD. Are there differences between transcripts that contain or lack a UGC before the start of the coding sequence?</p><p>3) Likewise, the authors provide a clear and thorough analysis of UG/C cleavages, but these represent numerically a minority of UPR-induced cleavages overall. In the discussion, the authors equivocate between saying that these transcripts are &quot;cleaved by Ire1 upon UPR induction&quot; and pointing out that they could be cut by &quot;another, yet to be identified endonuclease&quot;. There's no evidence that these RNAs are direct Ire1 targets, however. Since one class of target transcripts match the defined Ire1 sequence preference well, the possibility of a second, distinct nuclease seems stronger.</p><p>4) The study identified 76 genes whose deletion results in the rescue of Tm-induced growth defects (proteins involved in vesicle transport and located on the cell surface), and 106 Tm-sensitizing deletions. The authors focused their study on the latter group, while the first group is uncharacterized. Did the authors perform any validation/analysis of the first group?</p><p>5) Ribosome footprinting experiments have been performed on WT, dom34Δ, ski2Δ, and dom34Δ/ski2Δ strains. However, data were not fully presented. Most of the experiments compared WT with dom34Δ/ski2Δ strains. Information about the dom34Δ and ski2Δ strains should be presented.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29216.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors show a strong enrichment for transmembrane and secreted proteins among the list of direct RIDD targets, but they don't comment on the converse: are classes of ER-associated mRNAs spared from RIDD, and can we rationalize which transcripts escape cleavage?

We analyzed the group of non-RIDD targeted mRNAs and the group of the Ire1-cleaved mRNAs against all secretory mRNAs. There was no significant enrichment for secretory proteins in the non-RIDD mRNAs so we, unfortunately, cannot offer a theory to explain which ER-associated mRNAs escape cleavage and why. We have now included the results of this analysis in the Discussion in the paragraph where we discuss target specificity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) UG/C sites in the 5' UTR should block initiation and destabilize the mRNA, rather than triggering elongation stalls and progressive NGD. Are there differences between transcripts that contain or lack a UGC before the start of the coding sequence?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the thoughtfulness of this question as we had not explicitly considered it. To explore this possibility further, we made a list of all genes with a UG/C in the 5’UTR and checked whether there were notable trends in the gene-level expression of mRNA or footprints. We did not see any pattern emerge.</p><p>This is not terribly surprising because mRNA-Seq alone is not very sensitive for identifying cleaved mRNAs. In fact, it only revealed 39 targets in our previous study. Because translation of 5’UTRs is relatively low, our higher-sensitivity short footprint profiling approach is only appropriate for cleavages in heavily translated regions and does not offer a means to detect cleavage events in the 5’UTR. We therefore cannot rule out this possibility and have now added text to the manuscript to include it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Likewise, the authors provide a clear and thorough analysis of UG/C cleavages, but these represent numerically a minority of UPR-induced cleavages overall.

We’ve adjusted the wording of this paragraph to address this point and improve clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The study identified 76 genes whose deletion results in the rescue of Tm-induced growth defects (proteins involved in vesicle transport and located on the cell surface), and 106 Tm-sensitizing deletions.

One way to rationalize the enrichment of these gene categories is by the downstream consequences of tunicamycin (inhibition of N-glycosylation). Inhibition of specific parts of this pathway may cause a beneficial reorganization of the secretory system, which lead to a growth advantage for the cell under such circumstances. We now point out this possibility with an added citation in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Ribosome footprinting experiments have been performed on WT, dom34Δ, ski2Δ, and dom34Δ/ski2Δ strains.

We have also added text to the Discussion section to better highlight the analysis that we performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, which specifically examines the effects of the single and double mutations and how these pathways appear to be somewhat redundant under the conditions of our assay.</p></body></sub-article></article>
