extinction. A close relative of gammaretroviruses, HERV-T, circulated in primates for ~25 million years (MY) before apparent extinction within the past ~8 MY. Construction of a near-complete catalog of HERV-T fossils in primate genomes allowed us to estimate a ~32 MY old ancestral sequence and reconstruct a functional envelope protein (ancHTenv) that could support infection of a pseudotyped modern gammaretrovirus. Using ancHTenv, we identify monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT-1) as a receptor used by HERV-T for attachment and infection. A single HERV-T provirus in hominid genomes includes an <italic>env</italic> gene (hsaHTenv) that has been uniquely preserved. This apparently exapted HERV-T <italic>env</italic> could not support virion infection but could block ancHTenv mediated infection, by causing MCT-1 depletion from cell surfaces. Thus, hsaHTenv may have contributed to HERV-T extinction, and could also potentially regulate cellular metabolism.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22519.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22519.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22519.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Over millions of years, viruses and the animals that they infect have been locked in a battle for survival, where each has needed to evolve ways to counteract the effects of the other. While the evolution of ancient animals can be studied by looking at the fossilized remains of their extinct relatives, studying how ancient viruses have evolved is more difficult as they usually do not leave behind physical traces of their existence. However, a family of viruses called retroviruses is a notable exception to this rule.</p><p>Retroviruses have a step in their life cycle in which their genetic material is integrated into the genome (the name for an organism’s complete set of genetic material) of the cell that they have infected. In rare cases, when that cell is a precursor of a sperm or egg cell, then the viral genes may then be passed on to the animal’s offspring, ultimately leaving genetic traces that can be studied in modern animals. This acts as a genetic ‘fossil record’ of extinct viruses.</p><p>HERV-T was a retrovirus that spread among our primate ancestors for about 25 million years before its extinction roughly 11 million years ago. Blanco-Melo et al. have now analyzed the genetic remains left by HERV-T in the genomes of humans and related primates, and were able to use this information to recreate a protein that made up the outer envelope that surrounded the virus. Further experiments showed that this viral protein helped HERV-T to infect human cells by interacting with a protein called MCT1 on the cell surface.</p><p>Blanco-Melo et al. also found a particular HERV-T gene that was unexpectedly well preserved in the human genome. The gene retained its ability to produce an envelope protein for about 13 to 19 million years. It is likely that ancient primates ‘hijacked’ the viral gene and used the protein it produced to remove the MCT1 protein from the surface of their own cells. Without MCT1 on the surface, HERV-T was unable to infect the cells. Thus, these findings present an example of how viruses themselves can provide the genetic material that animals use to combat them, potentially leading to their extinction.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22519.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22519.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Endogenous retrovirus</kwd><kwd>Hominid</kwd><kwd>Paleovirology</kwd><kwd>receptors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37AI064003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bieniasz</surname><given-names>Paul D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bieniasz</surname><given-names>Paul D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gifford</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The reconstitution of a functional envelope protein from an extinct hominid retrovirus reveals its receptor and an ancient host defense that may have led to the extinction of the virus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>When the targets of a given retrovirus include host cells that will become part of the germ-line, viral sequences can become inherited and sometimes fixed in host populations. Indeed, about 8% of the human genome is composed of inactive or fragmented endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lander et al., 2001</xref>). A few retroviral genes and regulatory DNA elements have been exapted to perform diverse host functions, such as syncytial trophoblast fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lavialle et al., 2013</xref>), and transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chuong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fort et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Macfarlan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rebollo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ting et al., 1992</xref>).

Indeed, <italic>gag</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Best et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murcia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yan et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>env</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gardner et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ito et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kozak, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McDougall et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Robinson and Lamoreux, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Spencer et al., 2003</xref>), and accessory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Czarneski et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frankel et al., 1991</xref>) from endogenous viruses have been shown to contribute to host defense against exogenous retroviruses, through a variety of mechanisms.</p><p>Although some functions have been ascribed to exapted retroviral fragments, most provide no obvious advantage to their host. Nonetheless, endogenous proviruses represent a fossil record of past infections, enabling the study of ‘paleovirology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Emerman and Malik, 2010</xref>). In particular, the synthesis of consensus or deduced ancestral sequences based on retroviral fossils has enabled the functional analyses of reconstructed proteins from ancient, presumptively extinct, retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewannieux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldstone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaiser et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and Bieniasz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perez-Caballero et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Soll et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Numerous members of the gammaretrovirus genus currently circulate in mammalian species, but exogenous gammaretroviruses appear absent from modern humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bénit et al., 2001</xref>). A key question in virology, that is potentially answerable using paleovirological analyses, is what caused the elimination of extinct viral lineages? Here, we address this question for an extinct lineage of gammaretroviruses that replicated in ancient primates (HERV-T) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blusch et al., 1997</xref>). While no functional HERV-T genes have been found in available modern primate genomes, we show that a single HERV-T <italic>env</italic> gene was apparently exapted in hominids. We find that the product of this HERV-T <italic>env</italic> gene can block retroviral infection mediated by a reconstructed, functional ancestral HERV-T env, by depleting the HERV-T receptor from cell surfaces. Thus, this exapted <italic>env</italic> gene may have driven the extinction of HERV-T from hominids.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Using similarity search-based approaches, we constructed a comprehensive catalog of HERV-T fossils in old world monkey (OWM) and ape genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis of near-complete proviral elements revealed three major HERV-T clades (T1–T3), each of which was associated with phylogenetically distinct LTR sequences, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Two clades (HERV-T3 and HERV-T2) were previously annotated (LTR6A and LTR6B in RepBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bao et al., 2015</xref>]) while a third (HERV-T1) was novel. Other HERV-T-like sequences (found by similarity to HERV-T protein-coding genes) are present in new world monkeys (platyrrhini primates) and documented in Repbase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bao et al., 2015</xref>). The presence of orthologous HERV-T loci in various primate species, and integration dates estimated from LTR divergence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), indicated that the infectious ancestor of HERV-T entered primate germlines between ~43 and ~32 MY ago (MYA). Additional germline integration events occurred in various primate lineages for the ensuing 25 MY, with the most recent integrations that became fixed in primates having occurred ~11 MYA in hominids and ~8 MYA in macaques (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of recovered HERV-T fossils indicated that the HERV-T2 clade derives from a single, hypermutated HERV-T1 element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and likely expanded by complementation in-trans. HERV-T3 represented the oldest HERV-T clade in catarrhini primates, with integration dates ranging from ~8 to ~30 MYA, and had the highest overall copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). There was some support for the division of HERV-T3 into two sub-clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Using a maximum likelihood approach we inferred the sequence of an infectious ancestral HERV-T3 from near complete proviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Unlike fossilized viral elements, the reconstructed ancestral sequence had <italic>gag</italic>, <italic>pol</italic> and <italic>env</italic> genes with full coding potential, and revealed the likely presence of an additional open reading frame (ORF) of unknown function, located 5’ to <italic>gag</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Therefore, DF-1 cells, which exhibited the lowest susceptibility to MLV-ancHTenv, were selected to identify candidate HERV-T receptors as they would give the lowest ‘background’ level of infection in the context of a cDNA library screen. We generated a lentivirus-based human cDNA library from human 293T cells, which were among the most highly permissive cell lines tested, and then iteratively challenged and selected library-transduced DF-1 cells with MLV-ancHTenv virions containing antibiotic resistance or fluorescent protein genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This procedure progressively enriched MLV-ancHTenv-susceptible DF-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Lentiviral-vector directed PCR primers were then used to identify a human cDNA in the selected cells, that encoded human monocarboxylate transporter 1 (hMCT1, also known as SLC16A1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), a 12-pass transmembrane protein that mediates the transport of monocarboxylates such as lactate and pyruvate across the plasma membrane, and is upregulated in some cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Halestrap, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2013</xref>). Reintroduction of an hMCT1 cDNA into naïve DF-1 cells rendered them highly sensitive to infection with MLV-ancHTenv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Moreover, MCT1 expression in DF-1 cells also conferred dramatically enhanced ability to bind to MLV Gag-GFP virus-like particles (VLPs) pseudotyped with ancHTenv, but had no effect on the low-level binding of VLPs that lacked an Env protein or incorporated an ecotropic MLV envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Later, ~19–13 MYA, a HERV-T Env sequence (represented approximately by ancHTenv<sup>16MYA</sup>) was exapted by ancestral hominids and to serve as an antiviral gene. AncHTenv<sup>16MYA</sup> apparently functioned by interacting with MCT1, either at the cell surface promoting its internalization, or in the secretory pathway, blocking its transport to the plasma membrane, leading to MCT1 degradation and its depletion from the cell surface. This process is analogous to the specific receptor interference phenomena observed in retroviral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nethe et al., 2005</xref>) and exploited by endogenous <italic>env</italic> genes that exhibit antiviral activity in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gardner et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ito et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kozak, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Robinson and Lamoreux, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Spencer et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Given the fusogenic potential of ancHTenv, it is likely that the progenitor of hsaHTenv would have imposed a fitness cost on its ancestral hominid host. We speculate that the progenitor of hsaHTenv acquired mutations either concurrent with, or after, its integration that resulted in loss of its fusogenic potential (e.g. furin cleavage site mutations). This sequence (represented approximately by ancHTenv<sup>16MYA</sup>) retained full length open reading frame and MCT1 binding activity, and became fixed in the ancestral hominid population. Indeed, it is plausible that this exapted gene might have contributed to the apparent extinction of HERV-T from hominids at some point after the deposition of the most recent fixed hominid germline insertion, ~11 MYA.</p><p>The selection pressures acting on hsaHTenv, its orthologs and progenitors might have been complex. Loss of fusogenicity but retention of receptor binding activity are, in a sense, opposing influences in terms of maintenance of the ORF and its function. Moreover, although some purifying selective pressure (low dN/dS) can be detected in hsaHTenv and its orangutan ortholog, a relaxation of those forces might be expected to have occurred after HERV-T extinction, perhaps leading to reduced antiviral activity observed in modern hsaHTenv. Finally, as MCT-1 is a moncaboxylate transporter that is upregulated in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Halestrap, 2013</xref>), the ability of hsaHTenv to deplete MCT1 from cell surfaces may suggest an additional or alternative metabolism-related cellular or even anti-tumor functions and selective pressures. Such an activity might have continued to shape hsaHTenv sequence independent of anti-HERV-T activity.

Cells were washed three times with PBS before being treated with goat anti-mouse and/or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 and/or 594 dye, Life technologies, CA, RRIDs: AB_2534091, AB_2534088, AB_2534095, AB_2576217) diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20% and 5% goat serum for 1 hr at room temperature. DNA was stained with 50 μg/ml of DAPI (diluted in PBS) (Invitrogen) for 5 s. Cells were washed three more times with PBS and fluorescent microscopy images were analyzed using the a DeltaVision microscope (GE Healthcare) or the EVOS FL Cell Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Assay for effects of HERV-T Env on infection</title><p>Viruses were generated in 293T cells transfected with plasmids expressing HIV-1 gag-pol polyprotein (pCRV1), VSV glycoprotein and pCCIGW (IRES-GFP) plasmids and expressing the various HERV-T envelopes described above, or an unrelated protein as control (SIVgab Nef) using polyethylenimine. Viruses were harvested and filtered (0.22 µm) two days after transfection and were used to transduce 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> naïve 293T cells or 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> DF-1 clones expressing HA-tagged hMCT1. Transduced cells were expanded in 10 cm dishes until reaching confluency. Afterwards, serial dilutions of MLV expressing RFP (pCNCR) pseudotyped with ancHTenv were used to infect 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> transduced cells in 96 well plates. Two days post infection the number of GFP+, RFP+ and double positive cells were counted by FACS using a CyFlow space cytometer (Partec, Görlitz, Germany). The resulting data was analyzed with the FlowJo analysis software. The percentage of RFP positive cells was calculated after gating on the GFP positive population.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Cell fusion analysis</title><p>293T cells were transduced with a lentivirus vector (CCIGW) expressing various HERV-T envelopes or a control protein (SIVgab Nef) (described above) and then fixed and stained with DAPI (described above). Multinucleated cells (&gt;5 nuclei) and cells expressing the GFP reporter (indicative of the expression of the corresponding HERV-T envelope) were counted in three groups of ten microscopic fields and the number of multinucleated GFP+ cells as a percentage of the total number GFP+ cells was calculated for each condition.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5"

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Co-option of an endogenous retrovirus envelope for host defense in hominid ancestors&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Wenhui Li (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Welkin E Johnson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Blanco-Melo et al. utilize comparative analysis of 'fossilized' endogenous retroviruses of the HERV-T group from human and ape genomes in order to deduce the putative ancestor, and then elegantly demonstrate the ability of its envelope to infect a variety of cell lines when pseudotyped with MLV. The authors identify a candidate human receptor, MCT-1, by challenging very low permissive cells (DF-1) transduced with a cDNA library constructed from highly permissive cells (293T) with ancestral ERV-T env pseudotyped virions; reintroduction of the MCT-1 cDNA alone rendered DF-1 highly permissive to infection mediated by the ancestral envelope. The authors investigate a HERV-T locus that has, quite remarkably, retained its env ORF in humans despite millions of years of evolution, suggesting selective pressures acting on the HERV-T env. Blanco-Melo et al. show that this env is not fusogenic and is not able to infect cell lines that are otherwise sensitive to the ancestral ERV-T env. Endogenous levels of MCT-1 are depleted in the presence of either the HERV-T env or its direct ancestor, and expression of the constructs in MCT-1 expressing cells reduced infection from ancestral ERV-T env pseudo typed MLV, suggesting antiviral protective effects from this exapted viral gene.</p><p>The manuscript expands the number of known receptors used by this particular &quot;type&quot; of envelope glycoprotein, which is characterized by covalently linked SU and TM domains, and raises the issue of whether the phenomenon of exaptation of ERV as resistance genes is a widespread phenomenon – although the paper only amounts to proof in principle for the exaptation story, it sets a standard for how Erv glycoproteins should be investigated. It will be interesting to see whether the patterns observed here are unique to HERV-T or represent a predictable pattern among other ERV in other vertebrate lineages. Altogether, this is a very nice study.</p><p>The work from Blanco-Melo is compelling and the experimental quality is high. The findings are novel and suggest a scenario of evolutionary preservation of the HERV-T env to confer antiviral protection in primate ancestors following germline invasion of primate ancestors starting ~43-32 mya (and thereby leading to HERV-T extinction), consistent with observations of receptor interference in other retroviruses and exaptation of env for antiviral purposes in other species. The work is very nicely done and concise in presentation and in its findings and interpretation(s) therein. The work clearly offers fundamental biological insight on the basis of the importance and impact of viral proteins in the mechanisms that shape the evolutionary arms race with the host, and the utility of such endogenous sequences as raw material for exaptation in the host. The findings are novel and infer clear biological importance. The conclusions presented by Blanco-Melo et al. are clear and are justified by the experimentation. Likewise, the experiments are designed succinctly to directly test and in turn support the authors' overall hypothesis. In my opinion, there are not major concerns that should impede publication of the work, although minor concerns are pointed out below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors estimate HERV-T to have begun germline invasion ~43-32 mya, and estimate the HERV-T3 clade insertions, as a group, from ~8-30 mya; the insertion containing the preserved env reading frame was placed at ~7-19 mya, and then adjusted based on species distribution. The age estimation for the 'most recent' hominid insertion is then given in the Discussion as ~11mya. Is this value as obtained for the adjusted estimation for the insertion? Is this meant to suggest that insertion was the last ERV-T to enter the hominid line?</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> the authors show depletion of endogenous MCT-1 in 293T cells in the presence of the ancestral ERV-T and HERV-T envelope proteins. I am curious about the relative levels of depletion between the various envelope proteins. MCT-1 appears to be comparatively less in the presence of the ancestral envelopes than in the hsaHTenv; This would imply the contemporary human hsaT env has, over time, lost at least some MCT-1 interference. In terms of the evolution of the envelope protein and receptor does this suggest the ancestral forms are 'better' at targeting MCT-1?</p><p>3) The experiments showing that HERV-T envelope expression can block infection are convincing, but I have some concerns with the evidence that the hsaHTenv ORF was maintained due to selective pressure. The evolution simulation results are interesting, but not very informative without knowing the number of HERV-T proviruses in the genome, e.g. if there were 20 HERV-T env ORFs that integrated during that time period, on average we would expect one ORF to be maintained by chance, according to this simulation. The analysis is further complicated by the presence of older proviruses that would have had a smaller, but non-zero probability of having their env ORFs preserved to the present day by chance. It would be helpful to have information on dN/dS ratios for these sequences – if this gene has been exapted some level of purifying selection would be expected. If its only function was to protect against a long-extinct virus the selective pressures would have been relaxed since then, which might obscure the signs of selection somewhat, but it seems likely that at least some signature of selection at the residue level would remain.</p><p>4) For reasons that are unclear to us, this paper was submitted as a Short Report, although it contains much more than the &quot;single series&quot; of experiments specified for this format. The result is that some results that could be included in the results are relegated to supplemental, and both the Introduction and Discussion are severely constrained. There is a reasonably rich body of literature on exaptation of endogenous viruses that prevent infection by exogenous retroviruses that is barely mentioned here. These include not only the ALV and MLV case briefly mentioned in the Discussion, which, like HERV-T encode blocking env proteins, but also MMTV and JSRV which use very different mechanisms. Also, worth discussing is the possible contribution of the furin cleavage mutations or the C-terminal deletion in exaptation. The reader is shortchanged by the brevity enforced by the format.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22519.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors estimate HERV-T to have begun germline invasion ~43-32 mya, and estimate the HERV-T3 clade insertions, as a group, from ~8-30 mya; the insertion containing the preserved env reading frame was placed at ~7-19 mya, and then adjusted based on species distribution.

These data suggest that the most recent insertions occurred about 11MYA, with one noticeable outlier. This is indicated at the end of the first paragraph of the Results section, “with the last detectable integration having occurred ~8 MYA” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This outlier is found only in macaques, not hominids.” We have changed the wording at the end of the first paragraph of the Results section, and in the Discussion to be clearer on this point.</p><p><italic>Is this meant to suggest that insertion was the last ERV-T to enter the hominid line?</italic> </p><p>We did not intend to suggest that the 11MYA and 8MYA integrations are the last to have occurred in primates, however we concede that the wording in the original draft did suggest this. We can reasonably state that 11MYA and 8MYA are estimates for the dates at which the most recent integrations <italic>that became fixed</italic> in ancestral primates occurred. It is possible that additional more recent integrations occurred that never became fixed and were purged from primates, and are thus invisible to us. Again, we have amended the wording in the first Results paragraph and the Discussion to be more explicit about this.</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> the authors show depletion of endogenous MCT-1 in 293T cells in the presence of the ancestral ERV-T and HERV-T envelope proteins.

However, our data is actually a little ambiguous on this point – the ancestral forms appear more potent antiviral proteins than hsaHTenv in 293T cells, but roughly equivalently active in DF1/MCT1 cells (this might reflect differences in MCT1 expression levels in the two systems). This ambiguity led us to leave out a discussion of this point in the original paper – however we recognize that it perhaps should have been discussed and we have mentioned it in the revision.</p><p><italic>3) The experiments showing that HERV-T envelope expression can block infection are convincing, but I have some concerns with the evidence that the hsaHTenv ORF was maintained due to selective pressure.

We have modified the text to include such considerations, and strengthen the case that hsaHTenv indeed preserved:</p><p>A) We agree with the reviewers that (dN/dS) analyses could add support to the notion that hsaHTenv has been preserved. Due to the small number (three) of orthologous integrations for this locus (Human, Gorilla and Orangutan), we performed pairwise comparisons between these sequences and included the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Briefly, we found signs of purifying selection (dN/dS &lt; 1) between the human and orangutan sequences that, unlike the gorilla sequence, show a preserved env ORF. This result is consistent with the notion the purifying selection acted on this gene following its insertion into ancestral hominids. Note that a possible need to inactivate fusogenenicity would mitigate against the detection of purifying selection at this locus.</p><p>B) While it is true that ~1:20 env genes of the same age would be expected to be preserved by chance, and the presence of older proviruses slightly complicates the interpretation of our simulations, this argument makes the assumption that there is no penalty (fitness cost) associated with expression of an intact env gene – which we think is unlikely, given that ancHTenv is fusogenic this is mentioned in the revised Discussion.</p><p>C) We note the quite striking difference in the number of inactivating mutations in the Gag and Pol genes of the orthologous provirus as compared to Env. This observation, we think, significantly strengthens the argument that hsaHTenv was selectively preserved.</p><p>D) We also note that the hsaHTenv and orthologous orangutan and Gorilla sequence are mutated in a similar way – i.e. at the SU-TM boundary, preserving receptor binding, but inactivating fusogenicity.</p><p><italic>4) For reasons that are unclear to us, this paper was submitted as a Short Report, although it contains much more than the &quot;single series&quot; of experiments specified for this format.
