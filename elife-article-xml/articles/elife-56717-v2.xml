restricted, as well as structurally diverse specialized metabolites via multistep metabolic pathways. Hallmarks of specialized metabolic evolution include enzymatic promiscuity and recruitment of primary metabolic enzymes and examples of genomic clustering of pathway genes. Solanaceae glandular trichomes produce defensive acylsugars, with sidechains that vary in length across the family. We describe a tomato gene cluster on chromosome 7 involved in medium chain acylsugar accumulation due to trichome specific acyl-CoA synthetase and enoyl-CoA hydratase genes. This cluster co-localizes with a tomato steroidal alkaloid gene cluster and is syntenic to a chromosome 12 region containing another acylsugar pathway gene. We reconstructed the evolutionary events leading to this gene cluster and found that its phylogenetic distribution correlates with medium chain acylsugar accumulation across the Solanaceae. This work reveals insights into the dynamics behind gene cluster evolution and cell-type specific metabolite diversity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants produce a vast variety of different molecules known as secondary or specialized metabolites to attract pollinating insects, such as bees, or protect themselves against herbivores and pests. The secondary metabolites are made from simple building blocks that are readily available in plants, including amino acids, fatty acids and sugars.</p><p>Different species of plant, and even different parts of the same plant, produce their own sets of secondary metabolites. For example, the hairs on the surface of tomatoes and other members of the nightshade family of plants make metabolites known as acylsugars. These chemicals deter herbivores and pests from damaging the plants.</p><p>To make acylsugars, the plants attach long chains known as fatty acyl groups to molecules of sugar, such as sucrose. Some members of the nightshade family produce acylsugars with longer chains than others. In particular, acylsugars with long chains are only found in tomatoes and other closely-related species. It remained unclear how the nightshade family evolved to produce acylsugars with chains of different lengths.</p><p>To address this question, Fan et al. used genetic and biochemical approaches to study tomato plants and other members of the nightshade family. The experiments identified two genes known as <italic>AACS</italic> and <italic>AECH</italic> in tomatoes that produce acylsugars with long chains. These two genes originated from the genes of older enzymes that metabolize fatty acids – the building blocks of fats – in plant cells. Unlike the older genes, <italic>AACS</italic> and <italic>AECH</italic> were only active at the tips of the hairs on the plant’s surface. Fan et al. then investigated the evolutionary relationship between 11 members of the nightshade family and two other plant species. This revealed that <italic>AACS</italic> and <italic>AECH</italic> emerged in the nightshade family around the same time that longer chains of acylsugars started appearing.</p><p>These findings provide insights into how plants evolved to be able to produce a variety of secondary metabolites that may protect them from a broader range of pests. The gene cluster identified in this work could be used to engineer other species of crop plants to start producing acylsugars as natural pesticides.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Solanum quitoense</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Solanum pennellii</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1546617</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shiu</surname><given-names>Shin-Han</given-names></name><name><surname>Last</surname><given-names>Robert L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1655386</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shiu</surname><given-names>Shin-Han</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BER DE-SC0018409</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shiu</surname><given-names>Shin-Han</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1727362</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brandizzi</surname><given-names>Federica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM110523</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leong</surname><given-names>Bryan J</given-names></name><name><surname>Last</surname><given-names>Robert L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1757043</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Combs</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name><name><surname>Last</surname><given-names>Robert L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1811055</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schenck</surname><given-names>Craig A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A nightshade family gene cluster creates phenotypic novelty in trichome defensive metabolites via evolution of lipid metabolic enzymes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite the enormous structural diversity of plant specialized metabolites, they are derived from a relatively small number of primary metabolites, such as sugars, amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maeda, 2019</xref>). These lineage-, tissue- or cell- type specific specialized metabolites mediate environmental interactions, such as herbivore and pathogen deterrence or pollinator and symbiont attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mithöfer and Boland, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pichersky and Lewinsohn, 2011</xref>). Specialized metabolism evolution is primarily driven by gene duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moghe and Last, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Panchy et al., 2016</xref>), and relaxed selection of the resulting gene pairs allows modification of cell- and tissue-specific gene expression and changes in enzymatic activity. This results in expanded substrate recognition and/or diversified product formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leong and Last, 2017</xref>). The neofunctionalized enzymes can prime the origin and diversification of specialized metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schenck and Last, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weng, 2014</xref>).</p><p>There are many examples of mechanisms that lead to novel enzymatic activities in specialized cell- or tissue-types, however, the principles that govern assembly of multi-enzyme specialized metabolic pathways are less well established. One appealing hypothesis involves the stepwise recruitment of pathway enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Noda-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>). In rare cases, non-homologous specialized metabolic enzyme genes occur in proximity to each other in a genomic region, forming a biosynthetic gene cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nützmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nützmann and Osbourn, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rokas et al., 2018</xref>). In recent years, an increasing number of specialized metabolic gene clusters (SMGCs) were experimentally identified or bioinformatically predicted in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutanaev et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castillo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schläpfer et al., 2017</xref>). However, although most experimentally characterized plant SMGCs are co-expressed, the majority of the bioinformatically predicted ones do not show coexpression under global network analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wisecaver et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>While examples of SMGCs are still relatively rare in plants, experimentally validated cases were reported for a surprisingly diverse group of pathways. These include terpenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chae et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prisic et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Qi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wilderman et al., 2004</xref>), cyclic hydroxamic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frey et al., 1997</xref>), biosynthetically unrelated alkaloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Itkin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Winzer et al., 2012</xref>), polyketides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schneider et al., 2016</xref>), cyanogenic glucosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takos et al., 2011</xref>), and modified fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeon et al., 2020</xref>). However, whereas each cluster encodes multiple non-homologous enzymes of a biosynthetic pathway, evolution of their assembly is not well understood.</p><p>Acylsugars are a group of insecticidal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leckie et al., 2016</xref>) and anti-inflammatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herrera-Salgado et al., 2005</xref>) chemicals mainly observed in glandular trichomes of Solanaceae species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schuurink and Tissier, 2020</xref>). These specialized metabolites are sugar aliphatic esters with three levels of structural diversity across the Solanaceae family: acyl chain length, acylation position, and sugar core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fan et al., 2019</xref>). The primary metabolites sucrose and aliphatic acyl-CoAs are the biosynthetic precursors of acylsucroses in plants as evolutionarily divergent as the cultivated tomato <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), <italic>Petunia axillaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nadakuduti et al., 2017</xref>) and <italic>Salpiglossis sinuata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moghe et al., 2017</xref>). The core tomato acylsucrose biosynthetic pathway involves four BAHD [<bold>B</bold>EAT, <bold>A</bold>HCT, <bold>H</bold>CBT, <bold>D</bold>AT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D'Auria, 2006</xref>) family acylsucrose acyltransferases (<italic>Sl-ASAT1</italic> through <italic>Sl-ASAT4</italic>), which are specifically expressed in the type I/IV trichome tip cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schilmiller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schilmiller et al., 2012</xref>). These enzymes catalyze consecutive reactions utilizing sucrose and acyl-CoA substrates to produce the full set of cultivated tomato acylsucroses in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Primary metabolites are biosynthetic precursors of tomato trichome acylsugars.</title><p>In cultivated tomatoes, the trichome acylsucroses are synthesized by four Sl-ASATs using the primary metabolites – sucrose and different types of acyl-CoAs – as substrates.

One example is an invertase-like enzyme originating from carbohydrate metabolism that generates acylglucoses in the wild tomato <italic>S. pennellii</italic> through cleavage of the acylsucrose glycosidic bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leong et al., 2019</xref>). In another case, allelic variation of a truncated isopropylmalate synthase-like enzyme (IPMS3) – from branched chain amino acid metabolism – leads to acylsugar iC4/iC5 (2-methylpropanoic/3-methylbutanoic acid) acyl chain diversity in <italic>S. pennellii</italic> and <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ning et al., 2015</xref>). Acylsugar structural diversity is even more striking across the family. Previous studies revealed variation in acyl chain length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moghe et al., 2017</xref>): <italic>Nicotiana</italic>, <italic>Petunia</italic> and <italic>Salpiglossis</italic> species were reported to accumulate acylsugars containing only short acyl chains (carbon number, C ≤ 8). In contrast, some species in <italic>Solanum</italic> and other closely related genera produce acylsugars with medium acyl chains (C ≥ 10). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the capability to produce medium chain acylsugars varies across the Solanaceae family.</p><p>In this study, we identify a metabolic gene cluster on tomato chromosome 7 containing two non-homologous genes – acylsugar acyl-CoA synthetase (<italic>AACS</italic>) and acylsugar enoyl-CoA hydratase (<italic>AECH</italic>) – affecting medium chain acylsugar biosynthesis. Genetic and biochemical results show that the trichome enriched <italic>AACS</italic> and <italic>AECH</italic> are involved in generating medium chain acyl-CoAs, which are donor substrates for acylsugar biosynthesis. Genomic analysis revealed a syntenic region on chromosome 12, where the acylsucrose biosynthetic <italic>Sl-ASAT1</italic> is located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fan et al., 2016</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis of the syntenic regions in Solanaceae and beyond led to evolutionary reconstruction of the origin of the acylsugar gene cluster.

This analysis revealed a model for the temporal order of emergence for the three types of genes, leading to their presence in the syntenic regions in extant Solanaceae plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We propose that the BAHD acyltransferase was the first of three genes that emerged before the divergence between Solanaceae and Rubiaceae, and was likely lost in Convolvulaceae. This hypothesis is based on the discovery of a BAHD acyltransferase pseudogene in the syntenic region of <italic>C. canephora</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is one of the closest <italic>Coffea</italic> sequences sister to the ASAT clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). In our model, ECH was likely inserted into the syntenic region before the Solanaceae-specific whole genome duplication (WGD) event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We propose that ACS was inserted into the synteny through segmental duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, whether ACS insertion happened before or after the Solanaceae-specific WGD event cannot be resolved by the phylogenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). If the insertion happened before WGD, one ACS gene loss on chromosome 12 in <italic>Solanum</italic> – as well as two independent gene losses on chromosomes 7 and 12 in both <italic>Petunia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>) and in <italic>Salpiglossis sinuata</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>) – should have happened. However, if the insertion happened after WGD, then only one gene loss in <italic>Petunia</italic> and <italic>Salpiglossis</italic> needs to be invoked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>). The latter scenario is more likely based on the principle of parsimony.</p><p>Our ancestral state reconstruction inference supports the notion that the medium chain acylsugars co-emerged with the ACS/ECH genes in the syntenic regions in the common ancestor of <italic>Solanum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6—figure supplement 7</xref>). This leads us to propose that the emergence of both ACS and ECH genes in the synteny was a prerequisite for the rise of medium chain acylsugars in Solanaceae species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Consistent with the hypothesis, only short chain acylsugars were observed in <italic>Petunia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s8">Figure 6—figure supplement 8</xref>), which correlates with the absence of ACS homolog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, medium chain acylsugars were detected throughout <italic>Solanum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s8">Figure 6—figure supplement 8</xref>), supported by the observation that both ACS and ECH homologs are present in extant <italic>Solanum</italic> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, although <italic>Nicotiana</italic> species collectively have both ACS and ECH genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), they do not produce medium chain acylsugars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s8">Figure 6—figure supplement 8</xref>) presumably due to gene losses. For example, the ECH homologs are pseudogenes in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> and <italic>N. tomentosiformis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These results show that the presence of both functional ACS and ECH genes are associated with the accumulation of medium chain acylsugars, supporting our hypothesis above.</p><p>Although no medium chain acylsugars were detected in <italic>Nicotiana</italic> species examined, the ACS and ECH genes may have been present in the syntenic region prior to divergence of <italic>Solanum</italic> and <italic>Nicotiana</italic>.

To test this hypothesis, we extended the phenotypic analysis to six such Solanaceae genera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s8">Figure 6—figure supplement 8</xref>).

The discovery of this locus was prompted by our observation of increased C10 containing acylsugars in tomato recombinant lines carrying this region from the wild tomato <italic>S. pennellii</italic> chromosome 7. In vitro biochemistry revealed that Sl-AACS1 produces acyl-CoAs using C6-C12 fatty acids as substrates. The function of <italic>AACS1</italic> and <italic>AECH1</italic> in cultivated and wild tomato medium chain acylsugar biosynthesis was confirmed by genome editing, and extended to the phylogenetically distant <italic>S. quitoense</italic> using VIGS. The trichome tip cell-specific expression of these genes is similar to that of previously characterized acylsugar pathway genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>There are increasing examples of plant specialized metabolic innovation evolving from gene duplication and neofunctionalization of primary metabolic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maeda, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Milo and Last, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moghe and Last, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zi et al., 2014</xref>). Recruitment of <italic>Sl-AACS1</italic> and <italic>Sl-AECH1</italic> from fatty acid metabolism provides new examples of ‘hijacking’ primary metabolic genes into acylsugar biosynthesis, in addition to an isopropylmalate synthase (<italic>Sl-IPMS3</italic>) and an invertase (<italic>Sp-ASFF1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ning et al., 2015</xref>). We hypothesize that both AACS1 and AECH1 participate in generation of medium chain acyl-CoAs, the acyl donor substrates for ASAT-catalyzed acylsugar biosynthesis. Indeed, Sl-AACS1 exhibits in vitro function consistent with this hypothesis, efficiently utilizing medium chain fatty acids as substrates to synthesize acyl-CoAs. Strikingly, Sl-AECH1 perturbs membrane lipid composition when transiently expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves, generating unusual C12-chain membrane lipids.</p><p>These results suggest that evolution of trichome tip cell-specific gene expression potentiated the co-option of <italic>AACS1</italic> and <italic>AECH1</italic> in medium chain acylsugar biosynthesis. Analogous to trichomes producing medium chain acylsugars, seeds of phylogenetically diverse plants accumulate medium chain fatty acid storage lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ohlrogge et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, fatty acids with unusual structures, including those of medium chain lengths, are rarely found in membrane lipids, presumably because these would perturb membrane bilayer structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Millar et al., 2000</xref>). For example, seed embryo-specific expression of three neofunctionalized enzyme variant genes in <italic>Cuphea</italic> species – an acyl-ACP thioesterase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dehesh et al., 1996</xref>), a 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dehesh et al., 1998</xref>), and a diacylglycerol acyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iskandarov et al., 2017</xref>) – lead to production of medium chain seed storage lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Voelker and Kinney, 2001</xref>). Trichome tip cell restricted expression of <italic>AACS1</italic> and <italic>AECH1</italic> represents an analogous example of diverting neofunctionalized fatty acid enzymes from general metabolism into cell-specific specialized metabolism. It is notable that we obtained evidence that Sl-AACS1 and Sl-AECH1 are targeted to mitochondria. Because the other characterized acylsugar biosynthetic enzymes – ASATs and Sl-IPMS3 – appear to be cytoplasmic, these results suggest that medium chain acylsugar substrates are intracellularly transported within the trichome tip cell. It is worth noting that Sl-AACS1 seems to show higher activity with C8 fatty acid than with C10 or C12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, B and C), while no C8 containing acylsugars were described in tomato trichomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that C8 fatty acids are not synthesized in trichomes.</p><p>Beyond employing functional approaches, this study demonstrates the value of a combined comparative genomic and metabolomic analysis in reconstructing the evolutionary history of a gene cluster: in this case over tens of millions of years. We propose that the acylsugar gene cluster started with a ‘founder’ BAHD acyltransferase gene, followed by sequential insertion of ECH and ACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This de novo assembly process is analogous to evolution of the antimicrobial triterpenoid avenacin cluster in oat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Qi et al., 2004</xref>). There are two noteworthy features of our approach. First, reconstructing acylsugar gene cluster evolution in a phylogenetic context allows us to deduce cluster composition in extant species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Second, it links cluster genotype with acylsugar phenotype and allows inference of acylsugar diversity across the Solanaceae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s8">Figure 6—figure supplement 8</xref>).</p><p>The current architecture of the Solanaceae acylsugar synteny merely represents a snapshot of a genomic neighborhood that is dynamic, which echoes a recent study of triterpene biosynthetic gene clusters in the Brassicaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peters, 2020</xref>). De novo assembly of the gene cluster was accompanied by gene duplication, transposition, pseudogenization, and deletion in different genera. In the case of non-acylsugar producer <italic>Capsicum</italic>, although phylogenetic analysis revealed putative <italic>Sl-AACS1</italic> and <italic>Sl-AECH1</italic> orthologous genes, they are not harbored in the syntenic region, probably due to translocation or assembly quality issues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In <italic>Nicotiana</italic>, the ECH genes became pseudogenized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), which is associated with lack of detectable plant medium chain acylsugars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s8">Figure 6—figure supplement 8</xref>). In tomatoes, the trichome expressed <italic>Solyc07g043660</italic> derives from a recent tandem duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>), yet its deletion has no effect on trichome acylsugars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). A parsimonious explanation is that <italic>Solyc07g043660</italic> is experiencing functional divergence, which may eventually lead to pseudogenization as observed for other genes in the syntenic region.</p><p>In this study, we identified an acylsugar SMGC in the context of a multiple chromosome syntenic region. This synteny resulted from WGD, and the acylsugar-related genes are co-expressed, and involved in the same metabolic pathway. This resembles the tomato steroidal alkaloid gene cluster consisting of eight genes that are dispersed into two syntenic chromosome regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Itkin et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, this tomato alkaloid SMGC is located next to the acylsugar cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), which is reminiscent of two physically adjacent SMGCs in the fungus <italic>Aspergillus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wiemann et al., 2013</xref>). Tomato steroidal alkaloids and acylsugars both serve defensive roles in plants, but are biosynthetically and structurally distinct and are stored in different tissues. This raises intriguing questions. Did the separation of acylsugar and alkaloid SMGCs into two chromosomes occur contemporaneously and by the same mechanism? Did this colocalization confer selective advantage through additive or synergistic effects of multiple classes of defensive metabolites? Answering these questions requires continued mining and functional validation of metabolic gene clusters across broader plant species and analysis of impacts of clustering in evolutionary and ecological contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> M82)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Sl-AACS1</italic></td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">GeneBank: MT078737</td><td valign="top">Characterized and named in the results</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> M82)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Sl-AECH1</italic></td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">GeneBank: MT078736</td><td valign="top">Characterized and named in the results</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Solanum pennellii</italic> LA0716)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Sp-AACS1</italic></td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">GeneBank: MT078735</td><td valign="top">Characterized and named in the results</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Solanum pennellii</italic> LA0716)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Sp-AECH1</italic></td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">GeneBank: MT078734</td><td valign="top">Characterized and named in the results</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Solanum quitoense</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Sq-AACS1</italic></td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">GeneBank: MT078732</td><td valign="top">Characterized and named in the results</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Solanum quitoense</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Sq-AECH1</italic></td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">GeneBank: MT078731</td><td valign="top">Characterized and named in the results</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Solanum quitoense</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Sq_c35719</italic></td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">GeneBank: MT078733</td><td valign="top">Characterized and named in the results</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Trimmomatic</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic">http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011848">SCR_011848</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">TopHat</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml">http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_013035">SCR_013035</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Cufflinks</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cuffmerge/">http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cuffmerge/</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014597">SCR_014597</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">MCScanX-transposed</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chibba.pgml.uga.edu/mcscan2/transposed/">http://chibba.pgml.uga.edu/mcscan2/transposed/</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">RAxML</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/stamatak/standard-RAxML">https://github.com/stamatak/standard-RAxML</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_006086">SCR_006086</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Mesquite</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mesquiteproject.org/">https://www.mesquiteproject.org/</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_017994">SCR_017994</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials and trichome metabolite extraction</title><p>The seeds of cultivated tomato <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> M82 were obtained from the C.M.

accelerated the ability to identify specialized metabolite pathways moving the research from simple cataloging to begin asking deeper questions about how novelty evolves. In this work, the authors begin to study the evolution of a gene cluster within a plant family. This illustrates the complexity that will begin to be uncovered when these studies are more widely conducted.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Evolution of a plant gene cluster in Solanaceae and emergence of metabolic diversity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Reuben Peters (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is 'in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>'. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary and essential revisions:</p><p>This work looks into the potential evolution of a set of genes within the Solanaceae using a blend of biochemistry and phylogenetics.</p><p>In the revision, please:</p><p>1) Address the WGD vs other forms of structural variation (tandem duplication, duplication and distal movement, etc.) topics raised by the reviewers.</p><p>2) Describe the gene selection and include all possible genes that may be evolutionarily linked as indicated by reviewer 1.</p><p>3) Enhance the Introduction and Discussion to provide a broader view of clustered vs non-clustered pathways in plant specialized metabolism.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors provide strong evidence that the two genes are specifically expressed in the trichome tip cells and are involved in production of medium chain acylsugars. However, I found the comparative genomic analyses to be confusing. More work is necessary to support the authors' evolutionary model.</p><p>1) Evolutionary analysis</p><p>1a) The Figure 6 model is too simplistic to follow the evolutionary history of all the gene duplicates in the region, while the Figure 6 supplemental synteny plot is too small to interpret. In the supplemental, I can't tell which genes are ECHs, ACSs, etc. because the rectangles are too small. There are many ACS, BAHD, and ECH paralogs in this syntenic block and the evolutionary history of all these paralogs is unclear. Moreover, by focusing exclusively on the co-located genes, the authors miss an opportunity to evaluate the evolutionary history of these two (three?) genes more globally. Where/how did the ancestral AACS1 and AECH1 genes originate? Was there genomic rearrangment? Non tandem gene duplication? An expanded phylogenetic analysis would be very helpful here. An OrthoFinder analysis on the 13 genomes included in Figure 6, would quickly provide the raw gene families for these phylogenies. This would allow the authors to elaborate on when the hijacking of primary metabolism occurred (Discussion paragraph one). Are AACS1 and AECH1 grouping sister to genes involved in primary metabolism? Or are they grouping with additional homologs of unknown or specialized function?</p><p>1b) There are no methods provided for how the sequences were selected for the Figure 4—figure supplement 2C phylogeny and I didn't see any methods for alignment or tree construction either. The ECH-containing orthogroup on PLAZA (https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/versions/plaza_v4_dicots/) contain several other ECH homologs (Solyc07g043690.1, Solyc07g044730.2, Solyc07g044710.1, Solyc07g044720.1) that appear to be grouping between AECH1 and Solyc06g54520, but these sequences are not included in the supplemental phylogeny.</p><p>2) Framing</p><p>2a) The authors mention in the Abstract and again in the Introduction that specialized metabolic gene clusters (SMGCs) are a hallmark of plant specialized metabolism. This gives the impression that gene clusters in plants are more common than they are. In fungal and bacterial genomes, gene clusters predominate. In plants, the pattern is not nearly as straight forward. Many plant specialized pathways are not clustered, and those pathways that are clustered are only partially so (i.e. these clusters are missing pathway regulators, product transporters, additional accessory enzymes, etc., which are common in microbial clusters); see Wisecaver et al., 2017. Given the extensive literature on complex microbial SMGCs, referring to two co-located genes as a SMGC feels like a bit of a stretch without additional clarification. Sometimes the authors appear to include the BAHD in the gene cluster, sometimes it's referred to as a two gene cluster. I wasn't sure whether BAHD was perhaps already know to function earlier in the pathway? The gene wasn't differentially expressed in the trichomes, so is it not involved? If no, then why is it included in the model?</p><p>2b) Similarly, I question the use of the term supercluster here as well. The fumagillin and pseurotin superclusters in <italic>Aspergillus</italic> are at least 29 genes long, co-regulated, intertwined, and maintained in diverse <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species despite being in the telomeric region of otherwise rapidly rearranging genomes (Wiemann et al., 2013). Do the authors believe that the co-location of these genes is being maintained in <italic>Solanum</italic> and are the genes being co-regulated?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>General assessment. The research is similar in scope to a previous <italic>eLife</italic> publication by the Last lab (Moghe et al., 2017). I assume the biochemical and plant transformation experiments are valid; however, this is not my area of expertise, so I focus my comments on the comparative genomic and evolutionary claims.</p><p>1) Novelty and framework for discussing innovation in metabolism with respect to clusters and “superclusters.” The novelty of the manuscript (for researchers who work outside Solanaceae and trichome biology) lies in the final paragraph discussing how this may be the first paper to describe &quot;superclusters.&quot; The Abstract, Introduction and Discussion could all benefit by citing more literature that encompasses the ongoing debates about the prevalence of &quot;clusters&quot; or not. The authors ask this as a question in the final paragraph; however this has been addressed in research not cited here (for example, Wisecaver et al., 2017). As the paper currently reads, they leave off most research (aside from their own self citations) that is outside of the &quot;cluster paradigm&quot; of the Osbourn lab (e.g., Nutzmann et al., 2016). It would be interesting to know if a &quot;Wisecaver-type network analysis&quot; would get similar results.</p><p>2) Gene and genome duplication analyses. The authors discuss evolution and gene duplication; however, they do not use the genomic resources of the 13 species examined to phylogenetically evaluate whether the duplicates that may be involved in the phenotype are from whole genome duplication (WGD or polyploidy) vs. small scale duplication (SSD). Given that Solanaceae have a WGD (as a triplication shown in Figure 6A), it would seem important to investigate the acylsugar biosynthesis pathway in this context (and any inferred patterns of loss after triplication if now in single or duplicate copy).</p><p>3) Experimental Design. A species phylogeny is given in Figure 6B for the species analyzed and the corresponding results and discussion hypothesize gain and loss events. Do the authors use a formal ancestral reconstruction analysis to back up their evolutionary scenario or is it just using parsimony to explain biochemical observations? There are formal tools used by evolutionary biologists to infer trait evolution that could be used here. This would seem particularly relevant for any claims made about the other genera (<italic>Jaltomata</italic>, <italic>Physalis</italic>, <italic>Iochroma</italic>, <italic>Atropa</italic>, and <italic>Hyoscyamus</italic>) that have missing data. It is not required; however, there other resources for other genera and sister families that could be exploited in a transcriptome analysis (e.g. One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative. 2019. One thousand plant transcriptomes and phylogenomics of green plants. Nature 574: 679-685).</p><p>Otherwise, this is an excellent manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes investigation of biosynthesis of medium chain length acylsugars in the Solanaceae, involving identification of an intriguing biosynthetic gene cluster. In particular, two new enzymes are identified and characterized here, which were found to be part of a complex genetic loci containing three different types of enzymes, each of which has undergone multiple tandem gene duplication. However, those for the “other” (third) enzyme in the original (chromosome 7) cluster are not required for this medium chain acylsugar biosynthesis, but rather a paralog on chromosome 12 instead. Intriguingly, this cluster is adjacent to the larger portion of the split cluster previously identified for steroidal alkaloid biosynthesis. It is tempting to speculate that assembly, with subsequent splitting, occurred together. Although the authors have avoided this more speculative hypothesis, it might be of interest to look at conservation of the split steroidal alkaloid cluster, analogous to that already reported here for the acylsugar biosynthetic cluster, to examine this hypothesis. In addition, one of the biochemical findings reported here is somewhat puzzling. Specifically, the characterized activity of the acylsugar acyl-CoA synthetase (AACS) seems to be higher with short, particularly C8, rather than medium (&gt;C10) chain length fatty acids. The authors should at least note this in the Discussion. Otherwise the work is solid, the results interesting and well-presented.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Evolution of a plant gene cluster in Solanaceae and emergence of metabolic diversity&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Christian Hardtke (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Please see the few questions by reviewer 1 that need editorial clarification within the manuscript. Other readers will likely have the same thoughts and any effort to address these questions would be greatly helpful to the future use of the paper by the community.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This revision satisfies most of my comments on the previous draft. The evolutionary analysis of the three gene families is much improved.</p><p>Could the segmental duplication of acyl-CoA have occurred in an ancestor of <italic>Solanum</italic> and <italic>Nicotiana</italic> following the divergence from <italic>Petunia</italic>? That seems like the most parsimonious explanation. What am I missing?</p><p>In the response to my earlier comment, the authors say that understanding of the mechanism of hijacking primary metabolism for acylsugar biosynthesis requires future work. However, the manuscript still reports to provide insights into this co-option in several places. Can the authors tone down these statements or make it more explicit what they mean here?</p><p>I think the point of the co-expression analysis was missed a bit by focusing only on other ACS, ECH, and BAHDs. It looks like the Moore et al., 2020 study called modules of co-expressed genes using several different metrics, while here the authors only report the pairwise coexpression between ACS, ECH, and BAHDs without binning these genes into discrete modules or looking for associations with other gene families.

The authors conducted the additional analyses that the external reviewers requested (e.g., co-expression analyses, updated ancestral state reconstruction) and added references and addressed issues raised. I appreciate that the authors found errors in their previous analyses and dropped the <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> AcS gene result given what the updated syntenic analyses found. I was slightly disappointed that the authors have still not been able to clearly disentangle the impact of whole genome duplications versus tandem duplications on this pathway (and the order of what may be nested tandem duplications) or did not find any genomic footprints for putative losses; however, this is likely due to incomplete genome sequence and taxon sampling and thus beyond the scope of what can be inferred at this time.

In the supplemental, I can't tell which genes are ECHs, ACSs, etc. because the rectangles are too small. There are many ACS, BAHD, and ECH paralogs in this syntenic block and the evolutionary history of all these paralogs is unclear. Moreover, by focusing exclusively on the co-located genes, the authors miss an opportunity to evaluate the evolutionary history of these two (three?) genes more globally. Where/how did the ancestral AACS1 and AECH1 genes originate? Was there genomic rearrangment? Non tandem gene duplication? An expanded phylogenetic analysis would be very helpful here. An OrthoFinder analysis on the 13 genomes included in Figure 6, would quickly provide the raw gene families for these phylogenies. This would allow the authors to elaborate on when the hijacking of primary metabolism occurred (Discussion paragraph one). Are AACS1 and AECH1 grouping sister to genes involved in primary metabolism? Or are they grouping with additional homologs of unknown or specialized function?</p></disp-quote><p>1) The Figure 6-supplemental figure with the synteny plot was improved. Large arrows with three different colors were used in the figure to point out the genes from the three families. The raw data with gene ID and location information used to generate this figure was included as a supplementary file.</p><p>2) We performed phylogenetic analysis to better understand the evolutionary history of ACS, ECH, and BAHD acyltransferase in the syntenic regions and provided a clearer picture of how these orthologs/paralogs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis evolved. Homologous genes of Sl-AACS1 (ACS), Sl-AECH1(ECH), and Solyc07g043670 (BAHD acyltransferase) were obtained through BLAST from the genomes of 13 species and were used to build three phylogenetic trees as shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 2, 3, and 4. The evolutionary history and duplication mechanisms that gave rise to the genes in the syntenic regions of different Solanaceae species were inferred. The phylogenetic analysis supports our proposed evolution model regarding the temporal order of emergence of the three types of genes in the syntenic region.</p><p>3) After this more detailed analysis, both AACS1 and AECH1 group sister to additional homologs with uncharacterized functions. Thus, future efforts will be required to further our understanding of the mechanism of “hijacking” primary metabolism for acylsugar biosynthesis. The Discussion was modified to reflect the new phylogenetic analysis results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1b) There are no methods provided for how the sequences were selected for the Figure 4—figure supplement 2C phylogeny and I didn't see any methods for alignment or tree construction either. The ECH-containing orthogroup on PLAZA (https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/versions/plaza_v4_dicots/) contain several other ECH homologs (Solyc07g043690.1, Solyc07g044730.2, Solyc07g044710.1, Solyc07g044720.1) that appear to be grouping between AECH1 and Solyc06g54520, but these sequences are not included in the supplemental phylogeny.</p></disp-quote><p>Methods for building the phylogenetic tree in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 was added to the figure legend. The purpose of this tree is to assist analyzing the ECH enzyme functions and thus did not include the genes with no trichome expression. A detailed ECH gene phylogenetic analysis with Sl-AECH1 homologs from multiple species was performed as shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Framing</p><p>2a) The authors mention in the Abstract and again in the Introduction that specialized metabolic gene clusters (SMGCs) are a hallmark of plant specialized metabolism. This gives the impression that gene clusters in plants are more common than they are. In fungal and bacterial genomes, gene clusters predominate. In plants, the pattern is not nearly as straight forward. Many plant specialized pathways are not clustered, and those pathways that are clustered are only partially so (i.e. these clusters are missing pathway regulators, product transporters, additional accessory enzymes, etc., which are common in microbial clusters); see Wisecaver et al., 2017. Given the extensive literature on complex microbial SMGCs, referring to two co-located genes as a SMGC feels like a bit of a stretch without additional clarification. Sometimes the authors appear to include the BAHD in the gene cluster, sometimes it's referred to as a two gene cluster. I wasn't sure whether BAHD was perhaps already know to function earlier in the pathway? The gene wasn't differentially expressed in the trichomes, so is it not involved? If no, then why is it included in the model?</p></disp-quote><p>1) We improved the way in which the concept of plant specialized metabolic gene clusters (SMGCs) was introduced to avoid giving readers the impression that plant gene clusters are common. The reference, Wisecaver et al., 2017, was cited in the introduction to provide a broader view of SMGCs prevalence in plants.</p><p>2) Additional clarification was added to the main text when describing the acylsugar gene cluster, which should be viewed in the broader context of synteny. Other than the co-localized Sl-AACS1 and Sl-AECH1 on chromosome 7, the chromosome 12 syntenic region contains the Sl-ASAT1 BAHD acyltransferase, which catalyzes the first step of tomato acylsugar biosynthesis. Notably, another acylsucrose BAHD acyltransferase, <italic>PaxASAT2</italic>, was also found in the <italic>Petunia axillaris</italic> synteny.</p><p>3) It is necessary to include BAHD acyltransferase genes in the evolutionary analysis to better understand the emergence of the tomato acylsugar cluster, especially because the presence of BAHD acyltransferase in the synteny predates the divergence of Solanaceae and Rubiaceae (refer to Figure 6 and supplements).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2b) Similarly, I question the use of the term supercluster here as well. The fumagillin and pseurotin superclusters in Aspergillus are at least 29 genes long, co-regulated, intertwined, and maintained in diverse Aspergillus species despite being in the telomeric region of otherwise rapidly rearranging genomes (Wiemann et al., 2013). Do the authors believe that the co-location of these genes is being maintained in Solanum and are the genes being co-regulated?</p></disp-quote><p>We added the reference raised by the reviewer and added more discussion of possible causes for the phenomenon and less on the terminology. As it is the case that plant clusters are rare, we expect plant superclusters to be even rarer and almost certainly smaller those in fungi. To answer the question of coregulation of the Chr 7/12 synteny genes requires future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) Novelty and framework for discussing innovation in metabolism with respect to clusters and “superclusters.” The novelty of the manuscript (for researchers who work outside Solanaceae and trichome biology) lies in the final paragraph discussing how this may be the first paper to describe &quot;superclusters.&quot; The Abstract, Introduction and Discussion could all benefit by citing more literature that encompasses the ongoing debates about the prevalence of &quot;clusters&quot; or not. The authors ask this as a question in the final paragraph; however this has been addressed in research not cited here (for example, Wisecaver et al., 2017). As the paper currently reads, they leave off most research (aside from their own self citations) that is outside of the &quot;cluster paradigm&quot; of the Osbourn lab (e.g., Nutzmann et al.2016). It would be interesting to know if a &quot;Wisecaver-type network analysis&quot; would get similar results.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion to provide a broader view of the clustered and non-clustered specialized metabolism (SM) genes. Wisecaver et al., 2017 proposed that plant SM pathway genes are co-expressed, independently of being organized into biosynthetic gene clusters. To test whether Wisecaver’s method will uncover which tomato genes in the chromosome 7 synteny are acylsugar biosynthesis related, we performed co-expression analysis using ACS, ECH, and BAHD acyltransferase family genes (Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Supplementary file 1). As expected, the genes that were characterized involved in acylsugar biosynthesis (Sl-AACS1, Sl-AECH1, and four Sl-ASATs) grouped together. One hypothesis for both physical proximity and gene expression clustering of Sl-AACS1 and Sl-AECH1 is that gene colocalization increases the possibility of coregulation. For example, a promoter element could be duplicated/transposed to drive the expression of nearby genes or newly inserted genes. Searching for the promoter element and testing our hypothesis is an on-going research in the lab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Gene and genome duplication analyses. The authors discuss evolution and gene duplication; however, they do not use the genomic resources of the 13 species examined to phylogenetically evaluate whether the duplicates that may be involved in the phenotype are from whole genome duplication (WGD or polyploidy) vs. small scale duplication (SSD). Given that Solanaceae have a WGD (as a triplication shown in Figure 6A), it would seem important to investigate the acylsugar biosynthesis pathway in this context (and any inferred patterns of loss after triplication if now in single or duplicate copy).</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to a similar question from reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Experimental Design. A species phylogeny is given in Figure 6B for the species analyzed and the corresponding results and discussion hypothesize gain and loss events. Do the authors use a formal ancestral reconstruction analysis to back up their evolutionary scenario or is it just using parsimony to explain biochemical observations? There are formal tools used by evolutionary biologists to infer trait evolution that could be used here. This would seem particularly relevant for any claims made about the other genera (Jaltomata, Physalis, Iochroma, Atropa, and Hyoscyamus) that have missing data. It is not required; however, there other resources for other genera and sister families that could be exploited in a transcriptome analysis (e.g. One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative. 2019. One thousand plant transcriptomes and phylogenomics of green plants. Nature 574: 679-685).</p></disp-quote><p>1) We performed trait ancestral state reconstruction analysis using the likelihood method instead of parsimony as shown in (Figure 6—figure supplement 7). Four traits were inferred for their ancestral states. They are the presence of medium chain acylsugars, presence of ACS in the synteny, presence of ECH in the synteny, and presence of both ACS and ECH in the synteny. We used the ancestral state reconstruction to infer that the co-emergence of the medium chain acylsugars and the ACS/ECH genes in synteny occurred in the common ancestor of <italic>Solanum</italic>.</p><p>2) Due to the highly trichome-specific expression patterns of genes involved in acylsugar biosynthesis, transcriptome analysis using tissues such as leaves, roots, fruits etc. does not always contain acylsugar related genes. Therefore, we refrained from using the public plant transcriptome databases to explore or validate genes involved in acylsugar biosynthesis, which may lead to biased results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This manuscript describes investigation of biosynthesis of medium chain length acylsugars in the Solanaceae, involving identification of an intriguing biosynthetic gene cluster. In particular, two new enzymes are identified and characterized here, which were found to be part of a complex genetic loci containing three different types of enzymes, each of which has undergone multiple tandem gene duplication. However, those for the “other” (third) enzyme in the original (chromosome 7) cluster are not required for this medium chain acylsugar biosynthesis, but rather a paralog on chromosome 12 instead. Intriguingly, this cluster is adjacent to the larger portion of the split cluster previously identified for steroidal alkaloid biosynthesis. It is tempting to speculate that assembly, with subsequent splitting, occurred together. Although the authors have avoided this more speculative hypothesis, it might be of interest to look at conservation of the split steroidal alkaloid cluster, analogous to that already reported here for the acylsugar biosynthetic cluster, to examine this hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the reviewer provided the tempting hypothesis regarding the evolutionary history of the two metabolic gene clusters. The analysis of co-location or co-regulation of the genes involved in producing these two compounds in the <italic>Solanum</italic> genus and beyond is an on-going interest of the lab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, one of the biochemical findings reported here is somewhat puzzling. Specifically, the characterized activity of the acylsugar acyl-CoA synthetase (AACS) seems to be higher with short, particularly C8, rather than medium (&gt;C10) chain length fatty acids. The authors should at least note this in the Discussion. Otherwise the work is solid, the results interesting and well-presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We mentioned and discussed this point that Sl-AACS1 seems to have higher activity with C8 fatty acids. Our favorite (though not experimentally tested) hypothesis for lack of C8-containing acylsugars is that this reflects a dearth of C8 fatty acids in trichomes.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This revision satisfies most of my comments on the previous draft.

We hope that you will agree that a gene gain event in <italic>Petunia</italic> is of lower probability than our proposed gene loss event.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the response to my earlier comment, the authors say that understanding of the mechanism of hijacking primary metabolism for acylsugar biosynthesis requires future work. However, the manuscript still reports to provide insights into this co-option in several places.

It looks like the Moore et al., 2020 study called modules of co-expressed genes using several different metrics, while here the authors only report the pairwise coexpression between ACS, ECH, and BAHDs without binning these genes into discrete modules or looking for associations with other gene families. This may be beyond the scope of this manuscript.
