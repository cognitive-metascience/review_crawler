prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, only a few lysine deacetylases (KDACs) have been identified in prokaryotes, perhaps in part due to their limited sequence homology. Herein, we developed a ‘clip-chip’ strategy to enable unbiased, activity-based discovery of novel KDACs in the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> proteome. In-depth biochemical characterization confirmed that YcgC is a serine hydrolase involving Ser200 as the catalytic nucleophile for lysine deacetylation and does not use NAD<sup>+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup> like other established KDACs. Further, in vivo characterization demonstrated that YcgC regulates transcription by catalyzing deacetylation of Lys52 and Lys62 of a transcriptional repressor RutR. Importantly, YcgC targets a distinct set of substrates from the only known <italic>E. coli</italic> KDAC CobB. Analysis of YcgC’s bacterial homologs confirmed that they also exhibit KDAC activity. YcgC thus represents a novel family of prokaryotic KDACs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05322.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05322.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05322.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>After proteins have been made, they can be modified in several ways. For example, chemical tags called acetyl groups may be added to (and later removed from) the protein to regulate cell activities such as aging and metabolism. Enzymes are proteins that help catalyze the reactions that add or remove the acetyl tags on certain “substrate” proteins. In the bacteria species <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, many enzymes that help to add acetyl groups to proteins have been discovered. However, only a single <italic>E. coli</italic> “deacetylase” enzyme that removes the acetyl group has been identified.</p><p>Now, Tu, Guo, Chen et al. have devised a technique to identify new deacetylases, called the “clip-chip” approach. In this method, thousands of proteins that are potential deacetylases are arrayed on a glass slide, and substrate proteins are immobilized on another slide. The two slides are then clipped together face-to-face, allowing the potential enzymes to transfer to the substrate slide and interact with the substrates.</p><p>Using this approach, Tu, Guo, Chen et al. identified a protein called YcgC as a deacetylase in bacteria. Further characterization experiments revealed that YcgC works in a different way to other known deacetylases, and that it targets different substrates to the previously known <italic>E. coli</italic> deacetylase.</p><p>Tu, Guo, Chen et al. found that the equivalents of YcgC in other bacteria species are also deacetylases; these enzymes therefore represent a new deacetylase family. In the future, the clip-chip approach could be used to discover new members of other enzyme families.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

biological processes, for example, transcriptional regulation, aging, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cohen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Grunstein, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lu et al., 2011</xref>). Recent mass spectrometry (MS) efforts have revealed that many proteins are acetylated in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, although only a single <italic>E. coli</italic> lysine deacetylase (KDAC), CobB, has been identified so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Choudhary et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Henriksen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhang et al., 2013a</xref>). The fact that induction of CobB only had a limited impact on reducing the global protein acetylation level suggests that additional KDACs may exist. However, homolog searching has failed to reveal any additional KDACs in <italic>E. coli</italic>, presumably because these enzymes emerged via convergent evolution. In contrast to bioinformatics methods, biochemical approaches have proven effective for identifying new enzymes resulting from convergent evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Tsukada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yamane et al., 2006</xref>), though their laborious, time-consuming nature has limited their applications to high-throughput, proteome-wide screens.

The substrate slide is created by immobilizing a substrate of interest onto a nitrocellulose-coated slide. After thousands of purified proteins are spotted on a plain glass slide, it is then ‘clipped’ onto the substrate slide in a face-to-face manner, resulting in the delivery of the proteins onto the substrate slide. Owing to the highly porous nature of nitrocellulose and the tiny volume of the protein droplets (0.3–0.5 nL), the delivered protein droplets are immediately absorbed and kept locally in the nitrocellulose, preventing cross-contamination. To determine which transferred proteins possess the enzymatic activity in question, the ‘clipped’ substrate slide is then incubated with an appropriate reaction buffer, followed by signal detection.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05322.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Screening the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> proteome to discover new KDACs using the ‘clip-chip’ strategy.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of the ‘clip-chip’ strategy.

The reactions were terminated by adding wash buffers, followed by a signal detection step with a pan α-acetyllysine (α-AcK) antibody coupled with Cy3-labeled secondary antibodies as detection reagents. Proteins that efficiently deacetylated the substrates could be readily identified as they left behind pairs of black holes in fluorescence images of the substrate slides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). To help determine the identity of the proteins with potential KDAC activity, we subsequently probed the clipped substrate slides with an α-6xHis antibody to visualize the <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins delivered onto the substrate slides. As a negative control, substrate slides were also processed in parallel without the clipping step. We identified four candidates that showed significant deacetylation activities against at least one of the three substrates tested.</p><p>To validate the KDAC activity observed above, we purified the four candidate proteins and performed solution phase deacetylation reactions against RutR. CobB was also included for comparison. By evaluating the decrease in acetylation signals using an immunoblot assay with α-AcK, we confirmed that one of the candidates, YcgC, could readily deacetylate RutR in vitro, and that CobB also deacetylated RutR. YjgD did not show any detectable deacetylation activity against RutR, while Gnd and YhbL showed slight activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). As YcgC also showed KDAC activity against NhoA and YceC (data not shown), we then focused on characterizing the function of YcgC.

To enable immunoprecipitation of endogenous RutR proteins, a 3xFLAG tag was chromosomally inserted into the 3′-end of the <italic>rutR</italic> coding sequence. An isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible <italic>ycgC</italic> construct was then transformed into the <italic>rutR:3xFLAG</italic> cells and induced for YcgC expression for up to 4 hr. Using IP-coupled immunoblotting analysis, we observed that acetylation levels of RutR proteins were significantly reduced in a YcgC expression level-dependent manner as detected by a custom-made α-YcgC monoclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast, the total amount of RutR was not affected by YcgC induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). These results confirmed that YcgC effectively deacetylates RutR in vivo without affecting its stability.</p><p>To examine whether K52 and K62 acetylation sites of RutR were deacetylated by YcgC in vivo, we created two single (K52Q; K62Q)- and one double (K52/62Q)-mutants of RutR. After transformation of these mutants into <italic>E. coli</italic>, subsequent IP-coupled immunoblotting demonstrated that, compared with WT RutR, mutation of either K52 or K62 resulted in a substantial loss of acetylation signals in RutR, with the K52/62Q double mutant showing the lowest acetylation signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). RutR K-to-R mutants (i.e., K52R, K62R, and K52/62R) were also created and tested, and similar results were observed to those with the K-to-Q mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

We found that Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (with or without ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid [EGTA]; Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and Complete Protease Tablet (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) could significantly inhibit YcgC’s deacetylase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Further analysis revealed that the active component in the Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail was a serine hydrolase inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), but not the other components. Additional assays demonstrated that YcgC’s deacetylase activity could not be inhibited by well-known deacetylase inhibitors, including trichostatin A, SAHA (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid), and NAM (Nicotinamide), and that hydrolase inhibitors, phenylmethylsulfonyl (PMSF), leupeptin, ethylenediaminetetracetic acid and EGTA, showed no detectable inhibition of YcgC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b,c</xref>). Thus, it is likely that YcgC belongs to the serine hydrolase family, which has no significant homology to any of the annotated KDACs to date.</p><p>To identify which Ser residue in YcgC was most critical for its hydrolase (KDAC) activity, we examined five Ser residues, namely S7, S10, S73, S77, and S200, which are highly conserved among its prokaryotic homologs on the basis of protein sequence alignment. Next, we created a quintuple Ser-to-Ala mutant (i.e., 5SA) in YcgC and tested its ability to deacetylate RutR in vitro. As compared with the WT YcgC, the 5SA mutant appeared devoid of RutR deacetylase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). To determine which of the five Ser residues was likely to be the catalytic nucleophile for hydrolase activity, we incubated WT YcgC with hydrolase inhibitor AEBSF and the following MS/MS analysis revealed that Ser200 was the only conserved residue that was covalently labeled with AEBSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). To confirm its importance, a Ser200-to-Ala (S200A) mutant was created and tested in the same in vitro assay. As anticipated, the deacetylase activity was not detectable with S200A YcgC, establishing Ser200 as the likely key catalytic residue.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05322.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>S200 is critical for YcgC’s deacetylation activity.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Two mutants of YcgC, that is, S S8/10/73/77/200A and S200A were constructed through gene synthesis.

This behavior was also observed with deacetylation by the sirtuin family member CobB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). This phenomenon is not typically associated with protein deacetylation and we considered the possibility that proteolytic degradation of deacetylated RutR was occurring. N-terminal Edman sequencing of RutR after YcgC treatment showed N-terminal truncation with loss of 14 residues (N-MTQGAVKTTGKRSR) or 11 residues (N-MTQGAVKTTGK). RutR without YcgC treatment was also sequenced, no N-terminal truncation was observed. We considered the possibility that YcgC might show protease activity in addition to its unambiguous deacetylase activity. However, we believe this is unlikely since treatment of RutR with the sirtuin CobB, mechanistically and structurally unrelated to YcgC, induces a similar N-terminal truncation in RutR, visualized by SDS-PAGE and detected by N-terminal sequencing with loss of 14 residues. We suspect that this N-terminal cleavage of RutR results from autoproteolysis. To explore this possibility, intact RutR proteins were first heat-denatured and then incubated with either YcgC or CobB under the same deacetylation conditions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, heat-denatured RutR could be partially deacetylated by both YcgC and CobB, but did not show a downshifting on SDS-PAGE. These results are consistent with the possibility that deacetylation of native acetylated RutR sparks autoproteolysis but denaturation inhibits this autoproteolytic activity.</p><p>To understand whether specific Lys residue(s) play a role in facilitating RutR autoproteolysis, K52R, K62R, K52/62R, K52Q, K62Q, and K52/62Q mutant and WT RutR protein were treated with YcgC and analyzed using Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Measurement of the ratios of cleaved/intact RutR revealed that K52Q and K52R RutR behaved similar to WT RutR. In contrast, K62Q, K62R, and the two double mutant RutR proteins showed diminished cleavage. Therefore, we propose that the apparent autoproteolytic activity of RutR is dependent on its deacetylation and that removal of the acetyl group from K62 appears most important for its cleavage. Future studies will be needed to further understand the molecular mechanism for the apparent RutR autocleavage and its biological function.</p><p>Because the N-terminal cleavage of RutR is tightly coupled with its deacetylation by YcgC, the downshifted band of RutR in the YcgC deactylation reaction can be conveniently used as a surrogate of YcgC’s activity. We thus performed steady-state assays to monitor the enzyme kinetics of YcgC via measuring the production of the downshifted RutR band, and estimated the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of YcgC to be 2.13 ± 0.65 μM and 0.29 ± 0.07 μM/min/μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>YcgC regulates transcription through deacetylating RutR</title><p>Originally identified as a transcriptional repressor of the <italic>rutABCDEFG</italic> operon in <italic>E. coli</italic>, RutR (YcdC) was later found to bind to 19 additional <italic>E. coil</italic> chromosomal loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Shimada et al., 2008</xref>), including the coding regions of <italic>pmrD</italic> and <italic>gcd</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Umezawa et al., 2008</xref>).

Using a standard DNA microarray approach, we found that, compared with WT cells, 197 genes were significantly repressed and 93 genes were activated after 4 hr of <italic>ycgC</italic> induction. In agreement with the above observations, expression levels of <italic>pmrD</italic> and <italic>gcd</italic> were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A similar analysis in parallel revealed that 4 hr of <italic>cobB</italic> induction resulted in 195 and 136 up- and down-regulated genes, respectively, compared with WT cells. However, with the exception of <italic>xerC</italic>, none of the RutR’s targets was affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Furthermore, Venn diagram analysis did not reveal any significant overlap between either the up- or down-regulated gene groups in the <italic>ycgC</italic> and <italic>cobB</italic> induction experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). These results suggest that YcgC profoundly affects global gene expression and it probably functions via distinct biological processes from CobB.</p><p>This conclusion is further supported by evidence obtained at the protein level. Using immunoblotting with pan α-AcK, we observed that overexpression of <italic>ycgC</italic> decreases the acetylation levels of many proteins, resulting in a global change in acetylation profiles compared with those of WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Importantly, changes in the acetylation profile of <italic>ycgC</italic>-induced cells were different from those in <italic>cobB</italic>-induced cells. For example, in boxed areas 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), the acetylated bands are almost completely absent in <italic>ycgC</italic>-overexpressing cells, while they are essentially unchanged in <italic>cobB</italic>-overexpressing cells. On the other hand, in boxed area 1, <italic>cobB</italic> overexpression completely abolished the acetylation signals, whereas only a modest decrease in acetylation signals is observed in <italic>ycgC</italic>-overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Taken together, the above results suggest that YcgC and CobB each target a distinct set of substrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>YcgC’s homologs show protein deacetylase activities</title><p>To determine whether YcgC’s KDAC activity is evolutionarily conserved, we searched for its homologs in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Although YcgC shows limited homology to components of the phosphotransferase system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Punta et al., 2012</xref>), no statistically significant homologs were identified in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Molin et al., 2003</xref>). However, many prokaryotic homologs with high similarity were readily identified. Other than homologs from <italic>Escherichia</italic> strains, the closet homolog is the DhaM protein from <italic>Shigella</italic> sp. (str. 2457T), and statistically significant homologs were also identified in more remotely related bacterial species. Therefore, we selected five homologs, representing a wide range of homology, for closer scrutiny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Sequence alignment of the five representative homologs with YcgC showed that the N-terminal regions (i.e., amino acids 1–2501–250) of these proteins are more conserved than the C-terminal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). To determine whether these YcgC homologs possess protein deacetylase activity, the five selected genes were synthesized, subcloned into the same IPTG-inducible expression vector as that of <italic>E. coli</italic> YcgC, and transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic>. After a 4 hr induction of each YcgC homolog, changes in global acetylation profiles were determined with two pan α-AcK antibodies and compared with that for WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c,d</xref>). Results clearly showed that induction of each of the five YcgC homologs gave rise to a unique protein deacetylation signature that is different from that of the WT and <italic>YcgC</italic>-induced strains. For example, overexpression of the <italic>Klebsiella</italic> homolog significantly reduced the acetylation levels of proteins at ~55 kDa (red box; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). As another example, overexpression of the <italic>Pantoea</italic> homolog substantially reduced the acetylation levels of proteins around 60 and 43 kDa compared with the WT strain (wide and narrow red boxes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that all five YcgC homologs possess readily detectable KDAC activity with different substrate preferences. Because YcgC and its homologs share little similarity with all the known KDACs identified so far, and because its activity does not require NAD<sup>+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup>, these results strongly suggest that this group represents a novel prokaryotic KDAC family.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05322.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>YcgC represents a new family of KDACs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Five representative YcgC homologs with protein sequence homology ranging from low to high.

Our in-depth biochemical characterization revealed that the novel KDAC YcgC removes the acetyl groups on K52/62 of its substrates RutR via a previously unknown Ser hydrolyase activity. A surprising observation was that, after deacetylated by either YcgC or CobB, the RutR showed a significant downshift on SDS-PAGE, suggesting possible proteolytic activity. Further biochemical analysis established that this is likely autoproteolysis of RutR that is stimulated by deacetylation of K62. Our data suggest that acetylation of RutR may enhance its stability. Indeed, endogenous RutR purified from cells grown under standard conditions is heavily acetylated. Although a complete understanding of this phenomenon will require future study; to our knowledge, this is the first example of a protein deacetylation event driving proteolytic activation.</p><p>Our in vivo functional studies on YcgC revealed that it down-regulates the expression of several RutR target genes by catalyzing the deacetylation of two lysine residues on RutR. It has been puzzling until now how RutR represses target gene transcription by its previously reported binding to coding regions of <italic>pmrD</italic> and <italic>gcd</italic>, as the binding sites are located hundreds of base pairs downstream of the start codons, and deletion of <italic>rutR</italic> does not enhance their expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Umezawa et al., 2008</xref>). Based on the results of this study, we propose that YcgC deacetylates RutR leading in turn to the recruitment of additional cofactors that enhance silencing of target gene expression. As PmrD has been demonstrated to serve as a connector between multiple two-component signal-transduction systems in <italic>Salmonella enterica, E. coli</italic>, and other bacteria, our study also suggests the possibility of crosstalk between protein acetylation and phosphorylation in <italic>E. coli</italic>, a prevalent regulatory mechanism found in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eguchi and Utsumi, 2005</xref>).</p><p>This study also highlights several advantages of the clip-chip approach. First, as an activity-based screen, this method can be readily adopted to search for many other types of enzyme activities. Second, the clip-chip approach does not require any prior knowledge of the enzymes of interest as long as a robust biochemical assay is available. Third, it is a proteome-wide, high-throughput screen that does not require further deconvolution (e.g., in MS/MS) of the positive signals because of the use of a protein microarray on which each protein is physically addressable. Finally, the clip-chip approach is capable of functional annotation of enzymes using both gain- and loss-of-signal reactions. We envision that the ‘clip-chip’ strategy will proved to be of wide application for the de novo discovery of enzyme activity in biology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals used in this study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO), and enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title><italic>E. coli</italic> proteome chip preparation</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> proteome chips were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2008</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled &quot;YcgC Represents a New Protein Deacetylase Family in Prokaryotes&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior Editor), Leemor Joshua-Tor (Reviewing Editor), and three reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The paper describes an interesting study that uses an application of proteome array &quot;Clip-Chip&quot; technology to the discovery of new enzymatic functions. This appears to be a new twist on the use of proteome arrays and therefore very appealing. This technology has clearly identified a new class of protein deacetylases that does not require metal ions or NAD<sup>+</sup>. This is a fortunate happenstance and highlights the utility of the method for discovery of enzymes that informatics would not have picked up by homology searching. Thus, this paper will be of considerable interest to a broad spectrum of biological scientists.</p><p>However, several issues have been raised specifically regarding the activity of YcgC as a lysine deacetylase that would have to be addressed:</p><p>1) The biochemical data supporting that YcgC has deacetylase activity was based on Western blots using pan-specific acetyl lysine antibodies. One particular concern is that YcgC might be a protease that can cleave RutR at a specific sequence. This cleavage may in turn affect the recognition of an acetyl lysine residue in RutR by the antibody, leading to a decreased acetyl lysine signal on Western blots. This is highly likely because <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows that RutR became smaller after treatment with YcgC. In addition, further post-translational modifications adjacent to the acetylated lysine might alter the epitopes for proper readout by an antibody. To rule out this concern, more biochemical data is needed. One suggestion is to examine whether YcgC can deacetylate a synthetic acetyl peptide and monitoring products using LC-MS based methods, which can provide definitive proof for the deacetylase activity.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> legend, you state: &quot;using acetylated RutR proteins […] YcgC showed robust deacetylation activity in vitro&quot;. It seems that the SDS-PAGE mobility of RutR doesn't change following deacetylation. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, there is at least 5KD shift to a lower molecule weight after deacetylation. Such a discrepancy should be addressed.</p><p>3) The mass spectrometry data showing the acetylated K52 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) is problematic. Although the spectra itself is not readable, it is clear that the peptide was obtained by trypsin digestion (as stated in the experimental section), which cleaves after lysine and arginine, but not after acetyl lysine. A long peptide with Kac embedded in the center should be detected. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> shows a peptide cut after acetyl lysine, which is highly unlikely. This indicates that either the acetyl group is not on K52 or the MS data is unreliable. Although all the Y ions are marked, for the C-Kac peptide as shown, the Y ions shouldn't be visible because it lost the positively charged Lys which shouldn't fly in MS. In contrast, the C-Lys peptide should fly. However, the similar ionization efficiency for the b and y ions for the two peptides doesn't make sense. The images are at low resolution and therefore hard to examine in detail. In addition, HPLC retention times should be indicated. The same concern is noted for the MS data shown in the supplementary figures.</p><p>4) The gel shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> is not convincing. The authors state in the text that the double mutant provides the lowest level of acetylation of RutR, the substrate protein. This is not apparent. At least by my eye the K62Q and the double mutant appear to provide quite similar results. Some sort of quantification of these results should be provided.</p><p>5) It was not clear in the manuscript whether or not YcgC is an essential protein in <italic>E. coli</italic>. A related point is that when the authors overexpress the protein in vivo, it was not clear whether this was being done in a ∆ycgC strain or on top of the native level of YcgC. Please provide this information.</p><p>Other issues to address:</p><p>6) It is surprising that 1x or 2x-acetylation/deacetylation can cause such a dramatic mobility shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Fortunately, the authors showed that CobB also deacetylates the same substrate. This data should be included to show that deacetylation can indeed cause a 5kD mobility shift.</p><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, why are the band intensities of alpha-Flag and α-YcgC so different? In addition, even given that α-Flag bands have equal intensity, the decreased α-Kac bands should correspond to two α-Flag bands given the decreased mobility shift following deacetylation.</p><p>8) For the MS analyses, it is not unclear whether the authors run the SDS page gels first and then cut the band for MS analysis. In theory, there should be two bands (Kac-containing starting materials and K-containing products), which should be resolved well and analyzed in parallel.</p><p>9) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, interestingly, although the negative signals of α-Kac antibodies, the Coo. bands showed the similar mobility as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. It seems that the same reaction occurs when RutR was mixed with YcgC. It is another strange observation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;YcgC Represents a New Protein Deacetylase Family in Prokaryotes&quot; for further consideration at eLife. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The manuscript has been significantly improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers all felt that this work is significant and important. Precisely because of this, it is important to make sure as much as possible that observations reported are not due to a contaminating protease activity. The MS data showing 95% sequence coverage of RutR sequence cannot prove that there is no proteolysis. The fact that YcgC does not work on a synthetic peptide is another reason for concern.</p><p>There are a couple of simple things that could be done to address this concern:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, include a negative control with CobB but without NAD<sup>+.</sup>If there is a protease contamination, it is likely an endogenous <italic>E. coli</italic> protein that is present in both the YcgC and CobB prep. Using CobB without NAD<sup>+</sup> should resolve this.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, K52Q and K62Q mutants were blotted and they appear to be of similar size to the WT protein. One can argue that the K to Q mutant behaves similarly to the acetylated WT protein. However, the authors should repeat these experiments using the K52R and K62R mutants. If these mutants migrate faster as the deacetylated RutR, it will also help address these concerns. In addition, the K to R mutants may improve the Ac Western blot because Q is generally thought to mimic acetyl lysine.</p><p>It is interesting that the 5-kd mobility shift only occurs for native YcgC but not N-terminal flagged YcgC. Such an observation should be described explicitly in the text to avoid potential confusion, especially if the K52R and K62R mutants don't migrate as fast. This type of shift by 1 or 2 Ac groups is quite large.</p><p>3) Another possibility is to mutate the conserved Ser residues in YcgC and show that the mutant loses deacetylase activity. There are only five conserved Ser residues and mutating them would not be a huge effort.</p><p>4) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the experimental details provided in the main text and response letter are still not clear. Did the authors run &quot;Coo. Stain&quot; on the samples and then use the same sample for the deacelylation reaction or did they run &quot;Coo. Stain&quot; and deacelylation with equal amounts of the two aliquots? If the latter is the case, the samples after the deacelylation reaction should be subsequently stain by a Western-compatible dye followed by anti-acetyllysine antibody.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05322.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] However, several issues have been raised specifically regarding the activity of YcgC as a lysine deacetylase that would have to be addressed: 1) The biochemical data supporting that YcgC has deacetylase activity was based on Western blots using pan-specific acetyl lysine antibodies.

In this study, the acetylated lysine residues were determined by comparing the MS/MS peaks obtained from the upper and lower (i.e., down-shifted) RutR protein bands after PAGE separation. To make this point clearer, we have now added an insert to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D and 2E</xref>, as well as to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>. To demonstrate that the down-shifted RutR was <italic>not</italic> caused by protease activity of YcgC, we repeated the MS/MS analysis several more times against the down-shifted RutR bands recovered from PAGE gels. (Please also see our response to Point 3 below.) To our satisfaction, we obtained a peptide-coverage for up to 95% and with both the N- and C- terminal of the full-length RutR, indicating that the down-shifted RutR was very unlikely to be caused by protease cleavage. Moreover, we observed that CobB-deacetylated RutR protein also appeared as a similar down-shifted band on SDS-PAGE, providing further confirmation of our interpretation of the data. Taken together, these additional results help establish that YcgC is a bona fide deacetylase and not a protease. We have now clarified this in the second paragraph of the subsection “In vitro characterization of YcgC's KDAC activity”, and added the CobB treated RutR to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>In addition, we have also treated RutR-derived synthetic peptides in acetylated and unacetylated forms with YcgC as recommended by the reviewers. There was no evidence that the RutR acetylated peptide was deacetylated or otherwise modified by YcgC treatment as analyzed by HPLC. Our interpretation of these results is that a folded substrate conformation or long-range recognition elements within RutR are critical for YcgC processing.</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> legend, you state: &quot;using acetylated RutR proteins […] YcgC showed robust deacetylation activity in vitro&quot;.

Since they were not deacetylated by YcgC, no down-shift would be expected and none as observed. We have now clarified this in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend.</p><p><italic>3) The mass spectrometry data showing the acetylated K52 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) is problematic.

The same concern is noted for the MS data shown in the supplementary figures.</italic> </p><p>We have consulted several mass spectrometry experts, and re-performed the MS/MS analysis with a different MS spectrometer (Q Exactive<sup>TM</sup> Plus quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer) of a much higher mass resolution. Long peptides with Kac embedded in the center for both K52 and K62 were clearly observed for untreated RutR (-YcgC), while not for treated RutR (+YcgC). We have now updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref> with the new MS/MS data, and provided clear images of HPLC retention times. We have also modified the manuscript accordingly (in the second paragraph of the subsection “In vivo validation of YcgC's KDAC activity”, and in the subsection “Identification of deacetylation sites by mass spectrometry&quot;).</p><p><italic>4) The gel shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> is not convincing.

We now provide quantification and statistic analyses to demonstrate the significant differences of their acetylation levels in the lower panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>. The figure legend and main text have been updated accordingly.</p><p><italic>5) It was not clear in the manuscript whether or not YcgC is an essential protein in</italic> E. coli<italic>.

Please provide this information.</italic> </p><p>YcgC is also known as DhaM, a subunit of the dihydroacetone kinase complex. It is not essential in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Because the endogenous level of YcgC is very low, YcgC was overexpressed on the wild type background. We have now clarified this point in the last paragraph of the subsection “Screen new KDAC using the <italic>E. coli</italic> proteome microarray”.</p><p><italic>Other issues to address: 6) It is surprising that 1x or 2x-acetylation/deacetylation can cause such a dramatic mobility shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

In addition, even given that α-Flag bands have equal intensity, the decreased α-Kac bands should correspond to two α-Flag bands given the decreased mobility shift following deacetylation.</italic> </p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> the anti-FLAG antibodies were used to detect the expression level of endogenous RutR, because we chromosomally tagged <italic>RutR</italic> gene with FLAG (subsection “In vivo validation of YcgC's KDAC activity”, first paragraph), whereas anti-YcgC mAb (created during this study) was for detecting YcgC during a time course of induction. It is evident that the endogenous level of YcgC is very low as shown in the control lane in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. The down-shifted RutR bands were only observed in our in vitro deacetylation reactions, when RutR was almost completely decetylated on both K52 and K62 (as shown by MS/MS analysis). While the evidence of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> indicates that YcgC can deacetylate endogenous RutR in vivo, it is likely to be far from complete compared with in vitro assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), potentially accounting for the lack of a shift. The FLAG tag may also affect the mobility, as well as other PTMs.</p><p><italic>8) For the MS analyses, it is not unclear whether the authors run the SDS page gels first and then cut the band for MS analysis. In theory, there should be two bands (Kac-containing starting materials and K-containing products), which should be resolved well and analyzed in parallel.</italic> </p><p>Yes, we treated RutR with YcgC first and then ran it together with untreated RutR on a PAGE gel. After Coomassie staining, we recovered both the upper band in the untreated RutR lane and the down-shifted band in the YcgC-treated lane. Both recovered proteins were then subjected to MS analysis. Please also see our response to Point 1 above. We have now added an insert to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>, and have clarified this in the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> legend; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref> legend).</p><p><italic>9) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, interestingly, although the negative signals of α-Kac antibodies, the Coo. bands showed the similar mobility as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. It seems that the same reaction occurs when RutR was mixed with YcgC. It is another strange observation.</italic> </p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, lysine-to-glutamine mutations were used to demonstrate that K52 and K62 were the two dominant acetylated residues. Because K-to-Q mutation has been commonly used to generate an acetylated lysine mimic due to chemical similarity of an acetamide and the Gln side chain (e.g., PMID: 23904479; 19303850; 21906795), such mutation may not generate enough structural change of the protein to cause a down-shifting of the band. To better demonstrate the differences in their acetylation level, we have repeated this assay and added statistical analyses to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>. Please also see our response to Point 4 above.

There are a couple of simple things that could be done to address this concern: 1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, include a negative control with CobB but without NAD<sup>+.</sup>If there is a protease contamination, it is likely an endogenous E. coli protein that is present in both the YcgC and CobB prep. Using CobB without NAD<sup>+</sup> should resolve this.</italic> </p><p>We have now included the negative control with CobB but without NAD<sup>+</sup>. As expected, no deacetylase activity was observed for this reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that it was unlikely due to contamination by an endogenous protease. We have added this result and modified the manuscript accordingly (subsection “In vitro characterization of YcgC's KDAC activity”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, K52Q and K62Q mutants were blotted and they appear to be of similar size to the WT protein. One can argue that the K to Q mutant behaves similarly to the acetylated WT protein. However, the authors should repeat these experiments using the K52R and K62R mutants. If these mutants migrate faster as the deacetylated RutR, it will also help address these concerns. In addition, the K to R mutants may improve the Ac Western blot because Q is generally thought to mimic acetyl lysine.</italic> </p><p><italic>It is interesting that the 5-kd mobility shift only occurs for native YcgC but not N-terminal flagged YcgC. Such an observation should be described explicitly in the text to avoid potential confusion, especially if the K52R and K62R mutants don't migrate as fast. This type of shift by 1 or 2 Ac groups is quite large.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for their insightful suggestions. The major concern was the observation of the 5-kDa downshift of RutR after the treatment of either YcgC or CobB, as it raised the possibility that YcgC might act as a protease that cleaved off the acetylated lysines of RutR. To explicitly address this concern, we have performed a series of assays. First, we recovered the downshifted RutR after YcgC treatment (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and performed N-terminal Edman sequencing. We identified two versions of cleaved RutR: the major species involves deletion of 14-aa (N-MTQGAVKTTGKRSR), and the minor species involves deletion of 11 aa (N-MTQGAVKTTGK) from the N-terminus of RutR. Because the identified acetylated K52 and K62 are quite distant from the N-terminus, this N-terminal cleavage cannot account for YcgC’s KDAC activity, although it still did not rule out YcgC’s protease activity. Second, we sequenced the downshifted RutR after CobB treatment and found the same cleaved RutR missing the 14-aa at the N-terminus. Since CobB is a NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent Class III sirtuin without any known protease activity, these results suggest that the RutR cleavage is intrinsic to RutR autoproteolysis. Third, to test whether RutR carries any protease activity, intact RutR proteins were heat-denatured and then incubated with either YcgC or CobB under the same deacetylation conditions. It became clear that denatured RutR could no longer downshift, while YcgC and CobB could still significantly deacetylate denatured RutR as compared with the untreated RutR. Finally, we examined the role of specific lysines in RutR’s proteolytic activity. As suggested by the reviewers, we created K52R, K62R and K52/62R mutants in RutR and tested them together with all the K-to-Q mutants in YcgC deacetylation reactions. On the basis of the ratios of cleaved/intact RutR in each reaction, we observed that when K62 was deacetylated in either K52Q or K52R, the proteolytic activity of these mutated RutR was almost as strong as WT RutR. In contrast, K62Q, K62R, and the two double mutants showed significantly lower proteolytic activities. Taken together, the above results confirmed YcgC’s KDAC activity and revealed that the autoproteolytic activity of RutR is dependent on deacetylation of K52/62 with K62 playing a major role. Because these new results are both important and interesting, we added a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and supplemental figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>) to fully describe our new observations.</p><p><italic>3) Another possibility is to mutate the conserved Ser residues in YcgC and show that the mutant loses deacetylase activity. There are only five conserved Ser residues and mutating them would not be a huge effort.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this insightful suggestion. As the reviewers expected, once these five conserved Ser residues were mutated in YcgC, the S8/10/73/77/200A mutant could no longer deacetylate RutR (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To further pinpoint the essential Ser for the KDAC activity, we incubated WT YcgC with hydrolase inhibitor AEBSF and the following MS/MS analysis revealed that Ser200 was the only residue covalently labeled with AEBSF (See new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This result was further validated by the observation that S200A mutation completely abolished YcgC’s KDAC activity (Left panel; new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We have now added these new results to the main text and to the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the experimental details provided in the main text and response letter are still not clear. Did the authors run &quot;Coo. Stain&quot; on the samples and then use the same sample for the deacelylation reaction or did they run &quot;Coo. Stain&quot; and deacelylation with equal amounts of the two aliquots? If the latter is the case, the samples after the deacelylation reaction should be subsequently stain by a Western-compatible dye followed by anti-acetyllysine antibody.</italic> </p><p>In the previous figure, one aliquot was Coomassie stained as loading control to show that equal amounts of RutR were loaded to each lane. Another aliquot was deacetylated and then WB by anti-acetyllysine antibody. To further clarify this, after the deacetylation reaction, RutR was divided into two aliquots of equal amounts: one aliquot was then subjected for Coomassie stain, and the other was western blotted by anti-acetyllysine antibody. We have also clarified this point in the manuscript accordingly (subsection “Screen new KDAC using the <italic>E. coli</italic> proteome microarray”, second paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
