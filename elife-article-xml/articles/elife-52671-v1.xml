This cell line, while previously characterized as having high NRF2 activity (DeNicola GM et al., Nat Genet. 2015 Dec;47(12):1475-81), do not have a KEAP1 mutation. This error does not affect our conclusions, but may lead to confusion in the field about the mutation status of this cell line, which we would like to avoid.
