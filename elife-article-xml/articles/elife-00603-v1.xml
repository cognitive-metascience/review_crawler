Here, we used a phylogenetic framework to measure mRNA profiles in 15 yeast species from the phylum <italic>Ascomycota</italic> and reconstruct the evolution of their modular regulatory programs along a time course of growth on glucose over 300 million years. We found that modules have diverged proportionally to phylogenetic distance, with prominent changes in gene regulation accompanying changes in lifestyle and ploidy, especially in carbon metabolism. Paralogs have significantly contributed to regulatory divergence, typically within a very short window from their duplication. Paralogs from a whole genome duplication (WGD) event have a uniquely substantial contribution that extends over a longer span. Similar patterns occur when considering the evolution of the heat shock regulatory program measured in eight of the species, suggesting that these are general evolutionary principles.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00603.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00603.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00603.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The incredible diversity of living creatures belies the fact that their genes are quite similar. In the 1970s Mary-Claire King and Allan Wilson proposed that a process called gene regulation—which determines when, where and how genes are expressed as proteins—is responsible for this diversity. Four decades later, the central role of gene regulation in evolution has been confirmed in a wide range of species including bacteria, fungi, flies and mammals, although the details remain poorly understood. In recent years it has been suggested that the duplication of genes—and sometimes the duplication of whole genomes—has had a crucial influence on the part played by gene regulation in the evolution of many different species.</p><p>Ascomycota fungi are uniquely suited to the study of genetics and evolution because of their diversity—they include <italic>C. albicans</italic>, a fungus that is found in the human mouth and gut, and various species of yeast—and because many of their genomes have already been sequenced. Moreover, their genomes are relatively small, which simplifies the task of working out how it has changed over the course of evolution. It is also known that species in this branch of the tree of life diverged before and after an event in which a whole genome was duplicated.</p><p>Ascomycota fungi use glucose as a source of carbon in different ways during aerobic growth. Most, including <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, are respiratory and rely on oxidative phosphorylation processes to produce energy. However, a small number—including <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>, two types of yeast that are widely used as model organisms—prefer to ferment glucose, even when oxygen is available. Species that favor the latter respiro-fermentative lifestyle have evolved independently at least twice: once after the whole genome duplication event that lead to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, and once when <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> and the other fission yeasts evolved.</p><p>Thompson et al. have measured mRNA profiles in 15 different species of yeast and reconstructed how the regulation of groups of genes (modules) have evolved over a period of more than 300 million years. They found that modules have diverged proportionally to evolutionary time, with prominent changes in gene regulation being associated with changes in lifestyle (especially changes in carbon metabolism) and a whole genome duplication event.</p><p>Gene duplication events result in gene paralogs—identical genes at different places in the genome—and these have made significant contributions to the evolution of different forms of gene regulation, especially just after the duplication event. Moreover, the paralogs produced in whole genome duplication events have resulted in bigger changes over longer periods of time. Similar patterns were observed in the regulation of the genes involved in the response to heat shock in eight of the species, which suggests that these are general evolutionary principles.</p><p>The changes in gene expression associated with the respiro-fermentative lifestyle may also have implications for our understanding of cancer: healthy cells rely on oxidative phosphorylation to produce energy whereas, similar to yeast cells, most cancerous cells rely on respiro-fermentation. Furthermore, yeast cells and cancer cells both support their rapid growth and proliferation by using glucose for biosynthesis to support cell division, although this process is not fully understood. Normal cells, on the other hand, use glucose primarily for energy and tend not to divide rapidly.</p><p>Thompson et al. found that the genes encoding enzymes in two biosynthetic pathways—one that produces the nucleotides necessary for DNA replication, and one that synthesizes glycine—are induced in respiro-fermentative yeasts but repressed in respiratory yeast cells. The fact that similar changes are observed in the same two pathways when normal cells become cancer cells suggests that these pathways have an important role in the development of cancer. The framework developed by Thompson et al. could also be used to explore the evolution of gene regulation in other species and biological processes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00603.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00603.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>regulatory evolution</kwd><kwd>duplication</kwd><kwd>divergence</kwd><kwd>carbon lifestyle</kwd><kwd>module</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Regev</surname><given-names>Aviv</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2R01CA119176-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Regev</surname><given-names>Aviv</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Broad Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Dawn A</given-names></name><name><surname>Regev</surname><given-names>Aviv</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Regev</surname><given-names>Aviv</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Computing Innovation Fellow</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roy</surname><given-names>Sushmita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wapinski</surname><given-names>Ilan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alfred P.

In some cases, changes in gene expression and related mechanisms are clearly coupled to other adaptive changes in lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ihmels et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Field et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsankov et al., 2010</xref>), whereas in others they may be the result of neutral ‘regulatory drift’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsong et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lavoie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, evolutionary changes in regulators, facilitated by protein modularity, in cooperative binding with other factors and shifts in protein–DNA interactions contribute toward different paths through a ‘hybrid’ regulatory state for the ancestral regulatory network to be resolved in to generate the diversity of regulatory network structures observed in modern species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tuch et al., 2008a</xref>)</p><p>Despite these early successes, collecting experimental data across species has remained challenging, and hence most experimental studies rely on two to four species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanay et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tirosh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lelandais et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wittkopp et al., 2008</xref>), with few exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsankov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wapinski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brawand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2011</xref>). An important challenge is to collect experimental data in such a way that would minimize irrelevant differences, for example, due to growth conditions, and allow focusing on true evolutionary distinctions. Expanding the experimental scope to cover a broader phylogenetic range and density can help study the divergence of expression in individual genes and gene modules in order to answer questions on the extent of conservation of transcriptional programs, its relation to phylogenetic distance, the emergence of new regulatory patterns across modules of co-regulated genes, and the specific contribution of gene duplication and divergence—through both sporadic and whole genome duplication—to regulatory evolution.</p><p>Here, we use comparative transcriptional studies across 15 <italic>Ascomycota</italic> species—spanning &gt;300 million years of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sipiczki, 2000</xref>)—to understand the evolution of modular gene regulation during batch growth on glucose and its depletion, a key physiological response. We optimized culture conditions across species, and collected ∼300 expression profiles at six physiologically comparable time points along each species’ growth: repletion (lag phase), exponential growth (‘mid-log’ and ‘late log’), the point of glucose depletion (‘diauxic shift’) and two later time points when the growth rate levels off (‘post shift’ and ‘plateau’). To analyze the evolution of regulatory modules, we use a new algorithm, Arboretum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roy et al., 2013</xref>), to identify expression modules across species and to reconstruct their evolutionary history.</p><p>We find that the degree of divergence of the transcriptional profiles correlates with phylogenetic distance, with the largest divergence in lag phase profiles. In all species, the transcriptional response involves five major transcriptional modules. While the module’s expression patterns are conserved across species, their gene membership diverges, proportionally to phylogenetic distance. Gene duplication events significantly contribute to regulatory divergence, in particular close to their phylogenetic point of duplication. This contribution is more pronounced and more prolonged for WGD paralogs. These patterns also characterize the evolution of the transcriptional response to heat shock, supporting their generality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roy et al., 2013</xref>). Our framework for comparative functional genomics is applicable to any complex phylogeny, and can help test these principles of regulatory evolution in other responses and species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An experimental system for comparative functional genomics in <italic>Ascomycota</italic></title><p>We studied 15 yeast species whose genome is fully sequenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), spanning &gt;300 million years of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sipiczki, 2000</xref>).

In principle, the lower conservation of the lag phase profiles in these and other species could have been merely due to the fact that this is the only phase sampled at the same absolute time (30 min). However, the repletion process is known to be fast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zaman et al., 2008</xref>), metabolite profiling in each species at this time point shows the least difference between species (MS, DAT and AR, unpublished results), and additional profiling in some of the most divergent species at finer increments did not change this finding (data not shown), ruling out this possibility. Nevertheless, some functional groups of genes do exhibit conserved induction or repression in the lag phase across most species (e.g., growth genes such as mRNA splicing genes are enriched among the highly induced genes [p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>, FDR, ‘Materials and methods’] possibly to support splicing of transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The transcriptional response consists of five major modules in all species</title><p>To automatically trace the evolutionary trajectory of gene regulation, we used a novel probabilistic algorithm, Arboretum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roy et al., 2013</xref>) (‘Materials and methods’), to infer modules of co-expressed genes in each extant species and to reconstruct the ancestral modules from which they were derived. Arboretum uses a generative probabilistic model of the evolution of module membership of a given gene, starting from the last common ancestor (LCA) of a set of species and probabilistically propagating this membership down the branches of the phylogenetic tree to the leaf nodes. Arboretum uses the phylogeny to link the module IDs at each phylogenetic point to the modules of the LCA, and uses the structures of gene trees (as defined from genome sequences; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wapinski et al., 2007a</xref>) during module identification. This allows Arboretum to simultaneously infer ancestral and extant module assignments, and to systematically handle complex orthology and paralogy relationships that arise from gene duplication and loss.

In most cases, divergence in paralog assignment is already apparent at the immediate phylogenetic point of the duplication event (at the phylogenetic resolution of this study). For example, ∼60% of the paralog pairs that arose at the ancestor of the <italic>Candida</italic> clade (A10) and that will eventually change their assignment, do so at that ancestor. Similar trends are observed for paralogs that arose at most other ancestors (e.g., A11, 54%; A9, 48%). Overall, of all the paralog pairs that arose sporadically (not in the WGD) in the phylogeny, and where at least one member of the pair was subsequently reassigned to a different module, 53% do so ‘at’ the point at which they arose. Furthermore, such sporadically duplicated genes are significantly enriched (Hyper-geometric test, p&lt;0.05,) among all the reassigned genes (duplicated or not) at their point of duplication, but not at later phylogenetic points, when they behave comparably to non-duplicated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). This suggests a short ‘window of opportunity’ in regulatory innovation, specifically facilitated by paralogous genes shortly after they are duplicated but not later, and provides strong experimental support to previous theoretical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gu et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>A prolonged effect of WGD paralogs on regulatory divergence</title><p>Paralogs that arose in the WGD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, A5) are a notable exception to some of these trends, and may affect divergence for a longer period. While a similar proportion (54%) of those that diverge do so as early as they arise, they continue to contribute significantly to the divergence in module assignment at later points compared to non-duplicated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, orange circles, Hyper-geometric test, p&lt;0.05).

Most paralogs (66% of all pairs) have at least one member diverging from the ancestral module. This includes paralogs with distinct fates, either due to ‘classical’ neo-functionalization (27% of all pairs), where one paralog maintains the ancestral assignment and the other is assigned to a different module (e.g., the purine biosynthesis genes <italic>URA8</italic> and <italic>URA7</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>, case 2), or due to asymmetric divergence (12%), where each paralog is reassigned to a distinct module, each different than the ancestral one (e.g., the disulphide isomerases <italic>EUG1</italic> and <italic>PDI1</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>, case 3). In the remaining cases (27%) there is symmetric divergence, where both paralogs are reassigned to the same module, distinct from the ancestral one (e.g., the ribonucleotide-diphosphate reductases <italic>SER3</italic> and <italic>SER33</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>, case 4). Only in a minority of paralog pairs (34%) the ancestral assignment of both copies is conserved (e.g., the ribosome biogenesis genes <italic>UTP5</italic> and <italic>UTP9</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>, case 1). These classes could be easily confounded in previous studies relying on paralogs from a single species (e.g., ‘conserved’ and ‘symmetrically diverged’ would be indistinguishable). The pre-duplication orthologs of genes from the neo-functionalized class are most prominent in the ‘unchanged’ Module 3 and mildly induced Module 4 (Hyper-geometric test<italic>,</italic> p&lt;10<sup>−3</sup>), suggesting that genes that were not regulated in glucose depletion prior to duplication, ‘gain’ such regulation de novo post-duplication, for at least one paralog.

Furthermore, the evolutionary trajectories of paralogous genes—including the higher reassignment of paralogs, the distinct reassignment capacity of sporadic and large-scale duplications, and the preponderance of reassignment of only one of two paralogs—are highly similar between heat shock and glucose depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A,B</xref>).

During the learning process, Arboretum uses a soft probabilistic assignment of module membership allowing a gene to contribute to the mean expression profile of different modules. At the end of the learning, the gene is assigned to the single module with the highest probability. In the majority of cases, this ‘hard assignment’ is well supported in our dataset, such that the probability that a gene belongs to its assigned module is much higher than its probability to belong to the next-best module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A,B</xref>) In some cases, however, a ‘soft’ probabilistic assignment may be preferable, to reflect the pleiotropic action of genes. A user can readily do this using the probabilities calculated by Arboretum.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00603.024</object-id><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>The per gene probability of Arboretum module assignments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>).

We chose a relatively small number (k = 5) as a conservative choice, which may under-estimate divergence relative to conservation, since genes with minor differences in expression between species would still likely belong to the same module. This choice increases our confidence in those divergence events that are highlighted, but may miss other divergence events. Several lines of evidence support the validity of our choice including the correspondence between the overall trends based on the direct expression levels (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–F</xref>) and those based on inferred modules (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), the substantial proportion of variance (65–70%) explained by 5 modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>), and the lack of additional clear temporal patterns or distinct functional enrichments at higher <italic>k’</italic>s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s1">Figure 14—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In particular, the module assignments at the point of duplication are two independent draws of module membership, one each for copy, ensuring that the orthogroup has the same module assignment before the duplication and allowing it the freedom to change assignment after duplication. We used these features to characterize the role of gene duplication in the evolution of gene regulation, substantially expanding on previous analyses based on comparing paralog expression in on one or two species. We found that paralogs significantly contribute to divergence, mostly during a short window of opportunity after duplication, with a more prolonged contribution from WGD paralogs. This may be explained by the fact that segmental duplication rarely preserves the entire regulatory region resulting in immediate expression divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lynch and Katju, 2004</xref>) whereas duplicates from WGD events preserve the regulatory inputs and thus may take longer to diverge.</p><p>Our study sheds important light on the regulatory and metabolic changes that accompanied the evolution of respiro-fermentation, which occurred twice independently in this phylogeny. In both cases, mitochondrial and respiratory genes were reassigned en masse, accompanied by convergent <italic>cis</italic> regulatory changes. However, changes in the regulation of amino acid, purine and sulfur metabolism genes occurred only following the WGD, possibly by repositioning of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements relative to nucleosome free regions.

Respiro-fermentation is functionally analogous to the (somatically evolved) Warburg Effect in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>), which relies—to some extent—on the ‘neo’-functionalization of metabolic enzymes. There are well-known similarities in glycolysis and respiration between the two states that enable both cancer and yeast cells to direct glucose to biosynthesis, supporting their rapid growth and proliferation. However, both the causes of this metabolic signature and its connection to biosynthesis are not fully understood. The observation that genes encoding enzymes in the nucleotide salvage and glycine biosynthesis pathways are strongly induced post-diauxic shift in respiro-fermentative post-WGD species is analogous to recently identified changes in these pathways in cancer cells that display the Warburg Effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaglio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jain et al., 2012</xref>), suggests that rewiring of nucleotide biosynthetic pathways contributes to this phenotype and points to fundamental metabolic principles that are independent of evolutionary descent.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>An experimental framework for comparative functional genomics</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Selection of species</title><p>The species in our panel include <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and its close relatives (<italic>sensu stricto</italic> clade), three other species who have diverged after the WGD (<italic>Saccharomyces castellii</italic>, the human pathogen <italic>Candida glabrata</italic>, and <italic>Kluyveromyces polysporus</italic>), three members of the <italic>Kluveroymyces</italic> clade (<italic>Kluyveromyces waltii</italic>, <italic>Saccharomyces kluyveri</italic>, and <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic>), two members of the <italic>Candida</italic> clade (the human pathogen <italic>C. albicans</italic> and the halophile <italic>Debaryomyces hansenii</italic>), <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic>, and two members of the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces</italic> clade (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces japonicus</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Determination of growth medium</title><p>The substantial differences in carbon lifestyle and ecological niches present major challenges in comparative functional studies. In particular, the same growth stage (e.g., mid-log) may involve different metabolic requirements and states. Indeed, not all the species grow well in typical media formulations (e.g<italic>.</italic>, YPD). We first identified a growth medium (‘Materials and methods’) in which differences in growth between species were minimized. This formulation boosts the growth of otherwise slow growers, without substantially impacting the growth of fast growers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1B and 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>Selection of physiologically comparable time points</title><p>For each species in our panel, we collected genome-wide transcriptional profiles at six physiologically-comparable time points during growth in our media, as glucose is consumed and depleted from lag phase until growth rate ‘plateaus’. Even in our new medium, there is still substantial variation in growth between species, likely indicating real physiological differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, a second challenge was to identify physiologically-comparable time points across species critical for distinguishing true inter-specific variation from temporal shifts due to growth rate differences. We therefore determined in real-time the growth rate, glucose, and ethanol levels for each species (‘Materials and methods’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and chose physiologically comparable (but potentially physically different) time points for each species for isolating RNA from lag, mid-log, late log, ‘diauxic shift’ (the point at which glucose is depleted), post-shift, and plateau. The Lag phase time point was taken 30 min after inoculation for all species. Log phase was defined as the mid-point of exponential growth. Diauxic Shift is the point at which glucose levels reached 0. To choose the remaining time points, we chose two time points before the diauxic shift (Early Late Log and Late Log) and two time points after the diauxic shift (Post Shift and Late Post Shift) for each species at times proportional to the maximum growth rate in exponential phase in each species. Finally, the Plateau time point was defined as approximately 2 hr after growth had plateaued. A pilot expression study was performed using the same species-specific microarrays in which expression profiles were measured for each of the eight time points (described above) for one biological replicate for each species. These data were then used to determine the final six time points used in the larger study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Quality control of microarrays</title><p>We used species specific Agilent microarrays, designed based on the ORF annotations of each species, as collected in the Fungal Orthogroup Repository (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wapinski et al., 2007b</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/regev/orthogroups/">http://www.broadinstitute.org/regev/orthogroups/</ext-link>).

However, since our sampling was done in ‘real time’, concurrently with measuring growth rates and glucose levels, after the full time course was collected, we re-confirmed (from the growth curve, glucose curve, etc.) that the time sampled was consistent with its intended label (e.g., that diauxic shift indeed occurred at the time of glucose depletion). In a very few cases, we had to discard a planned replicate since its actual collection occurred before or after the intended physiological event (see ‘Growth curve alignments’ below). The collected replicates were very highly reproducible (median Pearson correlation between replicates is 0.97, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

First, in each species sampling times for growth curves of biological replicates were shifted in order to align the exponential growth phase.

These alignments were concatenated and branch lengths were estimated using codeml of the PAML package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang, 2007</xref>). We repeated this procedure 10 times, selecting a random subset of 1000 uniform orthogroups each time, and used the average of the branch length values as branch length estimates. Average and standard deviations are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Comparing global expression and sequence divergence across species</title><p>As a measure of expression divergence, we calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic>) between the expression profiles of each pair of species at physiologically matching time points: Lag, Late lag, Diauxic shift, Post-diauxic shift and Plateau, separately (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–G</xref>). For each pair of species, we considered only those genes that are present in both species. We used the sum of the branch lengths of each species in a pair to their nearest common ancestor as their sequence divergence, and normalized it to range from 0 to 1 by dividing by the maximum sequence distance. We next compared expression divergence and sequence divergence using linear regression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>The Arboretum algorithm</title><p>Arboretum is an algorithm that identifies modules of co-expressed genes across multiple species and infers their evolutionary histories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roy et al., 2013</xref>). Arboretum is based on a generative probabilistic model of module evolution via transition matrices (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), and models expression generation at extant species via Gaussian mixture models, with a mean and variance for each time point of measurement in each species. Arboretum takes as input the genome-wide transcriptional profiles for all species measured, as well as a species tree, and all gene trees (as defined from genome sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wapinski et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">2007b</xref>). As output it provides module membership of genes in all extant and ancestral species, mean and variance of gene expression in each module in each extant species, and transition matrices at each species (extant or ancestral, except the LCA) that specify the probability of genes in each module to preserve or change their module membership in that species compared to their assignment in its immediate ancestor. During the module identification procedure, Arboretum uses the gene tree structure to trace the evolution of gene membership from ancestral modules to extant ones. If a gene changes it’s module membership compared to its immediate ancestor, the ancestral module is considered to have contracted, while simultaneously the new module of the gene is considered to have expanded. Explicitly incorporating the gene trees enables Arboretum to handle complex orthology and paralogy relationships that arise from gene duplications and losses. The model parameters are learned using an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, which on convergence provides maximum likelihood estimates of the transition matrices, module mean and variance and module assignments in both extant and ancestral species.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Application of Arboretum</title><p>We applied Arboretum to two separate datasets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), the first (Analysis 1) including orthogroups with no duplication events (2746 orthogroups) and that are present in at least two species, one of which had to be <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, and the second (Analysis 2) including orthogroups with at most one duplication event (3676 orthogroups) and that are again present in at least one other species in addition to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. Orthogroups with few duplications have the most reliable orthology relations and gene trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wapinski et al., 2007b</xref>). In both cases, the orthogroups could include losses, and could be lineage specific. Species and gene phylogenetic information were generated by Synergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wapinski et al., 2007a</xref>) and obtained from the Fungal Orthogroup Repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/regev/orthogroups/">http://www.broadinstitute.org/regev/orthogroups/</ext-link>) with the exception of <italic>K. polysporus</italic>, which was handled as described above. <italic>K</italic>. <italic>polysporus</italic> was excluded from the second set (including duplicates), due to lack of reliable gene tree information for its orthogroups.</p><p>Because Arboretum is based on the EM algorithm, final module inference and parameter estimation results may depend upon initial parameter settings. Furthermore, module assignments may get permuted during learning. For these reasons, we ran Arboretum with five different random initializations, where each run was seeded with an initial clustering with merged expression data across all species. We selected a particular random initialization for our final results based on manual inspection of the transition matrices, and did not have any arbitrary module permutations. Results for different random initializations were very comparable in terms of the module expression patterns and the transition matrices. In particular, the average F-score similarity of modules between any pair of random initializations ranged from 78% to 99% for the extant species, and from 88% to 96% for ancestral species for the non-duplication case. Similarly, for the case when we included duplications, the average F-score similarity of modules between any pair of random initializations ranged from 76% to 99% for the extant species, and ranged from 77% to 98% for ancestral species. A more detailed analysis of Arboretum’s stability and sensitivity is described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roy et al., 2013</xref>). The transition matrices are also very similar across random initializations for both the no-duplication (0.73–0.99) and duplication cases (0.68–0.99).</p><p>The Gaussian parameters were initialized by projecting the clusters onto individual species. The transition matrices were initialized to have diagonal-heavy elements, by setting the diagonal elements to p, p&gt;0.5, and the off-diagonal elements to (1 − p)/(<italic>k</italic> − 1) where <italic>k</italic> is the number of modules. We experimented with different values of p, p<italic>∈</italic> {0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8}, and used p=0.8 for the final results. Learned transition matrices are similar for p=0.6 and p=0.7, and had a correlation of (0.7–1.0), with the exception of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces</italic> and <italic>C. glabrata</italic> which exhibited a somewhat lower correlation (0.44–0.56) in the transition matrices initialized by the different p. In addition, we also compared the behavior of Arboretum using transition matrices initialized from the branch lengths. Specifically, the probability of a gene in species <italic>s</italic> to maintain it’s module membership was exp(−<italic>m</italic> × l<sub>s</sub>) where l<sub>s</sub> is the branch length from <italic>s</italic> to it’s immediate ancestor. We set <italic>m</italic> to 1, 2 or 3, but did not observe any significant differences in the learned transition matrices using these initializations vs initializations of p=0.8. The transition matrices learned were not significantly different from those initialized uniformly with heavy diagonals (and as we observed in the case of matrices initialized with p=0.5, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic>, and the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces</italic> species had the lowest correlation 0.44–0.56 with matrices initialized with p<italic>=0.8</italic>).</p><p>To select the number of modules in Arboretum we used a combination of penalized log likelihood and manual inspection. First we computed the penalized log likelihood using the minimum description length (MDL) as the penalty with different values for the number of modules, <italic>k</italic> = 5, 7, 9, 11. The MDL penalty increases as a function of the number of parameters in our model, which is equal to the number of means and variances we estimate for each extant species, and the size of the transition matrices in both extant and ancestral species (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roy et al., 2013</xref> for more details). Using this process the number of modules asymptotes at <italic>k = 9.</italic> We next inspected the patterns associated with each module, which entailed plotting the mean expression profile of each module and selecting <italic>k</italic> to reflect the most distinct temporal patterns. Using this process we determined that <italic>k = 5</italic> gave us the most meaningful and distinct set of profiles in terms of the GO processes enriched in different modules and the patterns associated with each module. Higher values of <italic>k</italic> did not improve the GO enrichment and was prone to module switching between closely related expression profiles.</p><p>To measure the amount of signal captured by our modules, we estimated the percent variance explained, defined as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>err</italic></sub> is the sum of squared errors between the measured expression profile of a gene, and its predicted expression profile. The predicted expression profile is the mean of the module to which the gene is assigned. <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>total</italic></sub> is defined as the total variance in the expression data. This is also called the coefficient of determination.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Calculation of Ancestral Module Conservation Index (AMCI)</title><p>The Ancestral Module Conservation Index (AMCI) is defined for every species (except the LCA) as the tendency of the genes in that species to conserve their module assignment compared to the assignment in its immediate ancestor. The AMCI for a species <italic>t</italic> is calculated as the average of the diagonal elements of <italic>t’</italic>s transition matrix. Because each element is a probability value, the AMCI is bounded between 0 and 1. The closer it is to 1, the more likely is the species to preserve the module assignments of its immediate ancestor, and the closer it is to 0, the more likely it is to diverge from the module assignments of its immediate ancestor.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Calculation of Module Contraction Index, Module Expansion Index and Module Stability</title><p>We defined two metrics for measuring module divergence: the Module Contraction Index (MCI) and the Module Expansion Index.

To find instances of motif matrices we used a procedure similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Habib et al. (2012)</xref>. Briefly, we scan the upstream sequence of a gene summing over all instances of a motif to get a real-valued number per promoter that measures the affinity of a TF for a promoter. These numbers are ranked to select the top 40% genes with the highest affinities and these are considered as target genes for the motif.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Contribution of gene duplication to module reassignment</title><p>We assessed the contribution of gene duplication to module reassignment at several levels. First, we considered all orthogroups with duplications as a single set. To assess the tendency of a gene to be reassigned between modules before and after duplication, we compared the normalized number of reassignments of a gene pre-duplication to the minimum, maximum and average of the normalized number of reassignments of its two ‘descendant’ copies post-duplication. The normalization factor for the pre-duplication counts was the number of species before duplication, and the normalization factor for the post-duplication counts was the number of species including and after the duplication. In both cases we excluded a species from the normalization if it lost the gene or had a missing value. We then used the normalized reassignment counts to generate the cumulative distributions for number of reassignments pre-duplication, and minimum, maximum and average number post-duplication, and compared these using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test.</p><p>Second, we compared the cumulative distributions of normalized reassignment counts for genes that were never duplicated vs those that had a duplication event. For genes with duplications, we considered reassignments only at and after the point of duplication, and handled the paralogous copies as two data samples. We compared these cumulative distributions using a KS-test.</p><p>Third, we analyzed the reassignment of genes at each phylogenetic point. We considered duplicates that arose at the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces</italic> ancestor (A13), the <italic>Hemiascomycota</italic> ancestor (A11), the <italic>Candida</italic> ancestor (A10), the <italic>Kluveromycetes</italic> and post-WGD species ancestor (A9), and the WGD ancestor (A5), because these are the phylogenetic points at which the vast majority of duplications have occurred in the considered orthogroups. For each of these phylogenetic points, <italic>s</italic>, we define three quantities: (1) <italic>X</italic>, the number of paralog pairs whose duplication occurred at <italic>s</italic>, (2) <italic>Y</italic>, the number of paralog pairs out of those in <italic>X</italic> of which at least one member is reassigned at any point in the phylogeny after duplication (including <italic>s</italic>), and (3) <italic>W</italic>, the number of paralog pairs out of those in <italic>X</italic> of which at least one member is reassigned at <italic>s</italic> exactly<italic>.</italic> Note, each paralog pair is allowed to contribute at most once to these counts. We then estimate the fraction of paralogs that are reassigned first at their point of origin as <italic>W/Y</italic>, and the fraction of duplicates that are reassigned at all as <italic>Y/X</italic>.</p><p>Fourth, we considered duplicates that arose at each point of origin <italic>s</italic>, and estimated their tendency to be reassigned at <italic>s</italic> and at all subsequent phylogenetic points, <italic>t</italic>. Specifically, we compared the number of duplicates that are reassigned at a given phylogenetic point to the total number of genes that are reassigned at that phylogenetic point. The statistical significance of the number of duplicates that are reassigned vs the number of all genes (with or without duplication) that are reassigned at that point is assessed using the Hyper-geometric distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Association of paralog pair fate with modules</title><p>As described in the main text, the module assignments of paralogs can have four possible fates right after duplication: conserved, neo-functionalized, symmetrically diverged and asymmetrically diverged. To assess if any of these classes were specifically associated with a particular expression module, we used a Hyper-geometric distribution that tests the probability that <italic>k</italic> or more genes from module <italic>i</italic>, have fate <italic>f</italic>, given that there are <italic>x</italic> genes in module <italic>i</italic>, <italic>t</italic> genes in all that are associated with fate <italic>f</italic>, and there are a total of <italic>T</italic> genes that can have any of the fates at the pre-duplication ancestral nodes. We performed this test at the pre-duplication ancestor and the post-duplication child node separately, as the total number of genes are different at these phylogenetic points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Nucleosome occupancy analysis</title><p>To analyze the nucleosome occupancy profiles of species-specific modules and gene sets that are reassigned in a coordinated way between modules, we used an approach similar to that previously described for functional gene sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsankov et al., 2010</xref>)<italic>.</italic> Briefly, we compared the distribution of the 5′ Nucleosome Free Region (NFR) occupancy counts for a gene set with the distribution of 5′NFR occupancy of all the genes in the genome using the KS-test. We used the negative of the logarithm of the p value of the KS-test to quantify the difference in the two distributions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Positioning of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory motifs relative to NFRs</title><p>We used a collection of species-specific motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Habib et al., 2012</xref>) as well as motifs representing A or G rich <italic>k</italic>-mers (e.g., polyA and polyG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsankov et al., 2011</xref>). Instances of these motifs were searched in 600-bp upstream of the ATG of each gene and each species. To assess if the instances of a particular motif <italic>m</italic> were repositioned with respect to the NFR in post-WGD species vs pre-WGD species, we used an approach as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsankov et al., 2010</xref>)<italic>.</italic> For each motif <italic>m</italic> and species <italic>t</italic>, we computed the fraction of instances in NFR regions across all of <italic>t</italic>’s genes, <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>mt</italic></sub><italic>.</italic> We converted the <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>mt</italic></sub> values to <italic>z</italic>-scores using the mean and standard deviation of all <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>mt</italic></sub> estimated for <italic>t.</italic> To test if the instances of a motif <italic>m</italic> are re-positioned in the post-WGD species, we compared the set of <italic>z</italic>-scores for <italic>m</italic> in the post-WGD species to the set of <italic>z</italic>-scores for <italic>m</italic> in the pre-WGD species, using a <italic>t</italic>-test (p&lt;0.05).</p><p>To assess if the instances of a motif, especially polyA, were enriched or depleted in the NFR of a query set of genes, we used a Hyper-geometric test to compare the number of instances inside the NFR vs the number of instances that are in the NFR for all genes in the genome. Similarly, we calculated enrichment of instances outside the NFR by comparing the number of genes in our query set with instances that were outside the NFR to the total number of genes that had instances outside the NFR. Depletion of instances in NFR was (1 − p) of enrichment of motif instances in the NFR region. Similarly depletion outside NFR was (1 − p) of enrichment of instances outside NFR.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Nir Friedman, Andrew Murray, and Tal Shay for helpful discussions and comments.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The paper presents an excellent and carefully analyzed dataset dealing with principles of the evolution of transcriptional regulation. The paper has already been through one round of revision and has certainly been improved. [Editors’ note: the authors were encouraged to resubmit once the manuscript describing the Arboretum algorithm had been accepted, as it serves as a basis for the analysis in the current submission.] The data look very nice, with physiology-aligned sampling points based on growth phase and nutrient availability. They apply a recently developed algorithm called Arboretum to infer co-regulated gene modules and changes in gene module membership across the phylogenetic tree. An important aspect of the approach is the ability to infer ancestral states at internal nodes across the tree, allowing comparison of module composition in extant and ancestral species.</p><p>However, both reviewers felt that the interpretation of the results based on the Arboretum algorithm needs to be revisited. This may not require additional analysis, but a more self-critical discussion seems warranted that specifies the limitations of the current approach. The major points of the referees are:</p><p>1) The Arboretum algorithm requires that “…every gene (if present in that species) must be assigned to exactly one module”. This seems to be a very crucial point for much of the analysis. One would canonically expect that most genes have pleiotropic functions, i.e., could easily be part of more than one module. We understand that it is necessary to artificially restrict this to the best-supported module, but this can at the same time lead to problems in the conclusions. For example, changes of genes from one module to another could potentially be due to small probability shifts of assignment within the algorithm. It would therefore be important to know the second best assignments for these genes and how much the assignment probabilities differ from each other. Ideally a statistical test would need to be developed that would assess whether a shift was significant. It seems that adding more analysis and discussion of this point is a prerequisite for interpreting the observed shifts between modules.</p><p>2) A major drawback is that the Arboretum approach does not exploit the interesting temporal details. Only five modules are inferred, whereas by eye it is clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3 and 4</xref> that there are more than five expression patterns in each species, due to subtle (but likely important) temporal differences. Simply defining modules based on “strong” versus “mild” induction or repression, without subdividing modules by temporal patterns, does not provide a lot of resolution. Furthermore, the method “over-fits” the data by classifying genes into discrete bins without saying anything quantitative about the divergence in expression. For example, genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> look mildly induced to similar levels in Smik and Sbay, but the middle panel shows that the genes are classified into different modules in the two species. In the end, the module classification is discrete but doesn’t really quantify the divergence in expression very well. All this leaves the biological interpretation of these modules murky – surely there must be more than five regulatory systems across the life cycle of these species, and if so then what do these module groupings really reflect?</p><p>The Discussion is currently rather short and should be expanded to deal with the above points.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00603.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The Arboretum algorithm requires that “…every gene (if present in that species) must be assigned to exactly one module”.

We completely agree that genes may exhibit pleiotropic behavior. In fact, Arboretum is a probabilistic method that enables us to use probabilistic module assignments, and thus a gene has a probability of belonging to a particular module and is allowed to contribute to the overall pattern of modules, with its contribution weighted by the probability. The algorithm assigns a gene to a single module <italic>only at the very final step</italic> of the algorithm based on the maximum probability of module assignment. Furthermore, in our set up, where we have multiple time points for a single condition our model has separate parameters (mean and variance) to model each time point.</p><p>As the reviewers point out, it is possible that there are some genes whose posterior/final probability of belonging to different modules are not different enough; that is, the difference between the probabilities associated with the most likely module and second most likely module is small. To assess how common this situation is in our data, we now examined explicitly the probabilities of our specific assignment for each gene-module-species combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Author response image 1A</xref>).<fig id="fig15" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>A. Shown are the fraction of genes (y-axis) that are assigned to the most likely module with probability of at least 0.5, 0.7 or 0.9 in each species (x-axis). B. Shown are the fraction of genes (y-axis) whose probabilities of the second most likely assignment is less 30%, 50%, or 70% of the most likely assignment, that is q/p &lt;x% where q is the probability of the second most likely assignment and p is the probability of the most likely assignment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00603-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>In principle, if there is not a high confidence of belonging to a module (or in the case of a tie), the gene’s probability would be 0.2 in all modules (assuming k=5). However, in our data, for the vast majority of the species, approximately 95% of genes are assigned to their most likely module with probability of at least 0.5 (60–70% in <italic>C. albicans, Y. lipolytica,</italic> and the <italic>Schizosacchromyces).</italic> Thus, module assignments are quite certain. Furthermore, the probabilities associated with the second most likely are less than 70% of most likely assignment for approximately 90% of genes (60–80% for <italic>C. albicans, D. hansenii, Y. lipolytica</italic> and the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces</italic> species; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Author response image 1B</xref>). Thus, we conclude that in our particular case, using ‘hard’ module assignments at the last step is unlikely to affect our conclusions. Nevertheless, these probabilities are part of Arboretum’s output, and – as we note in our revised Discussion – future users can easily assign genes to <italic>multiple</italic> modules, by picking a cutoff of assigning a gene to a module, rather than picking the maximum as we did here.</p><p><italic>2) A major drawback is that the Arboretum approach does not exploit the interesting temporal details.

All this leaves the biological interpretation of these modules murky – surely there must be more than five regulatory systems across the life cycle of these species, and if so then what do these module groupings really reflect</italic>?</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. This is indeed a question we were concerned with not only when we applied the algorithm, but also in its application to data. A larger number of modules would be able to distinguish finer patterns, but is also more prone to overfitting, to separating co-regulated genes into separate modules, and to inferring “transitions” between modules that are erroneous, thus over estimating divergence. In early studies with a higher number of modules, we do see separation of genes, which we know to be co-regulated by a shared mechanism (e.g., in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), into separate modules. We therefore opted for a more conservative approach, with fewer parameters (modules) and possibly under-estimating divergence. We note this point clearly in the revised Discussion, and point the reviewers to the companion paper in <italic>Genome Research</italic>, where the choice of number of modules is discussed in great detail.</p><p>To address the concern of the reviewers that we are missing possible patterns, we compute the percent variance explained by our model for different values of k (i.e., different numbers of modules). We find that at k=5, 65–70% of the variance is captured. We also inspected the different patterns of expression by plotting the mean of each module. We did not find many different temporal patterns at a higher k (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Author response image 2</xref>).<fig id="fig16" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>Each plot is the mean expression profile of a module. Each row corresponds to different k’s and each column corresponds to a species.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00603-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>A future model, explicitly handling temporal dependencies may enable us to potentially capture different dynamics, but with the current version of Arboretum higher values of k did not change the shape of the responses captured. Modeling temporal dependencies as part of the mixture model is thus an interesting future extension, as we now point out in the revised manuscript.</p><p>As for the potential over-fitting issue raised by the reviewers. First, the choice of a large number of genes in principle <italic>reduces</italic> the chance of splitting genes with similar expression to distinct bins, as noted above. Furthermore, Arboretum <italic>does</italic> provide a quantitative model of expression at the leaves (extant species) with two parameters (mean and variance of a Gaussian). Arboretum does not provide, however, a model of expression evolution (only of co-expression evolution, by evolving module assignment). Defining models of expression evolution is an important (and challenging) future goal. We point this out in the revised Discussion. Finally, we examined the expression levels of the 45 genes pointed out by the reviewers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Author response image 3</xref>). We find that the mean induction for these genes is indeed lower in <italic>S. mikatae</italic> than in <italic>S. bayanus,</italic> consistent with the distinct module assignment by Arboretum, although visually these changes are hard to see in the heat map in our paper with a saturation level of −2 and +2 (but are discernible by eye when viewed at a larger range of log ratio-3 and 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Author response image 3</xref>). Most (32/45) of the genes are significantly lower in <italic>S. mikatae</italic> based on a paired one-sided t-test (p&lt;0.1).<fig id="fig17" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><p>Shown are expression heat maps of the 45 genes for which Arboretum inferred a lower module assignment in <italic>S. mikatae</italic> compared to <italic>S. bayanus.</italic> Each heat map shows the same 45 genes at different saturation levels log ratio −1 to 1 (top), −2 to 2 (middle), −3 to 3 (bottom).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00603-resp-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>The Discussion is currently rather short and should be expanded to deal with the above points</italic>.</p><p>We have significantly expanded the Discussion to deal with points 1 and 2 above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
