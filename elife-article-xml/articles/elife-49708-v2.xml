intimately linked although the rules of this interplay are poorly understood. In this study, we combined our recent P-body transcriptome with transcriptomes obtained following silencing of broadly acting mRNA decay and repression factors, and with available CLIP and related data. This revealed the central role of GC content in mRNA fate, in terms of P-body localization, mRNA translation and mRNA stability: P-bodies contain mostly AU-rich mRNAs, which have a particular codon usage associated with a low protein yield; AU-rich and GC-rich transcripts tend to follow distinct decay pathways; and the targets of sequence-specific RBPs and miRNAs are also biased in terms of GC content. Altogether, these results suggest an integrated view of post-transcriptional control in human cells where most translation regulation is dedicated to inefficiently translated AU-rich mRNAs, whereas control at the level of 5’ decay applies to optimally translated GC-rich mRNAs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>P-bodies</kwd><kwd>post-transcriptional regulation</kwd><kwd>mRNA storage</kwd><kwd>mRNA decay</kwd><kwd>codon usage</kwd><kwd>GC content</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007391</institution-id><institution>Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Subvention Fixe</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weil</surname><given-names>Dominique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-14-CE09-0013-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weil</surname><given-names>Dominique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DARK consolidator grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morillon</surname><given-names>Antonin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-LABX-0028-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morillon</surname><given-names>Antonin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006331</institution-id><institution>Canceropôle PACA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brest</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Standart</surname><given-names>Nancy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004815</institution-id><institution>Isaac Newton Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Standart</surname><given-names>Nancy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003138</institution-id><institution>Fondation Philippe Wiener - Maurice Anspach</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Standart</surname><given-names>Nancy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The GC content of human mRNAs is key to P-body localization and protein yield, and has a major impact on their post-transcriptional control.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Translation, storage, localization and decay of mRNAs in the cytoplasm are closely coupled processes, which are governed by a large number of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hentze et al., 2018</xref>). These RBPs have to act in a coordinated manner to give rise to a proteome both coherent with cellular physiology and responsive to new cellular needs. mRNA fate is also intimately linked with their localization in membrane-less organelles, such as P-bodies (PBs). We recently identified the transcriptome and proteome of PBs purified from human cells. Their analysis showed that human PBs are broadly involved in mRNA storage rather than decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Standart and Weil, 2018</xref>), as also observed using fluorescent decay reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Horvathova et al., 2017</xref>). However, the mechanism underlying the large but specific targeting of mRNAs to PBs is still unknown, though it clearly results in the co-recruitment of particular RBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In mammalian cells, the RNA helicase DDX6, known for its involvement in mRNA decay and translation repression, is a key factor in PB assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Minshall et al., 2009</xref>). Patients with neurodevelopmental delay caused by heterozygous DDX6 missense mutations were recently identified, and their skin fibroblasts show a PB defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balak et al., 2019</xref>). Human DDX6 interacts with both translational repressors, and the decapping enzyme DCP1/2 and its activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ayache et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bish et al., 2015</xref>). Its yeast homologue Dhh1 is a cofactor of DCP2, as well as a translational repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>). The RBP PAT1B has also been defined as an enhancer of decapping, as it interacts with DDX6, the LSM1-7 heptamer ring and the decapping complex in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vindry et al., 2017</xref>), while in yeast Pat1p activates Dcp2 directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nissan et al., 2010</xref>) and its deletion results in deadenylated but capped intact mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonnerot et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouveret et al., 2000</xref>). DDX6 and PAT1B interact with the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex and the DDX6-CNOT1 interaction is required for miRNA silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vindry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mathys et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ozgur et al., 2015</xref>). DDX6 also binds the RBP 4E-T, another key factor in PB assembly, which in turn interacts with the cap-binding factor eIF4E and inhibits translation initiation, including that of miRNA target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kamenska et al., 2016</xref>). Altogether, DDX6 and PAT1B have been proposed to link deadenylation/translational repression with decapping. Finally, the 5’−3’ exonuclease XRN1 decays RNAs following decapping by DCP1/2, a step triggered by deadenylation mediated by PAN2/3 and CCR4-NOT or by exosome activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Łabno et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A number of RBPs also control mRNA fate in a sequence-specific manner, some of them localizing in PBs as well. For instance, the CPEB complex, best described in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Minshall et al., 2007</xref>), binds the CPE motif in the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of maternal transcripts through CPEB1, thus controlling their storage and their translational activation upon hormone stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Standart and Minshall, 2008</xref>). Additional examples include the proteins which bind 3’UTR AU-rich elements (ARE), such as HuR and TTP, to control translation and decay, and play key roles in inflammation, apoptosis and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wells et al., 2017</xref>). Protein-binding motifs are generally not unique and rather defined as consensus sequence elements. In the case of RISC, binding specificity is given by a guide miRNA, which also hybridizes with some flexibility with complementary mRNA sequences. A variety of techniques have therefore been developed to identify the effective RNA targets of such factors, ranging from affinity purification (such as RIP or CLIP) to transcriptome and polysome profiling after RBP silencing, providing the groundwork to address systematic questions about post-transcriptional regulation.</p><p>In this study, we searched for broad determinants of mRNA storage and decay in unstressed human cell lines, using our transcriptome of purified PBs and several transcriptomic analyses performed after silencing of general translation and decay regulatory factors, including DDX6, PAT1B and XRN1. We also used datasets available from the literature, including a transcriptomic analysis after DDX6 silencing, a DDX6-CLIP experiment and various lists of RBP and miRNA targets. Their combined analysis revealed the central role of mRNA GC content which, by impacting codon usage, PB targeting and RBP binding, influences mRNA fate and contributes to the coordination between two opposite processes: decay and storage. Reporter mRNAs varying in their GC content confirmed that AU-rich mRNAs have a lower protein yield than GC-rich ones, that they preferentially localize to PBs, and that they have an enhanced capacity to form RNP granules in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PBs mostly accumulate AU-rich mRNAs</title><p>We have previously shown that PBs store one third of the coding transcriptome in human epithelial HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>).

While reminiscent of the low GC content reported for stress granule mRNAs in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Khong et al., 2017</xref>), our reanalysis of the published dataset indicated that stress granule localization correlated weakly with the gene GC content (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = −0.12, p&lt;0.0001) and almost not at all with the mRNA GC content (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = −0.06, p&lt;0.0001). Indeed, comparing the GC content distribution of the transcripts that are enriched or excluded from PBs with all HEK293 cell transcripts, revealed that mRNA storage in PBs is confined to the AU-rich fraction of the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>As these transcripts also correspond to AU-rich genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), it raised the possibility that the impact of GC content on PB enrichment resulted indirectly from the genomic context of the genes. To address this issue, we looked at the link between PB enrichment and meiotic recombination, which can influence GC content through GC-biased gene conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duret and Galtier, 2009</xref>). The correlation between PB enrichment and meiotic recombination was much weaker than between PB enrichment and mRNA GC content (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = −0.16 vs −0.64, p&lt;0.0001 for both, significantly different from each other, p&lt;0.0001). Moreover, the latter was almost unchanged when controlling for meiotic recombination (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = −0.65 vs −0.64, p&lt;0.0001). Finally, it was still significant when controlling for intronic or flanking GC content (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = −0.33 and −0.45 respectively, all p&lt;0.0001), showing that mRNA base composition and PB enrichment are associated independently of meiotic recombination or the genomic context. We also computed partial correlations to verify that the correlation between PB enrichment and GC content was not secondary to the correlation that exists between GC content and expression level, or between GC content and gene conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><p>To refine the link between mRNA accumulation in PBs and their GC content, we analyzed separately the influence of their CDS and UTRs.

Consistently, we found that the frequency of amino acids encoded by GC-rich codons (Ala, Gly, Pro) was lower in PB-stored than in PB-excluded mRNAs, while the frequency of those encoded by AU-rich codons (Lys, Asn) was higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The difference could be striking, as illustrated by Lys, whose median frequency in PB-excluded mRNAs was 32% lower than in PB-enriched mRNAs, thus ranging within the lower 17th centile of their distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition to different amino acid usage, we observed dramatic variation in codon usage between the two mRNA subsets. For all amino acids encoded by synonymous codons, the relative codon usage in PBs versus out of PBs was systematically biased towards AU-rich codons (log2 of the ratio &gt;0, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). For example, among the six Leu codons, AAU was used 4-fold more frequently in PB-enriched than in PB-excluded mRNAs, whereas CUG was used 2-fold less frequently. This systematic trend also applied to Stop codons. Some additional codon bias independent of base composition (NNA/U or NNG/C) was also observed for 4 and 6-fold degenerated codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). For instance, Leu was encoded twice more often by CUU than CUA in PB-enriched mRNAs, whereas the use of both codons was low in PB-excluded mRNAs.

Considering for each amino acid the codon with the lowest usage (called low usage codon thereafter), 14 out of 18 are NNA or NNU, with the exception of Thr, Ser, Pro, Ala. We calculated the frequency of low usage codons for each CDS, and plotted it as a function of the GC content at the third position (GC3) to avoid any confounding effects of the amino acid bias. As expected, the frequency of low usage codons correlated strongly and negatively with GC3, with AU-rich CDS having a higher frequency of low usage codons than GC-rich CDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). According to their distinct GC content, PB mRNAs had a higher frequency of low usage codons than PB-excluded mRNAs. However, the correlation coefficient between frequency of low usage codons and GC3 was very close for both mRNA subsets (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = −0.88 for PB-enriched; −0.80 for PB-excluded mRNAs, p&lt;0.0001 for both), meaning that their different frequency of low usage codons could be largely explained by their GC bias alone.</p><p>We previously reported that protein yield, defined as the ratio between protein and mRNA abundance in HEK293 cells, was 20-times lower for PB-enriched than PB-excluded mRNAs. This was not due to translational repression within PBs, as the proportion of a given mRNA in PBs hardly exceeded 15%, but rather to some intrinsic mRNA property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>). In this respect, the frequency of low usage codons correlated more with PB localization (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = 0.59, p&lt;0.0001) than with protein yield (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = −0.21, p&lt;0.0001, significantly different from 0.59, p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Conversely, the CDS length correlated more with protein yield (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = −0.43, p&lt;0.0001) than with PB localization (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = 0.26, p&lt;0.0001, significantly different from −0.43, p&lt;0.0001). Nevertheless, the length of the CDS and its GC content contributed independently to PB localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Finally, combining the frequency of low usage codons with the CDS length, that is, considering the absolute number of low usage codons per CDS, was a shared parameter of both protein yield (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = −0.46, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and PB localization (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = 0.49, p&lt;0.0001). Strikingly, CDS with more than 100 low usage codons were particularly enriched in PBs, while those under 100 were mostly excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). One of the mechanisms linking codon usage to translation yield could be the abundance of cognate tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Novoa and Ribas de Pouplana, 2012</xref>). However, codon usage in PB-excluded mRNAs was not more adapted to the abundance of amino-acylated tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Evans et al., 2017</xref>) than codon usage in PB-enriched mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In conclusion, the strong GC bias in PB mRNAs results in both a biased amino acid usage in encoded proteins and a biased codon usage. Furthermore, the high number of low usage codons in PB mRNAs is a likely determinant of their low protein yield.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The PB assembly factor DDX6 has opposite effects on mRNA stability and translation rate depending on their GC content</title><p>In human, the DDX6 RNA helicase is key for PB assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Minshall et al., 2009</xref>).

To investigate how DDX6 activity is affected by mRNA GC content, we conducted a polysome profiling experiment in HEK293 cells transfected with DDX6 or control β-globin siRNAs for 48 hr. In these conditions, DDX6 expression decreased by 90% compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The polysome profile was largely unaffected by DDX6 silencing, implying that DDX6 depletion did not grossly disturb global translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Polysomal RNA isolated from the sucrose gradient fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and total RNA were used to generate libraries using random hexamers to allow for poly(A) tail-independent amplification.

Since DDX6 is cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ernoult-Lange et al., 2009</xref>) and has a role in mRNA decay, we assumed that changes in total mRNA accumulation generally reflected an increased stability of the transcripts, though we cannot exclude altered transcription levels for some of them. As polysomal accumulation can result from both regulated translation and a change in total RNA without altered translation, we then used the polysomal to total mRNA ratio as a proxy measurement of translation rate. Nevertheless, for few transcripts, polysomal enrichment may reflect an elongation block rather than an increased rate of initiation. Analysis of the whole transcriptome showed a link between mRNA fate following DDX6 depletion and their GC content, but, intriguingly, the correlation was positive for changes in total RNA (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = 0.45, p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and negative for changes in polysomal RNA (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = −0.32, p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

As for DDX6, we assume that changes in steady-state mRNAs following PAT1B silencing generally reflect their increased stability (though, again, we cannot exclude some changes at the transcription level). However, using our previous PAT1B silencing experiment in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vindry et al., 2017</xref>), we surprisingly found a negative correlation between mRNA stabilization after PAT1B and after DDX6 silencing (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = −0.31, p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, sheet6), suggesting that they largely target separate sets of mRNAs.

TOP mRNAs are special within group II lists, in that their translational control relies on a cap-adjacent motif rather than on 3’UTR binding. 4E-T is a major DDX6 partner required for PB assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ayache et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kamenska et al., 2016</xref>).

The median fold-changes of the bins in each RNAseq dataset were calculated and plotted as a function of their median GC content. Median values were similarly calculated for the various group I and II target lists and overlaid for comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Surprisingly, the fold changes of the targets of particular RBPs generally fell very close to the tendency plot based on GC content only. This was particularly true for DDX6- and XRN1-dependent decay, with only 4E-T targets being more stabilized after DDX6 silencing than expected from their GC content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>). In terms of translation rate, only FXR1 targets were slightly more translated after DDX6 depletion than expected from their GC content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4C</xref>). FXR1 targets were also more dependent on PAT1B for stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4D</xref>) and more enriched in PBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4E</xref>). In the case of HuR, TTP, FXR1-2, FMR1, PUM2, IGF2BP1-3 and MOV10, there was some, but minimal, additional PAT1B-sensitivity and PB enrichment.</p><p>Similarly, the fate of the miRNA targets was mostly in the range expected from their GC content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Nevertheless, some miRNA-specific effects were observed. For instance, the targets of several miRNAs were more stabilized than expected after DDX6 depletion, including miR-99b-5p, 92a-3p, 16–5 p, 18a-5p, 19a-3p, 19b-3p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5A</xref>), though this was not observed following XRN1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5B</xref>). Similarly, while the targets of miR-101–3 p and miR-21–5 p were both particularly enriched in PBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5E</xref>), only miR-101–3 p targets were particularly dependent on PAT1B for stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5D</xref>). Interestingly, we noted that the median GC content of the miRNA targets correlated with the GC content of the miRNA itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5F</xref>). Thus, despite their small size, the miRNA binding sites tend to have a GC content similar to that of their full-length host mRNA, which affects their fate in terms of PB localization and post-transcriptional control. Altogether, our analysis showed that, in steady-state conditions, mRNA GC content is a major parameter in terms of PB localization and regulation by DDX6, XRN1 and PAT1B, while the presence of binding sites for regulatory proteins makes subsidiary contributions.</p><p>Next, the strong correlation observed between GC content and PB localization raised the possibility that localization out of PBs was sufficient to determine mRNA sensitivity to DDX6 and XRN1 decay. While a tempting hypothesis, it could not explain all DDX6- and XRN1-dependent decay, since TOP mRNAs were strongly excluded from PBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>), but unaffected by DDX6 or XRN1 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). To address this issue more generally, we considered the fate of the minor subset of AU-rich mRNAs that were excluded from PBs. Compared to other similarly AU-rich transcripts, these mRNAs were indeed more sensitive to XRN1-dependent decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However they were not more sensitive to DDX6-dependent decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This suggested that XRN1 preference for GC-rich mRNAs is at least in part related to their exclusion from PBs, whereas DDX6 has a true preference for GC-rich mRNAs.</p><p>Interestingly, these PB-excluded AU-rich mRNAs were strongly enriched in mRNAs encoding secreted proteins and proteins associated with membranous organelles, with GO categories related to mitochondria, intracellular organelles and extracellular matrix proteins representing up to 36% of the transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, while mRNA localization in PBs is highly influenced by their GC content, it may also be outcompeted by retention on membranous organelles and plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Contribution of both the CDS and 3’UTR GC content to PB localization</title><p>The next major issue was to distinguish which of the CDS or 3’UTR is more important for PB localization, since they have very similar GC contents (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = 0.72, p&lt;0.0001).</p><p>As a first approach, we analyzed PB localization of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>).

In fact, AU-rich lncRNAs poorly accumulated in PBs, while GC-rich lncRNAs were excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). This suggested that the coding capacity of mRNAs was important for PB localization. As a second approach, we directly analyzed the respective contribution of the GC content of CDS and 3’UTR to PB localization. On one side, we analyzed transcripts by groups of similar 3’UTR GC content. Their GC3 was systematically much lower in PB mRNAs than in PB-excluded mRNAs, with differences ranging between 9% and 13% GC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In a mirror analysis, we analyzed groups of transcripts with similar GC3.

Conversely, optimally translated transcripts would be better controlled at the level of stability. One prediction is that proteins produced in limiting amounts, such as those encoded by haplo-insufficiency genes, are more likely to be encoded by PB mRNAs. Genome-wide haplo-insufficiency prediction scores have been defined for human genes, using diverse genomic, evolutionary, and functional properties trained on known haplo-insufficient and haplo-sufficient genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Steinberg et al., 2015</xref>). Using these scores, we found that haplo-insufficient mRNAs were indeed significantly enriched in PBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>To add experimental support to the importance of GC content for PB assembly, we conducted two assays. First, we analyzed the localization of reporter transcripts that differ only by the GC content of their CDS. HEK293 cells stably expressing the PB marker GFP-LSM14A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>) were transfected with plasmids containing an AU-rich (36% GC) or GC-rich (58% GC) CDS that encodes the same Renilla luciferase (Rluc) protein. After 24 h cells were analyzed for luciferase activity and transcript localization. In agreement with our previous analyses, Rluc protein yield was considerably reduced (4.5-fold) using the AU-rich rather than the GC-rich version of the CDS, despite similar mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The localization of the Rluc transcripts was then analyzed by smiFISH using AU-rich or GC-rich specific probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsanov et al., 2016</xref>). PBs containing clusters of Rluc mRNA molecules were five times more frequent using the AU-rich than the GC-rich version of the CDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). A similar result was obtained in HEK293 cells after PB immunostaining with DDX6 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Therefore, simply changing the GC content of this medium-size CDS (564 codons) was sufficient to modify mRNA localization in PBs.</p><p>Second, we tested the capacity of AU-rich and GC-rich RNA to form granules independently of translation. To this aim, we set-up a cell-free assay using HEK293 cells expressing GFP-LSM14A to monitor the formation of fluorescent PB-like granules and count them by flow cytometry, as previously performed for PBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>). After lysis and elimination of preexisting PBs by centrifugation, addition of recombinant DDX6 triggered the formation of new granules on ice, in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>). These granules had a similar size to endogenous PBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This reconstitution assay was surprisingly efficient, as granule formation required rather low concentrations of both the lysate components (about 100-fold lower than in cells, see Materials and methods) and recombinant DDX6 (0.17 µM versus 3.3 µM in cells, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ernoult-Lange et al., 2012</xref>). Next, the cell-free extract was briefly treated with micrococcal nuclease to decrease the amount of cellular RNA, and the assay was repeated with or without addition of an either AU-rich or GC-rich 1700 nt-long synthetic RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F</xref>). The AU-rich RNA increased the number of PB-like granules in a dose-dependent manner, while GC-rich RNA prevented their formation. Therefore, in the complex lysate environment and at 0°C, uncapped non-polyadenylated AU-rich RNA specifically favor the condensation of granules that are DDX6-dependent and contain LSM14A, two proteins that play a major role in the assembly of cellular PBs.</p><p>We conclude from these experimental data and our previous analyses that both the CDS and the 3’UTR contribute to PB localization. Low GC content in the CDS likely acts, at least in part, through codon usage and low translation efficiency. In the 3’UTR low GC content could allow for the binding of RBPs with affinity for AU-rich motifs and/or influence RNA secondary structure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>An integrated model of post-transcriptional regulation</title><p>Our combined analysis of the transcriptome of purified PBs together with transcriptomes following the silencing of broadly-acting storage and decay factors, including DDX6, XRN1 and PAT1B, provided a general landscape of post-transcriptional regulation in human cells, where mRNA GC content plays a central role. As schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, GC-rich mRNAs are excluded from PBs and mostly controlled at the mRNA level by a mechanism involving the helicase DDX6 and the 5’−3’ exonuclease XRN1. In contrast, AU-rich mRNAs are enriched in PBs and rather controlled at the level of translation by a mechanism also involving DDX6, while their accumulation tend to depend on a mechanism involving the DDX6 partner PAT1B and most likely 3’ decay. Accordingly, NMD and m6A-associated mRNA decay pathways tend to target GC-rich mRNAs, while most sequence-specific translation regulators and miRNAs tend to target AU-rich mRNAs. The distinct fate of GC-rich and AU-rich mRNAs correlates with a contrasting protein yield resulting from both different codon usage and CDS length. Thus, 5’ mRNA decay appears to control preferentially mRNAs with optimal translation, which are mostly GC-rich, whereas translation regulation is mostly used to control mRNAs with limiting translational efficiency, which are AU-rich.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation recapitulating the features of mRNA post-transcriptional regulation depending on their GC content.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49708-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig7s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Distribution of the gene GC content in various eukaryotic genomes.</title><p>The graphs were constructed as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>.

Moreover, while the analysis was consistent in proliferating cells of various origins, giving rise to a general model, it is possible that changes in cell physiology, for instance at particular developmental stages or during differentiation, rely on a different mechanism. In addition, our analysis focused on trends common to most transcripts, which does not preclude that particular mRNAs could be exceptions to the general model, being GC-rich and translationally controlled, or AU-rich and regulated by 5’ decay. In terms of translation yield and PB localization, this model is strongly supported by our experiments using AU-rich and GC-rich RNAs: AU-rich reporter mRNAs have a low protein yield compared to GC-rich ones, they preferentially localize in PBs in cells, and they enhance the formation of PB-like granules in a cell free extract.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>GC content and codon usage</title><p>While the redundancy of the genetic code should enable amino acids to be encoded by synonymous codons of different base composition, the wide GC content variation between PB-enriched and PB-excluded mRNAs has consequences on the amino acid composition of encoded proteins. It also strongly impacts the identity of the wobble base: in PB mRNAs, the increased frequency of A/U at position 3 of the codon mechanically results in an increased use of low usage codons. As CDS are also longer in PB mRNAs, it further increases the number of low usage codons per CDS in these mRNAs. Interestingly, we showed that the absolute number of low usage codons per CDS best correlates with low protein yield. Thus, these results provide a molecular mechanism to a previously unexplained feature of PB mRNAs, that is, their particularly low protein yield, which we reported was an intrinsic property of these mRNAs and not simply the result of their sequestration in PBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, the mRNAs of haplo-insufficiency genes, which by definition are expected to have a limited protein yield, are indeed enriched in PBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the GC-dependent codon bias, we also observed some GC-independent codon bias in PB-enriched mRNAs. Interestingly, some important post-transcriptional regulation programs involve codon usage. This was shown for proliferation- versus differentiation-specific transcripts in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gingold et al., 2014</xref>) and for maternal mRNA clearance during the maternal-to-zygotic transition in zebrafish, <italic>Xenopus</italic>, mouse, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bazzini et al., 2016</xref>). Codon usage could also enable the regulation of small subsets of mRNAs, depending on cellular requirements. In man, half of GO sets show more variability in codon usage than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rudolph et al., 2016</xref>). Based on GO analysis, we previously demonstrated that PB mRNAs tend to encode regulatory proteins, while PB-excluded mRNAs encode basic functions. Furthermore, proteins of the same complexes tended to be encoded by mRNAs co-regulated in or out of PBs, in so-called post-transcriptional regulons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Standart and Weil, 2018</xref>).

Interestingly, our previous analysis of the read coverage of PB and non-PB RNAs alsosuggested the existence of distinct decay pathways related to 3’ and 5’ extremities, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>). Part of the triage towards the PAT1B versus the DDX6/XRN1-dependent pathway could be somehow associated with the capacity of the transcripts to condense in PBs, since, among the AU-rich mRNAs, only the ones enriched in PBs were affected by PAT1B silencing (not shown). Nevertheless, PBs do not directly mediate the triage, since (i) TOP mRNAs were strongly excluded from PBs, but unaffected by either DDX6 or XRN1 silencing, and (ii) while PBs disappeared after DDX6 silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Minshall et al., 2009</xref>), causing the release of AU-rich mRNAs into the cytosol, only GC-rich mRNAs were stabilized.</p><p>Focusing on DDX6-dependent decay, the minor impact of the 5’UTR GC content, compared to CDS and 3’UTR, indicates that this helicase is not simply involved in allowing XRN1 access to the 5’ end. It is tempting to propose rather that, by unwinding GC-rich double-stranded regions over the entire length of the mRNA, DDX6 facilitates XRN1 progression. UPF1, another RNA helicase involved in mRNA decay, has also been shown to preferentially affect the decay of GC-rich mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Imamachi et al., 2017</xref>). The same observation was made for targets of the NMD pathway, which involves UPF1, SMG6 and SMG7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colombo et al., 2017</xref>). Although the bias in these cases was restricted to the 3’UTR regions, it suggests that DDX6 could act in concert with other helicases for decay of GC-rich mRNAs. For AU-rich mRNAs, either such an active unfolding would be dispensable, or it would rely on other helicases that remain to be identified, with potential candidates being those enriched in purified PBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>). Noteworthily, in agreement with the present study in cell lines, skin fibroblasts from patients with DDX6 missense mutations also showed significant accumulation of GC-rich mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balak et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Concerning XRN1, we showed that it preferentially acts on PB-excluded mRNAs, that is, on GC-rich mRNAs but also, to a lesser extent, on a subset of AU-rich mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). While XRN1 is described as a general decay factor, there is evidence that 5’ decay shows some specificity in vivo. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mutations in XRN1 have specific phenotypes, including wound healing, epithelial closure and stem cell renewal in testes, suggesting that it specifically degrades a subset of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pashler et al., 2016</xref>). Of particular relevance, a recent study showed that yeast XRN1 associates with ribosomes and decays mRNAs during translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tesina et al., 2019</xref>). If the mechanism is conserved in human, it would explain why XRN1 preferentially acts on GC-rich mRNAs, since they are the most actively translated mRNAs.</p><p>Turning to PAT1B, we showed that its silencing did not affect the same mRNAs as DDX6 silencing. A recent yeast study also showed that Dhh1/DDX6 and Pat1/PAT1B decay targets poorly overlap, suggesting the existence of two separate pathways in yeast as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">He et al., 2018</xref>). However, the underlying mechanisms may differ in the two organisms, since both Pat1 and Dhh1 targets were poorly translated in yeast, while only PAT1B targets were poorly translated in our study. Previous studies reported that tethered PAT1B decreases the abundance of a reporter mRNA in human cells, as a result of enhanced deadenylation and decapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ozgur et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kamenska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Totaro et al., 2011</xref>). However, we did not find any significant evidence of PAT1B-enhanced 5’ to 3’ decay in our read coverage analysis. Interestingly, genome-wide evidence in yeast too suggests that following decapping a significant fraction of the transcripts up-regulated in cells lacking Pat1 or Lsm1 is efficiently decayed from 3’ to 5’, rather than by the 5’−3’ Xrn1 exonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">He et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, CLIP experiments in yeast showed a preference for Pat1 and Lsm1 binding to the 3’ end of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mitchell et al., 2013</xref>). Altogether, we therefore favor the possibility that the mechanism by which PAT1B affects mRNA stability in human cells relies prominently on 3’ to 5’ decay. It could involve the CCR4/CNOT deadenylase and the LMS1-7 complexes, as, despite their low abundance or small size, CNOT1 and LSM2/4 had high scores in our previous PAT1B interactome analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vindry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vindry et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>PAT1B showed a strong preference for AU-rich targets, including those containing AREs. Many studies have demonstrated a link between AREs and mRNA stability, and its striking importance for processes such as inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wells et al., 2017</xref>). Most ARE-BPs promote mRNA destabilization while some ARE-BPs, such as HuR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lebedeva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mukherjee et al., 2011</xref>) and AUF1 for a subset of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yoon et al., 2014</xref>), can stabilize mRNAs. Altogether, these observations raise the possibility that ARE-BPs behave either as enhancers or inhibitors of PAT1B activity in mRNA decay. Similarly, the miRNA pathway could activate this PAT1B activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Translation repression and PB accumulation</title><p>DDX6 activity in translation repression has been documented in a variety of biological contexts. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, DDX6 contributes to the repression of maternal mRNAs, as a component of the well characterized CPEB complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Minshall et al., 2007</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Me31B/DDX6 represses the translation of thousands of mRNAs during the early stages of the maternal to zygotic transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). It also collaborates with FMRP and AGO proteins for translation repression in fly neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbee et al., 2006</xref>). In mammals, DDX6 is a general co-factor of the miRNA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mathys et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kamenska et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu and Rana, 2006</xref>). The intriguing finding of our analysis was that the targets of most tested translation regulators (FRX1-2, FMR1, PUM1-2, most miRNAs…) were AU-rich and had a median behavior in all datasets similar to other mRNAs of same GC content. While the GC bias of the targets of the various RBPs and miRNAs are likely to reflect their sequence preference, some RBPs may not reach sufficient concentration to occupy a significant number of binding sites. Moreover binding does not mean activity, and these factors could require cofactors or post-translational modifications to become ‘productive’ in terms of mRNA regulation. Of note, while TOP mRNAs clearly constituted an exception in terms of GC content, they are particular too in terms of their translation repression mechanism, with a regulatory sequence located at the 5’ end.</p><p>PBs add another layer to translation regulation, by storing translationally repressed mRNAs. It was already known that ARE-containing mRNAs bound to ARE-BPs such as TTP and BRF were recruited to PBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Franks and Lykke-Andersen, 2007</xref>) and that miRNA targets accumulate in PBs upon miRNA binding in a reversible manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhattacharyya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). As DDX6 and 4E-T are key factors in PB assembly in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Minshall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ayache et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kamenska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferraiuolo et al., 2005</xref>), it raises the question of whether these proteins contribute to translation repression by triggering the recruitment of arrested mRNA to PBs, or by mediating translation arrest, which then results in mRNA recruitment to PBs. While we have no answer for DDX6, we observed that 4E-T targets were particularly enriched in PBs, though rather insensitive to DDX6 or PAT1B depletion. First, this suggests that 4E-T function in PBs is partly independent of DDX6, agreeing with the previous observation that some PBs can still form when the DDX6 interaction domain of 4E-T is mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kamenska et al., 2016</xref>). Second, it indicates that PB localization and translation repression by DDX6 can be separated, at least to some extent.</p><p>In addition to their high AU content, we observed that PB mRNAs were longer than mRNAs excluded from PBs. Long CDS could favor mRNA recruitment in PBs by decreasing translation efficiency, and hence increasing the fraction of polysome-free mRNAs. Long 3’UTR should increase the probability of binding translation regulators, contributing also to PB recruitment. In agreement, it is interesting that DDX6 preferentially repressed the translation of mRNAs with long 3’UTR, while the CDS length was irrelevant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G</xref>). It is also possible that protein binding over the entire length of mRNA may contribute to PB recruitment. This would explain why the GC content of the 5’UTR has little impact as it is considerably shorter than CDS and 3’UTR. In this regard, it is interesting to note that we and others have previously proposed from biochemical experiments and electron microscopy imaging that DDX6 and its partner LSM14A coat repressed mRNAs at multiple positions, according to their length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ernoult-Lange et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Götze et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Evolutionary issues</title><p>Our results raise intriguing issues in terms of evolution. While PBs have been observed in very diverse eukaryotes, animal and vegetal, the GC-rich part of the human genome only emerged in amniotes (the ancestor of birds and mammals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duret et al., 2002</xref>). In more distant organisms, such as yeast, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic> or <italic>Xenopus</italic>, genes have a narrow GC content distribution, most often AU-rich (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, despite the conservation of the DDX6, XRN1 and to a lesser extent PAT1B proteins in eukaryotes, distinct modes of mRNA stability control depending on GC content may have evolved more recently. Moreover, the enzymatic properties of DDX6 could have adapted to the higher GC content of human transcripts.</p><p>The GC-rich part of the human genome was acquired through GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC), a non-selective process linked with meiotic recombination affecting GC content evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duret and Galtier, 2009</xref>). We considered the possibility that meiotic recombination occurred more frequently in genomic regions containing genes involved in basic functions, leading to stronger gBGC and, consequently, to higher GC content of PB-excluded mRNA. However, our analysis showed that mRNA base composition and PB enrichment are associated independently of meiotic recombination or the genomic context. We therefore put forward a model where the genome of higher eukaryotes has evolved partly to facilitate the control of regulators at the translation level, by limiting their protein yield. Regardless, the overall outcome of our study is that in human the GC content, a feature written in the genome, shapes in part mRNA fate and its control in a strikingly coherent system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0,2% Triton X-100) containing 65 U/mL RNaseOut ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega) and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics), incubated 20 min on ice and centrifuged at 500 xg for 5 min at 4°C to deplete nuclei. The cytoplasmic lysate was half diluted to 75 mM NaCl with buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM CaCl2, 0,2% Triton X-100, and treated with 1000 u/ml of micrococcal nuclease (Thermo Scientific) for 15 min at 37°C.

After 2 hr on ice, 90 µL of the reactions were run through a MACSQuant analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec). Particles were detected according to their Forward-scattered light (FSC) and their green fluorescence using the 488 nm excitation laser and counted in the total volume. We have previously reported that in HeLa cells, 15 µg proteins (corresponding to 53,000 cells) contain 8.6 ng DDX6, and that DDX6 concentration is 0.56 mM in PBs and 3.3 µM in cells (170-fold less) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ernoult-Lange et al., 2012</xref>). In the assay, CBP-DDX6-HIS concentration is 0.17 µM (1 µg in 100 µl, 61 kDa), and therefore about 20 fold less concentrated than in a cell, while the cell content (15 µg/53000 cells, 1000 µm<sup>3</sup>/cell, leading to 200 µg/0.7 µl) is diluted about 100 fold (200 µg in 100 µl).</p><p>For imaging experiments, the reactions were centrifuged at 11000 xg for 7 min at 4°C, resuspended in 5 µL of Mowiol (PolySciences) mounting medium, mixed by vortexing and mounted between glass slide and coverslip.

The sets of transcript-specific probes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) and the secondary Cy3 FLAP probe were designed, purchased and hybridized as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsanov et al., 2016</xref>). Of note, none of the AU-rich probes and only 7 out of the 24 GC-rich probes hybridize to the GFP-LSM14A transcripts, resulting in either no signal or a faint signal which was easy to discriminate from the Rluc-GFP mRNA signal. Cells were further processed for immunostaining using rabbit polyclonal anti-DDX6 (1:2000; Novus Biological) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 350 (1:300, Thermofisher) antibodies.

Reverse primers for Firefly and Renilla luciferases were also added for the luciferase reporter assay. No amplification was detected in negative controls omitting the reverse transcriptase. qPCR amplifications (12 μl) were done in duplicates using 1 μl of cDNA and the GoTaq Probe 2X Master Mix (Promega) on a LightCycler 480 (Roche), programmed as follows: 5 min, 95°C; 40 cycles [10 s, 95°C; 15 s, 60°C; 10 s, 72°C]. A last step (5 min progressive 95°C to 72°C) calculating the qPCR product Tm allowed for reaction specificity check. Primers for ACTB, APP, BACE1, LSM14A, LSM14B, MFN2, PNRC1, TIMP2, TRIB1, HPRT1, REN-low-GC, REN-high-GC and FIREfly were either gifts from R.

Raw reads were processed using trimmomatics. Alignment was performed on the longest transcript isoforms of Ensembl annotated genes with bowtie2 aligner. Isoforms shorter than 500 nucleotides were not considered. Only unique mapped reads were qualified for counting. Each transcript was subdivided in 20 bins from transcription start site (TSS) to transcript end site (TES) and the proportion of reads for each bin was computed. For the metagene analysis, the average distribution of reads along transcript length was computed so that each gene had the same weight independently of it expression level.</p><p>The protein yield was calculated as the ratio between protein abundance in HEK293 cells, taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geiger et al.

Statistical tests for differences between Spearman correlation coefficients were performed using the R package cocor and the ‘meng1992’ test. Partial correlations were computed using the ppcor package. Other graphical representations were generated using Excel and the Excel Analysis ToolPak (Microsoft).

(AU versus GC content) of human mRNAs upon their post-transcriptional fates. The results suggest that translational regulation applies predominantly to AU-rich transcripts, whereas high GC content correlates with mRNA decay as the major mode of regulation for such transcripts. While the cellular mechanism of how the nucleotide content of an mRNA is recognized remains unclear, all three reviewers found the results that are described in this paper interesting and important. The authors have addressed the key concerns during the revision, and the manuscript is now ready for publication.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;GC content shapes mRNA storage and decay in human cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All three reviewers found the results described in this paper interesting and felt that the reported findings are in principle appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there were important concerns regarding the statistical methods that must be addressed. We note that the results are mainly correlative and causation was not established. As described below, the authors should test their model with specific reporter mRNAs with varying GC content.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is a general issue of how the data are analyzed; almost every result is supported by correlation analysis (Spearman). First and foremost, the authors compare two different correlations many times, and attribute meaning to differences in the Spearman values – this is not appropriate, a statistical test is needed to establish whether two correlations are meaningfully different. Second, the authors use a wide range of adjectives (weak, strong, moderately etc) to describe and interpret correlations, the selection of these adjectives seems rhetorical rather than rigorous. Third, it would be helpful to justify (in the Materials and methods, perhaps) why Spearman rather than Pearson correlations are employed. Fourth, there are statements (e.g., subsections “PBs only accumulate AU‐rich mRNAs”; “The GC content of mRNAs shapes post‐transcriptional regulation”) that require associated statistical tests.</p><p>2) Relying on the GC content as the main basis for the conclusion could be problematic for the following reasons: a) There is a clear technical bias that connects GC content to observed transcript abundance as observed through RNAseq. This has been extensively documented (Benjamini et al., NAR 2012, for example), and has to do with the PCR amplification step at the end of almost every library construction protocol. This might not be problem with regards to the data produced by the authors, but they do use data, including CLIP data, from other sources. It can be difficult to be certain that such data is free of such biases. CLIP data may be particularly sensitive to this bias since due to the low amount of input material, a large number of PCR cycles are often required to make a library. b) GC content is not a standalone variable in the transcriptome. It is significantly correlated with a range of other variables, including transcript length (Marin et al. 2003, Yeast), expression (Kudla et al. 2006, PLOS Biology), and conservation (Litterman et al. 2019, Genome Res). Accordingly, all of these variables are correlated with each other. This makes it difficult to assign observed effects to just one of these variables. This is not to say that GC content is not playing a role, perhaps even a dominant one. However, it could be problematic to draw mechanistic conclusions from groups of correlations of metrics (GC, length) that are themselves prone to spurious correlations.</p><p>This could be disentangled through the use of reporter transcripts. For example, one could look at the P body localization, DDX6 sensitivity, etc. of long but GC-rich transcripts, short but GC-poor transcripts, and so on. This strategy could also be used to look at the relative contributions of CDS and 3' UTR sequences, since the GC content of the two in endogenous transcripts are correlated and thus also hard to disentangle.</p><p>3) The authors should speculate as to how they feel the GC-ness of an mRNA is 'measured' by the cell. Do they feel RNA secondary structure plays a role – in which case the authors could cross-compare with global assessments of RNA structure (e.g. Luu et al. 2016 Cell v165, p1267) Or could it be that the levels of specific amino-acylated tRNAs are critical? In which case the authors could compare to aa-tRNA levels (e.g. Evans et al., Cell v165 p1267). Or is there some other mechanism that the authors feel could be speculated upon?</p><p>4) The terminology used throughout the paper needs to more accurately reflect the experiments and data that have been evaluated. For instance- the authors use the terms mRNA stabilization and mRNA decay when describing analyses where steady state mRNA levels have been measured. They silence specific factors and measure steady state mRNA levels and talk about factor-dependent mRNA decay. They haven't at any point in the paper directly measured the rate of mRNA decay or the stability of an mRNA. In fact, the only experiment that touches upon this is the metaplot of reads across RNAs showing accumulations of 5' and 3' reads. Again, though this is not a direct measure. Another example of this is the assumption that polysome enrichment equates to translation rates. Once again translation or the rate of translation has never been measured in the paper. Instead the steady state levels of mRNA in polysome fractions has been measured and is used as a proxy for translation rates. While this is quite common in the general literature, at the very least the authors needs to explain the assumption and the potential for polysome enrichment due to inhibited translation elongation should be raised as a potential caveat.</p><p>5) Elements in the Discussion and the legend titles to individual parts of figures are often overstated and need to be looked at carefully – several examples are found throughout the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49708.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is a general issue of how the data are analyzed; almost every result is supported by correlation analysis (Spearman).

The p-values have been introduced in the Results section and the R package used is indicated in the Materials and methods.</p><p>(ii) We have now unified the description of correlations using the following rule: Rs ≤ │0.25│: weak; │0.25│ &lt; Rs &lt; │0.5│: moderate; Rs ≥│0.5│: strong.</p><p>(iii) The Pearson correlation evaluates the linear relationship between two variables, whereas the Spearman correlation can also evaluate variables with a non-linear relationship. We chose to systematically use the Spearman correlation in the interest of consistency, since the variables under consideration showed both nearly linear (e.g. accumulation in PBs and GC content of the mRNA, new Figure 1—figure supplement 1D) and non-linear (e.g. accumulation in PBs and mRNA length, new Figure 1—figure supplement 1A) relationship. This justification has been added to Materials and methods.</p><p>(iv) We have now added the missing information. For the statement that PB mRNAs are shorter than SG mRNAs, a new figure panel (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C) provides a full description of the distribution of length of mRNAs enriched and excluded from PBs and SGs, with the requested statistical test. We apologize for initially omitting the statistical test supporting the difference of GHI in PB-enriched versus PB-excluded mRNAs. It is now indicated in Figure 6C legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Relying on the GC content as the main basis for the conclusion could be problematic for the following reasons: a) There is a clear technical bias that connects GC content to observed transcript abundance as observed through RNAseq.

Concerning our own datasets (PB transcriptome, transcriptomes after silencing), the extent of the GC bias was very strong, and highly similar when analyzing separately the replicates of each experiment, as well as in silencing experiments performed in parallel in two laboratories using different protocols and cell lines. For the datasets from other sources, note that some of them do not rely on RNAseq (ARE-, G4- and CPE- containing mRNAs) or only partially (experimentally validated miR targets). For the others, we agree that some artefactual GC bias cannot be completely excluded. Consequently, whenever possible, we repeated our analysis using independent target lists (for YTHDF2), or using the targets identified in several CLIP experiments (for IGFBP1, FMR1, ATXN2, AGO1, AGO2). Regardless of origin or approach, overall, the observed GC biases were highly consistent: (i) SMG6 targets defined by PARE were GC rich, as observed for NMD targets using different approaches (Gingold et al., 2014, see Discussion); (ii) both the targets of ARE-binding proteins (HuR and TTP) and the ARE-containing mRNAs were AU-rich; (iii) same for miRNA and AGO targets; (iv) or for PUM1 and PUM2 targets, which are known to overlap. Therefore, we do not see a strong argument to reconsider our global conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) GC content is not a standalone variable in the transcriptome.

Throughout the manuscript, we tried to tackle these potential confounding effects: GC content at the transcript and genomic levels (first section of the Results), GC content and length of the mRNA (Figure 1E, Figure 1—figure supplement 1H), GC content and length of the CDS (Figure 2E), GC content of the CDS and 3’UTR (Figure 6A, B). In principle, the methodology we used enables to disentangle parameters two by two, using our experimental dataset. For instance, take GC content and length of the transcript (Figure 1E): considering mRNAs shorter than 1.5 kb, those which are out of PBs have a higher GC content than the ones which are enriched in PBs (56% vs. 46% median GC); and the same is true in all length ranges. Therefore, even if GC content and length are correlated, we can conclude that PB mRNAs have a lower GC content independently of their length.</p><p>Concerning the possible confounding effect of expression level and conservation, we have now added in Figure 1—figure supplement 1G a new analysis relying on the computing of partial correlations. It shows that the correlation between GC content and PB localization does not result from the correlation between GC content and expression levels or conservation.</p><p>The reviewers suggested we engineer reporter genes with combinations of particular features. Putting aside the numerous combinations to test if we are to consider the length and GC content in 5’UTR, CDS and 3’UTR, meeting the objective would require to have a clearer knowledge of all important parameters, while we are far from that. For instance, a number of RBPs, or combination of them, are likely to play a role in PB localization. How to integrate such a complexity in synthetic reporters? Moreover, RBP binding sites often follow broad consensus, so that by manipulating the GC content of the reporter, one may unintentionally create RBP binding sites, which could also lead to confounding effects.</p><p>Nevertheless, following the reviewers’ suggestion, we have now added a reporter assay to test one of the simplest issue : can the GC content of the CDS affect PB localization ? We expressed in cells a GC-rich or AU-rich luciferase mRNA and monitored its accumulation in PBs using single molecule FISH and a PB marker. Clusters of AU-rich mRNAs were found five-times more often in PBs than clusters of GC-rich mRNAs. This was observed in a HEK293 cell clone expressing the PB protein GFP-LSM14A, as well as in parental HEK293 cells using DDX6 immunostaining. These new data are presented in Figures 6D-F and Figure 6—figure supplement 2A-B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should speculate as to how they feel the GC-ness of an mRNA is 'measured' by the cell.

In which case the authors could compare to aa-tRNA levels (e.g. Evans et al., Cell v165 p1267). Or is there some other mechanism that the authors feel could be speculated upon?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the mechanism by which the GC content plays a role is a burning issue. Investigating the potential role of RNA secondary structures will require detailed descriptors and in depth analysis, since we know that the global RNA secondary structure correlates with the GC content. This seemed to us out of reach for the current manuscript, but we now mention this possibility at the end of the Results section.</p><p>However, we have now set-up a cell-free assay to investigate the capacity of AU-rich and GC-rich RNA to enhance the formation of PB-like granules. In this assay, granules form upon addition of DDX6 protein to an ice-cold cytoplasmic extract containing the PB marker LSM14A fused to GFP. The granules are then counted by flow cytometry, an approach that we previously used for PB purification (we used FAPS, Fluorescence Activated Particle Sorting) (Hubstenberger et al., Mol Cell 2017). The addition of synthetic AU-rich RNA but not GC-rich RNA favors the formation of DDX6-dependent granules that contain LSM14A. This is in support of the GC content playing, at least in part, a translation-independent role in PB assembly. Further studies will be required to define whether it is important for the binding of particular RBPs and/or for the structure of the RNA. These new data are presented in Figures 6G, H and Figure 6—figure supplement 2C-F.</p><p>Concerning the effect of the GC content on codon usage, we followed the suggestion to cross our data with the abundance of amino-acylated tRNAs. There has been active discussion on the extent of adaptation of codon usage to tRNA abundance in eukaryotes, particularly in human. Despite their high protein yield, the codon usage in PB-excluded mRNAs is not clearly fitted to the abundance of the isoacceptors. Other mechanisms such as tRNA modifications or differences of tRNA affinity for their codon may be more suited to understand the consequences of codon usage bias. While this is a negative result, we still added the analysis in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, as it could be of interest for other readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The terminology used throughout the paper needs to more accurately reflect the experiments and data that have been evaluated.

While this is quite common in the general literature, at the very least the authors needs to explain the assumption and the potential for polysome enrichment due to inhibited translation elongation should be raised as a potential caveat.</p></disp-quote><p>Concerning mRNA decay, we acknowledge that we did not measure any decay rate throughout the study, but only analyzed steady-state levels following the silencing of XRN1, DDX6 and PAT1B. XRN1 is a 5’ exonuclease, and DDX6 and PAT1B have well-evidenced roles in mRNA decay and translation, but not in transcription. We therefore feel justified in assuming that the global changes in mRNA levels that we are documenting mostly result from changes in mRNA decay or stabilization, rather than in transcription. To take into account the reviewer’s comment, we modified the text to reflect more accurately the experiments. However, it was impossible to do it systematically without becoming unreadable. Therefore, we extended our previous comment “Since DDX6 is cytoplasmic [Ernoult-Lange et al., 2009], we assumed that total mRNA accumulation generally reflected their increased stability” to raise the potential caveat: “though we cannot exclude altered transcription levels for some of them.” We provide similar arguments for PAT1B data.</p><p>Concerning translation, we agree that we did not measure the rate of translation. Instead, as is common in the field, we used the ratio of polysome to total mRNA levels as a proxy of translation rate, as explained: “As polysomal accumulation can result from both regulated translation and a change in total RNA without altered translation, we then used the polysomal to total mRNA ratio as a proxy measurement of translation rate.” Following the reviewer’s comment, we extended this sentence to raise the potential caveat of relying on this ratio: “Nevertheless, for few transcripts, polysomal enrichment may reflect an elongation block rather than an increased rate of initiation”. We also recall in Materials and methods and legends what was really measured.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Elements in the Discussion and the legend titles to individual parts of figures are often overstated and need to be looked at carefully – several examples are found throughout the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the manuscript to avoid overstatements.</p></body></sub-article></article>
