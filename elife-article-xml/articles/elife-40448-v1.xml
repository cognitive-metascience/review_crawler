RNAi inheritance is associated with Histone-3-Lysine-9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) of the targeted genes. In other organisms, maintenance of silencing requires a feed-forward loop between H3K9me3 and small RNAs. Here, we show that in <italic>C. elegans</italic> not only is H3K9me3 unnecessary for inheritance, the modification’s function depends on the identity of the RNAi-targeted gene. We found an asymmetry in the requirement for H3K9me3 and the main worm H3K9me3 methyltransferases, SET-25 and SET-32. Both methyltransferases promote heritable silencing of the foreign gene <italic>gfp</italic>, but are dispensable for silencing of the endogenous gene <italic>oma-1</italic>. Genome-wide examination of heritable endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) revealed that endo-siRNAs that depend on SET-25 and SET-32 target newly acquired and highly H3K9me3 marked genes. Thus, ‘repressive’ chromatin marks could be important specifically for heritable silencing of genes which are flagged as ‘foreign’, such as <italic>gfp</italic>.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

Inheritance of such transmitted information was linked to inheritance of small RNAs and chromatin modifications, and hypothesized to protect and prepare the progeny for the environmental challenges that the ancestors met.</p><p>By base-pairing with complementary mRNA sequences, small RNAs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> control the expression of thousands of genes, and protect the genome from foreign elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luteijn and Ketting, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Malone and Hannon, 2009</xref>).

In <italic>C. elegans</italic> small RNAs that enter the nucleus were shown to inhibit the elongation phase of Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guang et al., 2010</xref>); In addition, nuclear small RNAs are thought to recruit histone modifiers to the target’s chromatin, resulting in deposition of histone marks such as histone H3K9-tri methylation (H3K9me3) and H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lev et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mao et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The interactions between small RNAs and repressive chromatin marks are reciprocal: in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holoch and Moazed, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Molnar et al., 2010</xref>) and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moazed et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Verdel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hall et al., 2002</xref>) small RNAs and repressive histone marks form a self-reinforcing feed-forward loop, where nuclear small RNAs induce deposition of repressive histone marks, and in turn the repressive chromatin marks recruit the small RNA machinery to synthesize additional small RNAs. Whether a similar feedback operates in worms and other organisms, is still under investigation. In <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, transgene-induced small RNAs work independently of H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chicas et al., 2005</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, it was previously suggested that H3K9me is required for RNAi inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shirayama et al., 2012</xref>). However, studies from different groups have shown that the situation is more complex, and that H3K9me could be dispensable, and can even suppress heritable silencing of some targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalinava et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lev et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Minkina and Hunter, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic> H3K9me is considered to depend mainly on the methyltransferases MET-2, SET-25, and SET-32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalinava et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spracklin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Towbin et al., 2012</xref>). H3K9 methylation by MET-2 and SET-25 occurs in a step-wise fashion – after MET-2 deposits the first two methyl groups (H3K9me1/2), SET-25 can add the third methyl group (me3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Towbin et al., 2012</xref>). In the germline, however, SET-25 is capable of tri-methylating H3K9 in a MET-2-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bessler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Towbin et al., 2012</xref>). SET-32-dependent H3K9me3 is at least in part independent of the activity of SET-25 or MET-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalinava et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To study the roles of H3K9me3 in the maintenance of heritable small RNAs, we examined the inheritance of small RNAs in mutants defective in these histone methyltransferases. Although H3K9me3 was thought to be required for heritable RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2012</xref>), we found the heritable RNAi-responses are greatly potentiated in <italic>met-2</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lev et al., 2017</xref>). Our data indicated that the enhanced strength of the RNAi responses in <italic>met-2</italic> mutants stems from a genome-wide massive loss of different endogenous small RNA (endo-siRNAs) species. In normal circumstances, these endo-siRNAs compete with exogenously derived siRNAs over shared biosynthesis components required for small RNA production or inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lev et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, we found that the accumulated sterility (or ‘Mortal Germline’, Mrt phenotype) of <italic>met-2</italic> mutants results from dysfunctional small RNA inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lev et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>However, our previous results regarding the role of H3K9me1/2 (deposited by MET-2) did not rule out the possibility that H3K9me3 is yet required for efficient heritable silencing of <italic>gfp</italic> transgenes: We found that RNAi responses in <italic>met-2</italic> mutants nevertheless lead to marking of the target gene’s histones with a heritable H3K9me3 modification. Further, a comparison of the H3K9me3 signal on the <italic>gfp</italic> locus in different mutants has shown that anti-<italic>gfp</italic> RNAi responses were strongly inherited only in genetic backgrounds where some H3K9me3 trace could be detected (i.e, in wild type, <italic>met-2,</italic> and <italic>met-2;set-25</italic> mutants). In <italic>set-25</italic> single mutants, where no statistically significant H3K9me3 footprint could be detected, anti-<italic>gfp</italic> RNAi was only weakly inherited. Previously, <italic>set-25</italic> mutants were reported to be deficient in heritable RNAi responses targeting different fluorescent transgenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lev et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>RNAi silencing of the endogenous <italic>oma-1</italic> gene is also inherited transgenerationally. In contrast to anti-<italic>gfp</italic> heritable RNAi responses, for which H3K9me3 is important, we detected an enhancement in the inheritance potency of anti-<italic>oma-1</italic> RNAi in <italic>set-25</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lev et al., 2017</xref>). However, in that study we did not examine whether an H3K9me3 footprint was deposited on the endogenous gene <italic>oma-1</italic> in the <italic>set-25</italic> background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lev et al., 2017</xref>). The publication of a recent paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalinava et al., 2017</xref>) which described strong anti-<italic>oma-1</italic> RNAi inheritance in <italic>met-2;set-25;set-32</italic> triple mutants, despite the absence of a detectable H3K9me3 footprint, prompted us to re-examine the inheritance of anti-<italic>gfp</italic> RNAi in this triple mutants. We hypothesized that gene-specific characteristics lead to contrasting requirements for H3K9me3 and specific methyltransferases. In this manuscript, we describe an asymmetry in the requirement for H3K9me3 and specific methyltransferases for heritable RNAi responses aimed against the endogenous gene <italic>oma-1</italic> and the foreign gene <italic>gfp</italic>. These differences led us to perform a genome-wide analysis of H3K9 methyltransferase-dependent small RNAs, which revealed that the endo-siRNAs, which depend on H3K9me3 target newly acquired <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes that might be considered ‘foreign’, similarly to <italic>gfp</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Recently Kalinava et al. examined the heritable RNAi responses against <italic>oma-1</italic> also in a triple mutant, lacking the three main <italic>C. elegans</italic> H3K9 methyltransferases, SET-25, SET-32 and MET-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalinava et al., 2017</xref>).

These results suggest that SET-32 has a distinct role, and that it probably acts upstream to MET-2 and SET-25, in promoting RNAi inheritance. This conclusion is also consistent with the recent observation that SET-32, in contrast to MET-2 and SET-25, has an essential role in the establishment of RNAi-mediated nuclear silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kalinava et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Unlike RNAi silencing of <italic>oma-1</italic>, silencing of <italic>sup-35</italic> and <italic>fog-2</italic> genes is not inherited transgenerationally</title><p>Currently, the only gene that serves to study heritable transgenerational (more than two generations) RNAi of endogenous genes is <italic>oma-1</italic>. Transgenerational RNAi inheritance requires the target gene to be expressed in the germline, and many germline genes are essential or do not have a phenotype that can be scored over many generations.

In search of other endogenous target genes whose heritable silencing could be studied, we examined the inheritance of RNAi against the non-essential germline genes <italic>sup-35</italic> and <italic>fog-2</italic>. SUP-35 is a maternally deposited toxin, expressed in the mother’s germline, suppressed by PHA-1, a zygotically expressed anti-toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-David et al., 2017</xref>).

While we found that this response was inherited to the F1 progeny, it was not inherited transgenerationally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). In conclusion, we could not find additional endogenous gene targets that can be transgenerationally silenced upon RNAi.

Many of the genes that are targeted by ERGO-1-bound endo-siRNAs are duplicated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fischer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vasale et al., 2010</xref>). Accordingly, we found an enrichment for duplicated genes amongst the genes that had reduced endo-siRNA levels targeting them in <italic>set-25</italic> and <italic>set-32</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). An additional characteristic of the set of genes targeted by ERGO-1 endo-siRNAs is an enrichment for poorly conserved genes, that have fewer introns, and possess splicing site sequences that diverge from the consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fischer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Newman et al., 2018</xref>). It was recently suggested that these poorly conserved genes are targeted for silencing because their aberrant or”non-self-like’ splicing signals are detected by the splicing machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Newman et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, we examined whether the targets of the endo-siRNAs that depend on SET-25 or SET-32 can be distinguished by their splicing signals. The changes in the endo-siRNA pool in mutants of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated protein RNP-2/U1A (<italic>rnp-2</italic>) mirrored the endo-siRNA changes found in <italic>set-25</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), but not that of <italic>set-32</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We also found that genes targeted by SET-25-dependent- but not SET-32-dependent endo-siRNAs bear fewer introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, median of 3 and 4 compared to 4 of all protein coding genes, p-values=0.0047, and 0.42 for SET-25 and SET-32, respectively). No significant differences in the length of the coding sequences were found, hence, the difference in intron number does not simply derive from differences in gene lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>, p-value = 0.8673). The lists of genes targeted by SET-25-dependent or SET-32-dependent endo-siRNAs were enriched with genes shown to be targeted by intron-targeting small RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). We could not find, however, small RNAs aligning to the introns of the <italic>gfp</italic> transgene that we studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>, in most cases endo-siRNAs target only exons). We also did not find significant differences in the splicing motif divergence score (obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Newman et al., 2018</xref>). Since splicing also directly affects the RNAi machinery untangling its role in endogenous RNAi is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Newman et al., 2018</xref>). In summary, splicing may be one of the factors that contribute to distinguishing genes targeted by SET-25-dependent endo-siRNAs, but not by SET-32-dependent endo-siRNAs.</p><p>In contrast, in the sets of genes targeted by either SET-25-dependent or SET-32-dependent small RNA we found a significant enrichment for <italic>newly evolved genes</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, fold-change = 2.57 and p-value&lt;0.0001 for both SET-25- and SET-32-dependent endo-siRNAs targets, respectively). We define <italic>newly evolved genes</italic> here as genes which had no orthologs outside <italic>C. elegans</italic> (35/151 and 78/337 of genes targeted by SET-25- or SET-32-dependent endo-siRNAs, respectively). Concordantly, in the same gene sets we also found a significant <italic>depletion</italic> for nematode-conserved genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Importantly, the sets of genes targeted by SET-25-dependent endo-siRNAs and SET-32-dependent endo-siRNAs show very small overlap (25 out of 465 genes). Thus, while SET-25 and SET-32 are required for the maintenance of endo-siRNAs that target different genes, the characteristics of these genes are very similar, that is they are distinctively newly evolved genes that have slightly lower levels of PATC sequences. Although the changes in PATC density and intron numbers that distinguish these target genes are moderate, it is possible that the cumulative effect of these small differences may result in the exposure of foreign genes that need to be silenced.</p><p>In general, we find that certain sub-classes of endo-siRNA, such as ERGO-1 and HRDE-1 bound small RNAs, target gene sets enriched for newly evolved genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The significant enrichment for newly evolved genes among SET-25- and SET-32-dependent endo-siRNAs is maintained, however, even after excluding genes that are also targeted by HRDE-1, ERGO-1, WAGO-1 or Mutator endo-siRNAs (SET-25: 59/151 genes are not shared, fold enrichment = 2.97, p-value=0.0001, SET-32: 153/337 genes are not shared, fold-enrichment = 1.89, p-value=0.0012). Thus, the enrichment of newly evolved genes amongst the targets of SET-25- and SET-32-dependent endo-siRNAs is not simply due to a general preference for newly evolved genes by endo-siRNA pathways. Further, we find that newly evolved genes are marked by higher levels of H3K9me3 in comparison to the average level of H3K9me3 on protein coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Likewise, in the absence of RNAi, in wild-type animals, <italic>gfp</italic>, the example for a foreign (non-nematode) gene that we investigated, has higher levels of H3K9me3, in comparison to the well-conserved <italic>oma-1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The fact that across the genome SET-25-dependent- and SET-32-dependent endo-siRNAs target newly evolved and H3K9me3 methylated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), may explain why inheritance of RNAi responses raised against <italic>gfp</italic>, but not <italic>oma-1</italic>, depends on SET-25 and SET-32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our experiments reveal a specific role for histone modifications in small RNA inheritance. While in S. <italic>pombe</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> a feedback between H3K9me3 and small RNAs was suggested to be required for silencing, the worm’s RNAi inheritance machinery may use H3K9me3 as a mark that distinguishes genes identified as ‘new’. Since newly evolved genes can be disruptive, small RNAs survey these H3K9me3-flagged elements transgenerationally.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study began from an investigation of a perplexing asymmetry in the requirement of specific H3K9 methyltransferases for heritable silencing of the endogenous gene <italic>oma-1</italic> and the ‘foreign’ gene <italic>gfp</italic>. Single mutants of <italic>set-25</italic> and <italic>set-32</italic> and the <italic>met-2;set-25;set-32</italic> triple mutant displayed different heritable dynamics when either the <italic>gfp</italic> or the <italic>oma-1</italic> gene were targeted by RNAi. These results are not unique to the specific <italic>gfp</italic> transgene that was tested, since similar observations have been made with other transgenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klosin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lev et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shirayama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spracklin et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Unlike mutations in these histone methyltransferases, which negatively affect heritable silencing of <italic>gfp</italic>, but not <italic>oma-1</italic>, mutations in genes required for small RNA inheritance negatively affect heritable silencing of both <italic>oma-1</italic> and <italic>gfp.</italic> For example, the argonaute HRDE-1 is required for inheritance of RNAi responses against both genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalinava et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shirayama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weiser et al., 2017</xref>). The fact that heritable RNAi responses aimed at different genes are affected by different proteins should be taken into account when studying transgenerational inheritance. Specifically, when screening for genes that affect such inheritance, one must acknowledge that heritable silencing of different targets requires different chromatin modifiers.</p><p>Future studies will hopefully reveal why some recently evolved genes, but not others, display high levels of H3K9me3 (in the absence of RNAi), and are targeted by endo-siRNAs. Recent studies examined why transgenes are sensitive to silencing by synthetic piRNAs, while endogenous germline expressed genes, including <italic>oma-1</italic>, are not. This protection was suggested to be conferred at least in part by PATC sequences, and to be independent of the genomic location of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). PATC sequences were previously shown to allow expression of transgenes in the germline in heterochromatic areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frøkjær-Jensen et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, our analysis revealed that the gene targets of SET-25-dependent and SET-32-dependent endo-siRNAs have lower levels of PATC density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, the <italic>oma-1</italic> gene does not possess many PATC sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). An additional theory suggested that an intrinsic unknown coding-sequence feature confers resistance to silencing by piRNAs. Seth et al. have studied why a fusion between <italic>oma-1</italic> and <italic>gfp</italic> can trans-activate silenced <italic>gfp</italic> transgenes (an effect known as ‘RNAa’,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seth et al., 2013</xref>)). While unique ‘protective’ sequence features were not described in that work, the authors showed that an unknown coding-sequence feature, not related to the codon usage or the translation of the protein, grants the <italic>oma-1</italic> gene with its ability to activate silenced transgenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seth et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that the gene targets of SET-25- dependent and SET-32-dependent small RNAs that we describe here have unique intrinsic sequences that distinguish them as well. The different requirement of methyltransferases for heritable silencing of some genes but not others may be related to such intrinsic sequence features. Alternatively, it is possible, as was suggested in the past, that new genes are silenced because they are not licensed transgenerationally by heritable small RNAs for expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Claycomb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shen et al., 2018</xref>). If this is the case, future studies will hopefully reveal how such license is granted (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> for Scheme).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40448.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Scheme characterizing H3K9me3 methyltransferase-dependent endo-siRNAs and their targets.</title><p>SET-25-dependent and SET-32-dependent endo-siRNAs are enriched with small RNAs known to be carried by the argonautes HRDE-1, WAGO-1 and ERGO-1 but not CSR-1.

The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that all the issues have been addressed.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;H3K9me3 is Required for Inheritance of Small RNAs that Target a Unique Subset of Newly Evolved Genes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has highlighted the concerns that require revision and/or responses, and we have included the separate reviews below for your consideration. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p><p>As you will see in the reviews below, the reviewers agreed on the importance of this topic and the potential impact of the work. However, they also identified concerns with the statistical analyses and strength of the evidence supporting conclusions drawn. During the post-review discussion, after reading the other reviews, at least one of the reviewers stated that s/he became more concerned about the statistics and the reviewer who raised the statistical concerns feels the paper should not be published without quite significant changes. I hope the reviewers' detailed comments below will help you decide how to address these concerns and best proceed with this work. At this point, given the concerns expressed below, it may be best to withdraw this manuscript and return it at a later date when you have had a chance to address the quite significant issues raised by the reviewers.</p><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper explores interesting observations, that some particular genes respond differently to RNAi from each other. Oma-1 is a germ line gene that for some reason ignores histone methylation pathways whereas GFP does not ignore these pathways. The authors make the interesting connection that GFP is a foreign gene and therefore may be surveilled more than the endogenous <italic>oma-1</italic>. And when they compare siRNAs that are loaded into the germline inheritance pathway, they find that genes that novel to <italic>C. elegans</italic>, more likely to be foreign, are enriched. This is definitely worth publishing. I am not informaticist so I cannot judge the scatterplots in Figures 4,5 so I only weigh in on the RNAi assays for GFP fluorescence or fertility. Those results in Figures 1,2,3 are convincing. I am a little ashamed of myself for not being able to judge the statistics which is why I choose anonymity. Paper is good to me. The discussion is excellent too.</p><p>One suggestion: an often overlooked feature of the GFP fusion genes that everyone in <italic>C. elegans</italic> uses is that the introns are artificial and constructed by Andy Fire back when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. If any intron is likely to be viewed as foreign it would be these introns. Deep sequencing of strains carrying GFP fusion genes should show if these introns are highly subject to siRNA production. Need to filter based on the intron exon junctions of these artificial genes. This is not a key suggestion. Optional for the authors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this paper, the authors attempt to parse the differential roles of the three known <italic>C. elegans</italic> H3K9 histone methyltransferases (HMTs), <italic>set-32, set-25</italic>, and <italic>met-2</italic>. One of the first observations they note is the differential role <italic>set-32</italic> plays in transgenerational epigenetic silencing of the <italic>oma-1</italic> locus and a <italic>gfp</italic> transgene. More specifically, they find that <italic>set-32</italic> is not required to silence <italic>oma-1</italic> but is required to silence <italic>gfp</italic>. This suggests that there may be differential roles between silencing of genes derived endogenously and exogenously. They use ChIP-qPCR to show that this finding is not a result of differential H3K9me3 deposition at the indicated targets. The authors use the minimal data they collected regarding differences in silencing <italic>oma-1</italic> and <italic>gfp</italic> in <italic>set-32</italic> mutants coupled with data from previous studies (predominantly, Kalinava 2017, Towbin 2012, Lev 2017) to draw conclusions about the epistasis of the three HMTs. The focus of their paper seems to pivot from epistasis analysis of <italic>set-32</italic> to the function and targets of <italic>set-25</italic> where they implicate this HMT in specifically targeting newly evolved genes. They identify 151 protein-coding genes that are the specific targets of SET-25 silencing. These genes are enriched for HRDE-1 and WAGO-1 targets, H3K9me3 presence, germline expression, and most interestingly, newly evolved genes. The computational finding that <italic>set-25</italic> specifically regulates newly evolved genes is novel and intriguing, yet, experimentally unvalidated.</p><p>The implications of this work would be significant as it represents an important and valuable synthesis of data from multiple labs that have struggled to clearly address to this point, frequently arriving at apparently contradictory results. Though the question is interesting, the authors fail to arrive at a convincing conclusion from their analysis. The experiments and lack rigor and the computational analysis is opaque. The very weak first half of the paper, in which the authors piece together datasets from multiple authors, coupled with the second half of the paper that lacks validated experimental evidence to support their model makes this paper unsuited for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Major Critiques:</p><p>1) Figures 1, 2, 3: The first three figures could be combined into one figure. The data are incomplete and, as presented, offer little novel insight. To build a cohesive story, including both novel data and condensation/replication of the numerous published studies referenced in text and outlined below, RNAi inheritance assays must be replicated in all single, double, and triple mutants, minimally including both an exogenous and endogenous target, and results correlated with H3K9me3 deposition at each target in each genetic mutant. This is essential to support the major claims of this paper.</p><p>a) Figure 1B (upper and lower) – redundant with Kalinava et al., 2017. (different experimental scheme, same data and interpretation)</p><p>b) Figure 1C (lower) – Redundant with Spracklin et al., 2017.</p><p>c) Figure 1D – Redundant with Figures 1B-C.</p><p>d) Figure 1A-B – Zeller et al., 2016 demonstrate that <italic>met-2;set-25</italic> worms have reduced fertility at 20 and 25 degrees C due to accumulation of DNA damage in the germline. This will impact the total% fertile hermaphrodites used as a readout for anti-<italic>oma-1</italic> RNAi inheritance when analyzing inheritance defects across all HMT mutants.</p><p>e) Figure 2A – Loss of H3K9me3 at the <italic>oma-1</italic> locus in treated and untreated worms in the <italic>met-2;set-25;set-32</italic> mutant is redundant with Kalinava et al., 2017. Accumulation of WT levels of H3K9me3 marks across the genome is known to rely on MET-2, SET-25, and SET-32 as shown in Towbin et al., 2012, Mao et al., 2015, and Zeller et al., 2016.</p><p>f) Figure 2B – Demonstrates that H3K9me3 signal is higher on the <italic>gfp</italic> locus than <italic>oma-1</italic> locus in untreated worms, yet maintains that since there is no observable fold change between H3K9me3 in treated/untreated (2A) this observation does not account for the difference in RNAi inheritance phenotypes observed in figure 1. This assumption is discrediting a valid interpretation that increased base level H3K9me3 deposition at the <italic>gfp</italic> loci compared to <italic>oma-1</italic> is important for the reported differences in RNAi inheritance.</p><p>g) Figure 3 – this figure in insufficient to support the epistasis argument presented in text. It should be condensed into Figure 1. Additionally, the figure contains a typo that renders it uninterpretable: either the data are switched or the y-axis is incorrect.</p><p>2) Figure 4: This figure requires more rigorously controlled analysis and should focus on novel insight.</p><p>a) Figure 4A – The authors fail to do due diligence in showing that the <italic>set-25</italic> targets they identify are solely <italic>set-25</italic> targets, and that they do not overlap with other HMT targets. Performing <italic>set-32</italic> RNA-seq is a necessary control to ensure that these are not a set of common targets simply hypersensitive to loss of a single HMT.</p><p>b) Figure 4B-C – It is unsurprising that targets of an H3K9me3 methyltransferase are enriched for H3K9me3. Additionally, it logically follows that these targets are downstream of a pathway known to deposit H3K9me3 (HRDE/WAGO) and not a licensing pathway (CSR). However, the authors should discuss why these targets appear oocyte specific (shown in 4C), while simultaneously HRDE-1 target-enriched. HRDE targets germline non-expressed genes, pseudogenes, transposons, etc. The authors fail to explain or comment on this paradox.</p><p>3) Figure 5: Experimental validation is necessary to uphold the claims of this figure, and the ultimate conclusions of this paper. Failure to experimentally and convincingly show that SET-25 is specifically required to target newly evolved genes renders this paper as nothing more than a prediction founded on unsubstantiated computational outputs lacking critical controls. These controls are especially important in datasets containing small sample sizes (151 identified SET-25 genes) which are more prone to bias.</p><p>a) Figure 5A-B – the authors show that SET-25 targets are enriched for newly evolved genes. However, they did not perform the important converse experiment: what percentage of newly evolved genes are SET-25 targets? This analysis is necessary to isolate common identifiers between the subset of newly evolved genes targeted by SET-25 as compared to all newly evolved genes. Without this analysis, their claims into the function of SET-25 are baseless.</p><p>b) The computational analysis lacks validation by experimental evidence. A computational model is most useful when it is predictive, and the authors have not demonstrated that here. There are multiple ways in which the authors can test their model, a few of which are listed below:</p><p>i) Test multiple transgenes for silencing +/- <italic>set-25</italic></p><p>ii) Validate the transgenerational silencing difference of some of the 151 identified &quot;foreign&quot; SET-25 targets as compared to additional endogenous loci.</p><p>iii) Add &quot;foreign&quot; introns or interfere with splice junctions of known (licensed) genes and ChIP-qPCR for H3K9me3 +/- <italic>set-25</italic></p><p>iv) Mutate <italic>gfp</italic> transgene to include introns of highly conserved gene or introduce better splice donors/acceptors</p><p>4) Figure 6: The model figure must include the full scope of the work. Currently, it only incorporates data collected in Figures 4-5, but does not help the reader understand the genetic interplay of the HMT pathway, and the relationship between H3K9me3 deposition and RNAi inheritance elucidated throughout the first half of the paper.</p><p>Minor Critiques:</p><p>1) Figure 1D – these data are redundant to panels (1A-1C). Although the data do illustrate the weak RNAi inheritance responses in later generations, this can still be seen in the previous panels, and the space would be better utilized expanding Figure 1 as outlined in point 1 above. This data could instead be included as a supplemental figure. Furthermore, it is unclear exactly what is being graphed. The Materials and methods section implies they did ImageJ quantification of GFP signal and that they analyzed ~1350 – 1450 germlines, however, there do not appear to be that many points on the graph. Better graph description or clarification of data collection is necessary.</p><p>2) Grammar and punctuation throughout – including incorrect possessives (third paragraph of Introduction: &quot;Worms small RNAs…&quot;), missing commas, incomplete sentences (final sentence of Results section titled &quot;Set-25 is required for the maintenance of a specific class of endo-siRNAs&quot;), etc.</p><p>3) Figure 3 results typo – &quot;…<italic>met-25;set-25;set-32</italic> triple…&quot; is incorrect (no met-25)</p><p>4) Citing primary literature – especially in Introduction.

It is, understandably, a proxy for the purposes of this paper, but to define it as such significantly changes the meaning, especially with regards to the definition used throughout Figure 5.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Rechavi and colleagues propose that, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, H3K9me3 is important for siRNA-based silencing of newly evolved genes based on the depletion of siRNAs from a very narrow set of genes, that tend to be <italic>C. elegans</italic>-specific, in an H3K9me3-defective mutant, <italic>set-25</italic>. The data is consistent with a correlation existing between genes that are non-conserved and dependence on <italic>set-25</italic> for siRNA production. It is not clear, however, if this applies specifically to the subset of genes for which siRNAs are dependent on <italic>set-25</italic> or if it is a general theme for all genes targeted by the WAGO/Mutator branch of the siRNA pathway. A revised approach for analyzing the data, described below, would help to clarify this point.</p><p>It would be helpful if the Results section included a description of the <italic>gfp</italic> transgene including what endogenous elements it includes and if the endogenous elements are expressed in the germline normally.</p><p>Figure 1D. The results and figure legend sections describing Figure 1D would be clearer if there was a brief description of what is being measured.</p><p>Figure 2A. Do the open and closed circles represent two different primer pairs as in 2B?</p><p>Figure 2B. As this is a qPCR assay, results from two distinct primer sets shouldn't be directly compared without absolute quantification, which is not described as being done in the Materials and methods. It's also a bit concerning that qPCR results from completely distinct experiments – <italic>oma-1</italic> from one experiment and <italic>gfp</italic> from a different experiment done at a different time – are compared side by side.</p><p>How many biological replicates were included int the small RNA sequencing experiment in Figure 4A? Even though the sequencing data was described previously, as this is the major data in the manuscript, additional details should be provided – strains, developmental stages, replicates, synchronization, total mapped reads in each library, library preparation method, etc.</p><p>What was the fold change cutoff for identifying the 279 genes – 1.2 fold, as was used in describing transposons?</p><p>It appears that few genes have more than a very modest reduction or increase in siRNA levels. If the downstream analysis was done with only genes that were depleted of siRNAs by 3x it might lead to more pronounced effects.</p><p>Figure 5. A general concern with the data in Figure 5, is that while the results may be significant, and when you have Ns as large as several thousand it doesn't take much difference to be significant, the effects are quite modest and as such the biological relevance is a bit questionable. For example, the difference in PATC density appears to be less than 10% – is there biological relevance to a motif being present 3.5 times compared to 3.8 times? Similarly, do the authors believe that there is biological relevance in a set of genes having a median of 3.6 vs 4 introns?</p><p>There must be thousands of <italic>C. elegans</italic>-specific genes, but only a tiny fraction are dependent on <italic>set-25</italic> for optimal siRNA production. Thus, <italic>set-25</italic>/H3K9me3 is presumably a minor player in regulating these so-called newly evolved genes. What is the role of non-<italic>set-25</italic> dependent siRNAs in regulating these genes?</p><p>Are the <italic>C. elegans</italic>-specific genes more likely to be targeted by the subset of <italic>set-25</italic> dependent siRNAs than non-<italic>set-25</italic> dependent WAGO/Mutator siRNAs?</p><p>In each of the plots in Figure 5, it would be more appropriate if the comparisons of <italic>set-25</italic> targets was to WAGO targets as opposed to all coding genes, as the observed results could potentially apply to any random set of WAGO targets and may not distinguish the subset of genes affected by <italic>set-25</italic>. This is sort of eluded to in the manuscript but not tested.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Lev et al., demonstrate that H3K9me3 is required for inheritance of RNA silencing at some genes but not others. Specifically, H3K9me3 seems to be required for RNA silencing at foreign and newly evolved genes. This is a very intriguing idea, especially because there has been some disagreement as to when and how H3K9me3 is required for RNAi and inheritance.</p><p>Overall, this paper makes some interesting observations, especially between <italic>oma-1</italic> and GFP, but this analysis could really be taken to the next level by more broadly by addressing how consistent this observation is genome-wide (and beyond just the <italic>set-25</italic> mutant small RNA data). Also, the discovery of SET-25 targeting recently evolved genes is not surprising because of the significant overlap with ERGO-1, WAGO-1, and HRDE-1 target genes. Multiple publications have shown that these ERGO/WAGO/HRDE targets are overall less conserved, have fewer introns, and are spliced less efficiently, so SET-25-dependent siRNA target genes also having some of these features seems expected.</p><p>Specific suggestions</p><p>Need more/better background about the three methyltransferases.

How do the SET-25-dependent siRNA target genes compare to the small RNAs dependent on the other to H3K9 methyltransferases (MET-2 and SET-32, alone or in combination)?

Oma-1 is a germ line gene that for some reason ignores histone methylation pathways whereas GFP does not ignore these pathways. The authors make the interesting connection that GFP is a foreign gene and therefore may be surveilled more than the endogenous oma-1. And when they compare siRNAs that are loaded into the germline inhertance pathway, they find that genes that novel to C. elegans, more likely to be foreign, are enriched. This is definitely worth publishing. I am not informaticist so I cannot judge the scatterplots in Figures 4,5 so I only weigh in on the RNAi assays for GFP fluorescence or fertility. Those results in Figures 1,2,3 are convincing. I am a little ashamed of myself for not being able to judge the statistics which is why I choose anonymity. Paper is good to me. The discussion is excellent too.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the kind words.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One suggestion: an often overlooked feature of the GFP fusion genes that everyone in C. elegans uses is that the introns are artificial and constructed by Andy Fire back when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. If any intron is likely to be viewed as foreign it would be these introns. Deep sequencing of strains carrying GFP fusion genes should show if these introns are highly subject to siRNA production. Need to filter based on the intron exon junctions of these artificial genes. This is not a key suggestion. Optional for the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>That is a great suggestion, but endo-siRNAs target exons (almost exclusively), as RdRP amplification it thought to occur on the spliced mRNA (Sapetschnig et al., 2015). Nevertheless, we examined the siRNAs that are aligned to the <italic>gfp</italic> construct that we used in our study, and our analysis (Figure 4—figure supplement 2) shows no targeting of the synthetic introns of the GFP construct. Therefore this does not explain how <italic>gfp</italic> is different from <italic>oma-1</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this paper, the authors attempt to parse the differential roles of the three known C. elegans H3K9 histone methyltransferases (HMTs), set-32, set-25, and met-2. One of the first observations they note is the differential role set-32 plays in transgenerational epigenetic silencing of the oma-1 locus and a gfp transgene. More specifically, they find that set-32 is not required to silence oma-1 but is required to silence gfp. This suggests that there may be differential roles between silencing of genes derived endogenously and exogenously. They use ChIP-qPCR to show that this finding is not a result of differential H3K9me3 deposition at the indicated targets. The authors use the minimal data they collected regarding differences in silencing oma-1 and gfp in set-32 mutants coupled with data from previous studies (predominantly, Kalinava 2017, Towbin 2012, Lev 2017) to draw conclusions about the epistasis of the three HMTs. The focus of their paper seems to pivot from epistasis analysis of set-32 to the function and targets of set-25 where they implicate this HMT in specifically targeting newly evolved genes. They identify 151 protein-coding genes that are the specific targets of SET-25 silencing. These genes are enriched for HRDE-1 and WAGO-1 targets, H3K9me3 presence, germline expression, and most interestingly, newly evolved genes. The computational finding that set-25 specifically regulates newly evolved genes is novel and intriguing, yet, experimentally unvalidated.</p><p>The implications of this work would be significant as it represents an important and valuable synthesis of data from multiple labs that have struggled to clearly address to this point, frequently arriving at apparently contradictory results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer and agree that lots of data were collected over the years, and that it is still a challenge to connect all the dots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Though the question is interesting, the authors fail to arrive at a convincing conclusion from their analysis. The experiments and lack rigor and the computational analysis is opaque. The very weak first half of the paper, in which the authors piece together datasets from multiple authors, coupled with the second half of the paper that lacks validated experimental evidence to support their model makes this paper unsuited for publication in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We think, and the other 3 reviewers appear to share our view, that our conclusions stand, and that this critique is not justified. We cannot refute this statement (since no specific problems are mentioned, it’s just general negativity), and therefore we choose instead to address all the specific comments, one-by-one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Critiques:</p><p>1) Figures 1, 2, 3: The first three figures could be combined into one figure. The data are incomplete and, as presented, offer little novel insight.</p></disp-quote><p>The three figures show different things, we think lumping all these data together would be too overwhelming. Therefore, for the sake of clarity, we leave the figures separated.

This is essential to support the major claims of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed it’s always important to replicate previous results, and we made sure to do it.

To the revised figure we also added new data on <italic>set-32</italic> (see below) and WAGO targets that further strengthen our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) Figure 4A – The authors fail to do due diligence in showing that the set-25 targets they identify are solely set-25 targets, and that they do not overlap with other HMT targets.</p></disp-quote><p>We never claimed that we saw anything that is true in general to all known HMTs. The Gu lab recently sequenced small RNAs from <italic>set-32</italic> mutants, the data was released (December 2019) 5 months after our manuscript was submitted (so obviously we couldn’t analyze it before, and therefore there was no “due diligence” to make). In the revised manuscript we include an analysis of these newly released data (Figures 3 and 4 and their figure supplements), which further support our conclusions and show that SET-25-dependent endo-siRNAs targets are unique yet their characteristics are shared with SET-32-dependent endo-siRNAs targets (for example high H3K9me3, newly evolved genes, HRDE-1 targets..).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Performing set-32 RNA-seq is a necessary control to ensure that these are not a set of common targets simply hypersensitive to loss of a single HMT.</p></disp-quote><p>An analysis of <italic>set-32</italic> RNA-seq is added to the revised manuscript, see Figures 3 and 4. We found that endo-siRNAs that depend on the two HMTs (SET-32 and SET-25) target different genes (very small overlap of 25 out of 465 genes). Importantly, however, the characteristics of these gene targets are very similar – H3K9me3 methylated, known targets of HRDE-1 and ERGO-1 argonauts, and newly evolved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Figure 4B-C – It is unsurprising that targets of an H3K9me3 methyltransferase are enriched for H3K9me3.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not agree. It is certainly surprising that endogenous small RNAs are <italic>directly</italic> affected by H3K9 methylation. The effects of the methylations could have been indirect (as is the case sometimes, for example as we demonstrated in Lev et al. Current Biology 2017). Further, in general it’s not a valid critique to speculate if something is surprising or not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, it logically follows that these targets are downstream of a pathway known to deposit H3K9me3 (HRDE/WAGO) and not a licensing pathway (CSR). However, the authors should discuss why these targets appear oocyte specific (shown in 4C), while simultaneously HRDE-1 target-enriched. HRDE targets germline non-expressed genes, pseudogenes, transposons, etc. The authors fail to explain or comment on this paradox.</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t think it’s a paradox. HRDE-1 is expressed specifically in the germline. Gene targets of HRDE-1 are not completely silenced in the germline. Indeed, we find a large overlap between HRDE-1 targets (Buckley et al., 2012) and germline expressed genes ((Buckley et al., 2012), (1000/1048 HRDE-1 targets!), See Figure 3—figure supplement 2. We elaborate on this now in subsection “H3K9me3 methyltransferases are required for the biogenesis of a specific class of endo-siRNAs”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 5: Experimental validation is necessary to uphold the claims of this figure, and the ultimate conclusions of this paper. Failure to experimentally and convincingly show that SET-25 is specifically required to target newly evolved genes renders this paper as nothing more than a prediction founded on unsubstantiated computational outputs lacking critical controls. These controls are especially important in datasets containing small sample sizes (151 identified SET-25 genes) which are more prone to bias.</p></disp-quote><p>It's not clear how to test this (that newly evolved genes are subjected to SET-25-dependent heritable RNAi). The data generated an interesting hypothesis that maybe future studies could further study. In addition, the experiments with the two reporter genes (<italic>oma-1</italic> and <italic>gfp</italic>) support these ideas.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) Figure 5A-B – the authors show that SET-25 targets are enriched for newly evolved genes. However, they did not perform the important converse experiment: what percentage of newly evolved genes are SET-25 targets? This analysis is necessary to isolate common identifiers between the subset of newly evolved genes targeted by SET-25 as compared to all newly evolved genes. Without this analysis, their claims into the function of SET-25 are baseless.</p></disp-quote><p>The converse fold change of enrichment of SET-25 targets amongst newly evolved genes is 2.57 (the same as the direct fold change enrichment value presented in the paper) and the is p-value &lt; 0.0001.</p><p>The fold enrichment is calculated (described in the Materials and methods section) as follows:</p><p>Enrichment=ObservedExpected=fractionofgenesbelongtothei-thsetamongdifferentialexpressedSTGsfractionofgenesbelongtothei-thsetamongallthegenes</p><p>Therefore, converse enrichment calculations do not give values different from the enrichment values. The P value might change due to the randomization and changes in the size of the examined gene set.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The computational analysis lacks validation by experimental evidence. A computational model is most useful when it is predictive, and the authors have not demonstrated that here. There are multiple ways in which the authors can test their model, a few of which are listed below:</p><p>i) Test multiple transgenes for silencing +/- set-25</p></disp-quote><p>We previously tested an additional transgene for silencing with <italic>set-25</italic> mutants and got the same results (see Sup Figure 2B in Lev et al., 2017).

Currently, it only incorporates data collected in Figures 4-5, but does not help the reader understand the genetic interplay of the HMT pathway, and the relationship between H3K9me3 deposition and RNAi inheritance elucidated throughout the first half of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion. Since we added to the revised manuscript genome wide analyses of <italic>set-32</italic> mutants, we incorporate the conclusion of these experiments to the Model Figure. In addition, we added a supplementary figure that explains the interplay between the HMT mutants (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Critiques:</p><p>1) Figure 1D – these data are redundant to panels (1A-1C). Although the data do illustrate the weak RNAi inheritance responses in later generations, this can still be seen in the previous panels, and the space would be better utilized expanding figure 1 as outlined in point 1 above. This data could instead be included as a supplemental figure.</p></disp-quote><p>As we wrote above (this was raised in a previous comment of the same reviewer) Figure 1D (Figure 1—figure supplement 1 in the revised version) shows the absolute quantification of GFP, and therefore we do not think it is redundant. Moreover, it shows that there’s weak inheritance in the mutants (which is different from what was previously suggested in the literature). Nevertheless, we have no objection to moving it to the supplemental information, and we did so in the revised manuscript (now shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, it is unclear exactly what is being graphed. The Materials and methods section implies they did ImageJ quantification of GFP signal and that they analyzed ~1350 – 1450 germlines, however, there do not appear to be that many points on the graph. Better graph description or clarification of data collection is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>Since it’s a scatter column graph, points with the similar values “fall” on each other.

It is, understandably, a proxy for the purposes of this paper, but to define it as such significantly changes the meaning, especially with regards to the definition used throughout Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, indeed, we made sure that we did not say it’s a newly evolved gene anywhere in the paper. As the reviewer writes, we say that it could perhaps be seen as a proxy. We toned down these statements in the revised text.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Rechavi and colleagues propose that, in C. elegans, H3K9me3 is important for siRNA-based silencing of newly evolved genes based on the depletion of siRNAs from a very narrow set of genes, that tend to be C. elegans-specific, in an H3K9me3-defective mutant, set-25. The data is consistent with a correlation existing between genes that are non-conserved and dependence on set-25 for siRNA production. It is not clear, however, if this applies specifically to the subset of genes for which siRNAs are dependent on set-25 or if it is a general theme for all genes targeted by the WAGO/Mutator branch of the siRNA pathway. A revised approach for analyzing the data, described below, would help to clarify this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her excellent comments, we added the suggested new analyses to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be helpful if the Results section included a description of the gfp transgene including what endogenous elements it includes and if the endogenous elements are expressed in the germline normally.</p></disp-quote><p>Added (Figure 4—figure supplement 2E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1D.

As this is a qPCR assay, results from two distinct primer sets shouldn't be directly compared without absolute quantification, which is not described as being done in the Materials and methods.

It is also worth noting that the <italic>gfp</italic> and <italic>oma-</italic>1 H3K9me3 ChIP experiments were done using the same strain (SX1263), grown on the same control bacteria, using the same ChIP protocol and reagents.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How many biological replicates were included int the small RNA sequencing experiment in Figure 4A?

Adding a fold change cutoff did not change our results (Supplementary file 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5. A general concern with the data in Figure 5, is that while the results may be significant, and when you have Ns as large as several thousand it doesn't take much difference to be significant, the effects are quite modest and as such the biological relevance is a bit questionable. For example, the difference in PATC density appears to be less than 10% – is there biological relevance to a motif being present 3.5 times compared to 3.8 times? Similarly, do the authors believe that there is biological relevance in a set of genes having a median of 3.6 vs 4 introns?</p></disp-quote><p>That’s a good point, we agree with the reviewer, and therefore we acknowledge this in the revised manuscript and detail the exact differences in means. It also worth noting that the PATC density distributions were graphed in log2 scale such that the actual differences are larger than seen (~10% in median, and ~25% in average levels). In the revised version we note in the figure that log2 scale is shown in addition to the explanation in the figure legends. We also added analysis of PATC density levels of targets of WAGO associated endo-siRNAs (now Figure 4A) and endo-siRNAs <italic>upreulgated</italic> in <italic>set-25</italic> and <italic>set-32</italic> mutants (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) that shows that the reduced PATC density levels are specific to endo-siRNAs that depend on SET-25 or SET-32. Moreover, in the revised paper we further explain how many complementary signals, even if some are relatively small (in average intron number or PATC levels) could together expose genes that need to be silenced (See subsection “Endo-siRNAs that depend on H3K9me3 methyltransferases target a distinctive subset of newly evolved genes” paragraph three).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There must be thousands of C. elegans-specific genes, but only a tiny fraction are dependent on set-25 for optimal siRNA production. Thus, set-25/H3K9me3 is presumably a minor player in regulating these so-called newly evolved genes. What is the role of non-set-25 dependent siRNAs in regulating these genes?</p><p>Are the C. elegans-specific genes more likely to be targeted by the subset of set-25 dependent siRNAs than non-set-25 dependent WAGO/Mutator siRNAs?</p></disp-quote><p>Another good point. We analyzed this in Figure 4—figure supplement 3 in the revised manuscript. We found that the ERGO-1, WAGO-1, and HRDE-1 and Mutator class small RNAs show significant enrichment for targeting newly evolved genes. However, while the fold enrichment for newly evolved genes is comparable between endo-siRNAs that depend on SET-25 or SET-32, and those that depend on other WAGO/Mutator factors, we found that the SET-25/32 dependent endo-siRNAs that target newly evolved genes do not fully overlap with the endo-siRNAs that depend on the WAGO pathways. Further, the enrichment for newly evolved genes is maintained for SET-25/32 dependent endo-siRNAs, even when we removed the targets shared with ERGO-1, WAGO-1, and HRDE-1 and Mutator from the analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In each of the plots in Figure 5, it would be more appropriate if the comparisons of set-25 targets was to WAGO targets as opposed to all coding genes, as the observed results could potentially apply to any random set of WAGO targets and may not distinguish the subset of genes affected by set-25. This is sort of eluded to in the manuscript but not tested.</p></disp-quote><p>These comparisons are added to the revised manuscript.
