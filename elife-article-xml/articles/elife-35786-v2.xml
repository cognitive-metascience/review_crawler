The production of NC cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is a valuable approach to study human NC biology. However, the origin of human trunk NC remains undefined and current in vitro differentiation strategies induce only a modest yield of trunk NC cells. Here we show that hPSC-derived axial progenitors, the posteriorly-located drivers of embryonic axis elongation, give rise to trunk NC cells and their derivatives. Moreover, we define the molecular signatures associated with the emergence of human NC cells of distinct axial identities in vitro. Collectively, our findings indicate that there are two routes toward a human post-cranial NC state: the birth of cardiac and vagal NC is facilitated by retinoic acid-induced posteriorisation of an anterior precursor whereas trunk NC arises within a pool of posterior axial progenitors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axial progenitors</kwd><kwd>neural

multipotent cell population which arises in the dorsal neural plate/non-neural ectoderm border region during vertebrate embryogenesis. Studies utilising chick and amphibian embryos have indicated that different levels of BMP, WNT and FGF signals, emanating from the mesoderm/non-neural ectoderm, orchestrate NC induction and specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Stuhlmiller and García-Castro, 2012</xref>). This occurs via the action, first of neural plate border-specific transcription factors such as PAX3/7, MSX and ZIC family members, and then via definitive NC-specifiers (e.g. SOX9/10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Simões-Costa and Bronner, 2015</xref>). Once specified, NC cells undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), exit the neural tube, and migrate to generate various cell types. The identity of NC products correlates with their position along the anteroposterior (A-P) axis, which is in turn reflected by the expression of HOX gene paralogous groups (PGs). Cranial NC cells give rise to mesoectodermal derivatives (e.g. dermis, cartilage, bone), melanocytes, neurons and glia colonizing the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Le Douarin et al., 2004</xref>) and are divided into an anterior HOX-negative and a posterior HOX PG (1-3 )-positive domain. The latter also includes cells contributing to heart structures (termed cardiac NC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Le Douarin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kirby et al., 1983</xref>). Vagal NC cells, which are located between somites 1–7, are marked by the expression of HOX PG(3-5) members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kam and Lui, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chan et al., 2005</xref>) and generate the enteric nervous system (ENS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Le Douarin and Teillet, 1973</xref>). HOX PG(5-9) -positive NC cells at the trunk level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kam and Lui, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nguyen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ishikawa and Ito, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Huber et al., 2012</xref>) produce sympathoadrenal cells, which in turn give rise to sympathetic neurons, neuroendocrine cells, and melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Le Douarin and Teillet, 1974</xref>).</p><p>An attractive approach for studying human NC biology and modelling NC-associated developmental disorders (neurocristopathies) involves the in vitro differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) toward NC cells. Conventional protocols to obtain NC from hPSCs are based on the production of a neurectodermal intermediate, via TGFβ signalling inhibition, which is subsequently steered toward a NC fate, usually through stimulation of WNT activity combined with the appropriate levels of BMP signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Menendez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hackland et al., 2017</xref>). These strategies yield NC cells of an anterior cranial character lacking HOX gene expression and the generation of more posterior HOX+ NC subtypes typically relies on the addition of retinoic acid (RA) and/or further WNT signalling stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Oh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fattahi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Denham et al., 2015</xref>). However, these signals fail to efficiently induce a high number of NC cells of a HOX PG(5-9) +trunk identity from an anterior cranial progenitor. Therefore, the generation of trunk NC derivatives such as sympathoadrenal cells often requires the flow cytometry-based purification of small cell populations positive for lineage-specific fluorescent reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Oh et al., 2016</xref>) or cell surface markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Bonsrah et al., 2018</xref>), a time-consuming and laborious approach.</p><p>A number of studies in chicken and mouse embryos employing both fate mapping and lineage tracing have shown the existence of a posterior NC progenitor entity, which is distinct from its more anterior counterparts and potentially co-localises with a pool of caudally-located axial progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Catala et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albors et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Javali et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schoenwolf et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schoenwolf and Nichols, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wymeersch et al., 2016</xref>). These progenitors include a bipotent stem cell-like population that fuels embryonic axis elongation through the coordinated production of spinal cord neurectoderm and paraxial mesoderm (PXM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tzouanacou et al., 2009</xref>) (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Steventon and Martinez Arias, 2017</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Henrique et al., 2015</xref>). In both mouse and chick embryos these neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) are located in the node/streak border and the caudal lateral epiblast during early somitogenesis, and later in the chordoneural hinge within the tailbud (TB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wymeersch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cambray and Wilson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cambray and Wilson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown and Storey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McGrew et al., 2008</xref>). No unique NMP markers have been determined to date and thus, molecularly, NMPs are defined by the co-expression of the pro-mesodermal transcription factor Brachyury (T) and neural regulator SOX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tsakiridis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Olivera-Martinez et al., 2012</xref>; ).

T and SOX2 have a critical role, in conjunction with CDX and HOX proteins, in regulating the balance between NMP maintenance and differentiation by integrating inputs predominantly from the WNT and FGF signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wymeersch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gouti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Young et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Koch et al., 2017</xref>).

Specifically, trunk NC production has been shown to be controlled by transcription factors which also regulate cell fate decisions in axial progenitors such as CDX proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sanchez-Ferras et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sanchez-Ferras et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sanchez-Ferras et al., 2016</xref>) and NKX1-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sasai et al., 2014</xref>). The close relationship between bipotent axial and posterior NC progenitors is further supported by fate mapping experiments involving the grafting of a portion of E8.5 mouse caudal lateral epiblast T+SOX2+ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wymeersch et al., 2016</xref>) and avian embryonic TB regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Catala et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McGrew et al., 2008</xref>) which have revealed the presence of localised cell populations exhibiting simultaneously mesodermal, neural and NC differentiation potential. Furthermore, retrospective clonal analysis in mouse embryos has shown that some posterior NC cells originate from progenitors which also generate PXM and spinal cord neurectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tzouanacou et al., 2009</xref>).

We show that hPSC-derived, ‘pre-neural’ axial progenitors contain a subpopulation that displays a mixed early NC/NMP transcriptional signature and thus is likely to represent the earliest trunk NC precursors. We demonstrate that T+ neuromesodermal potent axial progenitor cultures are competent to efficiently generate trunk NC cells, marked by thoracic HOX gene expression. This transition to trunk NC appears to take place via the maintenance of a CDX2/posterior HOX-positive state and the progressive amplification of an NC gene regulatory network. We also show that ‘caudalisation’ via RA treatment of anterior NC precursors leads to the acquisition of a mixed cardiac/vagal NC identity rather than a trunk NC character and define novel markers of distinct posterior NC subtypes. Finally, we utilise our findings to establish a protocol for the in vitro generation of PHOX2B+ sympathoadrenal cells and sympathetic neurons at high efficiency from cultures of posterior axial progenitor-derived trunk NC cells without the need for FACS-sorting to select for minor precursor subpopulations. Taken together these findings provide insight into the mechanisms underpinning the ‘birth’ of human NC cells at different axial levels and pave the way for the in vitro modelling of trunk neurocristopathies such as neuroblastoma.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptome analysis of human axial progenitors</title><p>We and others have previously shown that combined stimulation of the WNT and FGF signalling pathways in PSCs leads to the production of a high (&gt;80%) percentage of T+SOX2+ cells.

To this end, we grafted trunk NC cells derived from a human induced PSC (iPSC) line carrying a constitutive ZsGreen fluorescent reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lopez-Yrigoyen et al., 2018</xref>) in or on top of the dorsal neural tube of Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) stage 10–11 chick embryos. We found that, following incubation for 2–3 days, grafted donor cells migrated out of the graft site (6/6 grafted embryos) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Furthermore, the donor cells that had migrated the furthest consistently entered the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and exhibited expression of DRG markers such as TUBB3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shao et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), ISL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ericson et al., 1992</xref>) and SOX10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ota et al., 2004</xref>) (3/6 grafted embryos) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). These results suggest that human trunk NC generated from axial progenitors exhibits similar migratory behaviour/in vivo differentiation potential to its embryonic counterparts.</p><p>Since elevated BMP signalling appears to coincide with the acquisition of an early NC/border character by human axial progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and E</xref>) we also examined whether inhibition of this pathway affects their ability to generate trunk NC. We found that LDN treatment of axial progenitors during their induction from hPSCs (i.e. between days 0–3 of differentiation) has no effect on subsequent trunk NC production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>) indicating that early BMP activity alone is not the critical determinant of NC potency in this population. We also confirmed the NM potency of the starting axial progenitor cultures as treatment with high levels of FGF2-CHIR and RA led to the production of TBX6+/MSGN1 + PXM and SOX1+ spinal cord, posterior neurectoderm (PNE) cells respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E,F</xref>). Taken together these data suggest that hPSC-derived NM-potent axial progenitor cultures are competent to produce trunk NC at high efficiency.</p><p>To further confirm the lineage relationship between trunk NC cells and T+ axial progenitors we utilised a T fluorescent reporter hPSC line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mendjan et al., 2014</xref>) and isolated, via flow cytometry, axial progenitors/NMPs expressing T-VENUS following 3 day treatment of hPSCs with FGF2 and CHIR for 3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G</xref>) in order to test their NC potential. T-VENUS+ axial progenitors exhibited no or very low (5% of total cells) expression of the definitive pluripotency markers OTX2 and NANOG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acampora et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Osorno et al., 2012</xref>) respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) and hence are unlikely to be pluripotent. The small NANOG + T-VENUS+<sup>low</sup> fraction we detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A,C</xref>) probably reflects the reported presence of <italic>Nanog</italic> transcripts in the gastrulation-stage posterior epiblast of mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Teo et al., 2011</xref>). However, to avoid contamination from potentially pluripotent NANOG + T-VENUS+<sup>low</sup> cells, we sorted and analysed exclusively T-VENUS+<sup>high</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These were then plated in NC-inducing conditions for 5 days as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and the acquisition of a trunk NC identity was examined. We found that almost 60% of the cells were SOX10+ and about a third of them also co-expressed HOXC9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This finding demonstrates that T + hPSC derived axial progenitors have the ability to generate efficiently SOX10+ neural crest and suggests that at least half of the trunk NC cells derived from bulk axial progenitor cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>) originate from T-expressing cells.</p><p>Similar to established in vitro neural induction strategies, most current NC differentiation protocols aiming to generate posterior (e.g. trunk) cell populations from hPSCs rely on the caudalisation of an anterior ectodermal precursor via treatment with RA and/or WNT agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Oh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fattahi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Denham et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we compared our axial progenitor–based approach for generating trunk NC to a conventional strategy involving the generation of anterior cranial NC (ANC) precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hackland et al., 2017</xref>) followed by RA addition in the presence of WNT and BMP signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The axial identity of the resulting cells was assessed by qPCR assay of <italic>HOX</italic> transcripts corresponding to different levels along the A-P axis. In line with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fattahi et al., 2016</xref>) RA-treated cells expressed high levels of <italic>HOX</italic> PG(1-5) members compared to untreated NC suggesting a posterior cranial and vagal/cardiac NC character (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). However, efficient induction of trunk <italic>HOXC8</italic> and <italic>9</italic> transcripts was only achieved when posterior axial progenitors were employed as the starting population for NC generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Furthermore, axial progenitor-derived NC cells were marked by increased expression of the trunk NC marker <italic>HES6</italic>, but did not express the cranial markers <italic>OTX2</italic>, <italic>DMBX1</italic> and <italic>LHX5</italic> although they were positive for the ‘late’ cranial NC transcripts (<italic>TFA2B</italic>, <italic>ETS1</italic>, <italic>SOX8</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Simoes-Costa and Bronner, 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). We thus conclude that posterior axial progenitors are the ideal starting population for efficiently generating trunk NC in vitro whereas RA treatment of anterior NC precursors predominantly produces posterior cranial and cardiac/vagal NC cells. These data also serve as evidence supporting the notion that trunk NC precursors are likely to arise within cells with axial progenitor/NMP features rather than a caudalised anterior progenitor. This is further supported by our T-VENUS sorting experiments showing that T-VENUS+<sup>high</sup>OTX2 negative axial progenitors are a source of trunk NC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B,D</xref>) and therefore the generation of these cells is unlikely to occur via ‘caudalisation’ of an anterior OTX2+ NC precursor.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35786.016</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Transcriptome analysis of in vitro derived neural crest cells corresponding to distinct axial levels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagrams showing the culture conditions employed for generating NC cells of distinct axial identities using hPSCs.

The simultaneous presence of anterior HOX PG(1-5) transcripts together with their more posterior group 6–9 counterparts in our trunk NC cultures would be expected in trunk NC due to their co-expression in the posterior neural tube/neural crest in E9.5 mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gouti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arenkiel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Glaser et al., 2006</xref>).

Comparison of the day six trunk and d3 ANC precursor transcriptomes also revealed that expression of LHX5 and DMBX1 marks an anterior NC state whereas HES6 is associated exclusively with a trunk fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) indicating that diversification of axial identity in NC cells starts at an early time point via the action of distinct molecular players.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Distinct routes to posterior neural crest fates</title><p>To identify candidate genes mediating the gradual lineage restriction of trunk NC precursors present in axial progenitor cultures we compared the transcriptomes of d6 trunk NC precursors and day 3 WNT-FGF-treated hPSCs (='NMPs’).

FACS analysis revealed that the majority of cells were PHOX2B expressing (average percentage from four independent experiments = 73.5%, s.d. = 6.3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and a large proportion of them were also positive for the early SA progenitor marker ASCL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hirsch et al., 1998</xref>) indicating that they had acquired a symphathoadrenal identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Further maturation of the resulting SA progenitors in the presence of neurotrophic factors (BDNF, GDNF and NGF) resulted in the induction of a high yield of sympathetic neurons/progenitors co-expressing PHOX2B together with the sympathetic neuron regulator GATA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tsarovina et al., 2010</xref>) (average of 40% of total cells), ASCL1 (63%) and the SA differentiation regulator <italic>ISL1</italic> (64%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). At later stages of differentiation almost all PHOX2B-GFP + cells co-expressed ASCL1 further confirming a gradual transition from an early ASLC1+PHOX2B- progenitor to a more ‘mature’ double positive state (data not shown). A high proportion of the resulting cells also expressed the catecholamine production-associated enzyme/sympathetic neuron markers tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) together with dopamine- β-hydroxylase (DBH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ernsberger et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

This bottleneck prevents the dissection of the mechanisms directing human NC emergence at different axial levels as well as the efficient isolation of cell types for modelling trunk NC-specific neurocristopathies such as neuroblastoma. Previous work in amniote embryos suggested that posterior (trunk/lumbosacral) NC cells arise independently from their anterior counterparts, within a pool of axial progenitors localised near the primitive streak and the tailbud during axis elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Catala et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schoenwolf et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schoenwolf and Nichols, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wymeersch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tzouanacou et al., 2009</xref>). Here we utilised these findings and exploited our ability to induce T+ NM potent axial progenitors from hPSCs in order to use them as the optimal starting point for the efficient in vitro derivation of trunk NC (~50% HOXC9+ SOX10+), SA progenitors (~70% PHOX2B-GFP+) and functional sympathetic neurons without the use of FACS sorting. This strategy represents a considerable improvement over current approaches, which typically yield 5–10% PHOX2B-GFP + cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Oh et al., 2016</xref>) and is in line with a recent study reporting the successful production of chromaffin-like cells through the use of an NC-induction protocol which transiently produces T+ SOX2+ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Denham et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Bonsrah et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We show that, similar to neural cells a HOX-positive posterior identity is acquired by human NC cells via two distinct routes: posterior cranial/vagal/cardiac HOX PG(1-5)+ NC cells emerge through the RA/WNT-induced posteriorisation of a default anterior precursor, reflecting Nieuwkoop’s ‘activation-transformation’ model, whereas HOX PG(5-9)+ trunk NC cells arise from a separate WNT/FGF-induced posterior axial progenitor exhibiting caudal lateral epiblast/NMP features mixed with a neural plate border/neural crest identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

This is in line with bulk and single cell transcriptome data showing that mouse embryonic axial progenitors/NMPs express border and early NC markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gouti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Koch et al., 2017</xref>).

We also found that CDX2 expression is maintained at high levels during the generation of trunk NC indicating that this transcription factor might be critical in inducing an NC character in axial progenitors. CDX2 has been shown, together with β-catenin, to bind and activate neural plate border/early NC specifiers such as MSX1 and ZIC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sanchez-Ferras et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Funa et al., 2015</xref>) and, intriguingly, ChiP-Seq data from in vitro-derived mouse NMPs have revealed that many NC/border genes are direct targets of CDX2 often jointly with T (e.g. PAX3, SOX9, ZIC3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amin et al., 2016</xref>). Collectively these findings raise the possibility that β-catenin and CDX2, in conjunction with FGF/BMP signalling, may be critical for the establishment of a NC/border identity in T+ axial progenitors and further work is required to test this hypothesis.</p><p>We provide evidence that BMP/WNT treatment of human axial progenitors promotes the induction of a definitive trunk NC state. This transition appears to coincide with the progressive extinction of key axial progenitor genes and their replacement by a battery of NC-specific transcription factors such as TFAP2B, SOX10, NR2F2 and NR2F1 while the levels of some ‘common’ axial progenitor-NC markers (e.g. SOX9, PAX3, TFAP2A and SNAI2) remain high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). TFAP2A has been previously reported to act as a master NC transcription factor whose binding on key enhancers, together with NR2F1/2, appears to initiate transcription of NC-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2012</xref>). This finding raises the possibility that these transcription factors are the molecular drivers of the transition from an early posterior axial progenitor state to a lineage-restricted trunk NC fate in response to BMP/WNT. How is a trunk axial character specified? Our transcriptome analysis data suggest that, at least in vitro, a generic trunk identity is first installed during the emergence of multipotent CDX2+trunk HOX+axial progenitors under the influence of WNT-FGF activity and then ‘converted’ into posterior NC through the progressive accumulation of neural plate border/definitive NC markers within BMP-responsive cells. The posterior character of these incipient trunk NC precursors and their progeny is likely to be maintained via continuous CDX2 expression and further potentiation of trunk HOX activities as indicated by the expression profiles of these genes in both d6 precursor and d9 trunk NC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>) and their reported roles in trunk NC specification. However, other trunk NC-specific regulators may also be involved in this process and loss-/gain of-function approaches are required to dissect their exact involvement in programming trunk identity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">cell line (Homo <break/>Sapiens)</td><td valign="top">T-VENUS</td><td valign="top">68</td><td valign="top">Parental hES <break/>cell line = H9</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">cell line (Homo <break/>Sapiens)</td><td valign="top">SOX10-GFP</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">Parental hES cell line = H9</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">cell line (Homo <break/>Sapiens)</td><td valign="top">PHOX2B-GFP</td><td valign="top">18</td><td valign="top">Parental hES cell line = H9</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">cell line (Homo <break/>Sapiens)</td><td valign="top">MSGN1-VENUS</td><td valign="top">Unpublished</td><td valign="top">Not previously <break/>described, parental line = <break/> NCRM1 iPSCs (source = NIH)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">cell line (Homo <break/>Sapiens)</td><td valign="top">Sox2-GFP</td><td valign="top">44</td><td valign="top">Parental hES cell line = Shef4</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">cell line (Homo <break/>Sapiens)</td><td valign="top">MIFF1</td><td valign="top">102</td><td valign="top">iPSC line from <break/>healthy donor</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">cell line (Homo <break/>Sapiens)</td><td valign="top">SFCi55-ZsGr</td><td valign="top">64</td><td valign="top">iPSC line from healthy <break/>donor containing a <break/>constitutive fluorescent <break/>ZsGreen reporte</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">cell line (Homo <break/>Sapiens)</td><td valign="top">MasterShef7</td><td valign="top">44</td><td valign="top">Wild type hES <break/>cell line</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and differentiation</title><p>We employed the following hPSC lines: a Shef4-derived Sox2-GFP reporter hESC line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gouti et al., 2014</xref>), the H9-derived T-VENUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mendjan et al., 2014</xref>), SOX10-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>) and PHOX2B-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Oh et al., 2016</xref>) reporter hESC lines, the MSGN1-VENUS reporter hiPSC line, the wild type Mastershef7 hESC line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gouti et al., 2014</xref>) and an iPSC line (MIFF-1) derived from a healthy individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Desmarais et al., 2016</xref>).

After aggregating overnight at 37°C, cell clumps (diameter =~ 50–100 µm) were implanted into or on top of the neural tube of HH stage 10–12 chick embryos. The roof plate was lesioned to accommodate transplanted tissue at the level of newly forming somites. Embryos were harvested 2–3 days post transplantation (HH stages 18–24).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Cells were fixed for 10 min at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), then washed in PBST (PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100) and treated with 0.5 M glycine/PBST to quench the PFA. Blocking was then carried for 1–3 hr in PBST supplemented with 3% donkey serum/1% BSA at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in PBST containing in PBST supplemented with 3% donkey serum/1% BSA. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C and with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 2 hr in the dark. Cell nuclei were counterstained using Hoechst 33342 (1:1000, Thermo Fisher) and fluorescent images were taken using the InCell Analyser 2500 system (GE Healthcare). Chick embryos were fixed in 4% PFA for 2–3 hr at 4°C and left in 30% sucrose solution overnight at 4°C. Chick embryos were mounted in OCT (VWR 361603E) and transverse sections (15–20 µm) were taken using a cryostat. Immunostaining of sections was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Placzek et al., 1993</xref>).

The extracellular solution contained (mM): 135 NaCl, 5.8 KCl, 1.3 CaCl2, 0.9 MgCl2, 0.7 NaH2PO4, 5.6 D-glucose, 10 Hepes-NaOH, 2 sodium pyruvate. Amino acids and vitamins for Eagle’s minimal essential medium (MEM) were added from concentrates (Invitrogen, UK). The pH was adjusted to 7.5 and the osmolality was about 308 mosmol kg-1. hPSC-derived sympathetic neurons were viewed using an upright microscope equipped with Nomarski DIC optics (Nikon, Japan) and were continuously perfused with extracellular solution. Patch electrodes were pulled from soda glass capillaries (Hilgenberg GmbH, Germany) and electrodes had resistances in extracellular solution of around 4 MΩ. The shank of the electrode was coated with surf wax to minimise the fast electrode capacitative transients. The pipette solution contained (mM): 131 KCl, 3 MgCl2, 1 EGTA-KOH, 5 Na2ATP, 5 Hepes-KOH, 10 sodium phosphocreatine (pH 7.3, 290 mosmol kg-1). Voltage and current clamp protocol application and data acquisition were performed using pClamp software and a Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices, USA). Recordings were filtered at 2.5 or 10 kHz (8-pole Bessel), sampled at 5 or 100 kHz and stored on computer for off-line analysis using Clampfit, GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc, USA) and Origin (OriginLab, USA) software. Recordings and reported currents were corrected off-line for linear leakage and residual capacitative transients. Membrane potentials under voltage clamp were corrected for the voltage drop across the residual series resistance (Rs) at steady-state current level and for a liquid junction potential, measured between pipette and bath solutions, of –4 mV. Residual Rs after compensation (up to 80%) was 1.2 ± 0.1 MΩ (n = 14) and cell membrane capacitance was 11.4 ± 2.1 pF (n = 14). Statistical comparisons of means were made using either the unpaired student’s two-tailed t-test for two data sets, or for comparisons of multiple data sets, using analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post-test). For all the above statistical tests p&lt;0.05 was used as the criterion for statistical significance. Mean values are quoted ±S.D. in text and figures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Catecholamine ELISA</title><p>Commercial ELISA kits were used to assess secretion of Dopamine (Biovision Cat #E4219-100) and Norepinephrine (Biovision cat #4360–100) following the manufacturer’s instructions and analysed using a Varioskan Flash plate reader at 450 nm (Thermo Scientific). Sympathetic neurons were depolarised following treatment with 50 mM KCl dissolved in differentiation media. Media supernatant was collected after 10 min and centrifuged at 10000xg for 10 min at 4°C to remove insoluble debris and dead cells and stored at −20°C until analysis. Supernatant from undifferentiated hPSCs was used as a negative control.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Lesley Forrester, Roger Pedersen, Gabsang Lee and Lorenz Studer for providing the SFCi55-ZsGr, T-VENUS, PHOX2B-GFP and SOX10-GFP reporter hPSC lines respectively.

Overall, the study is well designed and clearly written. However, protocols to trigger NMPs from mouse and human PSCs are already very well established across the field. Furthermore, two groups (as cited by the authors in the current manuscript: Friedel et al., 2015; Guimond et al., 2014) have already provided some evidence of NMP-derived neural crest derivatives, in particular SAP derived chromaffin-like cells. Nevertheless, the current study goes beyond those published studies by focusing more on developmental approaches and by looking in more detail at the transitions from NMP induction to NC specification. In particular, the study presents detailed analyses of HOX gene induction and global gene expression, and it achieves a protocol to generate trunk NC and SAP induction at high efficiencies.</p><p>Beyond the potential concerns about novelty mentioned above, there are additional issues that should be addressed including better quantification of the various subpopulations observed and the need to more clearly demonstrate the lineage relationship of NMP and subsequent NC identity. Furthermore, the characterization of the resulting SAP-like neural crest derivatives is quite limited and the trunk identity of the resulting neurons highly dependent on a few reagents such as HOXC9 antibodies which are not validated very well in the current study.</p><p>1) IHC vs Flow based quantification. The study relies very heavily on the use of immunocytochemical (ICC) analysis including double and triple stains. Such analysis can be tricky as it does not allow for an easy representation of the different levels of expression among positive cells and, for many of the Figures presented here, it lacks quantification. This issue could be addressed by using intracellular flow, where both quantification and representation of levels across cells can be shown more easily. For example, it would be important to have proper quantification and presentation of expression levels for the various panels in Figure 1 as well as Figure 2B among others.</p><p>2) Lack of a true lineage analysis. The authors argue lineage-relationships based the co-expression of certain markers rather than any true genetic lineage mapping or at least cell sorting based analyses. The study could be much more convincing by including genetic fate mapping data, ideally using a hPSC reporter line such as a reporter line for T. At the minimum, the authors should present a more detailed quantification of marker expression as detailed under #1 and discuss potential pitfalls of their current approach (such as the possibility of persisting OCT4+ cells at NMP stage – see #4 below – or early NC commitment in parallel or prior to NMP stage).</p><p>3) BMP/LDN experiments. The authors present data to show that endogenous BMP signaling seems to be important for the expression of early NC markers in day 3 NMP cultures. Indeed, LDN treatment greatly reduces several of those markers. However, this gets back to the question of lineage relationships and whether NMPs indeed are fully plastic as suggested or whether a subset is already committee to NC lineage and therefore no longer bona fide NMPs. Another interesting point regarding those data is that LDN also reduces CDX2 levels. This argues that BMP may not only trigger NC bias but also enable CDX2 expression and posterior patterning. Do the authors have data on LDN treated NMPs that were subsequently induced towards NC lineage by using the BMP/WNT NC protocol from day 3 onwards? Do they observe comparable potential to trigger NC after early LDN treatment?</p><p>4) Persisting OCT4 expression the gene expression data in Figure 4G shows highly differential expression of OCT4 in NMP vs NMP-NC (~ 1,000 fold differential expression) – this suggests that there is remaining OCT4 expression either in all NMPs, or there is a subset of cells at NMP stage that retain OCT4 expression. This should be addressed by ICC or flow cytometry for OCT4. If there is a subset of OCT4+ cells at day 3, it raises concerns along the lines stated under #1 and #2 regarding lineage origin of those NC cells.</p><p>5) Subtype identity of NMPs There are conceptual questions about how to define NMPs if the cells already express NC (and potentially other subtype) markers at the day 3 stage prior to NC induction. It raises the issue of how many NMP subpopulations co-exist and where did they come from (a defined, common intermediate?). For example, the authors state: &quot;Collectively, these findings indicate that a NC/border state probably arises within multipotent posterior axial progenitors which have not committed to a neural or mesodermal fate&quot; However, if cells already express PAX3 and SOX9, it seems tricky to argue that those cells within NMP cultures are not committed at all.</p><p>6) HOXC9. The HOXC9 antibody is a critical reagent for this study. The induction of HOXC9 levels seem to vary quite a bit based on the gene expression data presented throughout the paper while the antibody seems to label a very large proportion of all the cells. It would be helpful to include some additional control assays to demonstrate the specificity of the antibody, and to include stage-matched ANCs or RA treated ANCs throughout to further validate specificity.</p><p>7) HOX co-expression data. There are no data looking at co-expression of various HOX genes. This is particularly relevant as the authors conclude that NMP-derived NC is HOX6-9 while ANC is HOX1-5 (e.g. Summary scheme in Figure 6). However, the gene expression data indicate that most anterior HOX genes (1-5) are expressed equally or even higher in NMP vs ANC or ANC+RA derived lineages (e.g. Figure 1C and Figure 3E, Figure 4D).</p><p>8) Characterization of trunk NC derivatives / SAPs A key argument regarding the importance of the current study, is the ability to efficiently generate trunk NC derivatives such as sympathetic neurons without the need for sorting. However, the characterization of those sympathetic neurons is very limited and lacks basic co-expression data (e.g. TH/DBH) or functional data such as evidence of catecholamine release or other physiological hallmarks of sympathetic neurons. Such assays are commonly presented by other studies reporting on the derivation of sympathetic neurons from hPSCs (e.g. Friauf, 2008).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The study by Frith and colleagues employs methods to convert human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) into posterior/caudal neural crest (NC) cells via an axial progenitor intermediate. In addition, the authors define culturing conditions that allow efficient production of peripheral sympathetic neurons without the need for additional purification schemes, such as FACS. Overall, the authors present their work very well, with excellent command of the literature, and have advanced our knowledge for generating trunk NC cells and their derivatives that I expect will be used by researchers in the field. However, in its current form, the conclusions are over-stated and the impact of the study is lessened by the fact that similar protocols for generating trunk NC and peripheral neurons (and other NC-cell types) have recently been published (as noted by the authors). In addition, the experimental approaches are not overly innovative (cell culture, immunohistochemistry and RNA-Seq) and largely focus on sufficiency outcomes with no experiments addressing necessity. As one of the main conclusions from the study concerns the origin of trunk NC cells from axial progenitors, there should be some spatial data to confirm the molecular signatures. For example, transplantation of anterior versus posterior NC cells into avian embryos to show the observed transcriptional changes impact the fate of cells at different axial positions. This technique is commonly used in the field to test axial identity and NC competence (e.g., Abu-Bonsrah et al., 2017, Denhamn et al., 2017) and would complement the heavy reliance on using only molecular signatures in cell culture. Indeed, many of the genes used by the authors to define axial NC identity are expressed in other cell types, particularly other neural, neuroectodermal and mesoderm derivatives that develop adjacent to NC cell in vivo. Thus, without the addition of fate mapping data in vivo, other interpretations/conclusions could be drawn on what cell types are actually generated by this new method..</p><p>1) The authors should employ transplantation techniques with different progenitors derived in vitro (axial, NMPs, PXM, and anterior versus posterior NC cell types) to show they indeed are fated/committed to specific axial lineages in vivo. For example, RA-treated anterior NC cells should largely generate cardiac/vagal cell types in vivo compared to posterior NC cells, whereas transplanted axial cells would be expected to generate multiple posterior lineages. Such data would significant enhance the impact of the study and strengthen the conclusion that human axial progenitors generate trunk NC.</p><p>2) The authors identify a potential new gene involved in trunk NC development, ASLX3. The authors should perform in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry on vertebrate animals (mouse, chick or fish) to localize ASLX3 (or its conserved equivalent) to trunk NC cells in vivo. This would strengthen their argument that their approach used to classify axial identity in vitro (which is reliant on HOX gene expression) can also produce new knowledge on the genetic regulation of trunk NC in vivo.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript shows that trunk-NC cells are best/most efficiently derived via an axial progenitor population, similar to the neuro-mesodermal progenitor giving rise to lower motor neurons. The authors show solid work that clearly indicate that this progenitor can be guided into producing NC cells with trunk identity. More sophisticated experiments, such as following cells over time using reporter lines to show that the NMP truly is giving rise to the trunk-NC population as well as in vivo work showing the same thing would definitively prove this interesting hypothesis. Therefore, some of the conclusions should be worded a bit more carefully. Nevertheless, this is the first report (to my knowledge) of NC cells derived from NMPs with trunk NC character and it seems a highly efficient one as well. Thus, I think this is an important report that should be published.</p><p>- To strengthen the conclusion in subsection “A BMP-dependent neural crest signature in human axial progenitor cultures” (Collectively, these findings indicate that a NC/border state probably arises within multipotent posterior axial progenitors, which have not committed to a neural or mesodermal fate) it would be useful to see what percentage of all cells are posterior axial progenitors committed to become trunk-NC. For example, by doing triple stained intracellular FACS analysis of T, CDX, SOX9.</p><p>- In Figure 3D, the authors show that the axial progenitor can give rise to paraxial mesoderm. This could be strengthened by showing that these PXM cells can further be differentiated into definitive mesodermal cell types.</p><p>- Do the SOX9+ cells early at day 3 also express SOX10? (associated with Figure 2B). Why does SOX9 come on before SOX10 and does SOX10 stay on?</p><p>- Can you maintain this trunk-NC cells as progenitors and expand them in culture, if that is possible it would make this technique even more useful.</p><p>-The RNA-seq/microarray data suggests that DMBX1 and LHX5 versus HES6 could serve as markers to distinguish anterior from trunk NC cells. This notion should be strengthened by staining to show the same at the protein level.</p><p>- Figure 5C: 80% of Phox2B-GFP- cells are ASCL1+? What are these cells? Maybe they are younger cells that have not yet turned on Phox2B, which would mean that at day 18 there is a mixture of cells in terms of developmental stage. Could that be showed more?</p><p>- Scale bars are missing in all pictures.</p><p>- Discussion section: This should be stated more carefully, since the transcriptome analysis is done in in vitro generated cells. Without confirming in vivo data, one cannot definitively prove that axial progenitors are converted into posterior NC in embryogenesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35786.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors' note: the authors’ plan for revisions was approved and the authors made a formal revised submission.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As you will see from the reviewer comments below, there was enthusiasm for the technique, but there were two significant issues that preclude us from making a decision.</p><p>A) There was a concern about the quantification of the day 3 NMP cell fates.

Thus, to investigate the persistence of pluripotent cells, we examined the presence of cells expressing more definitive pluripotency markers such as NANOG (Osorno, Tsakiridis et al., 2012) and OTX2 (Acampora et al., 2013) in axial progenitor cultures derived from a T-VENUS reporter hPSC line (Mendjan et al., 2014). Following quantification, we found a small (5% of total cells) NANOG+T-VENUS+<sup>low</sup> fraction and no OTX2+T-VENUS+ co-expressing cells. This indicates minimal contamination of our NC-potent T+ axial progenitors with pluripotent cells. We have included these data in new Figure 3—figure supplement 3. However, to eliminate completely the possibility that pluripotent cells may be the source of trunk NC cells following re-plating of axial progenitor cells in NC-inducing conditions we also flow- sorted and tested the NC potential of T-VENUS+<sup>high</sup> cells which we found to be NANOG negative (see new Figure 3—figure supplement 3C). Our new results show that indeed these cells exhibit the potential to generate SOX10+ neural crest cells, a proportion of which (approximately one third) is also positive for HOXC9 (See new Figure 3F). This implies that T+<sup>high</sup> axial progenitors are the source of at least half of the trunk HOXC9+SOX10+ NC cells we obtain following differentiation of bulk unsorted human axial progenitor cultures (about 50% of the total cells, see Figure 3C). We speculate that the rest is likely to arise from the T+<sup>low</sup> fraction, which was not included in the sorted population. These new data also suggest that the production of trunk NC from T+ progenitors does not occur via “posteriorisation” of an OTX2+ anterior NC progenitor entity (Simoes-Costa and Bronner, 2016) since the very few OTX2+ cells we detected in our axial progenitor cultures were all T-VENUS negative and therefore were not included in the sorted population that gave rise to SOX10+HOXC9+ cells upon plating in NC-inducing conditions (Figure 3F, Figure 3—figure supplement 3B, D in revised m/s). We have discussed these findings in the relevant Results section (“To further confirm the lineage relationship between trunk NC cells and T+ axial progenitors… originate from T-expressing cells” and “This is further supported by our T-VENUS… “caudalisation” of an anterior OTX2+ NC precursor”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) An in vivo functional readout of the derived cells is required to establish the true importance of the technique.

These data are shown in new Figure 3D and Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-C.</p><p>(ii) We show by ELISA that axial progenitor-derived sympathetic neurons produce catecholamines (dopamine and norepinephrine) at levels similar or higher to the ones described previously for in vitro derived sympathetic neurons (Oh et al., 2016).

Furthermore, our new data show that BMP-inhibited axial progenitors can still generate trunk NC at a similar efficiency to untreated controls (See new Figure 3—figure supplement 2D).

The lack of an exclusive NMP marker makes the precise definition of committed vs non-committed NMPs very challenging. Recent lineage tracing and single cell RNA-seq studies have revealed that mouse embryonic NMP subpopulations exhibit expression of more definitive lineage-specific markers such as the paraxial mesoderm gene Tbx6 (Javali et al., 2017; Gouti et al., 2017). We speculate that co-expression of NC/border markers with NMP markers such as T in day 3 FGF-CHIR treated hPSC cultures probably represents a similar phenomenon. Our new T-VENUS-sorting experiments demonstrating that at least some of the T+ axial progenitors (which are presumably N-M potent since about 70-80% T+ cells are also Sox2+CDX2+, and also co-express border/NC markers, see new Figure 2C, Figure 2—figure supplement 1B) can generate trunk NC cells supports the notion that “a NC/border state probably arises within multipotent posterior axial progenitors which have not committed to a neural or mesodermal fate”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) HOXC9.

We also validated the antibody’s specificity by carrying out immunostaining on ETS1+ anterior NC cultures and found no HOXC9 positivity, also in line with our transcriptome analysis data. We have included these data in new Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) HOX co-expression data. There are no data looking at co-expression of various HOX genes. This is particularly relevant as the authors conclude that NMP-derived NC is HOX6-9 while ANC is HOX1-5 (e.g. Summary scheme in Figure 6). However, the gene expression data indicate that most anterior HOX genes (1-5) are expressed equally or even higher in NMP vs ANC or ANC+RA derived lineages (e.g. Figure 1C and Figure 3E, Figure 4D).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is raising a valid point. We should note that co-expression of HOX1-5 and HOX6-9 transcripts does occur in the posterior part of the mouse embryo around E9.5, both in the NMP-containing tailbud region (Gouti et al., 2017l) as well as in differentiated posterior neural/neural crest cells (e.g. for <italic>Hoxb1</italic> expression in E9.5 mouse embryos see Glaser et al. Development 2006 and Arenkiel et al., 2003; for <italic>Hoxc9</italic> expression see Bel et al., 1998) and thus the presence of HOX1-5 transcripts in HOX9+ trunk NC cells is not unexpected. Alternatively, the co-expression of transcripts belonging to both HOX1-5 and HOX6-9 groups may be a result of the co-emergence of a separate population of cardiac/vagal NC cells during trunk NC differentiation. This may be due to the action of endogenous RA signalling since our microarray data revealed the upregulation of RA signalling components in axial progenitor-derived trunk NC even though no exogenous retinoic acid was added to the differentiation medium (see Supplementary file 2 in submitted manuscript). Unfortunately, we have not found reliable antibodies against HOX group 1-5 members that we can use together with HOXC9 in order to distinguish between these two possibilities. We have included a discussion of this point in the Results section in the revised manuscript (“The simultaneous presence… even though no exogenous RA was added to the differentiation medium”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Characterization of trunk NC derivatives / SAPs A key argument regarding the importance of the current study, is the ability to efficiently generate trunk NC derivatives such as sympathetic neurons without the need for sorting. However, the characterization of those sympathetic neurons is very limited and lacks basic co-expression data (e.g. TH/DBH) or functional data such as evidence of catecholamine release or other physiological hallmarks of sympathetic neurons. Such assays are commonly presented by other studies reporting on the derivation of sympathetic neurons from hPSCs (e.g. Friauf, 2008).</p></disp-quote><p>See our response to point B. We have now also included data showing co-expression of TH and DBH in axial progenitor-derived sympathetic neurons (see new Figure 5—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The study by Frith and colleagues employs methods to convert human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) into posterior/caudal neural crest (NC) cells via an axial progenitor intermediate. In addition, the authors define culturing conditions that allow efficient production of peripheral sympathetic neurons without the need for additional purification schemes, such as FACS. Overall, the authors present their work very well, with excellent command of the literature, and have advanced our knowledge for generating trunk NC cells and their derivatives that I expect will be used by researchers in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for their positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, in its current form, the conclusions are over-stated and the impact of the study is lessened by the fact that similar protocols for generating trunk NC and peripheral neurons (and other NC-cell types) have recently been published (as noted by the authors).</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to be careful about our conclusions and we are happy to consider rephrasing them on a case-to-case basis if required. We disagree that the impact of our study is lessened by the publication of similar protocols (we presume the reviewer refers to the manuscripts by Denham et al., 2015 and Abu-Bonsrah et al., 2017) and we would like to point to reviewer 3’s comment that “this is an important report that should be published”. Apart from establishing a highly efficient method for generating trunk NC cells we believe that our manuscript also provides an insight into the basis of anterior-posterior regionalisation in the human neural crest and therefore, as reviewer 1 correctly noted, goes beyond the Denham et al., and Abu-Bonsrah et al., publications, which focus almost exclusively on improving the technical aspects of human ES cell differentiation toward posterior neural crest and its derivatives.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the experimental approaches are not overly innovative (cell culture, immunohistochemistry and RNA-Seq) and largely focus on sufficiency outcomes with no experiments addressing necessity.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not understand this point. We believe that the additional data we have included (e.g. trunk NC cell grafting, catecholamine release assay, electrophysiology, NMP/NC/pluripotency marker quantification, T-VENUS sorting experiment etc.) provide better insight into the functionality and nature of the cell populations we are generating in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As one of the main conclusions from the study concerns the origin of trunk NC cells from axial progenitors, there should be some spatial data to confirm the molecular signatures. For example, transplantation of anterior versus posterior NC cells into avian embryos to show the observed transcriptional changes impact the fate of cells at different axial positions. This technique is commonly used in the field to test axial identity and NC competence (e.g., Abu-Bonsrah et al.et al., 2017, Denhamn et al.et al., 2017) and would complement the heavy reliance on using only molecular signatures in cell culture.</p></disp-quote><p>In our opinion, the use of chick embryo transplantation as a comparative assay for quantifying differences in the axial identity status of heterogeneous hPSC-derived donor cell populations is very challenging to set up and possibly hard to interpret. We predict that the location of the graft site will routinely promote the selection of “compatible” subpopulations which in some cases will be minor “contaminants” co-emerging with the desired cell type during hPSC differentiation (e.g. vagal NC cells arising in trunk NC cultures and vice versa) and thus a large number of grafts will be required in order to derive statistically significant data. Further complications may arise due to the differential effect that the axial identity of the donor cells may exert on their developmental potency/proliferation in a heterotopic grafting context (Zhang et al., 2010). In fact, we are not aware of any study where chick embryo grafting was employed to compare in a quantitative manner distinct PSC-derived cell types in terms of axial identity. However, as stated earlier we have performed grafting of axial progenitor-derived trunk NC cells into chick embryos to confirm in qualitative terms that these behave similarly to their in vivo counterparts, i.e. they exhibit NC-like migratory behaviour and colonise the DRG.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Indeed, many of the genes used by the authors to define axial NC identity are expressed in other cell types, particularly other neural, neuroectodermal and mesoderm derivatives that develop adjacent to NC cell in vivo. Thus, without the addition of fate mapping data in vivo, other interpretations/conclusions could be drawn on what cell types are actually generated by this new method.</p><p>1) The authors should employ transplantation techniques with different progenitors derived in vitro (axial, NMPs, PXM, and anterior versus posterior NC cell types) to show they indeed are fated/committed to specific axial lineages in vivo. For example, RA-treated anterior NC cells should largely generate cardiac/vagal cell types in vivo compared to posterior NC cells, whereas transplanted axial cells would be expected to generate multiple posterior lineages. Such data would significant enhance the impact of the study and strengthen the conclusion that human axial progenitors generate trunk NC.</p></disp-quote><p>See our response above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors identify a potential new gene involved in trunk NC development, ASLX3. The authors should perform in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry on vertebrate animals (mouse, chick or fish) to localize ASLX3 (or its conserved equivalent) to trunk NC cells in vivo. This would strengthen their argument that their approach used to classify axial identity in vitro (which is reliant on HOX gene expression) can also produce new knowledge on the genetic regulation of trunk NC in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that ASLX3 is a promising candidate marker of trunk NC. However, the characterisation of its expression domains in vivo will be time-consuming since we are not aware of any published antibodies or in situ hybridisation probes that could be used for ASXL3 detection and we would have to generate these reagents from scratch. Consequently, while of clear interest, we think that carrying out these in vivo experiments are beyond the scope of the current study which is focused on the generation of trunk neural crest cells by differentiation of hPSC in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript shows that trunk-NC cells are best/most efficiently derived via an axial progenitor population, similar to the neuro-mesodermal progenitor giving rise to lower motor neurons. The authors show solid work that clearly indicate that this progenitor can be guided into producing NC cells with trunk identity. More sophisticated experiments, such as following cells over time using reporter lines to show that the NMP truly is giving rise to the trunk-NC population as well as in vivo work showing the same thing would definitively prove this interesting hypothesis. Therefore, some of the conclusions should be worded a bit more carefully. Nevertheless, this is the first report (to my knowledge) of NC cells derived from NMPs with trunk NC character and it seems a highly efficient one as well. Thus, I think this is an important report that should be published.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for recognising the importance of our manuscript. We believe that the additional experiments we carried out in response to points A and B (see above) address the reviewer’s suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- To strengthen the conclusion in subsection “A BMP-dependent neural crest signature in human axial progenitor cultures” (Collectively, these findings indicate that a NC/border state probably arises within multipotent posterior axial progenitors, which have not committed to a neural or mesodermal fate) it would be useful to see what percentage of all cells are posterior axial progenitors committed to become trunk-NC. For example, by doing triple stained intracellular FACS analysis of T, CDX, SOX9.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included immunostaining quantification data, see our responses above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In Figure 3D, the authors show that the axial progenitor can give rise to paraxial mesoderm. This could be strengthened by showing that these PXM cells can further be differentiated into definitive mesodermal cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added data showing the expression of PXM and early somite markers in our axial progenitor-derived PXM cells (see new Figure 3—figure supplement 2E, F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Do the SOX9+ cells early at day 3 also express SOX10? (associated with Figure 2B). Why does SOX9 come on before SOX10 and does SOX10 stay on?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not detect any SOX10 in day 3 axial progenitors and its expression starts round days 6-7 of differentiation (d0=start of NMP differentiation) peaking round days 8-9 and then becomes downregulated till its extinction round days 10-11. The earlier upregulation of SOX9 relative to SOX10 is in agreement with in vivo expression data (Cheung and Briscoe, 2003).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Can you maintain this trunk-NC cells as progenitors and expand them in culture, if that is possible it would make this technique even more useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to maintain/expand trunk NC cells as spheres in the same way as we have previously reported for cranial NC (Hackland et al., 2017) but, unfortunately, our attempts have been unsuccessful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-The RNA-seq/microarray data suggests that DMBX1 and LHX5 versus HES6 could serve as markers to distinguish anterior from trunk NC cells. This notion should be strengthened by staining to show the same at the protein level.</p></disp-quote><p>The expression of DMBX1/LHX5 and HES6 in the anterior and trunk NC respectively has already been examined thoroughly in the chick embryo by Simoes-Costa and Bronner, 2016 and therefore we have used them in our study as “established” axial identity readouts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 5C: 80% of Phox2B-GFP- cells are ASCL1+? What are these cells? Maybe they are younger cells that have not yet turned on Phox2B, which would mean that at day 18 there is a mixture of cells in terms of developmental stage. Could that be showed more?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that Figure 5C shows that 80% of the cells were found to be ASCL1+ and approximately 60% were double-positive for both PHOX2B-GFP and ASCL1 and not that 80% of PHOX2B-GFP negative cells are ASCL1+. ASCL1 has been previously shown to be turned on earlier than PHOX2B, both in vivo and in vitro, during hPSC differentiation toward sympathetic neurons (Hirsch et al., 1998; Oh et al., 2016), so we agree with the reviewer that the remaining 20% of ASCL1+ PHXO2B-GFP- cells could be earlier progenitors indicating that day 18 cultures contain cells from different developmental stages. We have found that at later stages almost all PHOX2B-GFP+ cells are also ASCL1+ which further supports the idea that earlier cultures are developmentally heterogeneous. We have made a note of this in the Results section (“At later stages of differentiation almost all PHOX2B-GFP+ cells… more “mature” double positive state”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Scale bars are missing in all pictures.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Discussion section: This should be stated more carefully, since the transcriptome analysis is done in in vitro generated cells. Without confirming in vivo data, one cannot definitively prove that axial progenitors are converted into posterior NC in embryogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-phrased to “Our transcriptome analysis data suggest that, at least in vitro, a generic trunk identity is first installed…”.</p><p>Additional references:</p><p>Aires R, Jurberg AD, Leal F, Nóvoa, Cohn MJ, Mallo M.
