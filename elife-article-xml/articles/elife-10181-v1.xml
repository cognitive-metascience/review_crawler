How is the activity in these sensory neurons transformed into behavior? Using <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, we map a novel sensory neuron circuit motif that encodes odor concentration. Primary neurons, AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWA, directly detect the food odor benzaldehyde (BZ) and release insulin-like peptides and acetylcholine, respectively, which are required for odor-evoked responses in secondary neurons, ASEL and AWB. Consistently, both primary and secondary neurons are required for BZ attraction. Unexpectedly, this combinatorial code is altered in aged animals: odor-evoked activity in secondary, but not primary, olfactory neurons is reduced. Moreover, experimental manipulations increasing neurotransmission from primary neurons rescues aging-associated neuronal deficits. Finally, we correlate the odor responsiveness of aged animals with their lifespan. Together, these results show how odors are encoded by primary and secondary neurons and suggest reduced neurotransmission as a novel mechanism driving aging-associated sensory neural activity and behavioral declines.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10181.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10181.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10181.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A sense of smell can help animals to find food and detect danger. Odor molecules activate so-called olfactory neurons that relay signals to the brain in the form of nerve impulses. This information is then processed, and the appropriate response is triggered; for example, an animal might move towards the smell of food, or away from the scent of a predator. But how can the activity of olfactory neurons trigger the right behavioral response?</p><p>Leinwand et al. have now explored the activity of olfactory neurons in a roundworm called <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The experiments revealed that a food odor activated two olfactory neurons directly, and that each of these ‘primary’ neurons then in turn activated another ‘secondary’ olfactory neuron. This communication between primary and secondary olfactory neurons was essential for worms to respond to the food odor. Further experiments revealed that the primary olfactory neurons send chemical signals, called neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, to communicate with the secondary neurons. Importantly, mutations that blocked this chemical signaling prevented the worms from responding appropriately to the smell of food.</p><p>Aging animals, including people, often have impaired senses and can therefore find it difficult to identify and respond to odors. Leinwand et al. found that aged worms were no different. Further experiments suggested that aging worms' responses to odor decline because the communication between the primary and secondary olfactory neurons may be impaired with age. When Leinwand et al. strengthened this communication it reversed the effects of aging on the worms' sense of smell. Moreover, the experiments also showed that an animal's performance on the odor task was correlated with its longevity, such that the better performers also lived longer. A challenge for the future is to understand the precise changes that occur at early stages of aging to impair the sense of smell. Future studies could also test if similar combinations of olfactory neurons are needed to trigger certain behavioral responses to odors in young and old mammals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10181.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10181.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>sensory neuron</kwd><kwd>neurotransmission</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>neural circuit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH096881-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chalasani</surname><given-names>Sreekanth H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001447</institution-id><institution>Rita Allen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chalasani</surname><given-names>Sreekanth H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000888</institution-id><institution>W.M.

This sensory information is relayed to downstream neural circuitry, generating appropriate food-seeking and toxin-avoiding behaviors, which enhance animal fitness. In particular, olfactory sensory neurons have an additional challenge in detecting a large set of volatile cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buck, 2005</xref>). In mammals, odors are detected by G-protein coupled odorant receptors that are expressed on olfactory sensory neurons. Moreover, while the mammalian genome encodes approximately 1000 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buck and Axel, 1991</xref>), each olfactory sensory neuron is known to express only one type of receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vassar et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chess et al., 1994</xref>). Since mammals can detect far more than 1000 odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duchamp-Viret et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rubin and Katz, 1999</xref>), this suggests that olfactory information at this level is encoded by a combinatorial code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Malnic et al., 1999</xref>). Calcium imaging and electrophysiological studies have confirmed that individual odorants bind multiple odorant receptors and activate the corresponding olfactory sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Malnic et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abaffy et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, activity in an individual olfactory sensory neuron represents not only the molecular receptive field of its odor receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Araneda et al., 2000</xref>), but also gating by feedback circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gomez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wachowiak et al., 2009</xref>) and modulation by sniffing behavior in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wesson et al., 2009</xref>). Information from these sensory neurons is then further processed and relayed to other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miyamichi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>). Despite this understanding, little is known about how specific activity patterns in the olfactory sensory neurons are correlated with behavioral outputs. One solution to this problem is to analyze numerically simpler invertebrate olfactory circuits where information flow can be traced at the resolution of individual neurons and correlated with animal behavior.</p><p>The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, with its small nervous system consisting of just 302 neurons, is ideally suited for a circuit-level analysis of chemosensory processing and behavior. Chemosensory stimuli are detected by twelve sensory neuron pairs located in the amphid ganglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">White et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bargmann, 2006</xref>). All 24 of these neurons send their dendrites to the nose of the animal where they detect environmental changes and relay that information through their axons to the downstream circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">White et al., 1986</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> uses small numbers of sensory neurons to drive locomotion towards or away from particular sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bargmann, 2006</xref>). For example, single cell ablation experiments showed that the bilaterally asymmetric pair of AWC sensory neurons is necessary for attraction to benzaldehyde (BZ) odor, while the AWA sensory neuron pair is required for diacetyl odor attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bargmann and Horvitz, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bargmann, 2006</xref>). Functional imaging experiments revealed that AWC neurons are activated by the removal of odor stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chalasani et al., 2007</xref>), while AWA neurons respond to the addition of odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zaslaver et al., 2015</xref>). However, these sensory neuron activity patterns are not sufficient to explain how animals behave when they encounter diverse olfactory stimuli in the environment. We hypothesized that multiple amphid ganglia neurons could encode odor information and drive plastic olfactory behaviors; therefore, we performed the first comprehensive analysis of odor-evoked neural activity in all amphid neurons. We identified a novel circuit motif consisting of primary and secondary olfactory neurons that collectively encode odor and drive behavioral plasticity. We then analyzed the reliability of this combinatorial code and found that it degrades during aging. Our experiments suggest that a selective vulnerability of neurotransmitter release pathways in aged animals is the underlying mechanism that leads to a specific decay in secondary olfactory neuron activity and associated behavioral decline. Furthermore, we find that olfactory circuit function is correlated with an animal's longevity.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10181.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Multiple sensory neurons detect the odor benzaldehyde (BZ).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Image of a young adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> and schematic depicting the twelve pairs of sensory neurons in the anterior amphid ganglia whose dendrites project to the nose of the animal where they detect sensory stimuli.

We trapped young adult animals expressing GCaMP family of genetically encoded calcium indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tian et al., 2009</xref>), under cell selective promoters, in individual amphid sensory neurons in our custom-designed microfluidic device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chalasani et al., 2007</xref>) and recorded their responses to BZ. Consistent with previous studies, we observed a large calcium transient indicating increased AWC activity upon removal of a medium concentration BZ stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chalasani et al., 2007</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found additional BZ responsive neurons: the diacetyl sensing AWA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bargmann et al., 1993</xref>) were activated by the addition of BZ, while ASE and AWB neurons (that were previously shown to sense salts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bargmann and Horvitz, 1991</xref>] and volatile repellents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Troemel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bargmann, 2006</xref>], respectively) also responded to the removal of this stimulus in young adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

While the two AWC and ASE neurons can be genetically and functionally separated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wes and Bargmann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>), each one in the pair showed similar responses to the removal of the BZ stimulus; therefore, we chose to focus our subsequent analysis on the AWC<sup>ON</sup> and ASEL (left) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). We also noted that the ASEL responses to BZ were slower to reach the maximum response (average of 5.46 s after stimulus change) than the other odor responsive neurons (average 1–2 s after stimulus change), indicating that the kinetics of odor-evoked activity are different in different cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, different neural activity patterns distributed across AWC, ASE, AWA, AWB and ASH sensory neurons defined active neural circuits for different concentrations (medium as well as high or low) of BZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–I</xref>). We focused on responses to the attractive medium concentration of BZ for the remainder of this study. Our data suggests that four pairs of sensory neurons (AWC, AWA, ASE and AWB) signal the presence of this BZ stimulus.</p><p>Next, we tested whether all four of these sensory neuron pairs were also required to drive behavioral attraction to BZ. We used a chemotaxis assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and analyzed the behavior of animals with non-functional sensory neurons. We found that genetic ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beverly et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yoshida et al., 2012</xref>) or blocking synaptic transmission (with tetanus toxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schiavo et al., 1992</xref>]) in any of the four AWC, ASE, AWA or AWB neurons impaired animals' chemotaxis to a point source of medium BZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This data is consistent with our imaging experiments and confirms a role for multiple sensory neurons in driving attraction to the BZ odor. In particular, our results showing important roles for ASE, AWA and AWB neurons in BZ attraction are novel. Together, these results show that a combinatorial code of activity across multiple neurons is essential to drive plasticity in an animal's behavior to BZ odor.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Primary and secondary olfactory neurons encode BZ odor</title><p>Previously, we defined two classes of sensory neurons: primary neurons, which directly detect stimuli, and secondary neurons, which respond to neurotransmission from primary neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leinwand and Chalasani, 2013</xref>). To classify the BZ-responsive neurons, we combined laser cell ablation with functional imaging. We predicted that BZ responses in primary neurons would be preserved when other odor responsive sensory neurons were ablated, while secondary neuron responses would require functional signaling from intact primary neurons. We found that AWC<sup>ON</sup> responses to BZ were not affected in animals with any of the other BZ responsive neuron pairs (AWA, ASE or AWB neurons) ablated, suggesting that AWC<sup>ON</sup> neurons directly detect the odor stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Similarly, AWA responses to BZ were not affected in animals with ablated AWC, ASE or AWB neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These experiments suggest that AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWA neurons directly detect BZ and function as primary sensory neurons. In contrast, ASEL responses to BZ were greatly reduced in animals with ablated AWC neurons, but unaffected by AWA or AWB neuron ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This suggests that ASEL neurons may respond to signals from AWC<sup>ON</sup> primary sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Similarly, AWB responses to BZ required signaling from AWA neurons as these responses were significantly reduced specifically in the AWA ablation condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, while AWA neurons responded to the addition of odor stimulus with an increase in the calcium signal, the AWB neuron calcium signal increased upon odor removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>). We suggest that AWB neurons may be inhibited by AWA and, when odor is removed, AWA is no longer active, leading to a release from inhibition and an increase in AWB activity. Additionally, direct olfactory sensory inputs or signaling from other neurons may also contribute to AWB activity, accounting for the residual AWB responses to odor in the AWA neuron ablated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Collectively, these data show a novel sensory circuit configuration in which the odor responsive neurons are not equal: the olfactory circuit for BZ odor is composed of two primary sensory neurons (AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWA) and two secondary neurons (ASEL and AWB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10181.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cell ablation reveals primary and secondary BZ sensory neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average young adult AWC<sup>ON</sup> neuron responses to medium BZ in control (Ctrl) mock-ablated animals compared to animals with the AWA, ASE or AWB sensory neurons ablated (neurons ablated at an early larval stage).

To identify the relevant primary neuron released neurotransmitters that activate the secondary neurons, we analyzed the neural activity patterns in various mutants. We first examined genetic mutants that primarily block the release of (1) small, clear synaptic vesicles containing classical neurotransmitters such as glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and acetylcholine [Munc13 or <italic>unc-13</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Richmond et al., 1999</xref>)] or (2) neuropeptide-containing dense core vesicles [CAPS, calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion, or <italic>unc-31</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Speese et al., 2007</xref>)].

Specifically, odor-evoked ASEL activity required <italic>unc-31-</italic>dependent neuropeptide signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Restoring neuropeptide release function specifically to the AWC neurons rescued ASEL BZ responses in <italic>unc-31</italic> mutants, suggesting that AWC neurons release peptides to recruit ASEL neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This gene mutant analysis suggests that the longer time required for ASEL neurons to reach their maximum response to odor may reflect the additional requirement of AWC-dependent peptidergic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Similarly, ASER responses to BZ also require neuropeptide signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). While we have not identified the source of these neuropeptides, we suggest that AWC released peptides may also activate ASER neurons. Moreover, <italic>unc-13-</italic>dependent classical neurotransmission was not required for either ASEL or ASER responses to BZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). We then examined AWB responses to BZ in neurotransmission mutants. AWB responses were significantly and specifically reduced in <italic>unc-13</italic> mutants, suggesting that these neurons are recruited to this olfactory circuit by classical neurotransmitter(s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To confirm that AWA was the source of these classical neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), we used tetanus toxin to manipulate the neurotransmitter pathways. Tetanus toxin has been previously shown to cleave synaptobrevin and block neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schiavo et al., 1992</xref>). We found that expressing tetanus toxin specifically in the AWA, but not AWC, sensory neurons significantly reduced AWB responses to BZ removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This confirms that AWA signals to AWB and recruits it into the odor circuit. Nevertheless, the residual odor-evoked AWB responses observed in <italic>unc-13</italic> mutants and transgenic animals with reduced AWA neurotransmission (AWA::tetanus toxin) confirm that direct sensory inputs or signaling from other neurons may also contribute to AWB activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These data show that ASE and AWB neurons can function as secondary neurons because their responses to BZ require neuropeptide and classical neurotransmitter signaling respectively. Collectively, this defines a BZ odor-encoding circuit motif consisting predominantly of two primary and two secondary neurons wired as two parallel channels of olfactory information.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Insulin peptidergic and cholinergic transmission from primary olfactory sensory neurons are required for secondary olfactory neuron activity</title><p>We then mapped the identities of the neuropeptide and neurotransmitter pathways transferring information from primary to secondary olfactory neurons. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome includes at least 122 neuropeptide genes and pathways to generate several classical neurotransmitters including glutamate, GABA and acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hobert, 2013</xref>). To identify the cognate neuropeptide(s) activating ASEL neurons, we used ASEL activity as readout to screen a number of neuropeptide gene mutants. We found that the insulin-like peptide <italic>ins-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pierce et al., 2001</xref>) was required for BZ-evoked ASEL responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Moreover, restoring INS-1 function specifically to AWC neurons, but not to AWA neurons, rescued mutant ASEL activity deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This suggests that AWC neurons release INS-1 peptides to recruit ASEL neurons into the odor circuit. To confirm AWC as the source of the INS-1 peptides, we used an AWC neuron-specific RNAi approach to knockdown the <italic>ins-1</italic> gene. Previous studies have shown that expressing the sense and anti-sense transcript under a cell-specific promoter can efficiently knockdown the gene of the interest in that cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Esposito et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leinwand and Chalasani, 2013</xref>).

We suggest that the same insulin neuropeptide may be multifunctional. For example, INS-1 released from AIA interneurons inhibits AWC and ASER activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tomioka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chalasani et al., 2010</xref>), while we show that INS-1 released from AWC recruits ASEL into the BZ circuit. Ultimately, this signaling can regulate odor circuit dynamics, salt chemotaxis plasticity and integrative thermotactic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kodama et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tomioka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chalasani et al., 2010</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that the site of release and likely also signaling in the downstream neurons play key roles in determining the functionality of INS-1 peptides.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10181.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Insulin peptidergic and cholinergic transmission from the two primary olfactory sensory neurons recruits two secondary olfactory neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) BZ-evoked activity in young adult ASEL neurons in wild-type, <italic>ins-1</italic> insulin-like peptide mutants, <italic>ins-1</italic>; AWC-specific <italic>ins-1</italic> rescue and <italic>ins-1</italic>; AWA-specific <italic>ins-1</italic> rescue.

We found that odor-evoked ASEL activity required the canonical insulin receptor (<italic>daf-2</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pierce et al., 2001</xref>]) and PI3-Kinase (<italic>age-1</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morris et al., 1996</xref>]) signaling in ASEL neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). We suggest that the increase in calcium in ASEL may result from rapid signaling downstream of PI3-Kinase acting directly on calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blair and Marshall, 1997</xref>), and that this may represent an alternate pathway to the canonical, long term effects of DAF-2 signaling to regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murphy et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the insulin receptor mutant (<italic>daf-2</italic>) had a stronger reduction in ASEL activity compared to the insulin ligand mutant (<italic>ins-1</italic>) or the insulin ligand knockdown animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). These results suggest that AWC neurons may co-release additional insulin peptides along with INS-1 to bind the insulin receptor on ASEL neurons. Importantly, we also confirmed that AWC<sup>ON</sup> primary olfactory neuron dynamics were normal in all of the insulin pathway mutants analyzed, indicating that insulin signaling functions downstream of primary olfactory sensory transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Furthermore, we have previously shown that ASEL responses to a different, directly detected stimulus, salt, are not affected in the <italic>daf-2</italic> or <italic>age-1</italic> mutants, suggesting that these primary ASEL responses do not depend on insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leinwand and Chalasani, 2013</xref>). Together, these results indicate that AWC-released insulin peptides signal to ASEL secondary neurons via the insulin receptor and PI3-Kinase to encode the BZ stimulus.</p><p>We also mapped the classical neurotransmitter pathway recruiting AWB neurons into the circuit. We found that mutations in the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), <italic>unc-17</italic>, which packs acetylcholine into synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alfonso et al., 1994</xref>), reduced AWB odor responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Restoring cholinergic function specifically in AWA primary neurons was sufficient to elicit wild-type-like activity in AWB secondary neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We also examined additional components of the cholinergic synthesis and release pathway through a cell-specific RNAi knockdown approach. We found that knocking down the <italic>C. elegans</italic> choline acetyltransferase (ChaT), <italic>cha-1,</italic> which is required for the biosynthesis of acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rand and Russell, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alfonso et al., 1994</xref>), specifically in the AWA neurons significantly reduced AWB neuron responses to BZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Together, these results suggest an essential role for cholinergic signaling from the AWA neurons to recruit AWB neurons to the olfactory circuit. Interestingly, AWA neuron-specific knockdown of the choline transporter <italic>cho-1,</italic> which is required for high affinity choline reuptake at presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Okuda et al., 2000</xref>), had no effect on AWB responses to BZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that AWA requires the choline acetyltransferase, but may not require the high affinity choline transporter to release acetylcholine. While we cannot rule out the possibility that our attempts to knockdown the choline transporter were ineffective, our results are consistent with prior observations that loss of <italic>cho-1</italic> has only mild effects on cholinergic neurotransmission and suggest that de novo choline synthesis and low affinity choline uptake may be sufficient for cholinergic signaling in the olfactory circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mullen et al., 2007</xref>). We considered whether acetylcholine modulates AWB activity by acting on muscarinic receptors. We found that odor-evoked AWB activity was not affected in mutants of any of the three identified <italic>C. elegans</italic> muscarinic receptors (<italic>gar-1</italic>, <italic>gar-2</italic> and <italic>gar-3</italic>) (data not shown), suggesting that acetylcholine might bind other receptors on AWB neurons. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome encodes 8 acetylcholine-gated chloride channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hobert, 2013</xref>) and we suggest that AWA-released acetylcholine binds one of these receptors to inhibit AWB neuronal activity when odor is added, leading to a rebound from this inhibition when odor is removed. Moreover, we found that AWB responses to the directly detected repulsive odorant 2-nonanone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Troemel et al., 1997</xref>) were normal in <italic>unc-17</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We suggest that AWB secondary (to BZ), but not primary (to 2-nonanone) responses require cholinergic signaling. Importantly, we also confirmed that AWA primary olfactory neuron dynamics were normal in the genetic mutants and knockdown animals analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). These experiments support the conclusion that changes in the secondary neuron activity observed in these mutants and knockdown transgenic animals are downstream of sensory transduction in the primary neurons and related to transmitter release from primary neurons.</p><p>Next, we tested whether insulin peptidergic and cholinergic signaling were required for chemotaxis behavior. Consistent with our imaging results, we found that knocking down the insulin-like peptide <italic>ins-1</italic> in AWC neurons significantly reduced attraction to BZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In addition, animals with the choline acetyltransferase <italic>cha-1</italic> knocked down specifically in AWA neurons also displayed significantly reduced BZ chemotaxis behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Together, these data show that BZ stimulus is encoded by AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWA primary sensory neurons, which use insulin peptidergic and cholinergic neurotransmission to elicit activity in ASEL and AWB secondary neurons and to shape chemotaxis behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Thus, multiple neuropeptide and neurotransmitter pathways are integrated to shape odor encoding and behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Attractive olfactory behavior and odor-evoked activity of secondary neurons specifically decay with aging</title><p>We have shown that a combinatorial neural activity code comprising primary and secondary neurons encodes odors and drives behavior. Is this combinatorial olfactory code persistent and reliable throughout life? Interestingly, olfactory behavioral performance has been previously shown to degrade with age, which in turn affects quality of life and overall safety and survival across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doty and Kamath, 2014</xref>). We used the detailed characterization of the combinatorial BZ olfactory circuit described above to investigate systems levels changes in olfactory function with age.</p><p>We first tested whether aging affects BZ-evoked behavior. While young adults were strongly attracted to BZ odor, we found that older animals (day 4–6) showed a significant impairment in their attraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The behavioral deficit was largest for day 6 adults; however, we found that these animals had more variability in their size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) making it difficult to design an effective trap to image animals beyond day 5 of adulthood and analyze their odor-evoked neuronal activity. Therefore, for the remainder, we compared young adults (day 1, the age characterized above) and animals at a post-reproductive, early stage of aging (day 5), which we refer to as ‘aged’ adults. Importantly, we found that the aging-associated chemotaxis behavioral deficit is unlikely to be caused by changes in locomotory ability since the speed of chemotaxing aged animals did not differ from that of young adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

We analyzed the responses of the primary (AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWA) and secondary (ASEL and AWB) neurons to BZ in both young (day 1) and aged (day 5) adult animals. Overall, aging did not affect the reliability, duration or magnitude of odor-evoked activity in AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWA primary neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D,G–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, odor-evoked ASEL and AWB secondary neuron activity was highly variable with aging, with many neurons failing to show any responses to odor, revealing a possible mechanism for behavioral decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, the AWB neurons that did respond to odor in aged animals had calcium transients that were indistinguishable from responses in younger animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Additionally, considering only the animals with odor responsive ASEL neurons, the BZ responses of the aged animals were in fact significantly larger than that of the young animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,G,H</xref>). These results suggest that odor-evoked activity in ASEL and AWB secondary neurons selectively decays in some animals. Consistent with these results, we found that the weak chemotaxis performance of aged animals towards BZ only required the primary AWC and AWA neurons, and not the unreliable secondary ASE and AWB neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). To further examine this, we tested whether performance in the chemotaxis assay is correlated with the odor responsiveness of the ASEL and AWB secondary neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We found that aged animals that failed to chemotax towards BZ were significantly more likely to have odor non-responsive ASEL and AWB neurons than aged animals that successfully found the odor source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>). Taken together, these data reveal a distributed neural circuit that detects attractive odors and suggest that BZ behavioral declines arise from unreliable activity of aged secondary ASEL and AWB neurons in this circuit.</p><p>We then tested whether this aging-associated decline was dependent on odor concentration. We showed that a distinct, but overlapping set of sensory neurons encodes high concentration BZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H,I</xref>). Behaviorally, we found that high BZ was similarly repulsive in young and aged animals (through day 5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Consistently, high BZ-evoked neural activity did not significantly decline between day 1 and day 5 adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B–D</xref>). These data suggest that the aging-associated decline in neuronal function is dependent on odor concentration; consistent with previous studies showing relatively preserved behavioral detection of strong sensory stimuli with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hummel et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Next, we investigated whether aging impairs all or only selective functions of ASEL and AWB neurons. To test this, we analyzed responses to salt (sodium chloride) and the repulsive odorant 2-nonanone, which are directly transduced by ASEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bargmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>) and AWB neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Troemel et al., 1997</xref>), respectively. We found that neuronal activity and behavior in response to these stimuli remained reliable and robust in aged animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K,L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A–D</xref>). These data indicate that functionality of both ASEL and AWB neurons in aged animals is sensory context dependent. Specifically, their primary responses to salt (ASEL) and 2-nonanone (AWB) are preserved, while their function as secondary neurons in encoding attractive BZ stimuli is impaired during aging.</p><p>We have previously shown AWC sensory neurons act as secondary neurons in the salt sensory circuit and respond to salt stimuli in an ASE-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leinwand and Chalasani, 2013</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether AWC secondary responses salt were also degraded during aging. However, we found that AWC responses to salt were not reduced in aged animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4E,F</xref>). These data suggest that these early aging-associated deficits are specific to the BZ circuit, leaving the salt circuit fully functional. Together, these results show that there is a sensory context dependent decline in ASEL and AWB responses to BZ with age, disrupting the combinatorial code for attractive olfactory information specifically.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Long-lived mutants do not affect aging-associated neuronal activity and behavioral declines</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> is short lifespan model and has proven to be useful in identifying conserved organismal-level longevity pathways, such as insulin and energy and stress sensing pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wolff and Dillin, 2006</xref>).

These data show that signaling from the longevity-modulating germline, AMP kinase energy sensing and Rab GTPase pathways do not attenuate secondary neuronal activity and behavior declines.</p><p>We also tested whether mutations that shorten lifespan could influence the aging-associated declines in neuronal function. A whole animal knockdown of the stress-induced heat shock factor 1 (<italic>hsf-1</italic>) was shown to be short-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hsu et al., 2003</xref>).

This suggests that the neurotransmission that recruits these neurons to the odor circuit may break down with age. In particular, impaired ASEL neuronal activity may indicate a breakdown in the peptidergic neurotransmission that recruits this neuron into the BZ circuit. In order to identify the mechanisms for this aging-associated decline, we manipulated the primary to secondary neurotransmission pathway. First, we hypothesized that aging might downregulate the levels of the peptide receptors on ASEL neurons, thus reducing signaling in aged ASEL neurons. We tested this hypothesis by overexpressing the DAF-2 insulin receptor specifically in the ASEL neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, left panel). However, we found no change in the reliability of these aged animals' odor-evoked ASEL activity compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This result suggests that receptor expression is not limiting in these aged animals.

To test this, we over-expressed the insulin-like neuropeptide INS-1 in the AWC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, right panel). This manipulation succeeded in improving the reliability of odor-evoked activity in aged ASEL neurons, suggesting that increased neuropeptide production, and consequently release, can rescue aging-associated deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also tested whether INS-1 (OE) could rescue aging-induced behavioral decline. We found that overexpressing INS-1 did not have a significant effect on the behavior of aged (or young) adults to BZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Together, these results show that while INS-1 (OE) can rescue the age-induced neural activity deficits, this is not sufficient to rescue aging-induced behavioral deficits. We suggest that the temporal properties of neuropeptide signaling are likely to be complex and that the INS-1 (OE) might have predicted effects on short timescales (a few seconds), but variable effects on longer timescales (hours to days).</p><p>To confirm a role for increased AWC neurotransmission in recruiting ASEL neurons, we also generated an AWC-specific RNAi knockdown of Tomosyn (<italic>tom-1</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gracheva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leinwand and Chalasani, 2013</xref>]), a syntaxin-interacting protein that normally acts as a brake on all neurotransmission, to increase neuropeptide and neurotransmitter release from AWC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, right panel). This manipulation to increase release from AWC neurons resulted in significantly more reliable odor-evoked ASEL activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). These manipulations did not significantly affect ASEL responses in young day 1 adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), suggesting that increased neurotransmission from the primary olfactory neurons specifically rescues the aging-associated ASEL defects. We also tested whether increased neurotransmission from AWC could rescue the aging-associated decline in chemotaxis behavior. We found that in aged day 5 adults, AWC-specific <italic>tom-1</italic> knockdown animals showed a significant improvement over wild-type in their attraction to BZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).

We hypothesized that this process could be reduced during aging; therefore, we tested whether manipulations to increase neurotransmission from AWA neurons could rescue the decline in aged AWB neural activity. We over-expressed the vesicular acetylcholine transporter, UNC-17, specifically in AWA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). OE of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter was previously shown to increase the quantity of acetylcholine packed into and released from synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Song et al., 1997</xref>).

We also confirmed a role for acetylcholine by using a pharmacological agent, arecoline.

These data suggest that both classical neurotransmission (from AWA neurons) and neuropeptide signaling (from AWC neurons), which are key components of the combinatorial code for BZ, may have a longevity promoting effect. These data are in contrast with previously published results showing that animals with AWC or AWA neurons ablated live longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcedo and Kenyon, 2004</xref>); therefore, we probed the role of these neurons in lifespan further. We analyzed the lifespan of animals in which AWA or AWC neurons were silenced rather than ablated. Animals expressing tetanus toxin in either AWA or AWC neurons to block their neurotransmission lived significantly longer than wild-type (average of 36.0% and 27.6% longer, respectively, over two independent trials, p &lt; 0.01, Mantel–Cox test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2 fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 2B,3</xref>). Together, these results suggest that a balance in neurotransmission from the primary olfactory neurons is crucial to an animal's longevity; both higher than normal and lower than normal levels of neurotransmission extend lifespan. We suggest that signaling from these primary olfactory neurons is integrated by the downstream circuitry to mediate effects on the animal's lifespan.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results define a novel neural circuit mechanism for encoding sensory information to drive behavior and demonstrate age-related functional declines in this circuit. These data provide the first indication that <italic>C. elegans</italic> employ a combinatorial olfactory coding strategy as in flies and mice, suggesting that this strategy is essential for behavioral plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oka et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, we suggest that primary olfactory neurons directly detect odors and use neurotransmission to recruit additional secondary neurons. However, activity in the secondary neurons declines with aging, leading to behavioral deficits.</p><p>We propose that the combination of primary and secondary neurons may be a common motif in sensory neural circuits from worms to mammals. A distinct, but similarly distributed neural circuit (which does not include the ASE neurons) encodes a different attractive odorant, isoamyl alcohol (data not shown, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yoshida et al., 2012</xref>]). Furthermore, we have previously shown that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> salt neural circuit is composed of a primary salt sensory neuron, ASEL, which releases INS-6 insulin neuropeptides to recruit a secondary sensory neuron, AWC<sup>ON</sup>, into the circuit in particular sensory contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leinwand and Chalasani, 2013</xref>). This combined primary and secondary neuron coding strategy is likely to increase the signal-to-noise ratios, thus preventing failures in encoding sensory information. Combinatorial coding of this sort may also be broadly useful for distinguishing different concentrations of the same stimulus, as they will be encoded by overlapping but distinct subsets of neurons. This approach may also enhance the ability of young adults to successfully find food, perhaps to enhance reproductive success, while the aging-associated declines occur in post-reproductive animals that may have reduced nutritional demands. Furthermore, the insulin peptidergic and cholinergic signaling from primary to secondary olfactory neurons could add salience to volatile food signals in a complex, multisensory environment. Previous studies have shown that insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lacroix et al., 2008</xref>) and cholinergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ogura et al., 2011</xref>) are expressed in mammalian olfactory processing centers, suggesting that these signaling pathways might also be used to encode odors in mammals. Detailed analyses of the architecture of sensory circuits, including the neurotransmission between sensory neurons, in other species are needed to determine whether the circuit motif described here is broadly conserved.</p><p>We find that primary sensory transduction remains robust as animals age. However, the combinatorial code for attractive volatile cues degrades with age because the activity of cells functioning as secondary neurons decays with age. Our results show that aging-induced decline in neuronal function is dependent on the interplay between sensory context and neuronal identity. For example, we find that primary ASEL responses to salt and AWB responses to 2-nonanone are preserved while their secondary responses to BZ are reduced in aged animals. This is in contrast with studies showing an early stage age-induced decline in the primary ASH neuron responses to hyperosmotic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chokshi et al., 2010</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that aging differentially affects sensory circuits, perhaps reflecting differences in physiological demand and the importance of diverse sensory contexts as the animal ages. Furthermore, these aging-associated sensory declines occur independently of many known longevity pathways. Insulin signaling has been shown to promote longevity in a number of model systems including <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Broughton and Partridge, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kenyon, 2010</xref>). We find that insulin signaling is required for the primary AWC<sup>ON</sup> to secondary ASEL neurotransmission and so are unable to separate its longevity promoting effect from its role in encoding sensory information. We speculate that the insulin signaling pathway might affect both the quality of an animal's life by encoding odors based on sensory context and also its lifespan.</p><p>Our experiments show that experimental manipulations targeting neurotransmission pathways improve the aging-associated neuronal activity and olfactory behavioral declines. Several different mechanisms could underlie the impairments observed in aged animals and overcome by our manipulations. A decline in peptidergic and cholinergic gene expression with age could contribute; however, quantitative RT-PCR experiments suggest that there is no aging-associated reduction in the expression of these genes at the whole animal level [data not shown and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jin et al., 2011</xref>)]. Changes in gene expression specifically in the primary olfactory neurons cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, we speculate that the early aging-associated sensory impairments are driven at least in part by reduced neurotransmitter release from primary neurons, a mechanism likely applicable across species. We find that both increasing neurotransmitter production and release capacity rescue the aging-associated deficits. Therefore, it is likely that aging affects multiple steps in the neurotransmitter release pathway, emphasizing the key role played by this machinery in regulating animal behavior and physiology. These results are consistent with reports of reduced synapse number in the aged mammalian olfactory bulb, which should disrupt olfactory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Richard et al., 2010</xref>). We speculate that these differences in synaptic transmission also explain some of the inter-individual variability in aging phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pinto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vijg, 2014</xref>). Subsequently, these circuit-level changes could produce hyposmia or anosmia, which may be among the earliest predictors of lifespan and mortality across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Toth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pinto et al., 2014</xref>). More generally, we suggest that alterations in transmitter release, which disrupt neuronal communication throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dickstein et al., 2007</xref>) are likely to underlie variability in individual animal behavior and age-related cognitive and behavioral decline.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were grown and maintained under standard conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

We first captured 10 s of baseline activity (t = 0–10 s) in chemotaxis assay buffer (5 mM K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (pH 6), 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 50 mM NaCl), then 2 min (t = 10–130 s) of exposure to an odor (or salt) stimulus dissolved in chemotaxis buffer, and lastly 50 s (t = 130–180 s) of buffer only. BZ refers to a 0.005% vol/vol dilution in chemotaxis assay buffer, except where low BZ (0.0001% vol/vol) or high BZ (0.1% vol/vol) is specifically mentioned. Additionally, a 0.1% vol/vol dilution of 2-nonanone and 50 mM sodium chloride stimulus were used as indicated. For arecoline experiments, worms were pre-treated with 0.15 mM arecoline in chemotaxis buffer for approximately 20 min and immediately imaged in the presence of the drug. Laser ablations of the paired AWC, AWA, AWB or ASE sensory neurons, along with mock ablations, were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bargmann and Avery, 1995</xref>) in transgenic animals expressing GCaMP. In all experiments, a single neuron was imaged in each animal, and each animal was imaged only once. Wild-type Ctrls, mutants, and transgenic or drug treated strains for each figure were imaged in alternation, in the same session.</p><p>We used Metamorph and an EMCCD camera (Photometrics) to capture images at a rate of 10 frames per second. A MATLAB script was used to analyze the average fluorescence for the cell body region of interest and to plot the percent change in fluorescence for the region of interest relative to F<sub>0</sub>, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chalasani et al., 2007</xref>). Specifically, data was plotted and statistical analysis was performed as follows: (1) for line graphs of ΔF/F over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3 fig4">Figures 1–4</xref> and corresponding figure supplements), the average fluorescence in a 8 s window (t = 1–9 s) was set as F<sub>0</sub>. Average and standard error at each time point were generated and plotted using MATLAB scripts, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leinwand and Chalasani, 2013</xref>). (2) For heat maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6 fig7">Figures 5–7</xref> and corresponding figure supplements), the average fluorescence in a 8 s window (t = 1–9 s) was set as F<sub>0</sub>.</p><p>To quantify calcium responses, F<sub>0</sub> was consistently set to the average fluorescence signal from 1 s to 9 s prior to the relevant change (addition or removal) of stimulus. For statistical analysis, the average fluorescence and standard error were calculated for each animal over a short period corresponding to the duration of a response. Specifically, to analyze on responses to the addition of stimulus, the average fluorescence and standard error were calculated in the 10 s period following the addition of odor or salt (t = 10–20 s). For AWA neurons, the response duration was very brief; therefore, a 4 s time period was used instead (t = 10–14 s) so that small, fast responses could be appropriately quantified. To analyze off responses to the removal of stimulus, the average fluorescence and standard error were calculated in the period following the removal of odor (t = 130–140 s for all cells except ASE, and t = 130–145 for the slower, longer duration ASE responses). Traces in which an averaged ΔF/F of greater than 600% was recorded were excluded as they are likely to be artifacts of the neurons moving out of the focal plane and these usually account for less than 1% of the traces collected. To determine whether there was an odor-evoked increase or suppression of the calcium signal (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the average fluorescence in these time windows in buffer only trials was compared (by a two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test) to the average fluorescence in odor stimulation trials, for each neuron. The maximum ΔF/F in these time periods following odor addition or removal and the time to reach this maximum ΔF/F (from the stimulus change, in seconds) were also quantified (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

For the subset of odor-responsive neurons (exceeding the 10% ΔF/F cut-off), the averaged ΔF/F after the stimulus change and the time to the maximum ΔF/F were also analyzed using two-tailed unpaired <italic>t-</italic>tests to compare different ages or genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Furthermore, considering only the odor responsive neurons, no significant differences were observed in the magnitude of the odor-evoked suppression of young and aged animals (comparing the average fluorescence in ten second windows tiling the period of odor stimulation, by two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test), indicating that our subsequent analyzes of the odor removal time period are not biased by the choice of the F<sub>0</sub>.</p><p>(3) For bar graph quantifications of the % odor or salt responsive neurons in the aging experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6 fig7">Figure 5I,K,L, 6F, and 7E</xref> and the corresponding figure supplements): (a) F<sub>0</sub> was set to the average fluorescence from 1–9 s for quantification of the percent of AWA and ASH neurons responsive to the addition of BZ stimulus and for the percent of ASEL and AWC neurons responsive to the addition of NaCl salt stimulus. (b) F<sub>0</sub> was set to the average fluorescence from 121–129 s for AWC<sup>ON</sup>, ASEL and AWB responses to BZ or 2-nonanone odor stimulus removal. The percent of odor responsive neurons was calculated by determining the proportion of cells displaying an average fluorescence (ΔF/F) greater than 10% after odor addition (for AWA and ASH) or odor removal (all other neurons). 10% ΔF/F was used as the cut-off for odor responsiveness because, for all neurons imaged, changing buffer around the nose of the animal elicited a response smaller than this cut-off. Similarly, neurons displaying an average fluorescence (ΔF/F) greater than 10% after salt addition were considered to be salt responsive. A two-tailed Chi–Square test was used to compare the percent of odor or salt responsive neurons in different conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Chemotaxis assays</title><p>Odor chemotaxis assays were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ward, 1973</xref>). For aging assays, worms were synchronized by hatch offs in which 8 young adult worms were given 150 min to lay eggs on a large plate before being picked off. These eggs were grown at 20° until the appropriate day of adulthood, except for <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants, which were raised at the restrictive temperature, 25°. Aging animals were transferred to new bacteria plates every other day to track the aging animals and to avoid contamination by their progeny. Chemotaxis assays were performed on 2% agar plates (10 cm diameter) containing 5 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6), 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>. Animals were washed once in M9 and three times in chemotaxis buffer (5 mM K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (pH 6), 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>). For arecoline chemotaxis experiments, 0.15 mM arecoline was added to the M9 and chemotaxis buffer washes, yielding a 16–20 min drug treatment immediately prior to the behavioral experiment. Odor concentration gradients were established by spotting diluted BZ (0.2% vol/vol, in ethanol) near the edge of the plate, with a Ctrl 1 μl of ethanol spotted at the opposite end of the plate. Where noted, 1 μl of neat BZ was used for high concentration point source assays. For 2-nonanone experiments, a 50% vol/vol dilution of 2-nonanone in ethanol was used. For salt chemotaxis experiments, salt gradients were established by placing a Ctrl or a high salt (500 mM NaCl) agar plug on the assay plate and allowing 16–20 hr for the salt to diffuse and form a gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leinwand and Chalasani, 2013</xref>). 1 μl of sodium azide was added to the odor (or salt) and the Ctrl spots to anesthetize animals reaching the end points. Washed worms were placed on the plate and allowed to move freely for one hour. The chemotaxis index was computed as the number of worms in the region near the odor (or salt) minus the worms in the region near the Ctrl divided by the total number of worms that moved beyond the origin. Nine or more assays were performed, over at least three different days.

Second, animals were given only 30 min to move freely on the chemotaxis plate.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. As you can tell these issues require some significant re-writing, but no further experimentation.</p><p>1) AWB shows a nice odor-off response even in AWA-ablated animals. The source of this sensory stimulus is not known, one possibility being redundant inputs from AWA and AWC. Small but significant AWB response is also observed in the <italic>unc-13</italic> mutant, <italic>unc-17</italic> mutant and other manipulations. Given the status of the analysis and the characteristics of AWB as olfactory neurons, direct sensory input to AWB is not excluded and is in fact likely. Please discuss this issue in the text and put an arrow (maybe dotted arrow) from “benzaldehyde” to “AWB” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2E and 4G</xref>, unless you identify neurons that account for 100% of the odor-off response of AWB.</p><p>2) Also, AWA's role is enigmatic. Upon odor removal, at which time AWB is activated, AWA does not respond at all, or show only a small calcium increase. On the contrary, upon odor addition, AWA is largely activated but AWB is not activated, or a bit inhibited. Therefore a simple excitatory or inhibitory synapse from AWA to AWB does not explain the behavior of AWB neurons. This simple consideration leads to the question whether AWBs dependence on AWA is based on fast synaptic transmission. You show that the <italic>unc-17</italic> mutant shows reduced response of AWB and this defect is rescued by <italic>unc-17</italic> expression in AWA. <italic>cho-1</italic> RNAi shows similar results. However, this does not necessarily mean AWB is activated upon odor removal by cholinergic neurotransmission from AWA. Equally possible explanations – which you should discuss in the text – are the modulatory effects of AWA-released acetylcholine (as muscarinic receptors function in other systems), by which AWB becomes more responsive to direct odor sensation. In the Abstract, you state: “Primary neurons, AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWA, directly detect the food odor benzaldehyde and release insulin-like peptides and acetylcholine, respectively, to activate secondary neurons, ASEL and AWB”. This clearly implicates that insulin and acetylcholine are released upon odor detection to activate ASEL and AWB. This is not supported because there is no release timing data presented for neither insulin nor acetylcholine (these data are generally difficult to obtain in <italic>C. elegans</italic>). You need to carefully rephrase these statements to something like “insulin-like peptide and acetylcholine released from AWC and AWA respectively are required for activity of secondary neurons”.</p><p>3) The quantification data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref> are persuasive in showing that only ASEL and AWB decline by age. However, you need to accurately describe the quantification method. In the Methods, you state: “To analyze off responses to the removal of stimulus, F0 was set to the time just prior to odor removal (t=121-129s)”. This is probably not what you did for the heat maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B-D</xref>, which show only the 120s-180s time points, and the dot plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>. Instead, F0 seems to come from the average of t=1-9s for these analyses.</p><p>4) In the Methods, you state: “the percent of odor responsive neurons was calculated by determining the proportion of cells displaying an average fluorescence (ΔF/F) greater than 10 percent after odor addition (for AWA) or odor removal (all other neurons)”. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G, I, J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and other similar figures, which time points did you use for calculating F0 (or F), 1-9s or 121-129s?</p><p>The definition of F0, of course, affects the interpretation of the results. All time series traces of ASEL and AWB calcium levels, like those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> show downward trends during odor exposure. If F0 is defined for 1-9s, all data quoted above might mean that aged ASEL and AWB are more sensitive to suppression by sustained odor exposure. This can be appreciated by quantifying the decline in calcium levels during 2-minutes odor exposure in young and aged animals, but this result is not presented and it should be.</p><p>It is fine either way, as far as there is a change in “secondary neuron” responses between young and aged animals, but the results must be accurately presented so that readers are not lead to misunderstandings.</p><p>5) Please indicate whether you tested whether <italic>ins-1</italic> mutants are defective in chemotaxis to benzaldehyde? Same for AWA::<italic>cha-1</italic>(RNAi) animals? The current model predicts that they should be.</p><p>6) Given the multiple caveats of RNAi, it would be useful to include a control RNAi – so perhaps RNAi against <italic>unc-25</italic> or something like that. If you have such a control, please add it.</p><p>7) Given that it is absolutely impossible to know whether the RNAi against <italic>cho-1</italic> was really effective, you should temper their conclusions based on this result.</p><p>8) In the present version, you do not discuss whether the effects you report here are specific to the benzaldehyde odorant or whether a similarly distributed circuit also responds to other AWC-sensed odorants. In the previous version, you had mentioned that IAA is different. Please explicitly mention in the Discussion that your BA findings may not be generalizable to all odorants (it is fine to mention the IAA data as unpublished data).</p><p>9) In the Discussion, you propose that the “aging-associated sensory impairments are driven by reduced neurotransmitter release from primary neurons”. The data don't really support this conclusion strongly. You show that a) overexpression of <italic>ins-1</italic> as well as b) RNAi of tomosyn results in improved ASE responses and in the latter case, behavior. Similarly, they also show that overexpression of <italic>unc-17</italic> improves responses (also addition of arecoline) and behavior. But these effects need not arise only from reduced release but could also arise from reduced age-dependent expression of cholinergic genes or <italic>ins-1</italic>. Please address this issue in the text.</p><p>10) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, it would be better to present the scatter plots now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5– figure supplement 1</xref>. The percentage responsive metric shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> doesn't quite capture the differences in the responses.</p><p>[Editors' note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled “Neural mechanisms regulating aging-associated behavioral decline in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three peer reviewers, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While all reviewers recognized the importance and potential interest of the work, the overall sense was that there were too many loose ends in the manuscript that require a substantial amount of additional work. You can see these points listed below by the individual reviews. The member of the Board of Reviewing Editors who handled the manuscript also had concerns about the validity of the claim that the AWA neurons are indeed cholinergic. Once all these concerns have been addressed, you may want to consider submitting the manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic>, but this would count as a completely new submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Leinwand and colleagues reports essentially two stories. The first describes the existence of a possible population code for some odors (that were originally thought to be sensed by single sensory neurons), and the second describes the effects of aging on this population coding mechanism, and how changes in this coding may underlie aging-dependent decline in chemotaxis abilities. However, neither story is sufficiently developed.</p><p>Essential questions:</p><p>If the model is that AWC and AWA represent parallel and non-redundant channels for BZ responses, and that in young animals, AWC and AWA in addition act via ASE and AWB, respectively, why does ASE ablation show as strong a chemotaxis defect as the AWC ablation (1G?). The model would predict that in an ASE-ablated strain, AWC should still be able to drive reasonably strong chemotaxis. This appears to be the case for the AWA/AWB channel, since AWB-ablated animals show a weaker defect than AWA-ablated animals.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: The authors assert that AWC is a primary BZ sensor based on the fact that their responses are unaffected in <italic>unc-13</italic> and un<italic>c-31</italic> mutants. There does appear to be a significant defect in the BZ response in <italic>unc-13</italic> mutants though (2A). Also, the responses in <italic>unc-31</italic> mutants are extremely variable. For AWA, the authors can't rule out gap junctions, so their conclusion that AWA is a primary BZ sensor should be tempered. For the rescue experiments (2C, 2D), all of them are quite weak rescue – what is the reason for that? The supplemental data show that ASEL responses are significantly affected in <italic>unc-13</italic> mutants as well but that is not addressed. Finally, it would be useful to see some negative controls here. Easy ones to try are AWA rescue for ASE, and AWC rescue for AWB.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: The authors show that ins-1 may be the relevant neuropeptide from AWC that regulates ASE responses to BZ. However, rescue in AWC alone is not sufficient since many reports in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have shown that neuropeptides need not necessarily be expressed from their site of release to have effects. So, the authors need to demonstrate that expression from other neurons do not rescue, or perform RNAi in AWC alone. This is particularly important since <italic>ins-1</italic> released from AIA has previously been shown to affect both AWC responses (by the corresponding author) and ASE responses (Iino group). These latter results should be discussed in the context of this work.</p><p>I might have missed this, but are there effects of either <italic>daf-2</italic> or <italic>unc-17</italic> on salt responses in ASE and nonanone responses in AWB, respectively?</p><p>While AWB seems to be an OFF neuron for BZ (and also for nonanone, as reported previously), it appears to be an ON neuron for IAA. How might that work? Related to this, the IAA population coding appears to be different than BZ since it looks like AWC shows a pretty strong defect in IAA responses in aged animals. This is shown in the supplemental material but not discussed.</p><p>While the data showing that increased NP signaling or cholinergic signaling can rescue the odor response in aged animals are nice, the data leave open the question of exactly how the population code contributes to increased chemotaxis in younger animals. For instance, does the population code change in older animals responses in aversive neurons for instance that compete with neurons driving attraction?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have uncovered a novel sensory circuit motif for the sensation of a medium concentration of benzaldehyde, and have characterized the decline of this ability with age. The authors identified AWC and AWA as primary sensors of this odorant, and ASE and AWB as secondary sensory neurons that are recruited by the primary sensory neurons but do not sense the odor independently. Specifically, they find that the neuropeptide INS-1 is released from AWC and activates ASE through the DAF-2 receptor, while acetylcholine is released from AWA to activate AWB. Age-related behavioral deficits are found to be primarily a consequence of decreased activity in the secondary sensory neurons ASE and AWB in response to the stimulus, but can be corrected by increasing neurotransmission in the primary sensory neurons AWC and AWA.

These statements could be toned down.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors focused on benzaldehyde (bz) response of amphid sensory neurons and found that in addition to the known bz-sensing neurons AWC, AWA, AWB and ASE respond to bz. AWA shows ON responses and others show OFF responses. According to the authors, AWC and AWA are primary sensory neurons (their response to the odor does not rely on synaptic transmission), and ASE and AWB are secondary sensory neurons. They claim that AWC-to-ASEL communication depends on the insulin signaling genes <italic>ins-1</italic>, <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>age-1</italic>, while AWA-to-AWB communication depends on the cholinergic signaling gene <italic>unc-17</italic>. Based on this characterization of the basic circuit, they look at the age-dependent decline of chemosensation. Chemotaxis to bz declines with age, through 1 to 6 days in adulthood. The calcium response of AWC and AWA neurons did not significantly change by age, while response of ASEL and AWB becomes variable in aged animals, whereby fraction of non-responsive neurons increases with age. Increasing the expression of <italic>ins-1</italic> in AWC or AWC-specific RNAi of <italic>tom-1</italic> tomosin rescues the ASEL response, while increasing the expression of <italic>unc-17</italic> or addition of cholinergic agonist arecoline rescues the AWB response. Chemotaxis performance of individual aged animal was found correlated with lifespan. Together, the authors suggest that synaptic transmission is the primary site of age-dependent decline.</p><p>This is an interesting paper in which clear changes in bz chemotaxis and underlying sensory circuit during aging was demonstrated and the site of change was identified. This is a beautiful work benefited by the short lifespan and single-cell resolution of the model system of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The observation that individual animals showing good chemotaxis at day 5 of adulthood are predicted to live longer is particularly interesting.</p><p>In spite of these merits, there are also problems in presentation and interpretation of the data as follows.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript, the authors state that insulin (INS-1) acts for neurotransmission between AWC and ASEL. This terminology itself is probably not wrong, but we need to consider what this statement means in terms of how insulin might work. Are the authors suggesting that it acts as a neurotransmitter in a most classical sense of the term, namely as a factor that is released by excitation of the presynaptic neuron and acts trans-synaptically on the postsynaptic receptor to directly activate the postsynaptic neuron? In this case, how do they think DAF-2 insulin receptor and AGE-1 PI3-kinase might lead to activation of this neuron? Although PI 3-kinase pathway is known to modulate several channels and receptors in mammalian systems, as far as this reviewer knows, adding insulin to a neuron does not immediately excite the neuron.</p><p>A more likely possibility is that INS-1 acts chronically on ASEL and modulates the molecular machinery in this neuron so that it becomes more responsive to synaptic inputs to this neuron, for example from AWC. In this case, AWC may use another neurotransmitter such as glutamate to transmit the odor signal to ASEL. As a reference, INS-1 has been reported to act on ASER neuron to modulate this neuron, and DAF-2 receptor in ASER was shown to down-regulate synaptic transmission that occurs in response to chemosensory inputs to this neuron (Ohno et al. Science 2014). It is well established that DAF-16 FOXO acts downstream of DAF-2 to regulate expression of many genes including longevity-related gene. It would therefore be also possible that INS-1 acts hormonally on other nearby neurons to change the expression level of proteins that regulate the activities of this neuron (neurotransmitter receptors, voltage-gated calcium channels etc.). Note that the authors only tested expression of <italic>ins-1</italic> in AWC for rescue but not in other neurons or tissues.</p><p>Unless the authors show evidence that INS-1 directly activates ASEL neuron, they should avoid misleading expressions, specifically: “Together, these results indicate that AWC-released insulin peptide signal via the insulin receptor and PI3-Kinase to rapidly activate ASE secondary neurons (within 5 seconds) and encode bz stimulus.” There is no evidence for this statement. Also, the cartoon, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> middle, clearly implies that INS-1 acts as a classical neurotransmitter. This is also not supported by the results presented.</p><p>2) AWA is activated upon addition of bz and AWB is activated upon removal of bz (at the medium concentration). If one assumes that AWB is activated by a direct input from AWA neurons (through acetylcholine), the input ought to be an inhibitory input. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> right, shows the opposite. Along with the above argument, it is more appropriate to omit Ca<sup>2+</sup> in ASEL and AWB in the cartoon.</p><p>3) The authors often call AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWC<sup>OFF</sup> together as AWC and ASEL and ASER as ASE. However, as stated by the authors in the manuscript these two pairs of neurons are molecularly and functionally different. The authors focused their exploration on AWC<sup>ON</sup> and ASEL and left out characterization of ASER and AWC<sup>OFF</sup>. Therefore they should be careful in there descriptions. For example, Figure 2–figure supplement 1A shows that calcium response of AWC<sup>OFF</sup> is significantly compromised in the <italic>unc-13</italic> mutant even if one looks only at the initial increase in the calcium level. Therefore AWC<sup>OFF</sup> is categorized as secondary olfactory neuron for bz, while the authors state “two pairs of primary sensory neurons (AWC and AWA)”. This is inappropriate.</p><p>4) In the subsection “Attractive Odor-evoked Activity of Seconardy Neurons Specifically Decays with Aging: “the calcium transient of odor-responsive aged ASEL and AWB neurons were indistinguishable from responses in younger animals”. I actually do not see this. If we leave out non-responsive animals, by manual inspection, overall response of ASEL looks higher and that of AWB looks lower. The authors need to quantify the magnitude of response of “responding” neurons. This is important because the authors claim that variability of neuronal responses increases by age. This is true if the magnitude of the calcium response of “responding” neurons in old animals is equal or higher than young animals, because there are more “non-responsive” animals, while if response of responding neurons are lower in old animals than in young animals, this simply means an overall decline of neuronal response.</p><p>5) To me, the results of Figure 4–figure supplement 3 look contradictory with the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. The former indicate that the sensory responses of ASEL and AWB are correlated with chemotaxis performance, while the latter indicates that the presence of ASEL or AWB neurons are irrelevant to chemotaxis performance in aged animals. One possible explanation to solve this contradiction would be that responsiveness of ASEL and AWB is correlated with responsiveness (or other functions) of AWC or AWA, so that an individual with poor response of ASEL has a poor function of AWC<sup>ON</sup>. Is this the case?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10181.045</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) AWB shows a nice odor-off response even in AWA-ablated animals. The source of this sensory stimulus is not known, one possibility being redundant inputs from AWA and AWC. Small but significant AWB response is also observed in the</italic> unc-13 <italic>mutant,</italic> unc-17 <italic>mutant and other manipulations. Given the status of the analysis and the characteristics of AWB as olfactory neurons, direct sensory input to AWB is not excluded and is in fact likely.

We have added some subsections to clarify this point by adding to our descriptions of the cell ablation results and the <italic>unc-13</italic> and AWA neuron-specific tetanus toxin expression results (subsections “Primary and Secondary Olfactory Neurons Encode Benzaldehyde Odor” and “AWC-released Neuropeptides and AWA-released Classical Neurotransmitters are Required for the Activity of ASEL and AWB Neurons, Respectively”). We have also revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2 and 4</xref> by drawing dotted arrows in our models to reflect this possibility.</p><p><italic>2) Also, AWA's role is enigmatic. Upon odor removal, at which time AWB is activated, AWA does not respond at all, or show only a small calcium increase. On the contrary, upon odor addition, AWA is largely activated but AWB is not activated, or a bit inhibited. Therefore a simple excitatory or inhibitory synapse from AWA to AWB does not explain the behavior of AWB neurons. This simple consideration leads to the question whether AWBs dependence on AWA is based on fast synaptic transmission. You show that the</italic> unc-17 <italic>mutant shows reduced response of AWB and this defect is rescued by</italic> unc-17 <italic>expression in AWA.</italic> cho-1 <italic>RNAi shows similar results. However, this does not necessarily mean AWB is activated upon odor removal by cholinergic neurotransmission from AWA. Equally possible explanations – which you should discuss in the text – are the modulatory effects of AWA-released acetylcholine (as muscarinic receptors function in other systems), by which AWB becomes more responsive to direct odor sensation. In the Abstract, you state: “Primary neurons, AWC</italic><sup><italic>ON</italic></sup> <italic>and AWA, directly detect the food odor benzaldehyde and release insulin-like peptides and acetylcholine, respectively, to activate secondary neurons, ASEL and AWB”. This clearly implicates that insulin and acetylcholine are released upon odor detection to activate ASEL and AWB. This is not supported because there is no release timing data presented for neither insulin nor acetylcholine (these data are generally difficult to obtain in</italic> C. elegans<italic>). You need to carefully rephrase these statements to something like “insulin-like peptide and acetylcholine released from AWC and AWA respectively are required for activity of secondary neurons”</italic>.</p><p>We rephrased our statements about the effects of primary olfactory neuron released insulin-like peptides and acetylcholine in the Abstract and in the section headings to better describe our results. We also expanded this discussion to describe possible modulatory effects of AWA-released acetylcholine to sensitize AWB responses to odor (please see Results section description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, we consider modulatory signaling through muscarinic acetylcholine receptors unlikely because we observed wild-type like AWB odor responses in our experiments examining mutations in the only three identified <italic>C. elegans</italic> muscarinic type receptors (<italic>gar-1, gar-2</italic> and <italic>gar-3</italic>).</p><p><italic>3) The quantification data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1"><italic>Figure 5–figure supplement 1</italic></xref> <italic>are persuasive in showing that only ASEL and AWB decline by age. However, you need to accurately describe the quantification method. In the Methods, you state: “To analyze off responses to the removal of stimulus, F0 was set to the time just prior to odor removal (t=121-129s)”. This is probably not what you did for the heat maps in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5E, F</italic></xref><italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B-E</italic></xref><italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7B-D</italic></xref><italic>, which show only the 120s-180s time points, and the dot plots in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1"><italic>Figure 5–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>. Instead, F0 seems to come from the average of t=1-9s for these analyses</italic>.</p><p>We made several changes to clarify our quantification methods. First, for all the truncated heat maps shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6 fig7">Figures 5-7</xref>, we changed the time labels (on the x-axis) to show 120-180s, which more accurately describes the part of the experiment depicted and allows us to refer to particular time windows in our imaging experiments in one consistent manner throughout the entire paper. (We note that we did not change the time labels for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, which shows 0-60s and includes the odor addition period in which AWA neurons are active.) Next, we revised our Materials and methods section text to clearly state the F0 used for each heat map or graph.

All time series traces of ASEL and AWB calcium levels, like those in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>show downward trends during odor exposure. If F0 is defined for 1-9s, all data quoted above might mean that aged ASEL and AWB are more sensitive to suppression by sustained odor exposure.

For the quantifications of young and aged ASEL and AWB odor responses, we have set F0 as the average fluorescence signal from 1s to 9s immediately prior to the stimulus removal (t=121-129s). For many cells, this quantification method reveals larger magnitude responses than the responses that would have been calculated if F0 were set to t=1-9s; however, we chose this method because it is more sensitive to small odor-evoked increases in the calcium signal. Crucially, we note that, considering only the odor responsive neurons, we did not observe any significant differences between in the magnitude of the odor-evoked suppression of young and aged animals (please see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Author response table 1</xref>).

The first describes the existence of a possible population code for some odors (that were originally thought to be sensed by single sensory neurons), and the second describes the effects of aging on this population coding mechanism, and how changes in this coding may underlie aging-dependent decline in chemotaxis abilities. However, neither story is sufficiently developed.</italic></p><p>We recognize the reviewer's concerns about the two stories in our manuscript. We have reorganized our manuscript to first describe the combinatorial coding strategy used by <italic>C. elegans</italic> chemosensory circuits and then discuss how this code is changed during the aging process.</p><p><italic>Essential questions:</italic></p><p><italic>If the model is that AWC and AWA represent parallel and non-redundant channels for BZ responses, and that in young animals, AWC and AWA in addition act via ASE and AWB, respectively, why does ASE ablation show as strong a chemotaxis defect as the AWC ablation (1G?). The model would predict that in an ASE-ablated strain, AWC should still be able to drive reasonably strong chemotaxis. This appears to be the case for the AWA/AWB channel, since AWB-ablated animals show a weaker defect than AWA-ablated animals.</italic></p><p>The reviewer is correct in identifying the two parallel channels (AWC-ASE and AWA-AWB) for benzaldehyde responses. There is a difference in signaling between these two channels in that AWA might signal through multiple downstream cells including AWB, while AWC might have fewer downstream targets including ASE. It is therefore not surprising that ASE (-) animals have a similar phenotype as AWC (-) animals.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>: The authors assert that AWC is a primary BZ sensor based on the fact that their responses are unaffected in</italic> unc-13 <italic>and</italic> unc-31 <italic>mutants. There does appear to be a significant defect in the BZ response in</italic> unc-13 <italic>mutants though (2A). Also, the responses in</italic> unc-31 <italic>mutants are extremely variable. For AWA, the authors can't rule out gap junctions, so their conclusion that AWA is a primary BZ sensor should be tempered. For the rescue experiments (2C, 2D), all of them are quite weak rescue – what is the reason for that? The supplemental data show that ASEL responses are significantly affected in</italic> unc-13 <italic>mutants as well but that is not addressed. Finally, it would be useful to see some negative controls here. Easy ones to try are AWA rescue for ASE, and AWC rescue for AWB.</italic></p><p>We have added an independent method to confirm the primary and secondary neurons in the benzaldehyde circuit. We combined cell ablations with calcium imaging, predicting that primary neuron responses would not be affected by the ablation of other sensory cells, while secondary neuron responses would be greatly reduced when primary neurons are ablated. These experiments confirm that AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWA are primary neurons, while ASEL and AWB are secondary neurons. These results are also consistent with our genetic experiments. Moreover, we have re-analyzed our data and find that ASEL responses in <italic>unc-13</italic> mutants are not significantly different from those in WT animals (p = 0.098 two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test). (In this analysis and all the experiments in the paper we have now excluded traces in which an averaged ΔF/F of greater than 600% was recorded after the stimulus change. Such traces account for less than 1% of the traces collected and are likely to be artifacts of animal movement causing the cell to move out of the focal plane etc.) The reviewer is correct in identifying that AWC<sup>OFF</sup> neuron is not a primary neuron for benzaldehyde as its odor responses are significantly reduced in <italic>unc-13</italic> mutants. We have edited our revised version to reflect that.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>: The authors show that</italic> ins-1 <italic>may be the relevant neuropeptide from AWC that regulates ASE responses to BZ.

So, the authors need to demonstrate that expression from other neurons do not rescue, or perform RNAi in AWC alone.

We have analyzed the neural code of an aversive concentration of benzaldehyde and find that it is not changed in older animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplement 3</xref>). We suggest that the neural code for volatile attractants might be more susceptible to the deleterious effects of aging when compared to the neural code for repellents under these assay conditions. Broadly speaking, we do agree with the reviewer that the aging-associated change in the combinatorial code is likely to influence the neural circuit at the level of downstream interneurons.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p><italic>In the subsection “Insulin Peptidergic and Cholinergic Transmission from Primary Olfactory Sensory Neurons Activates Secondary Olfactory Neurons”</italic>: <italic>conceptually, if INS-1 is an antagonist how is it used to depolarize ASE?</italic></p><p>We are not sure how or if INS-1 depolarizes ASE neurons.

Also, the cartoon,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref> <italic>middle, clearly implies that INS-1 acts as a classical neurotransmitter. This is also not supported by the results presented</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer and do not have a direct method to show that AWC released INS-1 activates ASE. We have included additional data showing that AWC neuron specific knockdown of <italic>ins-1</italic> impairs ASE odor responses, while AWA-neuron specific rescue of <italic>ins-1</italic> fails to rescue the mutant odor responses. Additionally, we agree with the reviewer that the canonical effects of the DAF-2/AGE-1 pathway regulate transcription and gene expression (described by Murphy CT et al. and others) and we cannot rule out that this leads to a chronic action of INS-1 to modulate the molecular machinery of the ASEL neuron. However, we speculate that alternate pathways downstream of INS-1/DAF-2 could also exist to rapidly modulate neuronal activity. These alternate pathways may be homologous to the rapid effect of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to increase calcium channel currents within seconds to alter neuronal activity (dependent on receptor tyrosine kinase and PI3-Kinase signaling) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blair and Marshall 1997</xref>, Selinfreund and Blair 1994). In this way, the increase in calcium in ASEL might result from rapid signaling downstream of INS-1, DAF-2 and PI3-Kinase acting directly on calcium channels. Because this is speculative, we have edited our manuscript to say that simply “AWC released INS-1 recruits ASE into the benzaldehyde circuit”. We have also changed our cartoons throughout the paper.</p><p><italic>2) AWA is activated upon addition of bz and AWB is activated upon removal of bz (at the medium concentration). If one assumes that AWB is activated by a direct input from AWA neurons (through acetylcholine), the input ought to be an inhibitory input.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref> <italic>right, shows the opposite. Along with the above argument, it is more appropriate to omit Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>in ASEL and AWB in the cartoon</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer and changed our cartoon to reflect this concern.</p><p><italic>3) The authors often call AWC</italic><sup><italic>ON</italic></sup> <italic>and AWC</italic><sup><italic>OFF</italic></sup> <italic>together as AWC and ASEL and ASER as ASE. However, as stated by the authors in the manuscript these two pairs of neurons are molecularly and functionally different. The authors focused their exploration on AWC</italic><sup><italic>ON</italic></sup> <italic>and ASEL and left out characterization of ASER and AWC</italic><sup><italic>OFF</italic></sup><italic>. Therefore they should be careful in there descriptions. For example, Figure 2–figure supplement 1A shows that calcium response of AWC</italic><sup><italic>OFF</italic></sup> <italic>is significantly compromised in the</italic> unc-13 <italic>mutant even if one looks only at the initial increase in the calcium level. Therefore AWC</italic><sup><italic>OFF</italic></sup> <italic>is categorized as secondary olfactory neuron for bz, while the authors state “two pairs of primary sensory neurons (AWC and AWA)”. This is inappropriate</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer and have edited our manuscript. We find that AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWA are primary neurons, while ASEL and AWB are secondary neurons.</p><p><italic>4) In the subsection “Attractive Odor-evoked Activity of Seconardy Neurons Specifically Decays with Aging: “the calcium transient of odor-responsive aged ASEL and AWB neurons were indistinguishable from responses in younger animals”. I actually do not see this. If we leave out non-responsive animals, by manual inspection, overall response of ASEL looks higher and that of AWB looks lower. The authors need to quantify the magnitude of response of “responding” neurons. This is important because the authors claim that variability of neuronal responses increases by age. This is true if the magnitude of the calcium response of “responding” neurons in old animals is equal or higher than young animals, because there are more “non-responsive” animals, while if response of responding neurons are lower in old animals than in young animals, this simply means an overall decline of neuronal response</italic>.</p><p>We have included additional data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref> quantifying the neuronal responses.

For the animals with odor-responsive AWB neurons, the average size of the AWB response and the peak response are unchanged by aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>).

The former indicate that the sensory responses of ASEL and AWB are correlated with chemotaxis performance, while the latter indicates that the presence of ASEL or AWB neurons are irrelevant to chemotaxis performance in aged animals. One possible explanation to solve this contradiction would be that responsiveness of ASEL and AWB is correlated with responsiveness (or other functions) of AWC or AWA, so that an individual with poor response of ASEL has a poor function of AWC</italic><sup><italic>ON</italic></sup><italic>. Is this the case?</italic></p><p>We find that AWC<sup>ON</sup> responses are reliable in aged animals, while ASEL responses are reduced and unreliable (quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). We do see a correlation with chemotaxis performance and odor responsiveness of secondary neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">figure supplement 2</xref>). We show that the improved chemotaxis performance observed in animals with increased neurotransmission from primary neurons requires functional secondary neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figure 6G and 7F</xref>). Together these results show that the secondary neurons play a crucial role in aged animal chemotaxis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
