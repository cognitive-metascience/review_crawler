shock response typically invoke a negative feedback loop consisting of the transcriptional activator Hsf1 and a molecular chaperone. Previously we identified Hsp70 as the chaperone responsible for Hsf1 repression and constructed a mathematical model that recapitulated the yeast heat shock response (Zheng et al., 2016). The model was based on two assumptions: dissociation of Hsp70 activates Hsf1, and transcriptional induction of Hsp70 deactivates Hsf1. Here we validate these assumptions. First, we severed the feedback loop by uncoupling Hsp70 expression from Hsf1 regulation. As predicted by the model, Hsf1 was unable to efficiently deactivate in the absence of Hsp70 transcriptional induction. Next, we mapped a discrete Hsp70 binding site on Hsf1 to a C-terminal segment known as conserved element 2 (CE2). In vitro, CE2 binds to Hsp70 with low affinity (9 µM), in agreement with model requirements. In cells, removal of CE2 resulted in increased basal Hsf1 activity and delayed deactivation during heat shock, while tandem repeats of CE2 sped up Hsf1 deactivation. Finally, we uncovered a role for the N-terminal domain of Hsf1 in negatively regulating DNA binding. These results reveal the quantitative control mechanisms underlying the heat shock response.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hsf1</kwd><kwd>Hsp70</kwd><kwd>heat shock</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP5 OD017941-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pincus</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1350949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Khalil</surname><given-names>Ahmad S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1518345</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gross</surname><given-names>David S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dynamic regulation of the heat shock response depends on a negative feedback loop in which Hsf1 activates expression of Hsp70 and Hsp70 specifically and directly represses Hsf1 transactivation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The heat shock response is a transcriptional program conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to humans in which genes encoding molecular chaperones and other components of the protein homeostasis (proteostasis) machinery are activated to counteract proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anckar and Sistonen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Richter et al., 2010</xref>). The master transcriptional regulator of the heat shock response, Heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1), binds as a trimer to its cognate DNA motif – the heat shock element (HSE) – in the promoters and enhancers of its target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gross et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hentze et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sorger and Nelson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xiao et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>In yeast, Hsf1 is essential under all conditions because it is required to drive the high level of basal chaperone expression needed to sustain growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">McDaniel et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Solís et al., 2016</xref>). Mammalian Hsf1 is dispensable under non-heat shock conditions because it exclusively controls stress-inducible expression of its target regulon, while high-level basal chaperone expression is Hsf1-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mahat et al., 2016</xref>). Hsf1 has been shown to play pro-cancer roles both in tumor cells and the supporting stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Santagata et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Scherz-Shouval et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to supplying high levels of chaperones to cancer cells, Hsf1 takes on specialized transcriptional roles to support malignant growth, and its activity is associated with poor prognosis in a range of human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mendillo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Santagata et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Scherz-Shouval et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, lack of Hsf1 activity has been proposed to contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases associated with protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gomez-Pastor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Neef et al., 2011</xref>). Despite the potential therapeutic benefits of modulating Hsf1 activity, a quantitative description of the regulatory mechanisms that control its activity in any cell type remains lacking.</p><p>Phosphorylation, SUMOylation, acetylation, chaperone binding (Hsp40, Hsp70, Hsp90 and/or TRiC/CCT), intrinsic thermosensing and an RNA aptamer have all been suggested to regulate Hsf1 in various model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anckar and Sistonen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baler et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cotto et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hentze et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hietakangas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Holmberg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kline and Morimoto, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Neef et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shamovsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Westerheide et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xia et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhong et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zou et al., 1998</xref>). These diverse mechanisms can operate on Hsf1 by impinging on a number of steps required for activation including nuclear localization, trimerization, DNA binding and recruitment of the transcriptional machinery. Our recent work in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> demonstrated that binding and dissociation of the chaperone Hsp70 is the primary ON/OFF switch for Hsf1, while phosphorylation is dispensable for activation but serves to amplify the transcriptional output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Based on these results, we generated a mathematical model of the yeast heat shock response. Given that we observed heat shock-dependent dissociation of Hsp70 from Hsf1, and that the genes encoding Hsp70 are major targets of Hsf1, we centered the model on a simple feedback loop in which Hsf1 activates expression of Hsp70, which in turn represses Hsf1 activity. While the model was able to recapitulate experimental data of Hsf1 activity during heat shock and correctly predicted the outcome of defined perturbations, its two central tenets remain untested: (1) Hsp70 directly binds to Hsf1 at a specific regulatory site; (2) Transcriptional induction of Hsp70 provides negative feedback required to deactivate Hsf1. Here, we provide direct evidence supporting these core model assumptions by severing the transcriptional feedback loop, rendering Hsf1 unable to deactivate, and mapping a direct Hsp70 binding site on Hsf1 through which Hsp70 represses its potent C-terminal transactivation domain. These results suggest that the heat shock response circuitry in this model system can be abstracted to a simple two-component feedback loop.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hsp70-mediated negative feedback is required to deactivate Hsf1</title><p>Our model of the heat shock response is centered on a feedback loop in which Hsf1 regulates expression of its negative modulator, Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). When the temperature is raised, the concentration of unfolded proteins exceeds the capacity of Hsp70. Hsp70 is titrated away from Hsf1, freeing Hsf1 to induce more Hsp70. Once sufficient Hsp70 has been produced to restore proteostasis, Hsp70 binds and deactivates Hsf1. In addition to producing more Hsp70, Hsf1 also induces expression of an inert YFP reporter that can be used as a proxy for Hsf1 activity. In the yeast strains used here, this YFP reporter is integrated into the genome under the control of a promoter containing four repeats of the heat shock <italic>cis</italic>-element (4xHSE) recognized by Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31668.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transcriptional induction of Hsp70 during heat shock is required for Hsf1 deactivation but not proteostasis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The Hsf1 regulatory circuit described by the mathematical model.

We cut the feedback loop in the mathematical model by removing the equation relating the production of Hsp70 to the concentration of free Hsf1 without changing any parameters or initial conditions. In the absence of Hsf1-dependent transcription of Hsp70, the model predicted that the HSE-YFP reporter should be activated with the same kinetics as that of the wild type, but should continue to accumulate long after the response is attenuated in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>To experimentally test this in yeast cells, we decoupled expression of all four cytosolic Hsp70 paralogs (<italic>SSA1/2/3/4</italic>) from Hsf1 regulation while maintaining the expression of total Hsp70 near its endogenous levels under non-heat shock conditions. This was achieved by integrating two copies of <italic>SSA2</italic> under the control of the Hsf1-independent <italic>TEF1</italic> promoter into the genome and deleting <italic>ssa1/2/3/4</italic>. We named this strain ∆FBL to denote that we had removed the feedback loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As expected, wild type cells were able to increase Hsp70 levels during heat shock. By contrast, ∆FBL cells were unable to induce Hsp70 during heat shock, though the Hsp70 level was constitutively elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We performed a heat shock time course in WT and ∆FBL cells and compared the expression of the HSE-YFP reporter by flow cytometry. As predicted by the simulation, the ∆FBL strain activated the reporter with identical kinetics to the wild type during the early phase of the response, but failed to attenuate induction during prolonged exposure to elevated temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). While the simulation correctly predicted the experimental results qualitatively, the model underestimated the amount of time required to observe the separation between the wild type and ∆FBL strains, suggesting the strength of the feedback had been exaggerated in the first iteration of the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). By reducing the strength of the feedback loop, we were able to quantitatively match the behavior of both the wild type and ∆FBL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, see Materials and methods for the updated parameter value).</p><p>The inability of Hsf1 to deactivate in the ∆FBL strain could result either from a specific disruption of the ‘OFF switch’ or from a general failure of the cells to restore proteostasis. In other words, does cutting the feedback loop simply result in sustained stress, or is the prolonged Hsf1 activity the result of specifically breaking its deactivation mechanism? To distinguish these possibilities, we first compared growth of wild type, ∆FBL and <italic>ssa1/2∆</italic> cells at 30°C and 37°C. The <italic>ssa1/2∆</italic> cells – which retain viability due to Hsf1-mediated induction of <italic>SSA3/4</italic> – displayed severely impaired growth at 30°C and were inviable at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). By contrast, the wild type and ∆FBL strains grew equally at 30°C, and the ∆FBL strain showed only a slight reduction in growth at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Surprisingly, removal of both <italic>SSA3</italic> and <italic>SSA4</italic> – the major heat shock-inducible Hsp70 genes in yeast – had only modest phenotypic consequences at elevated temperature. The reduced growth of the ∆FBL mutant at 37°C could be a consequence of either an inadequate or overzealous heat shock response, and does not necessarily indicate a general failure to restore proteostasis. To directly monitor the loss and restoration of proteostasis, we imaged wild type and ∆FBL cells expressing Hsp104-mKate over a heat shock time course. Hsp104 is a disaggregase that forms puncta marking protein aggregates when tagged with a fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Solís et al., 2016</xref>). Upon acute heat shock, the number of Hsp104-mKate foci spiked in both wild type and ∆FBL cells, but dissolved with the same kinetics in both strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). These data suggest that the ∆FBL cells can restore proteostasis just as efficiently as wild type cells and that the prolonged Hsf1 activation in the ∆FBL cells is due to a spdeactivation defect. Since Hsp104 requires Hsp70 for efficient activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Seyffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Winkler et al., 2012</xref>), there must be sufficient Hsp70 expressed under basal conditions to allow Hsp104 to operate. While Hsp104 may not recognize all classes of unfolded proteins and aggregates, these results suggest that the transcriptional negative feedback loop is required to deactivate Hsf1 once proteostasis has been restored.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Scanning mutagenesis reveals three independent repressive segments in Hsf1</title><p>In addition to positioning the transcriptional feedback loop as the core regulatory circuit that controls Hsf1 activity, the model also posits that Hsp70 binding is the mechanism that represses Hsf1. If this assumption were true, then disrupting the binding interaction should increase Hsf1 activity under non-heat shock conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To test this, we generated a series of 48 Hsf1 mutants in which we systematically removed 12 amino acid segments along the nonessential N- and C-terminal regions of Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We integrated these mutants into the genome as the only copy of <italic>HSF1</italic> in a strain background bearing the HSE-YFP reporter and assayed for activity by measuring YFP levels under non-heat shock and heat shock conditions by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). To benchmark the assays, we used wild type Hsf1 and mutants lacking the entire N- and C-terminal regions.

While we uncovered more biological complexity in Hsf1 regulation than we represent in the model, we validated the model’s central tenets – that Hsp70 binding and dissociation turn Hsf1 off and on, and that transcriptional induction of Hsp70 represents a critical negative feedback loop required for the homeostatic regulation of Hsf1. Moreover, we found the model to be remarkably powerful in its ability to predict the dynamics of Hsf1 activity when challenged with targeted perturbations to the system architecture despite its oversimplified structure. These results argue that conceptualizing the heat shock response as a two-component feedback loop – in which Hsf1 positively regulates Hsp70 expression and Hsp70 negatively regulates Hsf1 activity – is an appropriate abstraction that captures the essence of the regulatory network. Whether this simplifying abstraction can be applied to HSF1 regulation in metazoans remains to be determined.</p><p>At a more mechanistic level, our screen for functional determinants in the N- and C-terminal regions of Hsf1 revealed three distinct segments in Hsf1 that independently exert negative regulation. The two N-terminal segments contribute to hitherto unknown repression of Hsf1 DNA binding, while the single C-terminal segment, CE2, is a binding site for Hsp70 through which Hsp70 represses Hsf1 transactivation. Although, as its name suggests, CE2 is conserved, it is restricted to a subset of yeast species and is absent in mammalian HSF1 sequences. Its amino acid composition, consisting of hydrophobic and basic residues, is reminiscent of peptide sequences known to bind to Hsp70 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Van Durme et al., 2009</xref>), though the affinity we measured (9 µM) is relatively weak. Given the stoichiometry of Hsp70:Hsf1 in cells (&gt;500:1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>) this weak affinity is likely necessary to allow for stress-dependent dissociation of the complex and has been a constant requirement of our mathematical model since its inception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, while CE2 is not conserved in mammalian genomes in primary sequence, it would seem facile to evolve a distinct but functionally analogous hydrophobic and basic segment to allow for weak Hsp70 binding. Notably, even though we found no evidence that the N1 segment is an additional Hsp70 binding site on endogenous Hsf1, its sequence is also predicted to be an Hsp70 binding site and is capable of binding to Hsp70 when overexpressed (S. Peffer and K. Morano, personal communication).</p><p>In addition to mechanistic insight into Hsp70 binding, our results for the first time reveal the existence of intramolecular determinants that negatively regulate Hsf1 DNA binding. While removal of the N-terminal region of Hsf1 leads to increased activity, at least in certain genomic contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sorger, 1990</xref>) – suggesting that this region is repressive – the N-terminus also has a transactivation function and is important for efficient recruitment of Mediator during heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim and Gross, 2013</xref>). Here we show that removal of the full N-terminal region results in increased association with select target gene promoters under non-heat shock conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating a context-dependent role for this yeast-specific region in regulating DNA binding and suggesting a mechanistic basis for the increased transcriptional activity of Hsf1<sup>∆N</sup> relative to wild type Hsf1. In particular, the N1/N2 segments suppress DNA binding at the synthetic <italic>4xHSE</italic> promoter, as Hsf1<sup>∆N/∆N2</sup> displayed increased association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). If N1 were a bona fide second Hsp70 binding site (S. Peffer and K. Morano, personal communication), then this observation suggests that Hsp70 regulates both Hsf1 DNA binding and transactivation. Alternatively, if the N1/N2 segments impede DNA binding independent of Hsp70, then an additional heat shock-dependent mechanism would be required to relieve this block. Perhaps, by analogy to the intrinsic ability of human HSF1 to trimerize and bind DNA at elevated temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hentze et al., 2016</xref>), the N1/N2 segments could contribute to direct thermosensing by mediating a temperature-dependent conformational change that increases DNA binding ability. Under either scenario, it is possible that the effect is indirect, and that deletion of N1/N2 results in the unmasking of the C-terminal activation domain.</p><p>Putting our observations together, we propose that Hsf1 can exist in one of four states in the yeast nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>):</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31668.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Thermodynamic representation of the four state model of Hsf1 activity.</title><p>State 1: C-terminal activation domain (CTA) closed/DBD unbound Hsp70 is bound to CE2 keeping the CTA closed; the N-terminal region is engaged in blocking the DBD from accessing available HSEs via the N1/N2 segments.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Hsf1 and Hsp70 constitute a two-component feedback loop that regulates the yeast heat shock response&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Peter M Douglas (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers and the Reviewing Editor have drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Here the authors have followed up their 2016 <italic>eLife</italic> paper where they reported that Hsp70/Ssa1-4 chaperone binding to the Hsf1 transcription factor was the main mechanism of negative regulation of Hsf1 in yeast, and that competition of Hsp70 away from Hsf1 in response to increased levels of unfolded protein induced by heat shock was the primary mechanism of activation of heat shock-induced Hsf1 target gene transcription. They also showed that the extensive phosphorylation of Hsf1 observed upon heat shock was dispensable for Hsf1 activation, but instead played a role in amplifying the Hsf1 transcriptional output. On this basis, they proposed that Hsf1 activity was regulated by two feedback loops – normally Hsp70 is in excess and can sequester Hsf1 by direct binding; following heat shock Hsf1 is released, and, among other target genes, drives expression of Hsp70, which then re-sequesters Hsf1 shutting off the response.</p><p>In this paper they tested their model in two ways. First, they engineered a yeast strain in which the four Ssa/Hsp70 genes were deleted and replaced by two copies of Ssa2 driven by a constitutive promoter, and showed that in this strain heat shock induced expression of an Hsf1-driven YFP gene with similar kinetics to WT, but that YFP expression was not shut off as heat shock persisted. Second, they showed that Hsp70 was able to bind to Hsf1 directly, and mapped the major binding site to a conserved element CE2 in the C-terminal tail of Hsf1.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and concur that this is a nice follow up to their prior paper, and is in principle appropriate for a Research Advance. However, although the data provide support for the model that the authors proposed in their earlier paper, the reviewers had a number of concerns that need to be addressed before publication</p><p>Essential points that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) The authors claim to have identified the binding site of Hsp70 on Hsf1. However, although their results indicate that CE2 is necessary for Hsp70 binding to Hsf1, they do not show that the CE2 motif is sufficient. For example, CE2 could influence the conformation of Hsf1 to expose an Hsp70 binding site that is located somewhere else, e.g. at the very C-terminal end of Hsf1, which also influenced the Hsf1 reporter activity. They should use a peptide-binding assay to demonstrate that this Hsf1 segment can be directly bound by Hsp70, and determine the Kd for binding this segment, and compare this value with the Kd of the Hsp70-Hsf1 complex used in their simulation. The authors should also create point mutations in this segment predicted to decrease the affinity of Hsp70 for Hsf1 more gradually, like replacing large hydrophobic residues (Leu or Tyr) for alanine or serine, or introducing negative charge in the CE2 region. These mutations should lead to predictable changes in the heat shock response that the authors could compare with simulations in their model.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>: It would be good to include (e.g. in the supplement) a chemical equation representation of the model with each arrow labeled with the appropriate parameter and indicating which parameters were changed in comparison to the previous version of the model. Although the model is described in the earlier published paper, the model is essential for the reader to understand this paper and inclusion of the model would facilitate understanding the study without continuous reference to the previous paper. Also, the authors mention that the original parameters did not represent their data correctly and that they had to change some parameters. It would be interesting to show a comparison of the simulation results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> with the previous and the new parameter values side by side.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>: The key to the interpretation of the results is accurate quantification of the levels of Ssa/Hsp70 in the cells under different conditions. The authors used Pgk1 levels to normalize Ssa1/2 levels, but because its levels were increased in heat-shocked cells, Pgk1 cannot be used as a reliable loading control for quantification of Ssa1/2, and the authors need to use another protein whose levels do not change upon heat shock for quantification. In this regard, the quantification data need error bars, and significance analysis should be performed. Accurate Ssa/Hsp70 quantification is a critical issue, because as it stands the level of Ssa1/2 was apparently higher in the constitutive ΔFBL cells than in WT cells in the absence of heat shock (it is estimated as 1.6 fold higher). If this is the case and the sequestration model is correct, one might have expected the Hsf1-driven YFP response upon heat shock to be somewhat delayed in the constitutive strain. In addition, the Ssa2/Hsp70 level after heat shock induction in the WT strain was apparently not that much higher than in the constitutive strain without heat shock and yet this sufficient to shut off YFP expression – this raises the issue of whether the level of Hsf1, which was not measured, was the same in these two strains.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: In the ChIP analysis, the ΔN1/ΔN2/ΔCE2 Hsf1 pulled down less HSE promoter DNA than the ΔN1/ΔN2 Hsf1 variant. According to the authors the N1 and the N2 region repress DNA binding in an Hsp70 independent manner, while CE2 contains the Hsp70 binding site for downregulation of the HSR. Why then does additional deletion of the Hsp70 binding site, i.e. prevention of Hsp70 binding, reduce DNA binding of the ∆N1/∆N2 Hsf1? Does Hsp70 association with to Hsf1 increase DNA binding? The ChIP data for those mutants are not consistent with the HSE-YFP reporter assay. With respect to DNA binding, the N1/N2 and CE2 elements seem to counteract each other, while with respect to Hsf1 transcriptional activity N1/N2 and CE2 act synergistically. Also, N1/N2 only affected the binding to the artificial 4xHSE promoter but not to any of the other promoters tested, and CE2 does not affect binding to any of the promoters in the context of the wild type Hsf1 protein. The question is whether either one of these elements affects expression of a reporter from a natural promoter. The authors should test their deletion variants using a reporter construct with a natural promoter like the Hsp82 and SSA4 promoters. In this regard, the fact that the ΔCE2 mutants resulted in direct upregulation of HSE-YFP activation, disagrees with previous work with <italic>C. albicans</italic> showing that CE2 is required for full expression of HSE genes (Nicholls et al., 2011), and this needs an explanation. In addition, the authors also fail to explain why individual deletions in the C-terminus cause increased YFP (but none caused decreased), while deleting the entire C-terminus results in a reduction in YFP.</p><p>5) Finally, it is not clear that this feedback mechanism applies to anything other than yeasts, since the CE2 element does not appear to be conserved in human HSF1, and this point merits at least some discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31668.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential points that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) The authors claim to have identified the binding site of Hsp70 on Hsf1.

As a control, we used a mutant CE2 peptide in which we replaced three basic residues with acidic residues (ce2-mut). We found the Kd of the Hsp70-CE2 complex to be 9 µM, a low but measurable affinity in line with the predictions of the mathematical model. The Hsp70-ce2mut complex had a Kd of 52 µM, indicating that the basic residues are important determinants of affinity and consistent with known Hsp70 binding preferences. In addition to this in vitro assay, we utilized the “decoy” assay we developed previously to show that appending the CE2 onto an inert mKate scaffold is sufficient to activate Hsf1 in trans in cells, with very strong activation if we increase the valency by appending two or three CE2 peptides.

Hsf1 does not change its level in the ∆FBL strain, though there is more Ssa1/2 under non-heat shock conditions. The ratios displayed are the average of two biological replicates. The point of the ∆FBL strain is that Hsp70 cannot be induced by heat shock, and this is clearly shown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: In the ChIP analysis, the ΔN1/ΔN2/ΔCE2 Hsf1 pulled down less HSE promoter DNA than the ΔN1/ΔN2 Hsf1 variant.

This suggests that these segments operate additively and independently. In the HSE-YFP assay, ∆N1/∆N2 increased activity, as did ∆CE2, and the ∆N1/∆N2/∆CE2 again was the sum of these two activities. There is no inconsistency here: in both the ChIP and HSE-YFP assays, the mutations are additive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, N1/N2 only affected the binding to the artificial 4xHSE promoter but not to any of the other promoters tested, and CE2 does not affect binding to any of the promoters in the context of the wild type Hsf1 protein.

We used a probe that recognizes all four <italic>SSA</italic> transcripts. The expression levels were consistent with the reporter output, with the exception of the ∆C mutant (which is very hypoactive and quite sick). We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that the binding sites for the general stress response transcription factors Msn2/4 (STREs) in several of the <italic>SSA</italic> promoters, and the ∆C mutant likely has induced the general stress response to compensate for diminished Hsf1 activity. We included this northern blot in our revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this regard, the fact that the ΔCE2 mutants resulted in direct upregulation of HSE-YFP activation, disagrees with previous work with C. albicans showing that CE2 is required for full expression of HSE genes (Nicholls et al., 2011), and this needs an explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>From our reading of the Nicholls et al. paper, they do not show the effect of target gene induction in the <italic>C. albicans</italic> ∆CE2 mutant at all. Rather, this is shown for the CE2t mutant, a truncation that includes removal of CE2 and the rest of the C-terminus. This CE2t mutant is more analogous to the ∆C mutant that we use here. They do show that the ∆CE2 mutant has a modest effect on growth at 37ºC, but this is just as likely to be due to hyperactivation as hypoactivation. We have now cited this paper, but there is no discrepancy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the authors also fail to explain why individual deletions in the C-terminus cause increased YFP (but none caused decreased), while deleting the entire C-terminus results in a reduction in YFP.</p></disp-quote><p>We suspect that we failed to identify a single segment required for activation due to the nature of how the Hsf1 transcriptional activation domain works. The C-terminus is a ~400 amino acid intrinsically disordered region (IDR) that is required for heat shock-inducible transcriptional activity. It is likely that the association of multiple IDRs in Hsf1 trimers or higher order oligomers into subnuclear condensates is what recruits the transcriptional machinery and drives gene activation. Thus, deletion of any 12 aa segment is unlikely to disrupt the multi-valent IDR interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Finally, it is not clear that this feedback mechanism applies to anything other than yeasts, since the CE2 element does not appear to be conserved in human HSF1, and this point merits at least some discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded this part of the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
