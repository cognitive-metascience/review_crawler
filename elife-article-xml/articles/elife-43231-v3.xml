Mutation of BEST1 causes retinal disease. Partly because bestrophin channels have no sequence or structural similarity to other ion channels, the molecular mechanisms underlying gating are unknown. Here, we present a series of cryo-electron microscopy structures of chicken BEST1, determined at 3.1 Å resolution or better, that represent the channel’s principal gating states. Unlike other channels, opening of the pore is due to the repositioning of tethered pore-lining helices within a surrounding protein shell that dramatically widens a neck of the pore through a concertina of amino acid rearrangements. The neck serves as both the activation and the inactivation gate. Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding instigates opening of the neck through allosteric means whereas inactivation peptide binding induces closing. An aperture within the otherwise wide pore controls anion permeability. The studies define a new molecular paradigm for gating among ligand-gated ion channels.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ion channels</kwd><kwd>allosteric mechanisms</kwd><kwd>gating</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>calcium-activated chloride channels</kwd><kwd>anion channel</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM110396</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Long</surname><given-names>Stephen B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA008748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Long</surname><given-names>Stephen B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-EM structures of the gating cycle of bestrophin reveal the molecular underpinnings of activation and inactivation gating in this calcium-activated chloride channel and reveal a surprisingly wide pore.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The family of bestrophin proteins (BEST1-4) was identified by linkage analysis to hereditary macular degenerations caused by mutations in BEST1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Petrukhin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Marquardt et al., 1998</xref>). To date more than 200 mutations in BEST1 are linked with eye disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xiao et al., 2010</xref>). BEST1-4 proteins are expressed in the plasma membrane and form Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels by assembling as pentamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hartzell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kane Dickson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vaisey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sun et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tsunenari et al., 2006</xref>). Data indicate that BEST1 mediates a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> current that is integral to human retinal pigment epithelial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The broad tissue distribution of the family suggests additional physiological functions that are not fully realized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hartzell et al., 2008</xref>), and these may include processes as diverse as cell volume regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fischmeister and Hartzell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Milenkovic et al., 2015</xref>), pH homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yu et al., 2010</xref>), and neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lee et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>An X-ray structure of chicken BEST1, which shares 74% sequence identity with human BEST1 and possesses analogous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activation and anion-selectivity properties, revealed an architecture that is distinct from other ion channel families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kane Dickson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vaisey et al., 2016</xref>). The channel comprises five BEST1 subunits arranged symmetrically around a central ion pore that is ~95 Å long. The diameter of the pore varies along its length and contains two constrictions, the ‘neck’ and the ‘aperture’, both of which are lined by hydrophobic amino acids. The X-ray structure of a bestrophin channel from the prokaryotic organism <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (KpBest) revealed a similar architecture, including analogous neck and aperture regions, in spite of minimal (14%) sequence identity to human BEST1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Surprisingly, however, whereas metazoan bestrophin channels are anion-selective and activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, KpBest is cation-selective and does not contain the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor region (the ‘Ca<sup>2+</sup> clasp’) that is conserved amongst metazoan organisms.</p><p>From electrophysiological studies of purified chicken BEST1 and of mutants inspired by the structure, it was deduced that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activation of the channel is due to the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions to the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> clasps, of which there are five owing to the pentameric architecture, and to subsequent conformational changes in the neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vaisey et al., 2016</xref>). These experiments made it clear that the neck forms the activation gate that opens in response to the binding of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. Perplexingly, however, even though the Ca<sup>2+</sup> clasps were occupied by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions in the X-ray structure, the conformation of the neck was too narrow to allow hydrated ions to pass. We initially postulated that phenylalanine residues within the neck (F80 and F84) might coordinate permeating anions via anion-quadropole interactions (also referred to as anion-π interactions) and thereby stabilize dehydrated anions as they passed though a narrow neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kane Dickson et al., 2014</xref>). However, we found that mutation of these residues to alanine had no effect on the ion selectivity properties of the channel, which made it seem unlikely that permeation through the neck was facilitated by anion-quadropole interactions in the wild type channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vaisey et al., 2016</xref>). Further, molecular simulation studies suggested that the conformation of the neck observed in the X-ray structure would form a significant energetic barrier that would likely prevent ion permeation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rao et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, it was not clear what conformation the X-ray structure represented or how anions might be able to pass through the neck.</p><p>Our recent electrophysiological studies using purified chicken BEST1 in synthetic bilayers show that, like many ion channels, BEST1 undergoes inactivation wherein ionic currents through BEST1 decrease over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vaisey and Long, 2018</xref>). We now realize that the ‘current rundown’ previously observed for mammalian bestrophin channels is due to channel inactivation and that channel inactivation is an inherent property of bestrophin channels and not due to other cellular factors. Inactivation is stimulated by high (&gt;500 nM) concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and is caused by the binding of a C-terminal ‘inactivation peptide’, contained within amino acids 346–367, to a receptor on the channel’s cytosolic surface that is located near the Ca<sup>2+</sup> clasp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vaisey and Long, 2018</xref>). Inactivation can be substantially diminished by mutation of the receptor site or mutation of the inactivation peptide, and it can be prevented altogether by removal of the inactivation peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vaisey and Long, 2018</xref>). From these and other mutagenesis studies it was additionally concluded that the neck functions as the inactivation gate that prevents ion flow in the inactivated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vaisey and Long, 2018</xref>). These results began to suggest that the X-ray structure might represent an inactivated conformation of the channel.</p><p>The X-ray structure of BEST1 was determined in complex with an antibody (denoted 10D10) to facilitate crystallization. Electrophysiological analyses of the antibody’s effect on BEST1 currents recorded using purified channels that were reconstituted into lipid bilayers indicate that it stimulates inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vaisey and Long, 2018</xref>), providing further evidence that the X-ray structure represents an inactivated state of the channel. Thus, because the inactivation peptide is bound to its receptor in the X-ray structure and because the antibody used for co-crystallization stimulates inactivation, we suspect that the X-ray structure represents an inactivated state in which the neck is too narrow to allow ions to flow through it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kane Dickson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vaisey and Long, 2018</xref>). The aforementioned studies suggest that the neck must widen to allow ion flow, but the extent of this widening and the conformational changes that underlie it are not clear. For example, minor movements of the side chain residues lining the neck might be sufficient for ion conduction, or opening might involve more dramatic rearrangements. Another unanswered question is how Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding controls the neck. It is also unclear what conformation the channel might adopt when the Ca<sup>2+</sup> clasps are emptied of their Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. To address these questions we determined a series of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of chicken BEST1 with and without Ca<sup>2+</sup> in activated, deactivated, and inactivated states that represent the major gating transitions of the channel. We find that ion conduction is permitted by dramatic widening of the neck and by correspondingly dramatic conformational changes in the protein. The conformational changes are more akin to localized protein refolding rather than the twisting or domain movement changes that typically underlie gating in ion channels and define the molecular bases of activation and inactivation gating in bestrophin channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To begin studying the structural basis of gating in BEST1, we determined a 3.1 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound BEST1 without an antibody (the same construct used for X-ray studies, comprising residues 1–405 of chicken BEST1, and termed BEST1<sub>405</sub>). From single particle analysis we obtained only a single conformation, which indicates substantial conformational homogeneity among the ~300,000 channel molecules in the dataset. The conformation of the channel is indistinguishable from the previously published X-ray structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kane Dickson et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>, RMSD for Cα atoms = 0.5 Å). As in the X-ray structure, each of the inactivation peptides, of which there are five owing to the symmetry of the channel, is bound to its cytosolic receptor and well defined in the density. Therefore, this cryo-EM structure also represents a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound inactivated state. This result indicates that antibody binding does not distort the channel from a native conformation and reflects a satisfying correspondence of structures determined using X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM methodologies.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>An open channel conformation</title><p>In an aim to obtain structural information on an open conformation of the channel, we used a construct spanning amino acids 1–345 (termed BEST1<sub>345</sub>) for cryo-EM studies. BEST1<sub>345</sub> does not inactivate because it is missing the C-terminal inactivation peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vaisey and Long, 2018</xref>). Importantly, whilst it does not inactivate, we have previously shown that BEST1<sub>345</sub> possesses normal Cl<sup>-</sup> selectivity and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vaisey and Long, 2018</xref>). Single particle cryo-EM analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound BEST1<sub>345</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>) revealed two distinct conformations of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The first, determined at 3.0 Å resolution, represents 86% of the particles and is essentially indistinguishable from the structure of BEST1<sub>405</sub>, except for the absence of the inactivation peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, RMSD for Cα atoms = 0.5 Å). Because BEST1<sub>345</sub> does not inactivate, the structure presumably represents a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound closed conformation. The conformation, in which the activation gate (the neck) is closed even though Ca<sup>2+</sup> is bound, is consistent with single channel recordings of <italic>drosophila</italic> BEST1, which indicate that the channel has a low probability of being open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chien et al., 2006</xref>). The neck adopts the same conformation in both the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound closed structure and the inactivated structure, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The second conformation present within the cryo-EM dataset, which represents 14% of the particles and is determined to 2.9 Å resolution, contains a dramatically widened pore within the neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>). Based on discussions presented herein we conclude that this represents the open conformation of the channel. The relative abundance of the closed conformation suggests that it is energetically favorable.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43231.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Open and closed conformations.</title><p>(<bold>a–b</bold>) Cryo-EM maps of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound closed (green; non-conductive) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound open (pink) conformations of BEST1<sub>345</sub>, depicted from the side (left panels) and as slices of the neck region viewed from the extracellular side (right panels).

Its narrowness, length and hydrophobicity would create an energetic barrier to ion permeation, consistent with simulation studies of wild-type and neck mutant BEST1 channel structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rao et al., 2017</xref>). In the open conformation, the neck has dilated to approximately 13 Å in diameter, which is more than sufficient to allow permeation of hydrated Cl<sup>-</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). No appreciable conformational difference is present in the cytosolic region of the channel, and in particular, the aperture constriction of the pore retains its dimensions. In accord with conclusions drawn from previous electrophysiological studies of mutations made within the neck and aperture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vaisey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vaisey and Long, 2018</xref>), we conclude that the neck functions as a gate. It permits ion flow in the open conformation and prevents it in the closed conformation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Opening transition of the neck</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2—video 1</xref> depict the transition between the closed and open conformations of the neck. Opening is reminiscent of the dilation of the iris of a camera lens. Conformational changes in the helices that form the walls of the neck (the S2b ‘neck’ helices from each of the five subunits) underlie opening. An unusual structural element allows for the movement of the neck helices and distinguishes the mechanism of gating in BEST1 from most other channels. Unlike most ion channels in which transmembrane segments are entirely α-helical, each S2b ‘neck’ helix is flanked on both of its ends by loop-like regions of extended secondary structure that partition what would otherwise be a continuous α-helix into three segments – S2a, S2b and S2c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). From comparison of the open and closed conformations of the neck, it is apparent that these loop-like regions provide a degree of flexibility that allows the neck helices to adopt their open and closed conformations and also provide a degree of tethering to the ends of these helices. Consequently, while the neck helices undergo substantial movement, the S2a and S2c helices remain essentially fixed during the gating transition.</p><p>In the closed conformation of the neck, hydrophobic packing at the center of the neck among the I76, F80 and F84 residues themselves stabilize this conformation. In the open conformation, the tendency of the phenylalanine residues to seclude their hydrophobicity from an aqueous environment is satisfied by their interactions with other hydrophobic amino acids (Y236 and W287) on the S3b and S4a helices located behind the neck helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The conformational change moves F80 and F84 away from the center of the pore and involves rotation of the neck helix along its helical axis (~15 ° clockwise viewed from the extracellular side) and outward displacement of the neck helix that is more pronounced on its N-terminal end (~2.5 Å at F80). The opening transition includes a slight expansion of the entire transmembrane region of the channel (~1 Å increase in radius), and a coordinated set of side chain rotamer changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). Both F80 and F84 move from the most commonly observed rotamer for phenylalanine (observed 44% of the time in the PDB) in the closed conformation to the second most commonly-observed rotamer (observed 33% of the time) in the open conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lovell et al., 2000</xref>). By these conformational changes, F80 and F84 rotate away from the axis of the pore (by 80<sup>o</sup> and 105<sup>o</sup>, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Accompanying side chain rotamer changes that occur among neighboring residues (Y236, F282, F283, and W287) allow for the movements of F80 and F84 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). The conformational change in I76 is also dramatic. When the channel opens, the first α-helical turn of the neck helix unravels such that I76 packs with F247, F276, L279 and F283 in the open conformation and has shifted by approximately 10 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The unraveling is facilitated by P77, which is perfectly conserved among BEST channels and is part of the neck helix in its closed conformation, but marks its N-terminal end in the open conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). The repositioning within the neck also exposes the hydrophilic residues S79 and G83 on the neck helix, which had been secluded behind the F80 and F84, to the pore in its open conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). Thus, through a concertina of coordinated conformational changes in and around the neck helix, amino acids that formed the hydrophobic barrier that prevented ion permeation have dispersed and reveal a wide aqueous vestibule, the diameter of which would be large enough to allow permeation of hydrated halide ions and larger molecules as well.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free conformation</title><p>To address how Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding contributes to BEST1 channel gating, we determined the cryo-EM structure of BEST1<sub>345</sub> in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). The structure is determined to 3.0 Å resolution and is indistinguishable from a cryo-EM structure of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free BEST1<sub>405</sub> at 3.6 Å resolution. As was expected from biochemical and electrophysiological analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vaisey and Long, 2018</xref>), the inactivation peptide is not bound to its receptor in the structure of BEST1<sub>405</sub> without Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The neck is closed in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and notably, it shares the same closed conformation as in the inactivated and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound closed structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The overall structure of the channel is very similar to the inactivated and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound closed conformations with the only notable differences near the Ca<sup>2+</sup> clasp. In structures with Ca<sup>2+</sup> bound, the five Ca<sup>2+</sup> clasps, one from each subunit, resemble a belt that wraps around the midsection of BEST1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Without Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the majority of each Ca<sup>2+</sup> clasp becomes disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). 3D classification of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free BEST1<sub>345</sub> dataset yielded only closed conformations of the neck but did indicate a degree of flexibility in the channel between the transmembrane and cytosolic regions that was manifested as a ~ 5° rotation along the symmetry axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This conformational flexibility was not observed in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound datasets, which suggests that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding rigidifies the channel.

W287 is perfectly conserved among metazoan bestrophin channels and even conserved in the prokaryotic KpBEST channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yang et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>); this sequence conservation would be consistent with an important role in channel gating. W287 is also positioned approximately at the midpoint between the Ca<sup>2+</sup> clasp and the neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). W287 adopts one side chain rotamer to pack with F80 and F84 in the open conformation and a different side chain rotamer in the closed conformation that buttresses the space between adjacent neck helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Because of its location and the conformational changes it undergoes, we hypothesized that W287 might propagate conformational changes in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> clasp to the neck and thereby govern the conformation of the neck. We find that the W287F mutation (BEST1<sub>345</sub> W287F) produces channels with dramatically altered gating. Whilst BEST1<sub>345</sub> W287F retained normal Cl<sup>-</sup> versus K<sup>+</sup> selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), the W287F mutation constitutively activates the channel, making it nearly insensitive to the presence or absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Approximately, 80% of the Cl<sup>-</sup> current level through BEST1<sub>345</sub> W287F is maintained when Ca<sup>2+</sup> was chelated with EGTA, whereas currents through wild type BEST1 drop to zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). To understand the molecular basis of this behavior, we determined cryo-EM structures of BEST1<sub>345</sub> W287F in the presence and absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> at 2.7 Å and 3.0 Å resolutions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). In the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, BEST1<sub>345</sub> W287F adopts an open conformation that is essentially indistinguishable from the open conformation observed for BEST1<sub>345</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3, C</xref>α RMSD = 0.2 Å). Unlike BEST1<sub>345</sub>, 3D classification of the BEST1<sub>345</sub> W287F dataset did not reveal a closed conformation, which indicates that essentially all of the particles are in an open conformation and that the open state is preferential for this mutant. Remarkably, in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and in spite of missing density for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and a disordered Ca<sup>2+</sup>-clasp region, the neck also adopts an open conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, in accord with the electrophysiological recordings, the W287F mutation decouples Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding from the conformational changes in the neck that are observed for the wild type channel. Modeling of the W287F mutation on a closed conformation of the channel introduces a void behind the neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3E</xref>), which we hypothesize energetically disfavors the closed conformation. The effects of the relatively conservative mutation of this tryptophan to a phenylalanine give context to a myriad of disease-causing missense mutations in and around the neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43231.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The W287F mutant decouples the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>ligand from the activation gate.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Sequence alignment at and around residue 287 for chicken, human, mouse, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (dros) and <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (Kp) bestrophin homologs and paralogs.

Both human and chicken BEST1 exhibit a lyotropic relative permeability sequence in which permeable anions that are more easily dehydrated than Cl<sup>-</sup>, such as Br<sup>-</sup>, I<sup>-</sup> and SCN<sup>-</sup>, are more permeable than Cl<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vaisey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Qu and Hartzell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hartzell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hille, 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, P<sub>X</sub>/P<sub>Cl</sub> ~ 2.7 when X = Br, ~5.1 when X = I and ~14.4 when X = SCN). The lyotropic permeability sequence is an indication that at least partial dehydration occurs for ions as they permeate through the channel. Given the structural context of the open channel, the aperture is the only constriction where dehydration would occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>); the dimensions of the aperture are too narrow for a hydrated ion to pass and therefore the aperture would necessitate that anions shed at least some water molecules as they pass through it. The structures support the conclusion that the aperture is responsible for the lyotropic permeability sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vaisey et al., 2016</xref>). Consistently, we find that mutation of V205 to a smaller residue (e.g. glycine, alanine, or serine) abolishes the lyotropic sequence among Cl<sup>-</sup>, Br<sup>-</sup>, I<sup>-</sup> and SCN<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), which suggests that the aperture is made sufficiently wide by these mutations to allow these ions to pass without dehydration. (It is worthwhile to note that our data are moot on the relative conductances among wild type and mutant channels but we hypothesize that wider apertures would yield larger conductances.) In contrast to the effects of small amino acids, mutation of V205 to isoleucine, a bulkier hydrophobic amino acid that would presumably reduce the diameter of the aperture, makes the lyotropic permeability differences between Cl<sup>-</sup>, Br<sup>-</sup>, I<sup>-</sup> and SCN<sup>-</sup> more dramatic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These effects suggest that ions would shed more water molecules when passing through the V205I aperture than through the wild type one. Thus, the aperture controls permeability among halide anions by causing ion dehydration, and it thereby engenders the characteristic lyotropic permeability sequence of BEST1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43231.019</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The aperture.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Close up of the aperture.

We found that the relative permeability of the channel to acetate, propionate and butyrate increases when V205 is substituted with the smaller alanine or glycine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, when the aperture is made wider by mutation, larger organic anions are more permeable. These data support the previous inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vaisey et al., 2016</xref>) that the aperture functions in the wild type channel as a size-selective filter. The aperture would tend to prevent the permeation of large cellular constituents such as proteins or nucleic acids but would allow smaller solutes such as Cl<sup>-</sup> ions to pass. However, the data indicate that the aperture is not perfectly discriminatory for the smallest solutes, as indicated by the measureable permeability of the wild type channel to acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

When unoccupied by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> clasps are disordered, the neck is closed, and ions are prevented from permeating through the channel by the neck. When Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions bind, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> clasps become ordered and the open and closed conformations of the channel have free energies that are similar enough that the neck can sample both conformations. The open conformation of the neck is dramatically wider than the closed conformation and opening (activation) exposes small hydrophilic amino acids to the pore where large hydrophobic ones had been. The wide neck explains why the neck has essentially no influence on ion selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vaisey et al., 2016</xref>), in spite of speculation that it might be involved in ion selectivity from the initial X-ray structure of BEST1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kane Dickson et al., 2014</xref>) and the structure of KpBest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). The channel inactivates at higher concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through a mechanism that involves the binding of the C-terminal inactivation peptide to its receptor. The receptor is on the cytosolic surface of the channel and the binding of the inactivation peptide to it allosterically controls the conformation of the neck from a distance. The inactivated conformation of the neck is indistinguishable from the deactivated (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free) one.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43231.021</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A Gating model.</title><p>In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, hydrophobic block at the neck prevents ion flow (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free closed).

The dramatic widening of the opened neck enables hydrated ions to flow through it. Binding of the inactivation peptide to its cytosolic receptor, which is stimulated by higher concentrations (&gt;500 nM) of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, induces the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound inactivated conformation in which the neck is closed.

Although this property in BEST1 is unusual among ion channels from a functional perspective, it seems less unusual from a structural perspective. Unlike many ion channels that have separate self-contained domains that are responsible for controlling channel gating, such as extracellular or intracellular ligand-binding domains, or voltage sensor domains within the membrane, which can often be studied in isolation using structural or functional approaches, BEST1 does not contain separable domains. The BEST1 channel comprises a single structural unit that resembles a barrel, with a portion of the barrel embedded in the membrane and a portion exposed to the cytosol. Additionally, the primary sequence of BEST1 does not have separate domains; rather the polypeptide portions that form the transmembrane and cytosolic regions of the channel are dispersed throughout the primary sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kane Dickson et al., 2014</xref>). The midsection of the barrel contains the region that functions as a gate (the neck) and the cytosolic surface of the barrel is decorated with sensors that influence the gate – namely the Ca<sup>2+</sup> clasps and the inactivation peptide receptors. These sensors, which function as integral parts of the channel as a whole and could not be studied in isolation, modulate the energetics of opening and closing of the neck through allosteric means. The sensors do so by relaying information received at the surface of the channel, such as the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> or the inactivation peptide, through the core of the protein to the neck. The design of the neck itself appears well suited to receive this subtle energetic information in that the neck comprises five helices (the S2b neck helices) that are tethered on each end by linker regions that allow the helices to toggle between two preferred orientations that form the closed and open conformations of the neck. Thus, while localized twisting or domain motions that are instigated by separate sensor domains often constitute the activation mechanism of ion channels, in bestrophin cytosolic sensors on the surface of the channel control a dramatic molecular choreography within the core of the protein that underlies gating and reveals a fascinating new gating mechanism among ion channels.</p><p>Our electrophysiological and structural data suggest that the aperture remains essentially fixed throughout the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation and inactivation processes. Rather than functioning as a gate, as has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), our data indicate that the aperture functions as a size-selective filter that discriminates permeant species on the basis of size and dehydration energy. Its dimensions and its hydrophobicity are such that any ion or hydrophilic entity passing through it must be at least partially dehydrated to fit. The aperture is thereby responsible for the lyotropic permeability sequence among small anions (e.g. Cl<sup>-</sup>, Br<sup>-</sup>, I<sup>-</sup>, SCN<sup>-</sup>) in which ions that are more easily dehydrated are more permeable through the channel. The aperture also limits the flow of larger anions such as acetate and mutations that increase the width of the aperture allow such ions to permeate more readily. Our data does not exclude the possibility that the aperture does change in dimensions somewhat due to thermal motion or due to some other factor. It has been observed, for example, that single channel currents obtained from purified KpBest are stimulated by ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). The mechanism of this regulation, and if it occurs in metazoan bestrophin channels, is not yet clear, but activation of bestrophins by ATP, which has been suggested to be mediated through changes at the aperture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), remains an intriguing possibility.</p><p>It has been proposed that the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA permeates through BEST1 and underlies a tonic form of synaptic inhibition in glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Previously, this possibility seemed incongruous with the narrowness of the neck observed in the X-ray structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kane Dickson et al., 2014</xref>) but the widened neck of the open channel conformation makes the possibility of slow conductance of GABA and/or other larger solutes more plausible from a structural perspective. While the dimensions of the aperture in the atomic models of BEST1, based on the cryo-EM and X-ray studies, would appear to preclude permeation of molecules the size of GABA, thermal motions that transiently widen the aperture may allow slow permeation of such solutes at physiologically relevant rates. Further, it is conceivable that regulatory mechanisms that influence the aperture exist and would modulate such permeation. Given the importance of the aperature in regulating permeation, the sequence diversity in the aperture region is particularly intriguing. This diversity may give rise to distinct permeation properties among bestrophins and hints that the physiological functions of the channels are broader and more nuanced than currently appreciated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, expression and purification of BEST1</title><p>Chicken BEST1 (UniProt E1C3A0) constructs (amino acids 1–405 or 1–345 followed by a Glu-Gly-Glu-Glu-Phe tag) were expressed in <italic>Pichia Pastoris</italic> as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kane Dickson et al., 2014</xref>).

A 3:1 (wt/wt) mixture of POPE (Avanti) and POPG (Avanti) lipids was prepared at 20 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> in reconstitution buffer (10 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.6, 450 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EGTA, 0.19 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>). 8% (wt/vol) <italic>n</italic>-octyl-β-<sc>D</sc>-maltopyranoside (Anatrace) was added to solubilize the lipids, and the mixture was incubated with rotation for 30 min at room temperature. Purified protein was mixed with an equal volume of the solubilized lipids to give a final protein concentration of 0.2–1 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> and a lipid concentration of 10 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>. Proteoliposomes were formed by dialysis (using a 8000 Da molecular mass cutoff) for 1–2 days at 4°C against 2–4 L of reconstitution buffer and were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°<sup>C</sup> until use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>Proteoliposomes were thawed and sonicated for approximately 10 s using an Ultrasonic Cleaner (Laboratory Supplies Company). All data are from recordings made using the Warner planar lipid bilayer workstation (Warner Instruments). Two aqueous chambers (4 mL) were filled with bath solutions. Chlorided silver (Ag/AgCl) wires were used as electrodes, submerged in 3 M KCl, and connected to the bath solutions via agar-KCl salt bridges [2% (wt/vol) agar, 3 M KCl]. The bath solutions were separated by a polystyrene partition with a ~ 200 μM hole across which a bilayer was painted using POPE:POPG in <italic>n</italic>-decane [3:1 (wt/wt) ratio at 20 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>]. Proteoliposomes were applied to the bilayer with an osmotic gradient across the bilayer with solutions consisting of: 30 mM KCl or NaCl (<italic>cis</italic> side) and 10 mM KCl or NaCl (<italic>trans</italic> side), 20 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.6 and 0.21 mM EGTA/0.19 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>free</sub> ~300 nM) or 1 μM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Proteoliposomes were added, 1 μL at a time, to the <italic>cis</italic> chamber to a preformed bilayer until ionic currents were observed. Solutions were stirred using a stir plate (Warner Instruments stir plate) to aid vesicle fusion. After fusion, the solutions were made symmetric by adding 3M KCl or 5M NaCl, depending on the starting solutions, to the <italic>trans</italic> side. Unless noted, all reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All electrical recordings were taken at room temperature (22–24°C).</p><p>Measurements of relative permeabilities among anions were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vaisey et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, after establishing symmetric (30/30 mM KCl or NaCl) conditions, the bath solution in the <italic>trans</italic> chamber was replaced by perfusion with solutions in which KCl or NaCl was replaced by various potassium salts (Br, I, SCN, acetate, propionate) or sodium salts (butyrate).</p><p>Currents were recorded using the Clampex 10.4 program (Axon Instruments) with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) and were sampled at 200 μs and filtered at 1 kHz. Data were analyzed using Clampfit 10.4 (Axon Instruments). Graphical display and statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software. In all cases, currents from bilayers without channels were subtracted. Error bars represent the SEM of at least three separate experiments, each in a separate bilayer. We define the side to which the vesicles are added as the <italic>cis</italic> side and the opposite <italic>trans</italic> side as electrical ground, so that transmembrane voltage is reported as V<sub>cis</sub>-V<sub>trans</sub>. Ion channels are inserted in both orientations in the bilayer.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank N Grigorieff, members of his laboratory, and the staff at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Cryo-EM facility for training and initial advice on cryo-EM.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Joel Meyerson (Reviewer #1); Christopher Miller (Reviewer #2); H Criss Hartzell (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This very nice manuscript from the Long laboratory presents new insights into the gating and permeation properties of the BEST1 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel. This research is significant not only because mutations in BEST1 are linked to a spectrum of inherited retinal dystrophies, but also because the mechanisms of gating of this channel by Ca<sup>2+</sup> have remained obscure despite extensive mutagenesis and structural studies. In this paper, the Long lab has solved the cryo-EM structures of chicken BEST1 in several conformations that reveal the mechanisms of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gating as well as some insights into the mechanisms of anion selectivity. The authors show that opening of the BEST1 channel involves a dilation of the neck region of the pore that occurs because hydrophobic residues I76, F80, and F84 move out of the pore in a concerted manner and repack with residues located in surrounding non-pore lining helices. The authors also show that the aperture of the pore is likely to form the anionic selectivity filter. We have no major concerns with what can only be described as a wonderful manuscript: it is clearly written, and the data are compelling. The following are several issues that we would like to have addressed.</p><p>1) Subsection “Opening transition of the neck”. While we think that we understand the basic mechanics of gating presented here, one reviewer had trouble visualizing the &quot;impressive flexibility&quot; and &quot;tethering&quot; that are provided by &quot;disruptions&quot; of the α-helix that allow the helix to &quot;float&quot;. One might argue that the imagery of the wording clouds, rather than explains, what is happening. The more precise description that follows is much clearer and could stand alone. Also, you might consider a description that begins with the assumption that gating is initiated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> stabilizing the &quot;open&quot; conformation of helix S4a and explaining how this conformational change may lead to the changes in the gating residues. For example, the sentence &quot;In a domino effect&quot;, makes it sound like the movements of F282, F283, and W287 are a consequence of the movements of F80 and F84, which seems backwards. Also, in the closed conformation, Q280, E74, and Y72 are fairly close together and we wondered whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding disrupts some polar interactions between S2b and S4a that stabilize the closed state. Also, in this regard, the description of the role of W287 could be clarified and refined.</p><p>2) Subsection “The aperture”. The finding that mutation of V205 to more hydrophilic residues abolishes the lyotropic sequence while replacing with a bulkier hydrophobic amino acid enhances the permeability differences deserves more attention. One might expect that replacing V205 with smaller more hydrophilic residues would increase the conductance of larger anions that are dehydrated more easily. But, the V205A/G/S mutations apparently reduce the conductance of all anions with larger anions being affected more than smaller anions. Do the authors have a model to explain the changes in permeability with these mutations or are these mutations significantly distorting the structure of the aperture? Could the authors also show bar graphs of G<sub>x</sub>/G<sub>Cl</sub>? One might also worry about the accuracy of permeability measurements when outward currents are so small. Could outward currents in Figure 5C, D be carried by K<sup>+</sup>?</p><p>3) Discussion, last paragraph. The dimensions of the aperture of cBEST1 would seem to preclude the permeation of large molecules. We presume the statement that there is &quot;variability in the aperture&quot; refers to primary sequence, not structure. While we like the suggestion that BESTs may have some unexpected functions, this paragraph should be more rigorously constructed or deleted.</p><p>4) Introduction, first paragraph. Should also cite Fischmeister and Hartzell (2005).</p><p>5) What is an &quot;indistinguishable closed conformation&quot;?</p><p>6) Subsection “The aperture”: <italic>Drosophila</italic> should be capitalized.</p><p>7) Discussion, third paragraph. What is the reasoning that led the authors to suggest that ATP may gate the channel via the aperture?</p><p>8) Results, first paragraph: The line reads &quot;…resolution cryo-EM structure of BEST1…&quot;. Readability would be improved if here the text indicated that the structure is calcium bound.</p><p>9) &quot;W287 is highly conserved among bestrophin channels.&quot; A sequence alignment to show the conservation would improve readability. This could simply be added as a supplemental panel.</p><p>10) &quot;... cryo-EM structures of the W287F mutant…&quot;.

This could be done in a small supplemental panel.</p><p>13) Minor typos: &quot;In Ca<sup>2+</sup>...&quot; should be &quot;In the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>…&quot;</p><p>14) &quot;A total of ~1000 or ~1600 micrographs were collected for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free BEST1<sub>345</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free BEST1<sub>345</sub> W287F, respectively […]&quot; should be &quot;A total of ~1000 and ~1600 micrographs were collected for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free BEST1<sub>345</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free BEST1<sub>345</sub> W287F, respectively […]&quot;</p><p>15) &quot;(using 6 or 8 classes for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free BEST1<sub>345</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free BEST1<sub>345</sub> W287F, respectively)&quot; should be &quot;(using 6 and 8 classes for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free BEST1<sub>345</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free BEST1<sub>345</sub> W287F, respectively)&quot;</p><p>16) Figure 4—figure supplement 3. &quot;…Structure of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free BEST1W287F should be &quot;...Structure of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free BEST1<sub>345</sub> W287F &quot;</p><p>17) A few lines where spaces are needed&quot;</p><p>&quot;…do so my relaying…&quot; should be &quot;…do so by relaying…&quot;</p><p>&quot;previously(Kane Dickson&quot; should be &quot;previously (Kane Dickson&quot;</p><p>&quot;SerialEM(Mastronarde&quot; should be &quot;SerialEM (Mastronarde&quot;</p><p>&quot;RELION2.1(Fernandez-Leiro&quot; should be &quot;RELION2.1 (Fernandez-Leiro&quot;</p><p>&quot;MotionCor2(Zheng&quot; should be &quot;MotionCor2 (Zheng&quot;</p><p>&quot;previously(Vaisey&quot; should be &quot;previously (Vaisey&quot;</p><p>Figure 1: first panel reads &quot;309, 189&quot; rather than &quot;309,189&quot;</p><p>18) In one of the citations of the lyotropic permeability sequence in this channel, it would be useful to quote the actual permeability ratios to Cl<sup>-</sup> for WT BEST.

In the revised manuscript, we have attempted to clarify the description of the conformational changes. We have removed the language of “domino effect” and “float”. Thank you for mentioning the intriguing possibility that polar interactions between S2b and S4a contribute to the stability of the closed state. The gating transition undoubtedly involves multiple energetic factors but we prefer to refrain from speculating further in this regard. The existence of both closed and open conformations of the neck when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is bound indicates that the gating transition is governed by relatively small energy differences once Ca<sup>2+</sup> is bound.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “The aperture”.

Could outward currents in Figure 5C, D be carried by K<sup>+</sup>?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. We have clarified possible mechanisms for the effects of mutations to V205 on the relative permeabilities. We do not expect mutation of V205 to A/S/G/I to cause major distortions to the structure of the protein.</p><p>Regarding relative conductances, we now include a bar chart showing the relative conductance of SCN<sup>-</sup> to Cl<sup>-</sup> for the wild type channel and the aperture mutants (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). The trend is consistent with the changes in relative ion permeabilities, which we do not find surprising. Mutations to smaller amino acids (e.g. G/S/A) reduce the relative difference in conductance between larger ions and Cl<sup>-</sup> that is observed for the wild-type channel, and this is similar to what we observe for the relative ion permeabilities. Because the electrophysiological studies are of macroscopic currents from an undetermined number of channels, we do not know if the mutations reduce or increase overall channel conductance (and/or change the open probability). Therefore, we submit that the reviewer is not correct to conclude that “the V205A/G/S mutations apparently reduce the conductance of all anions with larger anions being affected more than smaller anions.” Anecdotally, we find that smaller amino acid substitutions of the aperture residue (G/S/A) tend to yield larger macroscopic currents than the wild type channel for a given amount of proteoliposomes (this may indicate an increased overall channel conductance for these mutants); consequently, we typically used lower amounts of proteoliposomes for the planar lipid bilayer measurements of these mutants.</p><p>We think that it is unlikely that the outward currents observed in Figure 5—figure supplement 1D and E are carried by K<sup>+</sup>. Although the outward currents observed in Figure 5—figure supplement 1D and E are small, the measured reversal potentials were consistent for a given mutation and different mutants yielded different reversal potentials (as indicated in Figure 5D). These differences in reversal potentials are not due to differences in relative permeabilities of K<sup>+</sup> (or Na<sup>+</sup>) to Cl<sup>-</sup> among the mutants, which would have been apparent from the experiments shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Discussion, last paragraph.
