To date, all inhibitors of cholesterol transport block steps in lysosomes, limiting our understanding of post-lysosomal transport steps. Here, we establish the cholesterol-binding domain 4 of anthrolysin O (ALOD4) as a reversible inhibitor of cholesterol transport from PM to endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Using ALOD4, we: (1) deplete ER cholesterol without altering PM or overall cellular cholesterol levels; (2) demonstrate that LDL-derived cholesterol travels from lysosomes first to PM to meet cholesterol needs, and subsequently from PM to regulatory domains of ER to suppress activation of SREBPs, halting cholesterol uptake and synthesis; and (3) determine that continuous PM-to-ER cholesterol transport allows ER to constantly monitor PM cholesterol levels, and respond rapidly to small declines in cellular cholesterol by activating SREBPs, increasing cholesterol uptake and synthesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25466.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25466.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25466.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are surrounded by a plasma membrane made mostly from oily molecules known as lipids. One of these lipids, called cholesterol, is essential for keeping this membrane stable. Cholesterol is partly produced within the cells at a specialized structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, and partly imported from the blood surrounding the cell. In the blood, cholesterol is shielded inside particles called low-density lipoprotein (or LDL for short), which is taken into the cell and then sent to another structure called the lysosome.</p><p>Inside the cell, cholesterol that is freshly produced in the endoplasmic reticulum or freshly imported into the lysosome, must be moved to the plasma membrane, where most of the cholesterol is located. Cholesterol levels are regulated by a ‘control machinery’ of proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum. To keep the cholesterol levels constant, the endoplasmic reticulum needs to be in continual communication with the plasma membrane. However, the mechanisms by which cholesterol is transported between membranes are still poorly understood. Here, Infante and Radhakrishnan report a new tool to study how cholesterol is transported in human and hamster cells. The tool, which is based on part of a bacterial protein, traps cholesterol in the plasma membrane and prevents it from moving to the endoplasmic reticulum, and thus from updating the control machinery about cholesterol levels.</p><p>From this inhibition, it is inferred that a stream of cholesterol constantly travels from the plasma membrane back to endoplasmic reticulum. This way, proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum can monitor the cholesterol levels in the plasma membrane in real-time. The endoplasmic reticulum responded rapidly even to small declines in cholesterol levels by activating genes that increase cholesterol production or the amount of cholesterol imported via the LDL pathway. Further work showed that cholesterol derived from LDL travels from the lysosome directly to the plasma membrane to maintain optimal cholesterol levels. It then moves to the endoplasmic reticulum to signal that cholesterol levels in the cell have been satisfied.</p><p>The findings and tools described in this study will help to further investigate the mechanisms underlying the transport of cholesterol between the different membranes and structures in a cell. A next step will be to see if the mechanisms that apply to distribution of imported cholesterol from lysosomes, also apply to the cholesterol produced in the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25466.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25466.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cholesterol transport</kwd><kwd>plasma membrane</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>Niemann Pick C</kwd><kwd>lysosomes</kwd><kwd>cholesterol-binding toxin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL20948</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Infante</surname><given-names>Rodney Elwood</given-names></name><name><surname>Radhakrishnan</surname><given-names>Arun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1793</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Radhakrishnan</surname><given-names>Arun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12SDG12040267</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Radhakrishnan</surname><given-names>Arun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32DK007745</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Infante</surname><given-names>Rodney Elwood</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A post-lysosomal cholesterol transport inhibitor reveals how the endoplasmic reticulum membrane regulates total cellular cholesterol by constantly monitoring a critical pool of cholesterol in the plasma membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animal cells carefully control both their overall content of cholesterol as well as its distribution among organelles. Although present in the membrane of every organelle, 60–90% of a cell’s cholesterol is concentrated in its plasma membrane (PM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Duve, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lange et al., 1989</xref>). In the PM, the concentration of cholesterol is ~45 mole% of total lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Das et al., 2013</xref>). How does PM acquire and maintain these high levels of cholesterol? Much has been learned about the two sources through which cells acquire cholesterol – (i) receptor-mediated endocytosis of cholesterol-rich low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown and Goldstein, 1986</xref>), and (ii) biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Brown and Goldstein, 1990</xref>). However, neither of these two sources is located in the PM. LDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes and synthesized cholesterol from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) must be moved to PM by transport mechanisms that are not understood. Moreover, the SREBP regulatory network that controls rates of LDL uptake and cholesterol biosynthesis is located not in the PM, but in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown and Goldstein, 2009</xref>). Thus, PM cholesterol levels must be sensed and this information must be transmitted to ER to ensure optimal cholesterol levels in PM. These sensing mechanisms are also not fully understood.</p><p>Recent studies have provided clues regarding how the organization of PM cholesterol into three distinct pools may play a role in regulating cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2014</xref>). These studies showed that one pool of PM cholesterol, ~15 mole% of PM lipids, is sequestered by sphingomyelin. A second pool, ~12 mole% of PM lipids, is sequestered by other membrane factors. Cholesterol in excess of these two sequestered pools comprises a third pool that signals cholesterol excess to the regulatory machinery in the ER, thereby avoiding cholesterol overaccumulation while ensuring optimal cholesterol levels in PM. Defining these pools of cholesterol in PM was made possible by the use of mutant versions of Perfringolysin O (PFO), a bacterial toxin that binds specifically to accessible cholesterol in membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Das et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flanagan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sokolov and Radhakrishnan, 2010</xref>). Unfortunately, pore formation at 37°C by the PFO-derived probes prevented us from studying PMs of living cells, and restricted their use to PMs of cells that had been chilled to 4°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2013</xref>).</p><p>We overcame the undesired lytic properties of PFO probes by taking advantage of recent work where we showed that sub-domains of PFO and anthrolysin O (ALO), another closely related toxin, bound membrane cholesterol but did not form large oligomeric pores in red blood cells at 37°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gay et al., 2015</xref>). In the studies described here, we used the cholesterol-binding domain 4 of ALO, hereafter referred to as ALOD4, due to the protein’s higher stability. When non-lytic ALOD4 was used to study cells at 37°C, we made the surprising observation that ALOD4 was not just a reporter of PM cholesterol accessibility; it also trapped cholesterol at PM and specifically inhibited PM-to-ER cholesterol transport. Using this new cholesterol trafficking inhibitor, we traced the route taken by LDL-derived cholesterol to show that it travels directly from lysosomes to PM. We also show that trapping as little as 1% of PM cholesterol triggers the activation of the SREBP regulatory network in ER. This activation leads to increased cholesterol production and uptake, thus enabling a rapid and switch-like response to restore PM cholesterol to optimal levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Recombinant ALOD4 does not lyse CHO-K1 cells at 37°C</title><p>To develop a tool to study PM cholesterol in cells growing at 37°C, we overexpressed His<sub>6</sub>-tagged ALOD4 in bacteria, and purified the resulting recombinant protein as described in Materials and methods.

After being synthesized in the ER, both SREBPs bind to Scap, a cholesterol-sensing membrane protein that escorts SREBPs from ER to Golgi when ER cholesterol levels are below a threshold level of ~5 mole% of total ER lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown and Goldstein, 2009</xref>). In the Golgi, Site-1 protease and Site-2 protease sequentially cleave SREBPs, generating an active transcription factor fragment that travels to the nucleus to upregulate lipogenic genes, eventually raising cholesterol levels in cells and in ER. When ER cholesterol rises above the threshold concentration of ~5 mole% of total ER lipids, cholesterol binds to Scap and promotes Scap’s binding to Insigs, ER retention proteins. These interactions cause a conformational change in Scap, preventing its transport from ER to Golgi. Transport of SREBPs to Golgi is also blocked, and thus the proteolytic activation of SREBPs does not occur. As a result, cellular cholesterol levels decline and return to optimal levels. Activation of SREBPs is thus finely tuned to cellular cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown and Goldstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goldstein and Brown, 2015</xref>).</p><p>As cells growing in lipoprotein-rich FCS were well supplied with cholesterol, almost all of their SREBP2 and about half of their SREBP1 were in their precursor ER forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>second and third panels, lane 1</italic>).

If ALOD4 blocked receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoproteins, then the net result would be the same as incubation of cells in lipoprotein-poor serum. To test this possibility, we incubated CHO-K1 cells with ALOD4 in lipoprotein-rich FCS as well as in lipoprotein-poor serum (LPDS). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, we observed similar binding of ALOD4 to cells (<italic>top panel</italic>) and similar triggering of SREBP2 activation (<italic>bottom panel</italic>) both in FCS (<italic>lanes 1–5</italic>) and LPDS (<italic>lanes 6–10</italic>) incubation conditions. See Figure 6 later for a more detailed analysis of LDL uptake and degradation by sterol-depleted cells in the presence of ALOD4.</p><p>We then tested whether ALOD4 triggered SREBP activation by removing cholesterol from cells. For this experiment, we compared ALOD4’s effects to that of HPCD, a commonly used cyclodextrin that extracts cholesterol from cells and lowers the overall cellular cholesterol content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ohtani et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</xref>).

The HPCD-induced increase in SREBP2 processing was accompanied by a decrease in total cellular cholesterol from ~30 µg/mg protein to ~18 µg/mg protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <italic>lanes 1–3</italic>). However, the ALOD4-induced increase in SREBP2 processing was observed even though there was no significant change in total cellular cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <italic>lanes 4–6</italic>). Together, the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> suggest that ALOD4 triggers SREBP2 activation by binding to PM cholesterol and preventing its transport to ER, and not by blocking lipoprotein uptake or depleting cellular cholesterol. To determine whether ALOD4-induced activation of SREBPs led to upregulation of target genes in a manner similar to that induced by cholesterol depletion, we isolated total RNA from cells treated with ALOD4 or HPCD and measured the levels of mRNAs for HMG CoA reductase and LDL receptor by quantitative real-time PCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, expression of mRNAs for both these SREBP target genes was increased by ALOD4 treatment, and these increases were similar to that observed after HPCD treatment.

We incubated cells with 3 µM ALOD4 for 1 hr, after which the ALOD4-containing medium was removed and replaced with medium without ALOD4. Consistent with our previous observations, ALOD4 triggered SREBP2 activation in both lipoprotein-rich FCS and lipoprotein-poor LPDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <italic>upper panel</italic>, compare <italic>lane 1 to 2, and lane 7 to 8</italic>). ALOD4 that had bound to cells during the 1 hr incubation was detected both by immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <italic>lower panel</italic>, <italic>lanes 2 and 8</italic>) and by fluorescence measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

In addition to providing insights into the nature of ALOD4’s interaction with PM cholesterol, the rapid dissociation of bound ALOD4 from PMs also alleviated concerns that PM-bound ALOD4 may interfere with previously established methods to purify PM and ER membranes that we employ later for the analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Das et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</xref>). One might expect that dissociation of bound ALOD4 would restore PM-to-ER cholesterol transport and suppress the activation of SREBP2 transcription factors. However, we did not observe any such reversal during the short 30 min duration of this experiment. This is not surprising since previous studies have shown that suppression of SREBP2 activation by cholesterol delivered in complexes with MCD or in lipoproteins requires 1–2 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</xref>). As shown later, suppression of SREBP2 activation after dissociation of bound ALOD4 was indeed observed after 4 hr (see Figure 7C).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25466.007</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>ALOD4 triggers activation of SREBP2 by lowering ER cholesterol levels while leaving PM cholesterol levels unchanged.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) On day 0, CHO-K1 cells were set up in medium B at a density of 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/100 mm dish (20 dishes/replicate/condition).

We next sought to directly determine whether ALOD4 treatment lowers ER cholesterol levels. For this experiment, we set up three sets of CHO-K1 cells in lipoprotein-rich FCS. We then maintained one set of cells in FCS, and incubated the other two sets with either ALOD4 or cholesterol-depleting HPCD.

Compared to the FCS-treated set, ALOD4 treatment did not significantly alter cholesterol levels in the whole cell or in PM, whereas HPCD treatment lowered total cellular cholesterol from ~33 µg/mg protein to ~20 µg/mg protein and PM cholesterol from 41 mole% of total PM lipids to ~31 mole% of total PM lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). A different relationship was found when we quantified ER cholesterol levels. The ER cholesterol content of FCS-treated cells was ~8 mole% of total ER lipids and this value declined by a similar degree to ~4 mole% of total ER lipids when treated with ALOD4 or HPCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>LDL-derived cholesterol travels from lysosomes directly to PM</title><p>The above experiments demonstrate that ALOD4 blocks the transport of cholesterol from PM to ER. To determine if this property of ALOD4 would allow us to clarify the intracellular trafficking route of LDL-derived cholesterol, we first depleted CHO-K1 cells of cholesterol by incubation with HPCD, and then added back increasing amounts of LDL. After cholesterol depletion, almost all of the SREBP2 was activated to its cleaved nuclear form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>top panel, lane 1</italic>). Incubation with increasing amounts of LDL for 3 hr suppressed SREBP2 activation, leading to a decrease in the cleaved nuclear form and a corresponding increase in the uncleaved precursor form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>top panel lanes 2–4</italic>). However, addition of 3 µM ALOD4 during the 3 hr LDL incubation period completely blocked the suppression of SREBP2 activation, and only the cleaved nuclear form was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>top panel lanes 5–8</italic>).

ACAT is an ER enzyme that esterifies some of the LDL-derived cholesterol that reaches the ER. CHO-K1 cells were first depleted of cholesterol by incubation in lipoprotein-poor LPDS along with compactin, an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 1978</xref>). We then added increasing amounts of LDL together with [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate, and after 3 hr, processed the cells for measurement of cholesteryl [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate.

This is likely because cholesterol-binding toxins like ALOD4 do not bind 25-HC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sokolov and Radhakrishnan, 2010</xref>), and thus the oxysterol is free to enter cells and travel to the ER where it directly activates ACAT to esterify the cholesterol in that membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>The increase in PM-bound ALOD4 detected after LDL addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) argues against ALOD4 inhibiting the uptake or degradation of LDL; nevertheless the nature of ALOD4’s interaction with cholesterol in membranes gave us some concerns. ALOD4 could potentially bind to regions of the PM containing clathrin-coated pits and block LDL internalization. ALOD4 could also bind to cholesterol in the lipid monolayer coating the LDL surface and then block LDL’s binding to the LDL receptor or processing in lysosomes. To allay these concerns, we used previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldstein and Brown, 1974</xref>) to directly measure the uptake and degradation of LDL in the presence of ALOD4. CHO-K1 cells were depleted of cholesterol by incubation in lipoprotein-poor LPDS along with compactin. We then added 50 µg/ml [<sup>125</sup>I]LDL, a concentration at which SREBP2 activation was completely suppressed in the absence of ALOD4 and not suppressed at all in the presence of 3 µM ALOD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>upper panel,</italic> compare <italic>lane 3</italic> to <italic>lane 7</italic>). After incubation for 3 hr with increasing concentrations of ALOD4, we processed the cells for measurement of surface-bound plus internalized [<sup>125</sup>I]LDL (a measure of LDL uptake) and [<sup>125</sup>I]monoiodotyrosine released into medium (a measure of degradation of LDL).

In NPC1-deficient cells, LDL-derived cholesterol does not reach the PM to fill up its pool of accessible cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Das et al., 2013</xref>). The PMs of NPC1-deficient cells must thus rely on biosynthesis to meet their cholesterol requirements. For this experiment, we used a previously described mutant CHO-K1 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wojtanik and Liscum, 2003</xref>) that had no detectable levels of NPC1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <italic>top panel</italic>).

In contrast, the commonly used method of HPCD treatment to rapidly deplete ER cholesterol also lowers total cellular cholesterol by 30–40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Moreover, the use of HPCD to study cholesterol regulation in NPC1-deficient cells is confounded by HPCD’s ability to rescue the lysosomal cholesterol accumulation caused by NPC1-deficiency by as yet undefined mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abi-Mosleh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). We thus decided to compare the effects of these two methods of sterol depletion in NPC1-deficient cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, sterol depletion by HPCD triggered the activation of SREBP2 in both control CHO-K1 cells (<italic>upper panel, lane 1</italic>) and NPC1-deficient cells (<italic>lower panel, lane 1</italic>). Addition of LDL suppressed the activation of SREBP2 in control CHO-K1 cells (<italic>upper panel, lanes 1–4</italic>). LDL treatment also suppressed the activation of SREBP2 in NPC1-deficient cells (<italic>lower panel, lanes 1–4</italic>). This paradoxical result is consistent with an earlier study where HPCD treatment overcame the inability of NPC1-deficient cells to transport LDL-derived cholesterol out of lysosomes to ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abi-Mosleh et al., 2009</xref>). A different result was obtained when ALOD4 was used to deplete ER cholesterol from NPC1-deficient cells. Consistent with the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, incubation with 3 µM ALOD4 for 1 hr triggered the activation of SREBP2 in both control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <italic>upper panel, lane 5</italic>) and NPC1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <italic>lower panel, lane 5</italic>). We then replaced the ALOD4-containing medium with medium containing increasing amounts of LDL. Rapid dissociation of ALOD4 from PMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>) allowed LDL-derived cholesterol to transit through the PM and reach the ER to suppress the activation of SREBP2 in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <italic>upper panel, lanes 5–8</italic>), but not in NPC1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <italic>lower panel, lanes 5–8</italic>).

After cholesterol depletion, no binding of ALOD4 was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <italic>bottom panel lane 1</italic>), indicating levels of accessible PM cholesterol were low.

This suggests that cholesterol/MCD complexes deliver their cholesterol to the PM, where it is immediately sequestered by ALOD4, preventing its movement to the ER to suppress SREBP activation. In contrast, ALOD4 had no effect on the ability of 25-HC to suppress SREBP2 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <italic>top and middle panels, lanes 5–8</italic>), and we detected no binding of ALOD4 to PMs after addition of 25-HC (<italic>bottom panel, lanes 5–8</italic>).

We incubated CHO-K1 cells that had been growing in FCS with increasing amounts of cholesterol/MCD in the absence or presence of 3 µM ALOD4 for 1 hr, and then processed the cells for immunoblot analysis. In the absence of ALOD4, there was no triggering of SREBP2 activation since cellular sterol levels were high (<italic>top panel</italic>, <italic>lanes 1–4</italic>). When ALOD4 was added, it bound to PMs (<italic>bottom panel, lane 5</italic>) and prevented the PM cholesterol from traveling to the ER, thereby triggering SREBP2 activation (<italic>top panel, lane 5</italic>). When further supplemented with 50 µM cholesterol/MCD, the cholesterol levels in PM increased as judged by an increase in bound ALOD4 (<italic>bottom panel, lane 6</italic>). However, SREBP2 activation was not suppressed since all of the added cholesterol was likely sequestered by ALOD4 at PM and prevented from traveling to ER (<italic>top panel, lane 6</italic>). Supplementation with 100 µM and 200 µM cholesterol/MCD delivered even more cholesterol to PM, as judged by further increases in bound ALOD4 (<italic>bottom panel, lanes 7 and 8</italic>). In these cases, the additional cholesterol in PM was in excess of ALOD4’s sequestering capacity, leading to transport of cholesterol to ER and suppression of SREBP2 activation (<italic>top panel, lanes 7 and 8</italic>).</p><p>In a final experiment, we examined whether ALOD4 added to the extracellular medium of CHO-K1 cells was internalized during the treatment conditions of the experiments in the current study. We have already shown that when added to sterol replete cells for 1 hr, ALOD4 bound to PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <italic>lower panel lane 2</italic>) but the PM-bound ALOD4 rapidly dissociated, with no detectable signal after 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). If ALOD4 had been internalized during the 1 hr incubation period, the immunoblot analysis and fluorescence assays would have revealed residual bound ALOD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). We next measured whether ALOD4 could be internalized by sterol depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). We first depleted cells of cholesterol by incubation with HPCD for 1 hr, after which we incubated the cells without or with 50 µM cholesterol/MCD complexes for 3 hr. As expected, SREBP2 activation was triggered by sterol depletion, and this activation was suppressed by addition of cholesterol (<italic>top panel, lanes 1 and 2</italic>). When we included 3 µM ALOD4 during the 3 hr incubation period (<italic>bottom panel, lanes 3–6</italic>), the added cholesterol was trapped at the PM by the binding of ALOD4 (<italic>middle panel, lane 4</italic>) and was unable to reach the ER to suppress SREBP2 activation (<italic>top panel, lane 4</italic>). For a parallel set of cells, we removed the ALOD4-containing medium after the 3 hr incubation, and replaced it with medium without ALOD4. After 40 min, a time period that is sufficient for complete dissociation of PM-bound ALOD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), cells were harvested and subjected to immunoblot analysis. We observed no bound ALOD4 in the condition where cholesterol was added (<italic>middle panel, lane 6</italic>), suggesting that all of the PM-bound ALOD4 had dissociated during the 40 min period and that no detectable level of ALOD4 had been internalized during the 3 hr incubation period. Restoration of PM-to-ER cholesterol transport after ALOD4 dissociation was not sufficient to suppress the activation of SREBP2 in the short 40 min duration of this experiment, a result that is consistent with our previous observation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our current understanding of intracellular cholesterol trafficking has been largely made possible by tools that inhibit specific steps of this pathway (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).

LDL particles containing cholesteryl esters are internalized by sterol-depleted cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The internalized LDL is degraded in lysosomes, and its cholesteryl esters (chol. esters) are hydrolyzed by acid lipase to generate unesterified cholesterol (<italic>yellow circles</italic>) and fatty acids. Two lysosomal proteins, NPC1 and NPC2, mediate the exit of LDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes. Cholesterol is transported first to the sterol-depleted PM to replenish its cholesterol until optimal levels are reached. Excess PM cholesterol then traffics to regions of the ER where the SREBP regulatory network is located and where cholesterol levels are below a threshold concentration. After expanding ER cholesterol past the threshold level, excess cholesterol binds to SCAP, the ER cholesterol sensor, that is in complexes with SREBPs. Binding to cholesterol changes the conformation of Scap promoting its interaction with Insigs, ER retention proteins, and preventing recruitment of the Scap-SREBP complex into CopII vesicles for transport to Golgi. Proteolytic activation of SREBPs in Golgi does not occur, and genes encoding enzymes for cholesterol synthesis and uptake are shut down, thus maintaining cholesterol homeostasis. Excess ER cholesterol can be transported to the PM or can be converted by ACAT, an ER enzyme, to cholesteryl esters and stored in intracellular lipid droplets.

Other versions of these toxins have been used in end-point assays to measure changes in accessible cholesterol in PM and ER membranes purified from cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sokolov and Radhakrishnan, 2010</xref>). These earlier studies showed that the distribution of cholesterol between inaccessible and accessible pools in PM and ER membranes plays crucial roles in controlling cellular cholesterol levels. In the current study with live cells, we found that ALOD4 does much more than just serve as a passive reporter of accessibility of PM cholesterol. When added in the extracellular medium of cells that were replete with cholesterol, ALOD4 rapidly bound PM cholesterol and prevented its movement to ER. As a result, ER cholesterol levels dropped below a threshold concentration of ~5 mole% cholesterol, thereby triggering activation of SREBP transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). ALOD4 did not bind to PMs of cells that were depleted of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). When we attempted to replenish sterol-depleted cells with MCD/cholesterol complexes that deliver cholesterol directly to PMs, ALOD4 immediately bound this newly delivered cholesterol in PMs, and prevented its movement to ER to suppress SREBP2 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). A potentially useful feature of ALOD4 is that by sequestering PM cholesterol without extracting it from the membrane, ER cholesterol is depleted even though PM cholesterol levels and overall cellular cholesterol levels are not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). This sequestration is reversible, as removing ALOD4 from the medium results in rapid dissociation of PM-bound ALOD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>), and restoration of PM-to-ER cholesterol transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In contrast, other cholesterol modulators like cyclodextrins, statins, or lipoprotein-poor serum, all irreversibly deplete cholesterol from both PM and ER membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>ALOD4’s specific inhibition of PM-to-ER cholesterol transport allowed us to clarify the trafficking route of LDL-derived cholesterol after it exits lysosomes. The post-lysosomal fate of LDL-derived cholesterol has been a subject of debate with some studies suggesting that it moves from lysosomes to PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lange and Steck, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu and Tabas, 1991</xref>), and other studies suggesting that it moves from lysosomes to ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Neufeld et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Underwood et al., 1998</xref>). In the presence of ALOD4, sterol-depleted cells internalized LDL and degraded it in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), and the LDL-derived cholesterol exited the lysosomes and reached the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). At the PM, ALOD4 sequestered the LDL-derived cholesterol, preventing it from traveling to the ER and suppressing SREBP2 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), or stimulating the activity of ACAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These data support the model that LDL-derived cholesterol moves first from lysosomes to PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Only after PM’s cholesterol requirements are met does excess cholesterol travel from PM to ER. LDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes cannot bypass the PM and travel directly to ER to shut down lipogenic genes, thus ensuring that the supply of cholesterol is not prematurely halted before the PM’s needs are satisfied. Our simplified model shows LDL-derived cholesterol traveling directly from lysosomes to PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), but we cannot rule out the possibility that this cholesterol makes intermediate stops at other organelles such as peroxisomes on its way to PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2015</xref>), as long as these stops do not include the region of the ER housing the SREBP regulatory network or the ACAT enzyme. The PM to ER cholesterol transport route may also involve stops at other organelles. It should be noted that LDL-derived cholesterol is most likely delivered to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the PM, but must then flip to the outer leaflet of the PM to be accessible for binding to extracellularly added ALOD4. This step is likely not rate-limiting, since previous studies have suggested that equilibration of cholesterol between the bilayer leaflets of red cell membranes is rapid (t<sub>1/2</sub> of ~1 s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steck et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The kinetic studies of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> allowed us to estimate the number of cholesterol molecules that must be sequestered in PM to trigger SREBP transport from ER to Golgi and proteolytic activation. At saturation, ~150 ng (~10 pmol) of ALOD4 bound to ~120,000 cells in a single well of a 48-well plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). If we assume that each molecule of ALOD4 sequesters one molecule of cholesterol, we calculate that ALOD4 binds ~0.08 fmol of cholesterol/cell. In an earlier study, we estimated that a CHO-K1 cell growing in lipoprotein-rich FCS contains ~10 fmol of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</xref>). The LIPID MAPS consortium quantified the lipidome of a mouse macrophage and reported that a macrophage cell contains 1000–2000 pmol cholesterol/µg DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dennis et al., 2010</xref>). Using this value and previous measurements of ~10 picograms DNA/mouse cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 1980</xref>), we calculate that a mouse macrophage contains ~10–20 fmol of cholesterol, similar to the estimated value for CHO-K1 cells. While being mindful of the many assumptions made in estimating these values, our results suggest that sequestering just a small fraction (~1%) of cellular cholesterol at the PM and preventing its movement to ER, can trigger activation of SREBPs in an all-or-none manner. Treatment with HPCD, a commonly used tool to study cholesterol regulation, lowers cellular cholesterol by 30–40%, and also triggers activation of SREBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). The results obtained with ALOD4 indicate that the cholesterol homeostatic machinery is sensitive to much more subtle changes in a small, labile fraction of PM cholesterol. It remains to be determined whether this small fraction represents a critical sub-pool of the previously determined accessible PM cholesterol pool (~15 mole% of PM lipids, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2014</xref>). This metabolically active fraction of PM cholesterol can be maintained even in NPC1-deficient cells, which lack the ability to use LDL as a cholesterol source and must rely on cholesterol biosynthesis to stock its PM with optimal cholesterol levels. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, ALOD4 triggered activation of SREBP2 in NPC1-deficient cells with identical concentration dependence as it did in control cells.</p><p>In cells replete with cholesterol, robust PM-to-ER cholesterol transport ensures that the ER cholesterol concentration is above a threshold value of 5 mole% of ER lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</xref>). At these high concentrations, cholesterol binds to the ER cholesterol sensor Scap, leading to formation of a complex with ER-resident Insigs, thus preventing Scap’s recruitment into CopII coated vesicles and transport of SREBPs to Golgi where they can be proteolytically activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Incubating these cholesterol-replete cells with ALOD4 for 1 hr in the presence of compactin, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, results in ER cholesterol dropping below the threshold concentration of 5 mole% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This drop in cholesterol concentration leads to cholesterol’s dissociation from Scap, disassembly of the Scap-Insig complex, and promotes Scap’s recruitment into CopII coated vesicles to transport and activate SREBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). How does ALOD4 cause a drop in ER cholesterol levels without altering overall cellular cholesterol? In the absence of synthesis, ER cholesterol is maintained at an equilibrium level by balancing the influx of cholesterol from the PM with the efflux of cholesterol out of ER to other organelles, including to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lange et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2014</xref>). ALOD4’s inhibition of the influx pathway, but not of the efflux pathway, disrupts this equilibrium and leads to ER cholesterol dropping below the threshold concentration of 5 mole%, even though cholesterol has not been removed from the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that when cells are replete with cholesterol, the ER continuously receives cholesterol from PM to offset losses of cholesterol due to efflux out of ER. This allows the ER to constantly sample the cholesterol content of PMs, and make adjustments via transcriptional regulation of cholesterol uptake and synthesis to ensure optimal PM cholesterol levels. How cholesterol moves from PM to ER is currently not understood, although PM proteins such as ABCA1, and vesicular and non-vesicular trafficking pathways have been implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holthuis and Menon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lahiri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mesmin and Maxfield, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yamauchi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the experiments where we clarified the trafficking route of LDL-derived cholesterol, we purposefully included compactin to eliminate biosynthesis as a source for PM cholesterol. This allowed us to determine that LDL-derived cholesterol, once released from lysosomes, is directed first to the PM to ensure optimal cholesterol levels in that membrane before expanding the ER regulatory pool to downregulate cholesterol synthesis and uptake. A similar strategy is likely employed for newly synthesized cholesterol in ER, which must also be first directed to PM to meet the needs of that membrane before expanding the ER regulatory pool to shut down cholesterol synthesis and uptake. How proteins involved in cholesterol synthesis, regulation, and esterification are spatially organized in the ER, and how cholesterol is moved from ER to PM is currently not known. In addition to the uses outlined in the current study, ALOD4 could also help to reveal the transport pathways that originate from the ER and deliver cholesterol to PM.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>We obtained [<sup>14</sup>C]oleic acid (59 mCi/mmol) and [<sup>3</sup>H]cholesteryl oleate (30–60 Ci/mmol) from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO; Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-450 from BioRad, Inc., Hercules, CA; methyl-β-cyclodextrin (randomly methylated) (MCD) and hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPCD) from Cyclodextrin Technologies Development, Inc., Gainesville, FL; [<sup>125</sup>I]NaI (17 Ci/mg) from PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA; protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (cOmplete, EDTA-free) from Roche, Indianapolis, IN; 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) from Steraloids, Inc., Newport, RI; bovine serum albumin (BSA), cholesterol, fetal bovine serum (FCS), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) from Sigma, St. Louis, MO; and Alexa Fluor 488 C<sub>5</sub>-maleimide and Alexa Fluor 647 C<sub>2</sub>-maleimide from Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Continuous transport of a small fraction of plasma membrane cholesterol to ER regulates total cellular cholesterol&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have made an important discovery in cellular cholesterol metabolism. They have shown that a modified version of a cholesterol-binding cytolysin, ALO-D4, incubated with CHO cells, locks the accessible pool of cholesterol on the plasma membrane and prevents it from moving the ER. The diminished transport of cholesterol to the ER results in endoproteolytic processing of SREBP and activation of the SREBP pathway.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors are experts in measuring ER cholesterol in CHO cells. They should show, by measuring ER cholesterol in at least one experimental setting, that ALO-D4 binding to the plasma membrane reduces cholesterol in the ER.

They should show, by measuring ER cholesterol in at least one experimental setting, that ALO-D4 binding to the plasma membrane reduces cholesterol in the ER. Also, show that the processing of SREBP is accompanied by the expected gene-expression changes.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting this important experiment. We have now directly measured the effect of ALOD4 treatment on ER cholesterol levels. The result of this experiment, where we also measured ALOD4’s effect on PM cholesterol levels, is shown in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. For this experiment, we set up three sets of CHO-K1 cells in lipoprotein-rich FCS. We then maintained one set of cells in FCS, and incubated the other two sets with either ALOD4 or cholesterol-depleting HPCD. After treatment for 1 h, aliquots of cells from each set were subjected to immunoblot analysis for SREBP2, whole cell cholesterol quantification, PM purification and quantification of PM cholesterol (Das et al., 2013), and ER purification and quantification of ER cholesterol (Radhakrishnan et al., 2008). Consistent with the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, treatment of cells with ALOD4 or HPCD both triggered similar activation of SREBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, lanes2and3), however the treatments had distinct effects on cellular cholesterol distribution. Compared to the FCS-treated set, ALOD4 treatment did not significantly alter cholesterol levels in the whole cell or in PM, whereas HPCD treatment lowered total cellular cholesterol from ~33 µg/mg protein to ~20 µg/mg protein and PM cholesterol from 41 mole% of total PM lipids to ~31 mole% of total PM lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). A different relationship was found when we quantified ER cholesterol levels. The ER cholesterol content of FCS-treated cells was ~ 8 mole% of total ER lipids and this value declined by a similar degree to ~ 4 mole% of total ER lipids when treated with ALOD4 or HPCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>In a separate experiment, we show that ALOD4-induced triggering of SREBP processing is accompanied by expected increases in expression levels of HMG-CoA reductase and LDL receptor, both of which are SREBP target genes. These results are shown in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>.</p><p>Combined, these new sets of data bolster our interpretation of ALOD4’s effect in the Discussion. Binding of ALOD4 to PMs blocks PM-to-ER cholesterol transport, resulting in an ~ 50% reduction of ER cholesterol levels even though PM cholesterol and overall cellular cholesterol do not change. The drop in ER cholesterol triggers activation of SREBP transcription factors, increasing expression of target genes to increase cholesterol synthesis and uptake.</p><p><italic>2) Provide information on reproducibility of data and more detail on statistical analyses of data.</italic> </p><p>We now include detailed statistical analyses of all bar graph data in the paper. Individual data points for all triplicate studies are shown along with the standard error. <italic>P</italic> values are provided whenever statements of significance are made.</p><p>All results were confirmed in at least three independent experiments conducted on different days using different batches of cells and different batches of purified ALOD4. The only exception was the large-scale study described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> which was conducted in triplicate on one occasion. We have included this information in a section titled “Reproducibility of data” in the Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>3) Show that ALO-D4 binding activates SREBP processing in at least one other cell type, for example human fibroblasts.</italic> </p><p>The results of a new experiment showing that ALOD4 triggers the activation of SREBP1 and SREBP2 in human fibroblasts are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) Show a dose-response curves for the impact of ALO-D4 binding on SREBP processing.</italic> </p><p>A detailed dose response curve showing that increased ALOD4 binding leads to increasing processing of SREBP is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>.

We have made changes to the Discussion to reflect these points. We have also modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and the Discussion to more clearly convey how ALOD4 affects the equilibrium transport of cholesterol between PM and ER.</p><p><italic>6) Provide improved microscopy or delete it.</italic> </p><p>We have deleted the microscopy figure.</p><p><italic>7) Cite or show data that ALO-D4 is not internalized.</italic> </p><p>Studies by other groups have shown that the non-lytic domain 4 of PFO or ALO is not internalized, however these studies were carried out at 4°C or room temperature. Although suggestive, these earlier studies did not address whether ALOD4 would be internalized during the 37°C incubations of the current study. We have cited the suggestive earlier studies and also describe two experiments which suggest that ALOD4 is not internalized at 37°C – 1) When added to sterol-replete cells for 1 h at 37°C, ALOD4 bound to PM. The PM-bound ALOD4 rapidly dissociated, with no detectable signal after 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-E</xref>). If ALOD4 had been internalized during the 1 h incubation period, the internalized ALOD4 would have been detected as residual bound ALOD4. 2) We also measured whether ALOD4 could be internalized by sterol depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). We first depleted cells of cholesterol by incubation with HPCD for 1 h, after which we incubated the cells without or with 50 µM cholesterol/MCD complexes for 3 h. As expected, SREBP2 activation was triggered by sterol depletion, and this activation was suppressed by addition of cholesterol (top panel, lanes 1 and 2). When we included 3 µM ALOD4 during the 3 h incubation period (bottom panel, lanes 3-6), the added cholesterol was trapped at the PM by the binding of ALOD4 (middle panel, lane 4) and was unable to reach the ER to suppress SREBP2 activation (top panel, lane 4). For a parallel set of cells, we removed the ALOD4-containing medium after the 3 h incubation, and replaced it with medium without ALOD4. After 40 min, a time period that is sufficient for complete dissociation of PM-bound ALOD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), cells were harvested and subjected to immunoblot analysis. We observed no bound ALOD4 in the condition where cholesterol was added (middle panel, lane 6), suggesting that all of the PM-bound ALOD4 had dissociated during the 40 min period and that no detectable level of ALOD4 had been internalized during the 3 h incubation period.</p></body></sub-article></article>
