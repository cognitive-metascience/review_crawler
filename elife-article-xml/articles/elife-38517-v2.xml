Several studies have also implicated condensins in gene expression, although any mechanisms have remained enigmatic. Here, we report on the role of condensin in gene expression in fission and budding yeasts. In contrast to previous studies, we provide compelling evidence that condensin plays no direct role in the maintenance of the transcriptome, neither during interphase nor during mitosis. We further show that the changes in gene expression in post-mitotic fission yeast cells that result from condensin inactivation are largely a consequence of chromosome missegregation during anaphase, which notably depletes the RNA-exosome from daughter cells. Crucially, preventing karyotype abnormalities in daughter cells restores a normal transcriptome despite condensin inactivation. Thus, chromosome instability, rather than a direct role of condensin in the transcription process, changes gene expression. This knowledge challenges the concept of gene regulation by canonical condensin complexes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>condensin</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>SMCs</kwd><kwd>RNA-exosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernard</surname><given-names>Pascal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-15-CE12-0002-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robellet</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name><name><surname>Bernard</surname><given-names>Pascal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJA 20151203343</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernard</surname><given-names>Pascal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ligue Régionale Contre le Cancer - comité du Rhône</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernard</surname><given-names>Pascal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Xi-Ming</given-names></name><name><surname>Marguerat</surname><given-names>Samuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Molecular Biology Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cuylen-Haering</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name><name><surname>Clauder-Münster</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Steinmetz</surname><given-names>Lars</given-names></name><name><surname>Haering</surname><given-names>Christian H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDT20170437039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hocquet</surname><given-names>Clémence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Contrary to the generally accepted model, condensin maintains proper gene expression by promoting the accurate segregation of chromosomes and the partitioning of the RNA-exosome throughout mitosis, instead of directly regulating transcription.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes are ring-shaped ATPases, conserved from bacteria to human, which shape chromosomes and ensure their accurate transmission during cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hirano, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Uhlmann, 2016</xref>). Eukaryotes possess three distinct SMC protein complexes, named condensins, cohesin and SMC5/6. Condensins structure and condense chromosomes, cohesin mediates sister-chromatid cohesion and organises topological domains in the genome during interphase, and SMC5/6 promotes proper DNA replication and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hirano, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Uhlmann, 2016</xref>). A large body of in vivo and in vitro studies has substantiated the idea that SMC complexes shape the genome and preserve its integrity by encircling DNA helixes and, at least partly, by extruding loops of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ganji et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hirano, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Uhlmann, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Ruiten and Rowland, 2018</xref>). Besides organising chromosomes, cohesin and condensins have also been widely implicated in the control of gene expression, raising the idea that the two complexes link gene expression to chromosome architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dowen and Young, 2014</xref>). Yet, while our understanding of gene regulation by cohesin has progressed during the last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Merkenschlager and Nora, 2016</xref>), the mechanisms through which condensins impact on gene expression have remained largely enigmatic.</p><p>Condensins have been best characterised as the key drivers of the assembly of mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hirano, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Robellet et al., 2017</xref>). The profound reorganisation of chromatin fibres into compact and individualised rod-shaped chromosomes that marks the entry into mitosis is essential for the accurate transmission of the genome during anaphase. When the function of condensins is impaired, chromosome arms remain entangled and hence fail to separate, leading to the formation of sustained anaphase chromatin bridges and DNA breakage during telophase and in post-mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuylen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Samoshkin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sutani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Toselli-Mollereau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Woodward et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Like all SMC complexes, condensins are composed of two ATPases, called SMC2<sup>Cut14</sup> and SMC4<sup>Cut3</sup> (fission yeast names are indicated in superscript), that associate with three non-SMC subunits, which regulate the ATPase activity of the holocomplex and govern its association with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kschonsak et al., 2017</xref>). Most eukaryotes possess two condensins, called condensin I and II, which are composed of the same SMC2/SMC4 heterodimer but two different sets of non-SMC subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hirano, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Robellet et al., 2017</xref>). Despite their structural and functional similarities, the dynamics of association of condensin I and II with chromosomes differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Walther et al., 2018</xref>). Condensin II is nuclear during interphase and enriched on chromosomes from prophase until telophase. Condensin I, in contrast, is mostly cytoplasmic during interphase and associates with chromosomes from prometaphase until telophase. A third condensin variant called the Dosage Compensation Complex (DCC) has been described in the worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, which associates with the two X chromosomes in hermaphrodite animals and halves the expression of X-linked genes by reducing the occupancy of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kruesi et al., 2013</xref>). Yeasts, in contrast, possess a unique condensin complex, similar in terms of primary sequence to condensin I.</p><p>Condensin I and II have been implicated in the control of gene expression in various organisms, ranging from yeasts to human. In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the silencing of heterochromatic mating type genes and the position effect exerted by repetitive ribosomal DNA are both alleviated when condensin is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhalla et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise, in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, the SMC4<sup>Cut3</sup> subunit of condensin is needed to repress tRNAs genes as well as reporter genes inserted into the pericentric DNA repeats, which are coated with heterochomatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iwasaki et al., 2010</xref>). It remains unclear, however, during which cell cycle phase and through which mechanism budding and fission yeast condensins regulate the expression of such diverse genes in such different genomic contexts. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, depletion of condensin II is linked to an increase in the expression of at least 250 genes, but this effect does not correlate with the occupancy of condensin II on chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kranz et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, condensin I has been implicated in the repression of homeotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lupo et al., 2001</xref>), whereas condensin II has been reported to take part in the production of antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Longworth et al., 2012</xref>). Murine peripheral T cells that express a mutant version of the condensin II CAP-H2 regulatory subunit, exhibit a decreased compaction of chromatin and an increased expression of the proliferative gene <italic>Cis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rawlings et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting a possible mechanistic relationship between condensin-mediated chromosome organisation and gene expression. However, another study reported that the same CAP-H2 mutation led to only subtle effects on the transcriptome of precursor thymocytes, which might be caused by chromosomal instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Woodward et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Perhaps more consistent with a direct role in gene regulation, condensin I was found associated with active promoters during M phase in chicken DT40 cells, and its depletion prior to mitotic entry coincided with a decreased expression during the subsequent G1 phase of a subset of genes to which it bound to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, cohesin and condensin II have been detected at super-enhancers in rapidly proliferating mouse embryonic stem cells, and depleting condensin II has been associated with a reduced expression of cell-identity genes driven by these super-enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dowen et al., 2013</xref>). Yuen et al. observed a similar effect on the expression of highly-expressed housekeeping genes in mouse embryonic stem cells and human embryonic kidney cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yuen et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, it has been reported that not only condensin II, but also condensin I, binds enhancers activated by β-estradiol during interphase in human MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells, and that the depletion of condensin I or II led to a reduced transcription of oestrogen-activated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Intriguingly, the same enhancers where also found occupied by cohesin and to rely upon this complex to drive gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>All these studies tend to support the idea that condensin I and II play an important and evolutionarily conserved role in gene expression, through which they impinge on cell identity, cell proliferation and, possibly, also immunity. Yet, no conclusive evidence has been provided thus far as to how condensin I and II might achieve this function. Mitotic chromosomes conserve considerable chromatin accessibility, similar to interphase chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hihara et al., 2012</xref>), and DNA remains accessible to transcription factors even in mitotic chromosomes that have been structured by condensin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Palozola et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, it remains unclear whether and how mechanisms related to chromosome condensation could possibly underlie condensin-mediated gene regulation. Furthermore, given that the loss or gain of chromosomes is sufficient to alter gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Santaguida and Amon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sheltzer et al., 2012</xref>), it is crucial to determine to which extent the role attributed to condensin I and II in the control of gene expression is mechanistically different from, or related to, the assembly and segregation of chromosomes during mitosis.</p><p>Gene expression can be controlled at the transcriptional level by changing the activity and/or the occupancy of RNA polymerases, as exemplified by condensin<sup>DCC</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kruesi et al., 2013</xref>). It can also be controlled at the co- or post-transcriptional level by modulating the half-life of transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bühler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harigaya et al., 2006</xref>). The RNA-exosome is a conserved ribonuclease complex that ensures the maturation and the controlled degradation of a plethora of RNAs in the cell, including, for example, defective RNAs or cryptic unstable non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kilchert et al., 2016</xref>). The RNA-exosome consists of nine core subunits that associate with the RNase Dis3 in the cytoplasm, plus a second RNase, called Rrp6, in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kilchert et al., 2016</xref>). The mechanisms behind target recognition and processing or degradation modes by the RNA-exosome are not fully understood. Cofactors, such as the TRAMP poly(A)polymerase complex, stimulate the RNase activity of the RNA-exosome and specify its targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kilchert et al., 2016</xref>). Rrp6 has been found associated with chromosomes at actively transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrulis et al., 2002</xref>), leading to the idea that the RNA-exosome can handle nuclear RNA in a co-transcriptional manner. By processing and eliminating cellular transcripts, the RNA-exosome plays a central role in proper gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kilchert et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To gain insights into how canonical condensins regulate genes, we investigated the role of condensin complexes in gene expression during the fission and budding yeast cell cycle. In contrast to previous studies, we present here converging evidence that condensin plays no major direct role in the control of gene expression, neither in <italic>S. pombe</italic> nor in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. We show that lack of condensin activity is associated with increased levels of tRNAs, mRNAs and non-coding RNAs in post-mitotic fission yeast cells, reminiscent of other organisms, but that this effect is indirect: RNAs accumulate in condensin mutant cells because of the missegregation of chromosomes, as illustrated by the non-disjunction of the rDNA during anaphase, which dampens RNA degradation by the nucleolar RNA-exosome in post-mitotic cells. The discovery that budding and fission yeast condensins contribute to proper gene expression by maintaining chromosome stability during cell divisions, and not through a direct impact on gene transcription, challenges the widespread idea that condensin I and condensin II are direct regulators of gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNA-exosome-sensitive transcripts accumulate when condensin is impaired in fission yeast</title><p>To assess the role of condensin in gene expression in fission yeast, we compared the transcriptomes of wild-type and mutant cells in which the SMC2<sup>Cut14</sup> ATPase subunit of condensin was inactivated by the thermosensitive <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Saka et al., 1994</xref>). We shifted cells growing asynchronously at permissive temperature to the restrictive temperature of 36°C for 2.5 hr (one cell doubling) to inactivate SMC2<sup>Cut14</sup> and determined their transcriptomes using strand-specific RNA-seq.

However, the analysis of all increased mRNAs revealed no enrichment for a specific gene ontology (GO) term, which suggests that condensin inactivation does not affect the expression of a particular family of protein-coding genes. In contrast, ncRNAs, which represent ~22% of the transcription units in the fission yeast genome (n = 1524/6986; genome version ASM294v2.30), were significantly enriched in the population of transcripts up-regulated in the <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant (p&lt;0.001, Chi-square test). Since most ncRNAs are maintained at a low level by the nuclear RNA-exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wilhelm et al., 2008</xref>), their controlled degradation might be compromised in the mutant. We tested this hypothesis by northern blotting using the antisense ncRNA <italic>mug93-antisense-1</italic> (<italic>mug93as</italic>) as a representative example.

Using these criteria, we identified 489 transcripts, mostly mRNAs and ncRNAs, which were extended at their 3’ ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Oligo(dT)-primed RT-PCR showed that read-through RNAs were polyadenylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

We first confirmed that condensin localizes to chromosomes of cells released synchronously into the cell cycle from a G1 mating pheromone arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Chromosome spreading and ChIP showed that condensin bound to chromosomes already during G1 phase and that its levels on chromosomes increased as cells passed through S and G2 phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). To inactivate condensin in budding yeast, we proteolytically cleaved the kleisin (Brn1) subunit of the condensin ring by inducing expression of a site-specific protease from tobacco etch virus (TEV) using a galactose-inducible promoter, which efficiently released condensin from chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuylen et al., 2011</xref>), even during G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We then compared the transcriptome of G1 phase-arrested cells after condensin cleavage to cells with intact condensin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Remarkably, solely 26 transcripts were differentially expressed by at least two-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To rule out that such minor effect on gene expression was not an artefact caused by the G1 phase arrest, we repeated the experiment, but this time released cells after Brn1 TEV cleavage from the G1 phase arrest and re-arrested them in the subsequent M phase by addition of the spindle poison nocodazole, before preparing RNA for transcriptome analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In this experiment, only six genes displayed an up- or downregulation of two-fold or more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We conclude that condensin inactivation by releasing the complex from chromosomes has no major effects on the gene expression program of budding yeast cells when these cells are prevented from undergoing division.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38517.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Condensin release from chromosomes has no major effects on G1 or M phase gene expression programs in budding yeast.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TEV protease expression was induced in cells synchronized in G1 phase by α-factor (strains C3138 and C3139). 2.5 hr after TEV induction, RNA was extracted, cDNA synthesized, labelled and hybridized to tiling arrays.

However, in the absence of a cytokinetic ring, these chromatin bridges were no longer severed upon mitotic exit. Instead, since fission yeast cells undergo a closed mitosis, chromatin bridges collapsed into a single nucleus as cells exited mitosis. As a consequence, the gain or loss of chromosomal fragments and the production of post-mitotic cells with unbalanced karyotypes were suppressed when cytokinesis was prevented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Remarkably, parallel RNA-seq analysis revealed that ~98% of the RNAs up-regulated in the <italic>cut14-208</italic> single mutant were no-longer detected as differentially expressed in the <italic>cut14-208 cdc15-140</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>).

Finally, we found that <italic>cdc12-112,</italic> another mutation that also impairs cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 1997</xref>), equally restored normal gene expression in the <italic>cut14-208</italic> genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>), which confirms that cytokinesis was a driving force for the gene deregulation exhibited by the <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant. Taken together, these data indicate that changes in mRNA and ncRNA levels exhibited by <italic>cut14-208</italic> condensin mutant cells are mostly, if not entirely, the consequence of chromosome cleavage during cytokinesis.</p><p>The severing of chromosomes by the cytokinetic ring leads not only to DNA damage, as revealed by the accumulation of sustained Rad22-GFP foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but also to the formation of genomically unbalanced daughter cells, as shown by FACScan analysis of DNA contents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Both phenotypes coincide with the increase in RNA levels, and both are suppressed by <italic>cdc15-140</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To test whether one or both might be responsible for gene deregulation in <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells, we analysed by RT-qPCR the impact of DNA damage upon mitotic exit, or of genomic imbalance, on gene expression in cells provided with a fully functional condensin. To damage DNA, we synchronized cells in prometaphase by using the cryosensitive mutation <italic>nda3-KM311</italic> and then released them into mitosis in the presence of the drug Camptothecin to induce DNA breaks during S phase, which, in fission yeast, overlaps with cytokinesis and septum formation. In an alternative experiment, we treated wild-type cycling cells with Zeocin. The appearance of sustained Rad22-GFP foci in cells treated with Camptothecin or Zeocin confirmed the accumulation of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, RT-qPCR revealed no increase in ncRNA or mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>), arguing that DNA damage is not the main driver for gene deregulation in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells. To test the impact of genomic imbalance on gene expression, we used the thermosensitive <italic>mis6-302</italic> mutation which disrupts kinetochore assembly, and hence accurate chromosome segregation during anaphase, leading to the production of aneuploid post-mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saitoh et al., 1997</xref>). Note that <italic>mis6-302</italic> causes neither chromatin bridges nor a CUT phenotype. FACScan analysis of <italic>mis6-302</italic> cells grown at the restrictive temperature confirmed the appearance of genomically unbalanced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Remarkably, RT-qPCR of four reporter RNAs revealed a similar increase in <italic>mis6-302</italic> cells as in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This argues that chromosome missegregation during mitosis, which results from condensin inactivation, can lead to gene deregulation.</p><p>It has been reported that the expression of six different families of tRNAs, as measured by RT-PCR, is modestly increased in <italic>cut3-477</italic> condensin mutant cells grown at the restrictive temperature of 36°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iwasaki et al., 2010</xref>). We sought to revisit this observation and examined our RNA-seq data sets for tRNA levels. However, we obtained too few exploitable reads mapping within repeated tRNA genes, possibly because small, structured and extensively post-transcriptionally-modified tRNAs necessitate dedicated protocols to be analysed by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wilusz, 2015</xref>). We therefore assessed tRNA levels by RT-qPCR. We selected five reporter tRNAs, amongst which three – SER, SER+MET and LEU – have previously been found to be up-regulated in <italic>cut3-477</italic> condensin mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iwasaki et al., 2010</xref>). We measured the steady state levels of these five families of tRNAs in six different condensin mutant strains – <italic>cnd1-175</italic>, <italic>cut3-i23</italic>, <italic>cut3-477</italic>, <italic>cut3-m26</italic>, <italic>cut14-90</italic> and <italic>cut14-208</italic> – ranked by increasing frequency of chromosome missegregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Although we could not detect any significant change in tRNA levels in <italic>cut3-477</italic> cells, we observed a clear increase in <italic>cut3-m26</italic>, <italic>cut14-90</italic> and <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The increase correlated with the frequency of chromosome missegregation and with the accumulation of mRNAs and ncRNAs (compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). The <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutation exhibited the strongest penetrance. Importantly, preventing aneuploidy in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells by using the <italic>cdc15-140</italic> mutation restored a normal steady state level of these tRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Conversely, non-condensin mutations that disrupted chromosome segregation, such as <italic>ptr4-1</italic>, <italic>cut9-665</italic> or <italic>mis6-302</italic>, resulted in a similar increase in tRNA levels as in <italic>cut14-208</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). We noticed, however, that the effects of <italic>ptr4-1</italic> and <italic>cut9-665</italic> were more comparable to the <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutation than to the <italic>mis6-302</italic> mutation, which did not upregulate the tRNAs SER +MET and THR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This difference between <italic>cut14-208</italic> and <italic>mis6-302</italic> is unlikely to be caused by DNA damage that occurs in <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells upon mitotic exit, as neither Camptothecin nor Zeocin treatment increased tRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Co-immunostaining of Rrp6 tagged with a myc epitope and Gar2 tagged with GFP confirmed the nuclear localisation of Rrp6 and its marked enrichment within the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

Here, we challenge the idea that condensin complexes directly regulate transcription by providing compelling evidence that the functional integrity of condensin is dispensable for the maintenance of proper gene expression during interphase and even mitosis in fission and budding yeasts. Consistent with previous studies, we show that condensin deficiency alters the transcriptome of post-mitotic cells in fission yeast. However, this effect is mostly, if not entirely, the indirect consequence of chromosome missegregation during anaphase. Our findings therefore indicate that condensin plays no direct role in the control of gene expression in fission and budding yeasts, but is essential for the maintenance of proper gene expression by contributing to the accurate segregation of chromosomes during mitosis.</p><p>Strand-specific RNA-seq and RT-qPCR analyses reveal that <italic>cut14-208</italic> condensin mutant cells accumulate tRNAs, mRNAs, ncRNAs and 3’-extended read-through transcripts. Other condensin mutants such as <italic>cut3-m26</italic>, <italic>cut14-90</italic> and <italic>cut14-180</italic> exhibit similar increases in RNA levels, arguing that condensin takes part in proper gene expression in fission yeast, similar to other organisms. The population of <italic>cut14-208</italic> condensin mutant cells that exhibited increased RNA levels went through G2, M, G1, and S phases at the restrictive temperature in an asynchronous manner before their RNA was extracted and analysed. However, when <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells were synchronised at S or G2 phase or even at metaphase, RNA levels remained unchanged. Moreover, the prevalent suppressive effect of <italic>cdc15-140</italic> upon <italic>cut14-208</italic> on changes in gene expression argues that condensin impinges on gene expression in a cytokinesis-dependent manner, and therefore in an indirect manner. Importantly, it also implies that condensin deficiency makes by itself no predominant impact on the steady state level of RNAs in post-mitotic cells. Thus, although we cannot rule out the possibility that subtle impacts of condensin on the dynamics of transcription might have escaped our detection, our data strongly indicate that condensin plays no major direct role in the maintenance of proper gene expression during interphase or during mitosis in fission yeast. Concordantly, we show that also in budding yeast, condensin is largely dispensable for the maintenance of gene expression programs during the G1 phase or during metaphase. Importantly, our results are in agreement with a recent report that the global transcriptional program of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is largely insensitive to condensin depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Paul et al., 2018</xref>). Note that the separation of the budding and fission yeast lineages is thought to have occurred ~420 million years ago, which makes them as distant from each other as either is from animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sipiczki, 2000</xref>). Thus, in two evolutionarily distant organisms, condensin complexes play no major direct role in the maintenance of an established gene expression program.</p><p>The corollary is that the increased RNA levels exhibited by fission yeast cells defective for condensin must be the indirect consequence of a failure during late mitosis caused by a lack of condensin activity. Indeed, RNA levels increase coincidently with mitotic exit in synchronized condensin mutants and the amplitude of the increase correlates with the prevalence of chromosome missegregation during anaphase. Furthermore, suppressing the production of genetically unbalanced daughter cells by the cytokinesis mutation <italic>cdc15-140</italic> is sufficient to restore an almost normal transcriptome, despite condensin being impaired by the <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutation. Reciprocally, preventing proper chromosome segregation by mutations in separase (<italic>ptr4-1</italic>), the APC/C (<italic>cut9-665</italic>) or the kinetochore (<italic>mis6-302</italic>) is sufficient to trigger the accumulation of aberrant transcripts alike in <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells. Therefore, the missegregation of chromosomes during anaphase appears to be the principal responsible mechanism for the changes in RNA levels exhibited by condensin mutant cells.</p><p>A clear illustration of the impact of chromosome missegregation is provided by the non-disjunction of the duplicated copies of the rDNA, which depletes the RNA-exosome from daughter cells and leads to the accumulation of cellular RNAs. Indeed, we show (1) that sister-rDNAs systematically fail to disjoin during anaphase in <italic>cut14-208</italic> condensin mutant cells, leading to the production of anucleolate daughter cells; (2) Rrp6 and Dis3, which are enriched in the nucleolus, become depleted from anucleolate <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells; (3) the reduction of Rrp6 and Dis3 from anucleolate condensin mutant cells coincides with an increased steady state level of RNA-exosome-sensitive transcripts; and (4) an RNA-exosome sensitive transcript, the antisense RNA <italic>mug93as,</italic> accumulates principally if not exclusively in anucleolate condensin mutant cells, as expected from an impaired degradation. It is important to note that Rrp6 and Dis3 are reduced but not eliminated from anucleolated <italic>cut14-208</italic> condensin mutant cells. Knowing that Rrp6 accumulates predominantly on chromosomes during mitosis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Graham et al., 2009</xref>), we propose that the bulk of Rrp6 and Dis3 might similarly co-segregate with the nucleolus in fission yeast, while a fraction is presumably transmitted to daughter cells in association with chromatin or within the nucleoplasm. The co-depletion of Rrp6 and Dis3 from anucleolate <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells provides a straightforward explanation as to why the transcriptomes of the <italic>cut14-208</italic> and <italic>rrp6Δ</italic> strains overlap only partially, and to the slight additive effect exhibited by the <italic>cut14-208</italic> and <italic>rrp6Δ</italic> mutations with respect to the accumulation of <italic>mug93as</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and of 3’-extented <italic>hsp9</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). It can also explain why <italic>mug93as</italic> RNA accumulated to the highest levels in anucleolate cells with low chromatin amount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>Based on these observations, we propose the model depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Condensin deficiency impairs chromosome segregation during anaphase, and notably leads to chromatin bridges and the non-disjunction of the rDNA. Upon mitotic exit, this failure to properly segregate chromosomes alters the karyotype of daughter cells and creates an aneuploid condition that changes the cellular RNA content. In particular, Rrp6 and Dis3 which are enriched in the nucleolus during mitosis become depleted from anucleolate daughter cells. This reduces the activity of the RNA-exosome, allowing the accumulation of RNA molecules that are normally actively degraded by the RNA-exosome, such as ncRNAs and 3’-extended RNAs. This sequence of events illustrate how chromosome missegregation caused by condensin deficiency indirectly changes cellular RNA contents in fission yeast.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38517.017</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Condensin deficiency impinges upon gene expression by promoting accurate chromosome segregation throughout mitosis.</title><p>In wild-type fission yeast cells, Rrp6 and Dis3, the catalytic subunits of the RNA-exosome, are enriched in the nucleolus and a large fraction co-segregates with the bulk of the rDNA during anaphase. In condensin mutant cells, chromosomes fail to properly segregate during anaphase. Chromatin bridges are formed and entangled sister-rDNA copies fail to separate, leading to the production of karyotypically aberrant cells, whose aneuploid condition changes the transcriptome.

Premalignant murine T-cells defective for condensin II exhibit a transcriptome evocative of a stress response to aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Woodward et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, the depletion of Smc2, and hence the reduction of both condensin I and II, in a human neuroblastoma cell line modifies the expression of a large number of genes implicated mainly in cell cycle progression or DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murakami-Tonami et al., 2014</xref>). However, we did not observed such a clear transcriptomic signature in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells. One possible explanation is that condensin deficiency causes mostly the severing of chromosome arms by the cytokinetic ring in fission yeast, which presumably leads to the gain or loss of chromosomal fragments rather than of entire chromosomes. The resulting partial- or micro-aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pfau and Amon, 2012</xref>) might, in contrast to a whole chromosomal aneuploidy, not elicit a robust aneuploidy stress response, which presumably stems from the concomitant change in number of many genes that have little impact when varied individually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Santaguida and Amon, 2015</xref>). That different types of aneuploidy might have varying impacts on the transcriptome might also explain the slight differences we observed between the tRNA contents of <italic>cut14-208</italic> and <italic>mis6-302</italic> mutant cells, which missegregate entire chromosomes. In any cases, multiple mechanisms linked to chromosome instability and the genesis of aberrant karyotypes most likely concur to modify the transcriptome when condensin is defective. For instance, the slight up-regulation of histone genes that we observed in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells has previously been attributed to an indirect stabilization of the transcription factor Ams2 during defective anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our finding that condensin prevents the accumulation of 3’ extended read-though RNAs is reminiscent of the role played by cohesin in the termination of transcription at convergent genes. Probably pushed by active RNA Pol II, cohesin accumulates at intergenic regions that are flanked by co-transcribed convergent genes, where it prevents transcription to proceed beyond canonical termination sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gullerova and Proudfoot, 2008</xref>). It is important to note that in the case of unidirectional transcription, read-through RNAs are produced in a cohesin–independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gullerova and Proudfoot, 2008</xref>), implying that cohesin plays the role of a roadblock for RNA polymerases specifically at the 3’ends of co-transcribed convergent genes. Our observation that cohesin remains bound to chromatin in <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells, including at convergent genes that exhibit read-through transcripts, plus the lack of any noticeable increase in Pol II occupancy, argue that condensin is unlikely to prevent read-thought transcripts through a same mechanism. The fact that 43% of read-through RNAs originate from genes oriented in tandem in <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells further support this conclusion. Thus, besides cohesin-dependent termination, another pathway dependent upon condensin must also exist that prevents read-through transcripts. However, and crucially, condensin is unlikely to play a direct role in this second pathway, since <italic>cdc15-140 cut14-208</italic> double mutant cells no longer accumulate read-through RNAs. Furthermore, given that <italic>cut14-208</italic> reduces the binding of condensin to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nakazawa et al., 2015</xref>), the lack of read-through RNAs in <italic>cdc15-140 cut14-208</italic> cells suggests that condensin is unlikely to exert any major roadblock effect on active RNA polymerases. The overlap between <italic>cut14-208</italic> and <italic>rrp6Δ</italic> cells suggests instead that it is the degradation of read-through transcripts that is impaired. Read-through transcripts are produced in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gullerova and Proudfoot, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zofall et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore propose that read-through RNAs are naturally produced both at tandem and convergent genes in wild-type cells, but are rapidly degraded by Rrp6. Chromosome missegregation during mitosis caused by condensin deficiency induces their accumulation, despite the presence of cohesin, at least in part by depleting Rrp6 from karyotypically abnormal daughter cells.</p><p>Our finding that sister-rDNA almost systematically non-disjoin during anaphase in fission yeast condensin mutant cells is consistent with the severe missegregation of the rDNA observed in budding yeast and human cells deprived of functional condensin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D'Ambrosio et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freeman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Samoshkin et al., 2012</xref>), and with the idea that decatenation of sister-rDNA during late anaphase relies upon condensin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D'Ambrosio et al., 2008a</xref> ). In that context, the asymmetric partitioning of the ribonuclease Dis3 that we observed in budding yeast daughter cells after the inactivation of condensin by TEV cleavage can be reasonably interpreted as a consequence of a failure to disjoin sister-rDNA during anaphase. In addition, it has been reported that mutations affecting condensin generate anucleolate cells that accumulate polyadenylated RNAs in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Paul and Montpetit, 2016</xref>). Therefore, the missegregation of the rDNA that frequently occurs during anaphase when condensin is impaired presumably impinges upon gene expression in budding yeast, alike in fission yeast.</p><p>One related aspect that remains puzzling, however, is that chromatin bridges are almost systematically severed by the cytokinetic ring in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells, while the severing of the nucleolus is extremely infrequent (&lt;10% of the cases). The persistence of the nucleolus in the axis of cleavage might mechanically hinder cytokinesis, or trigger a wait signal. Alternatively, condensin deficiency might cause DNA double-strand breaks at fragile sites located on the centromere-proximal border of the cluster of rDNA repeats, allowing the displacement of untangled sister-rDNA towards one pole of the mitotic spindle through a spring-relaxation effect. A focused role for condensin in organising a region proximal to the rDNA, and located on its centromeric side, has been reported in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>). In HeLa cells, the depletion of SMC2 induces DNA breaks predominantly in repetitive DNA, including the rDNA/Nucleolar Organising Regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Samoshkin et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, missegregation of the rDNA in budding and fission yeast cells when condensin is impaired might reveal an evolutionarily-conserved acute dependency of repeated DNA elements upon condensin for their segregation and integrity. Given the prevalence of tandem repetitive DNA arrays in mammalian genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Warburton et al., 2008</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that condensin loss of function might have similar confounding impacts on the preservation of their structural integrity and proper expression.</p><p>Studies performed over the past 20 years have shown that the three-dimensional organisation of the genome influences gene expression, raising the key question of the role played by SMC complexes in the control of gene expression. A large number of studies have concluded in favour of a role for cohesin and condensin I and II in the control of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dowen and Young, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Merkenschlager and Nora, 2016</xref>), raising the idea that cohesin and condensins might collectively link gene expression to genome architecture. Although there are robust examples of cohesin-mediated regulation of cell-type-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Merkenschlager and Nora, 2016</xref>), for instance through enhancer-to-promoter interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ing-Simmons et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kagey et al., 2010</xref>), a recent study has raised the idea that the involvement of cohesin in the maintenance of an established gene expression program might be less prominent than initially thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rao et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, despite ample reports of cells defective for condensin I or II exhibiting changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhalla et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dowen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iwasaki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kranz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Longworth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lupo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murakami-Tonami et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rawlings et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yuen et al., 2017</xref>), to the best of our knowledge, there has thus far been no clear case where the influence of condensin I or II on gene expression has been dissociated from a possible confounding effect of chromosome missegregation. By providing evidence that condensin plays no major direct role in the control of gene expression in fission and budding yeasts, and showing that condensin impinges on gene expression by preserving the stability of the genome during mitosis, our work challenges the concept of gene regulation as a collective property of SMC complexes, and should help to better define future studies on the role of canonical condensins in gene expression in other organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic background (S. pombe)</td><td>972 h-</td><td>NA</td><td>245818 [UID] 391418 [GenBank] 245818 [RefSeq]</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic background <break/>(S. cerevisiae)</td><td>W303</td><td>NA</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagents (yeast strains)</td><td>See <break/><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref></td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td valign="bottom">Anti-tubulin (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="bottom">Keith Gull</td><td>TAT1</td><td>(1:50)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-myc (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Thermo Fisher</td><td>#9E10</td><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-HA (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>#12CA5</td><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-GFP (rabbit <break/>polyclonal)</td><td>Life Technologies</td><td>#A11122</td><td>(1:800 for IF and <break/>6 μg / IP for <break/>ChIP)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-ser2P RNAPII (rabbit <break/>polyclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>#ab5095</td><td>6 μg / IP</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-HA (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Covance</td><td>16B12 (anti-HA.11)</td><td>1.5 µl / 50 µl <break/>beads</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-PK (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Abd Serotec</td><td>MCA1360</td><td valign="bottom">2 µl / 50 µl beads</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref></td><td>Sigma</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial <break/>assay or kit</td><td>Dynabeads protein A</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>#10002D</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial <break/>assay or kit</td><td valign="bottom">In vitro transcription kit for probe labelling</td><td>Ambion/Thermo Fisher</td><td valign="bottom">T7 riboprobe system (AM1312)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>3-BrB-PP1</td><td>Toronto Research Canada</td><td>A602985</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, <break/>algorithm</td><td>RNA seq <break/>analysis</td><td>This study</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/LBMC/readthroughpombe">https://github.com/LBMC/readthroughpombe</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Media, molecular genetics and strains</title><p>Media and molecular genetics methods were as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moreno et al., 1991</xref>).

Reversible prometaphase arrest was performed at 19°C using the cold‐sensitive <italic>nda3‐KM311</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hiraoka et al., 1984</xref>). Metaphase arrest was achieved in PMG medium supplemented with thiamine 20 µM using the thiamine repressible <italic>nmt41-slp1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Petrova et al., 2013</xref>). Mitotic indexes were measured as the percentages of mitotic cells accumulating Cnd2‐GFP in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sutani et al., 1999</xref>). Budding yeast cells were grown at 30°C in YEPD to mid-log phase, collected by filtration, washed with ddH<sub>2</sub>O, and re-suspended at an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.30 in YEPD containing 3 µg/ml α-factor. After one hour, additional α-factor was added to 3 µg/ml. After another hour, an aliquot of cells was used for ChIP (G1 sample) and the remaining cells were collected by filtration, washed with dH<sub>2</sub>O and re-suspended in YEPD to release the cells from the G1 arrest. 30 min after and 60 min after the release, aliquots were collected for ChIP (S phase sample and G2 sample respectively). Budding yeast strains expressing TEV protease under the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter were grown at 30°C in YEP medium containing 2% raffinose (YEP-R) to mid-log phase, collected by filtration, washed with ddH<sub>2</sub>O, and re-suspended at an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.15 in YEP-R containing 3 µg/ml α-factor. After one hour, additional α-factor was added to 3 µg/ml. After 30 min, the cultures were split and TEV protease expression was induced in one half by addition of 2% galactose. After another 30 min, cells were collected by filtration, washed with dH<sub>2</sub>O and re-suspended in YEP-R (uninduced) or YEP-R with 2% galactose (YEP-RG; induced) with 3 µg/ml α-factor. Fresh α-factor was added to 3 µg/ml after another hour to all cultures and ChIP samples were collected one hour later.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Microscopy</title><p>To quantify anucleolate cells, cells expressing Gar2-mCherry and Psy1-GFP fusion proteins were fixed with cold methanol and DNA was stained with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) at 0.5 μg/ml in PEM buffer (100 mM PIPES, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO4, pH 6.9). Gar2-mCherry and Psy1-GFP were directly observed under the fluorescent microscope. Rad22-GFP foci were analysed on cells fixed with iced-cold methanol and stained with DAPI. Cytological analysis of the CUT phenotype was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hagan, 2016</xref>) except that cells were fixed with cold methanol and stained with Hoechst 33342 (20 μg/ml). Immunofluorescence was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Robellet et al., 2014</xref>), with the following modifications. Cells shifted at 36°C for 2h30 min were fixed with ice-cold ethanol and stored at 4°C. 2 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells were washed in PEMS (PEM +1.2 M Sorbitol) and digested with Zymolyase 100T (0.4 mg/ml in PEMS) for 30 min at 37°C. Images were processed and quantified using ImageJ with automated background subtraction.</p><p>Aliquots of budding yeast cells grown in YEP-RG media were transferred to Concavalin A-coated Cellview slides (Advanced TC, Greiner Bio-One). After 20 min, cells were washed twice and covered with SC media containing 2% raffinose and 2% galactose medium for live cell imaging. Images were acquired on an LSM780 with a 63×, 1.4 NA, Oil Plan Apochromat objective (Zeiss) controlled by ZEN 2012 software. The microscope was equipped with an incubation chamber (EMBL) and heated to 30°C. The pinhole was entirely opened and 7 z-slices with a distance of 1 µm were recorded.</p><p>Dis3-mNeonGreen fluorescence measurements were performed in Fiji. The z-section with the highest Dis3-mNeonGreen fluorescence was manually determined and a maximum projection of this plus the previous and following slices were performed. All cells where mother and daughter cells were in focus and at least one small bud was present in the mother or daughter cell (to ensure that chromosome segregation had been completed) were marked in the transmission channel and used for analysis. The Dis3 signal was then measured in circular 50 × 50 px ROIs in the mother and daughter cell. After background subtraction (determined as the mean of four 50 × 50 px ROIs in the cell-free region), the ratio of the Dis3 signal in the daughter cells and mother cell was calculated and plotted. Since samples were normally distributed according to a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, but variances were different according to Levene’s test (α = 0.05), an unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction was chosen to test for statistical significance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>FACScan</title><p>2 × 10<sup>6</sup> fission yeast cells were fixed with ethanol 70% (v/v), washed in sodium citrate (50 mM pH 7) and digested with RNase A (100 µg/ml) (Merck). Cells were briefly sonicated and stained with 1 μM Sytox Green (ThermoFischer Scientific). DNA content was quantified on a FACSCALIBUR cytometer using CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences). Raw data were analyzed with FlowJo software (BD biosciences). FACScan analysis of budding yeast cells was performed as previously described after staining DNA with either propidium iodide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuylen et al., 2011</xref>) or SYBR green I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuylen et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR</title><p>ChIP against fission yeast RNA Pol II (S2P) was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vanoosthuyse et al., 2014</xref>) using 2 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells fixed with 1% formaldehyde at 36°C for 5 min and then 19°C for 25 min. ChIP against Psm3-GFP was performed on cells fixed with 3% formaldehyde at 36°C for 30 min, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhardwaj et al., 2016</xref>). Fixed cells were washed with PBS and lysed using acid‐washed glass beads in a Precellys homogenizer. Chromatin was sheared into 300‐ to 900‐bp fragments by sonication using a Diagenode bioruptor. Sheared chromatin was split in two equivalent fractions subjected to parallel immunoprecipitations using magnetic Dynabeads coated with the appropriate antibody. Total and immunoprecipitated DNA was purified using the NucleoSpin PCR clean‐up kit (Macherey‐Nagel). DNA was analysed on a Rotor‐Gene PCR cycler using QuantiFast SYBR Green mix. ChIP-qPCR experiments for budding yeast cells were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuylen et al., 2011</xref>). In brief, aliquots of 42 ml culture with an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6 were fixed in 3% formaldehyde at 16°C. Chromatin was sonicated to an average length of 500 bp using a Diagenode bioruptor. For anti-HA immunoprecipitation, 50 µl protein G dynabeads and 1.5 µl 16B12 antibody (anti-HA.11, Covance) were used. For anti-PK immunoprecipitation, 50 µl protein A dynabeads and 2 µl anti-PK (V5) tag antibody (Abd Serotec MCA1360) were used. Purified DNA was analysed with an ABI 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using rDNA-specific primers.

After one hour, additional α-factor was added to 3 µg/ml. After another hour, an aliquot of cells was used for chromosome spreading (G1 sample) and the remaining cells were collected by filtration, washed with dH<sub>2</sub>O and re-suspended into YEPD to release the cells from the G1 arrest. Aliquots were collected for chromosome spreading 30 min and 60 min after the release (S and G2 phase samples, respectively). Chromosome spreads were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuylen et al., 2011</xref>) and stained for Brn1-HA<sub>6</sub> with 16B12 (anti-HA.11, Covance, 1:500) and Alexa Fluor 594–labelled anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, 1:600) antibodies and for DNA with DAPI.

For northern blotting, total or RNase H-digested RNA was resolved on 1% agarose gel supplemented with formaldehyde 0.7% (v/v), transferred onto Hybond-XL nylon membranes (Amersham) and cross-linked. Pre-hybridization and overnight hybridization were carried out in ULTRAhyb buffer (Ambion) at 68°C. Strand-specific RNA probes were generated by in vitro transcription using the T7 riboprobe system (Ambion) and internally labelled with [α−32P]-UTP. Membranes were quickly washed with 2X SSC and 0.1% SDS, 10 min in 2X SSC and 0.1% SDS, and 3 times in 0.2X SSC and 0.1% SDS. Blots were imaged with Typhoon 8600 instrument (Molecular Dynamics) and quantified with ImageQuant TL (GE Healthcare).</p><p>Single molecule RNA Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (smFISH), imaging and quantification smFISH was performed on formaldehyde-fixed cells, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keifenheim et al., 2017</xref>).

Probe sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. Cells were imaged on a Leica TCS Sp8, using a 63x/1.40 oil objective, Optical z sections were acquired (z-step size 0.3 microns) for each scan to cover the depth of the cells. For image analysis and quantification, cell boundaries were outlined manually and RNA spots quantified using FISH-quant package implemented in MATLAB, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>). The FISH-quant detection technical error was estimated at 6 – 7% by quantifying mRNA numbers using two sets of probes covering the 5’ half or the 3’ half of the <italic>rpb1</italic> mRNA and labelled with different dyes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>RNA-seq and analysis</title><p>RNA-seq was performed on biological triplicates. Total RNA was extracted from 2 × 10<sup>8</sup> yeast cells by standard hot‐phenol method. RNA quality was determined using TapeStation (Agilent) with RINe score &gt;9. Ribosomal RNA was removed by treating 2 µg of total RNA with the Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit (Yeast) (MRZY1324, Illumina, Paris, France). RNA-seq libraries were prepared using TruSeq Stranded kit. Sequencing was performed on Illumina Hiseq 4000, with single-end reads of 50 nt in length. Total number of reads per sample ranged from 59 million to 93 million. For in-silico analyses, we used the version ASM294v2.30 of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> genome in fasta format and the corresponding gff3 annotations downloaded from the ebi website (2017/03/22). Scripts are available in the following git repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/LBMC/readthroughpombe.">https://github.com/LBMC/readthroughpombe</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Modolo, 2018</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/readthroughpombe">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/readthroughpombe</ext-link>). The RNA-seq reads were processed with cutadapt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martin, 2011</xref>) to remove adaptors and further trimmed with UrQt (--t 20) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Modolo and Lerat, 2015</xref>) based on their quality. After quality control with fastqc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews, 2010</xref>), we built the reverse complement of the reads in the fastq files using seqkit, indexed the genome (-build) and mapped the trimmed fastq files (--very-sensitive) using Bowtie2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>). Mapping output files were saved in bam format with samtools (view -Sb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>To detect read-through events, we searched for sections of reads located immediately downstream of the 3’ ends of annotated transcription units, on the same DNA strand, and within gene-free intergenic regions. First, broad peaks of RNA-seq reads were identified using the peak caller Music v6613c53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harmanci et al., 2014</xref>). Bam files were sorted and filtered as forward or reverse with samtools (view -hb -F 0 × 10 or view -hb -f 0 × 10). The gff annotation file was converted to bed with convert2bed from bedtools, the genome indexed with samtools (faidx) and the annotation file split into forward and reverse with bedtools (complement). Next, reads corresponding to annotated transcripts were removed using samtools view (-hb bams -L annotation). Subtracted bam files were sorted with samtools sort, and RNA-seq peaks located outside annotated transcripts were detected with Music (-get_per_win_p_vals_vs_FC -begin_l 50 -end_l 500 -step 1.1 l_mapp 50 l_frag 363 -q_val 1 l_p 0). The resulting annotation was further filtered by removing peaks whose starting positions were located more than two read-length away from the nearest 3’end of a transcript. Only peaks detected in at least 2 out of 3 biological replicates were considered. Read-through detection was performed independently for the <italic>rrp6Δ</italic> and <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutants. To achieve comparable examination between <italic>rrp6Δ</italic> and <italic>cut14-208</italic> for reads quantification, we merged their respective read-through annotations and sorted them with bedtools (sort) and extracted the forward and reverse reads from the bam files with bedtools (bamtofastq). We generated the list of transcript sequences from the genome and the annotation with bedtools (getfasta -s). The transcript sequences were then indexed with kallisto (index-k 31 --make-unique) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bray et al., 2016</xref>) and the quantification achieved with kallisto (quant –single -l 363.4 s 85.53354). Quantifications were performed separately on the transcript alone and on the transcript plus read-through annotation.</p><p>Quantifications in mutant strains compared to wt were performed using the package DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Love et al., 2014</xref>) with R (v3.4.4). For differential expression analyses, we tested for log2 fold change superior to 0.5 or inferior to −0.5. For read-through events, we tested for a log2 fold change superior to 0 compared to the wild type to declare the read-through present in the mutant background. For all analyses, we selected p-values with an FDR <underline>≤</underline> 0.05. The package ggplot2 (v2.2.1) was used for graphics. The orientation of genes was analysed with R scripts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>High-resolution tiling arrays</title><p>For transcriptome analysis in G1 phase, <italic>Δbar1</italic> cells were grown at 30°C in YEP-R to mid-log phase, collected by filtration, washed with dH<sub>2</sub>O, and re-suspended at an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.3 – 0.4 in YEP-R containing 3 µg/ml α-factor.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Job Dekker as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript investigates the role of condensin in regulation of gene expression using fission and budding yeast as model systems. A role for condensins in gene expression has been suggested by many studies but the actual mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this study, the authors conducted a series of challenging experiments by depleting condensin in cells and assaying RNA expression at various phases of the cell cycle. This allowed them to make the following conclusions: First, they show that major changes in gene expression are only observed when condensin depleted cells are allowed to complete cytokinesis. They then present evidence that condensin does not play a direct role in regulation of gene expression but rather manifests its effects through problems with accurate chromosome segregation. Finally, they claim that missegregation of rDNA, and thus the unequal distribution of nuclear exosome components within the daughter cells, is the major contributor towards the observed differential expression in fission yeast.</p><p>Overall, all three reviewers agreed that the manuscript is well written and experiments are clearly described. The analyses are rigorous and mostly support the major conclusions drawn by the authors. However, there are some issues which need to be addressed:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The strongest part of the work is the analysis of <italic>S. pombe</italic>, while the analysis of budding yeast was less extensive. The authors should either completely remove all the analysis of budding yeast, or add significant new data to strengthen that part of the manuscript.</p><p>2) The authors should better relate their data to previous studies, e.g. tRNA expression changes and comparison of previously published RNA data in <italic>cut3-477</italic> cells.</p><p>3) Although the authors do show strong data that formation of anucleolate cell formation in condensin mutants can explain many effects on RNA levels, there are still observations that suggest that other processes may play roles as well. Specifically, a) other chromosome losses (other than loss of the nucleolus) can also occur (e.g. loss of the exosome encoding genes), b) some anucleolate cells do not display altered mug93as transcripts and c) not all condensin-dependent transcript changed depend on the RNA exosome. The authors should address, or at least discuss, these issues.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38517.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The strongest part of the work is the analysis of S. pombe, while the analysis of budding yeast was less extensive. The authors should either completely remove all the analysis of budding yeast, or add significant new data to strengthen that part of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the main focus of our work is the analysis of the consequences of condensin inactivation on gene transcription in fission yeast. The key purpose of the budding yeast experiments is to show that the major conclusion that condensin inactivation does not directly affect the expression of the bulk of genes in non-dividing cells, is correct also in an evolutionary distant organism. And this is precisely what the budding yeast experiments unambiguously show – without the necessity to repeat all experiments that we have performed in fission yeast in budding yeast.</p><p>Comparing budding and fission yeast in the context of this study is particularly relevant, because it allows to address the important question as to whether the ability (or not) of condensin to regulate gene expression is influenced by the dynamics of its chromosomal localisation during the cell cycle. Indeed condensin is mainly cytoplasmic during interphase and enriched on chromosomes during mitosis in fission yeast, while it is nuclear throughout the cell cycle in budding yeast. These different behaviours are reminiscent of the condensin I and II complexes in mammals. Therefore, showing that condensin plays no major role in the control of gene expression in both fission and budding yeasts rules out the possibility that the results obtained in fission yeast are caused by the specific cell cycle localisation of condensin in this species. Removing the budding yeast part of the work would, in our view, detrimentally weaken the message conveyed by the manuscript.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have now performed additional budding yeast experiments to demonstrate missegregation of exosome components also in this species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should better relate their data to previous studies, e.g. tRNA expression changes and comparison of previously published RNA data in cut3-477 cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have now fully addressed this point by analysing the expression level of tRNAs in condensin mutant strains. Please note that tRNA levels cannot be analysed by conventional RNA-seq, presumably because their small, structured and extensively-modified nature impose a dedicated protocol for retrotranscription (see Wilusz, 2015). We therefore used RT-qPCR, which has the advantage of allowing a direct comparison with the previous work of Iwazaki et al., 2010. To further strengthen the comparison, we have analysed 5 reporter tRNAs, amongst which three have been shown to accumulate in <italic>cut3-477</italic> mutant cells by Iwasaki et al. We measured the abundance of these 5 reporter tRNAs in six different condensin mutants, named <italic>cnd1-175, cut3-i23, cut3-477, cut3-m26, cut14-90</italic> and <italic>cut14-208</italic>, of increasing severity, as judged by their frequencies of chromosome missegregation.</p><p>We failed to detect any increase in tRNA levels in <italic>cut3-477</italic> cells grown at the restrictive temperature for 2.5 hours, and in that sense did not reproduce the results of Iwasaki et al. Please, note that in their published study, Iwazaki et al. shifted <italic>cut3-477</italic> cells to 36°C for 2 hours. Nevertheless, we observed robust increases of tRNA levels in the <italic>cut3-m26, cut14-90</italic> and <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells. Importantly, we collected evidence that the accumulation of tRNAs in condensin mutant cells is the indirect consequence of chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy. We found (1) that the amplitude of the increase in tRNA levels correlates with the frequency of chromosome missegregation, <italic>cut14-208</italic> being the most severely affected for both phenotypes, (2) that preventing the formation of aneuploid and anucleolate cells by the <italic>cdc15-140</italic> mutation restored normal levels of tRNAs in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells, despite condensin being impaired, and (3) that non-condensin mutations that disrupt accurate chromosome segregation, such as <italic>ptr4-1, cut9-665</italic> and <italic>mis6-302</italic>, all cause an increase in tRNA levels.</p><p>Thus, these new data corroborate our previous findings with RNA Pol II-transcribed mRNAs and ncRNAs. We therefore propose that the imbalance in genomic content that results from chromosome missegregation during mitosis is a major cause of the deregulation of most, if not all, cellular RNAs when condensin function is impaired. The results regarding tRNA levels are presented in the revised version of the manuscript in Figure 6 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1B, and in the last paragraph of the subsection “Gene expression changes in fission yeast condensin mutants are the result of a loss of genome integrity”.</p><p>Please note, however, that although tRNA levels were very similar to <italic>cut14-208</italic> in <italic>ptr4-1</italic> and <italic>cut9-665</italic> cells, we observed a difference in the level of two reporter tRNAs in <italic>mis6-302</italic> compared to <italic>cut14-208</italic>. This observation is consistent with the existence of gene-specific effects associated with the gain or loss of chromosomes (for reviews, see Pfau and Amon, 2012; Santaguida and Amon, 2015). It might also suggest that different variations of chromosome missegregation might have slightly different impacts on the whole transcriptome. This finding brought us to slightly revise the part of our Discussion section on the impact of aneuploidy on the transcriptome of condensin mutant cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Although the authors do show strong data that formation of anucleolate cell formation in condensin mutants can explain many effects on RNA levels, there are still observations that suggest that other processes may play roles as well. Specifically, a) other chromosome losses (other than loss of the nucleolus) can also occur (e.g. loss of the exosome encoding genes), b) some anucleolate cells do not display altered mug93as transcripts and c) not all condensin-dependent transcript changed depend on the RNA exosome. The authors should address, or at least discuss, these issues.</p></disp-quote><p>a) We agree that the loss of chromosomal fragments other than the rDNA/nucleolus most likely contribute to changes in the transcriptome of condensin mutant cells. This is what we have indicated in the first version of the manuscript. We have rephrased the Discussion to make this point clearer.</p><p>Regarding the loss of exosome-encoding genes, although this is formally possible, we would like to emphasize that, as we had mentioned in the first version of the manuscript (and Supplementary file 1), we did not detect any reduction in the mRNA levels neither of the exosome components, nor of the TRAMP components, at least at the level of the whole population of <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells. This is now indicated in the last paragraph of the subsection “Read-through transcripts accumulate upon condensin inactivation” (Supplementary file 1). Furthermore, given that <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells were allowed to go through a single cell cycle during the relatively short 2.5 h time-window of the experiment, we consider very unlikely that the loss of exosome-encoding genes might account for the changes in RNA levels that we measured in the whole population of cells by RNA-seq.</p><p>b) and c). We thank the reviewers for this comment. These two observations can be explained by the fact that both Rrp6 and Dis3 are reduced, but not totally eliminated from anucleolate <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells. The persistence of traces of Rrp6 and of Dis3 in anucleolate <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells can be clearly observed in Figure 7B (Rrp6) and Figure 7—figure supplement 1D (Dis3). This result implies that a fraction of the Rrp6 and Dis3 molecules is transmitted to daughter cells independently of the nucleolus, presumably in association with the bulk of chromatin, or within the nucleoplasm. The presence of residual Rrp6 and Dis3 molecules in anucleolate <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells provides a straightforward explanation to the fact that anucleolate cells with low chromatin amount, as judged by DAPI staining, exhibit the strongest mug93as FISH signals, and conversely why other anucleolate cells with high chromatin amounts show weak or no mug93as FISH signals. Note that the missegregation of the fragment of chromosome 2 that bears the <italic>mug93</italic> gene can also explain why some anucleolate cells do not exhibit a mug93as FISH signal.</p><p>The partial reduction of both Rrp6 and Dis3 in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells also explains why the transcriptomes of <italic>cut14-208</italic> and <italic>rrp6Δ</italic> cells overlap only partially, since only the RNA molecules that are the most sensitive to the dosage of Rrp6 (and to the dosage of Dis3), will accumulate in <italic>cut14-208</italic>. Other RNAs that are less sensitive to the reduction of Rrp6 will not accumulate in <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells, in contrast to <italic>rrp6Δ</italic> cells.</p><p>We agree this is an important point that needs to be made crystal clear. We now clearly mention this point in the second paragraph of the Results subsection “Non-disjunction of the rDNA during anaphase depletes the RNA-exosome from post-mitotic fission yeast cells and results in ncRNA accumulation”, and also in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
