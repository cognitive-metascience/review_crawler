Protein aggregates are also formed within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), although the fate of ER protein aggregates, specifically during cell division, is not well understood. By simultaneous visualization of both the ER itself and ER protein aggregates, we found that ER protein aggregates that induce ER stress are retained in the mother cell by activation of the ER Stress Surveillance (ERSU) pathway, which prevents inheritance of stressed ER. In contrast, under conditions of normal ER inheritance, ER protein aggregates can enter the daughter cell. Thus, whereas cytoplasmic protein aggregates are retained in the mother cell to protect the functional capacity of daughter cells, the fate of ER protein aggregates is determined by whether or not they activate the ERSU pathway to impede transmission of the cortical ER during the cell cycle.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06970.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06970.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06970.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many species of yeast form new cells by a process known as budding in which a small daughter cell ‘buds’ out of a larger mother cell. Mothers can only produce a limited number of buds before they die of old age. However, age is reset in the daughters to ensure that they are fully rejuvenated when born. Therefore, the mother cell needs to prevent the factors that cause aging and cell damage from entering the daughter.</p><p>Inside cells, proteins are made and folded correctly in a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. If proteins are not folded properly, they are normally rapidly destroyed. However, if a cell requires lots of proteins to be made quickly, this can sometimes overwhelm and ‘stress’ the endoplasmic reticulum. When this occurs, proteins start misfolding and clump up to form toxic aggregates, some of which collect inside the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p>The Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Surveillance (ERSU) pathway monitors the health of the endoplasmic reticulum and prevents ‘stressed’ endoplasmic reticulum from entering daughter cells, which can cause them to die. By visualizing the endoplasmic reticulum and the aggregates contained within it during budding in the yeast species <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Piña and Niwa have now found that the ERSU pathway can also prevent these aggregates from entering daughter cells. However, if the ERSU pathway is not switched on—as may be the case if the level of endoplasmic reticulum stress is very low—then aggregates can enter the daughter cells. This is in contrast to protein aggregates that form elsewhere in the cell, which are normally always kept inside the mother cell due to their damaging effects.</p><p>These results suggest that the ERSU pathway is responsible for preventing protein aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum from entering daughter cells, but only does so when these aggregates stress the endoplasmic reticulum. Future research will aim to identify how the ERSU pathway senses protein aggregates and prevents the transmission of damaged endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06970.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06970.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>protein aggregates</kwd><kwd>ER stress</kwd><kwd>ER inheritance</kwd><kwd>ER Stress Surveillance</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>asymmetric cell division</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32AI007469-20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Niwa</surname><given-names>Maho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1GM087415</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Niwa</surname><given-names>Maho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>118765-RSG-10-027-01-CSM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Niwa</surname><given-names>Maho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) inheritance regulation during ER stress controls the transmission of misfolded ER proteins from mother to daughter cell in budding yeast.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Asymmetric cell division is a mechanism that generates cells with different properties. Specifically, in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, asymmetric cell division allows daughter cell rejuvenation while ensuring that cellular damage is left behind in the mother cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henderson and Gottschling, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spokoini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallagher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nystrom and Liu, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Recent studies have revealed that cytoplasmic protein aggregates are retained in the mother cell, although the underlying mechanism(s) that establishes such an asymmetric mode of inheritance remains to be fully elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, little is known about whether such asymmetric division is regulated during the cell cycle.</p><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a gateway for the secretory pathway in eukaryotic cells. Proteins that are secreted or reside within the organelles of the secretory pathway initiate their journey when they are translocated into the membrane or lumen of the ER. In the unique oxidizing environment of the ER, nascent polypeptides undergo chaperone assisted folding and modifications, such as glycosylation and formation of disulfide bonds, to become mature active proteins before exiting from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mori, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rutkowski and Kaufman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ron and Walter, 2007</xref>). In addition, the ER is a major site for lipid synthesis and storage of intracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mcmaster, 2001</xref>). Many of these ER functions must work in concert to satisfy cellular demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oakes and Papa, 2014</xref>). The unfolded protein response (UPR)-signaling pathway is a conserved response to ER stress and plays a critical role in maintaining ER function by up-regulating the transcription of genes coding for ER chaperones and protein-folding components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cox et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mori et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ron and Walter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, the ER cannot be synthesized <italic>de novo</italic> and is generated only from existing ER. Given the critical function of the ER, it seems likely that cell cycle regulatory mechanisms must exist to ensure inheritance of a fully functional ER during cell division.</p><p>Recently, we reported the existence of a cell cycle surveillance mechanism or ‘checkpoint’ in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that safeguards the inheritance of functional ER by the daughter cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bicknell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babour et al., 2010</xref>). Upon ER stress induction, activation of this ER Stress Surveillance (ERSU) pathway results in re-localization of the cytokinesis-associated septin complex away from the bud neck, leading to a block in ER inheritance and cytokinesis. We showed that the ERSU pathway is independent of the UPR and is mediated by the Slt2 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK). In the absence of Slt2, cells do not exhibit the block in ER inheritance and the septin ring remains at the bud neck following exposure to ER stress, similar to normally dividing, unstressed cells. Ultimately, however, <italic>slt2Δ</italic> cells are not able to sustain their growth due to the transmission of the stressed ER into the daughter cell. In fact, preventing ER transmission into <italic>slt2Δ</italic> daughter cells by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of actin polymerization can restore growth. Importantly, while Slt2 MAPK is known to play a role in the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway, we found that the ERSU and CWI pathways are completely distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babour et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Levin, 2011</xref>). The discovery of the ERSU pathway thus not only identified a novel cell cycle checkpoint that ensures the inheritance of functional ER but also raised a number of important questions about the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Furthermore, it is also unclear how the ER contents, including misfolded proteins, are segregated during the cell cycle. Under normal growth conditions, terminally misfolded proteins in the ER are retro-translocated into the cytoplasm and degraded by proteasomes in a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hampton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bukau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vembar and Brodsky, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thibault and Ng, 2012</xref>). When misfolded ER proteins are overexpressed or the ERAD function is diminished, the damaged proteins accumulate into large foci within the ER lumen. A recent study proposed that these large ‘aggregate’-like foci are selectively retained in the mother cell via a mechanism that depends on the lateral ER diffusion barrier established by the septin ring at the bud neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clay et al., 2014</xref>). Such lateral diffusion barriers between the mother and daughter yeast cells have been proposed to play pivotal roles in preventing undesirable materials, such as protein aggregates, from transferring to the daughter cells. While the exact mechanisms that establish the mother–daughter diffusion barrier remain to be elucidated, the barrier was reported to be formed as soon as the new bud emerges and depends on the bud site selection component GTPase, Bud1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clay et al., 2014</xref>). This study thus presented an attractive model suggesting that ER protein aggregate inheritance is regulated similarly to that of large protein aggregates in the cytoplasm, such as Q-bodies, JUNQ (juxta-nuclear quality control compartment) and IPOD (insoluble protein deposit), which are actively retained in the mother to protect the daughter cell from toxicity of the protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>). However, a potentially unique feature of ER protein aggregate inheritance is that it could be affected by inheritance of the ER itself. To further our understanding of how ER protein aggregates are divided between mother and daughter cells, we investigated the distribution of ER protein aggregates in relation to the inheritance of the ER.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ER inheritance drives the transmission of ER protein aggregates into the daughter cell</title><p>To investigate the distribution of both the ER and ER protein aggregates between the mother and daughter cell, we monitored the distribution of a mutant form of the vacuolar protein carboxypeptidase Y (CPY*) fused to mRFP in cells also expressing Hmg1-GFP, a well-characterized ER marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Finger et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nishikawa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spear and Ng, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clay et al., 2014</xref>). A single amino acid change in CPY* (G255R) leads to improper folding, and the protein accumulates in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Finger et al., 1993</xref>). Expression of CPY*-mRFP was placed under the control of the galactose (GAL1) promoter and induced by incubation in galactose-containing media. After 2 hr of induction, CPY*-mRFP formed aggregate-like foci that co-localized with both the cortical ER (cER) and perinuclear ER (pnER) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We quantitated and evaluated the number of CPY*-mRFP foci in individual cells according to the daughter cell (bud) size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A small number (&lt;20%) of cells with small bud size (less than 2 μm in length; classified as class I cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babour et al., 2010</xref>), transferred CPY* foci to the bud, while the majority of cells (∼80%) contained foci only in the mother (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, ∼50–60% of class II (medium sized buds, larger than 2 μm in length) and class III (large buds with the nucleus and pnER in the bud) cells transferred CPY* foci to the bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06970.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inheritance of CPY* and CFTR aggregates by daughter cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wild-type (WT) cells expressing galactose (Gal)-inducible CPY*-mRFP and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker Hmg1-GFP were grown in 2% (w/v) Gal for 2 hr and then visualized by microscopy.

GFP-CFTR foci were observed in the ER of cells expressing another well-characterized ER marker, DsRed-HDEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Significantly, most daughter cells, regardless of their class, inherited GFP-CFTR foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>).</p><p>Foci formed after expression of CPY* in yeast are often referred to and treated as protein aggregates without biochemical characterization. Therefore, we subjected CPY* foci to a well-established detergent extraction test commonly used to characterize protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberti et al., 2010</xref>). The crude cell extracts prepared from CPY*-mRFP- or GFP-CFTR-expressing cells were treated with or without detergent and then fractionated by differential centrifugation. The majority of CPY*-mRFP was found in the insoluble protein pellet fraction regardless of detergent pre-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Similar results were obtained for GFP-CFTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These data indicate that the CPY* and CFTR foci observed here meet the definition of protein aggregates according to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simons et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sondheimer and Lindquist, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nishikawa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberti et al., 2010</xref>), and we therefore refer to CPY*-mRFP and GFP-CFTR foci as aggregates throughout this study.</p><p>Because both CPY*-mRFP and GFP-CFTR form aggregates in the ER, we tested whether the difference in their transmission to daughter cells might lie in the different effects of the aggregates on ER function. Previous studies have reported that expression of CPY*, but not CFTR, induces the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaudhuri et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>). Indeed, we found that induction of CPY*-mRFP resulted in the expression of a UPR reporter (UPRE-GFP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lane 3), and this was further increased upon treatment of cells with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin (Tm), a well-characterized ER stress inducer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lane 4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cox et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mori et al., 1993</xref>). We also asked whether CPY* aggregates activate the ERSU pathway, which functions to ensure the inheritance of functional cER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babour et al., 2010</xref>). We found that a majority of the class I daughter cells did not inherit the cER under the ER stress condition evoked by CPY*-mRFP expression, and cER inheritance was also diminished in class II and III cells, but to a much lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Additionally, the magnitude of the cER inheritance block caused by CPY*-mRFP expression was less than that induced by Tm treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E,F</xref>). Finally, we found that 63% of class I, 73% of class II, and 60% of class III daughter cells containing the cER also contained CPY* aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>; yellow vs gray bars). Taken together, these data indicate that for CPY*-mRFP-expressing cells, more than 65% of buds that inherited ER also contained at least one CPY* aggregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Conversely, 57% of buds without aggregates also lacked the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, light blue vs gray).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06970.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Differential inheritance of CPY* and CFTR aggregates and cER by daughter cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CPY*-mRFP expression activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway.

Therefore, CFTR aggregation presented an opportunity to evaluate the transmission of ER protein aggregates independently of the ER inheritance block. Quantitation of the number of CFTR aggregates and cER in the mother and daughter cells showed that virtually all class I, II, and III daughter cells contained CFTR aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>: yellow and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>), indicating no preferential retention of CFTR aggregates by the mother cells. Thus, although CPY* and CFTR both form ER protein aggregates in yeast cells, preferential retention of aggregates was only observed in the CPY*-expressing cells, which also displayed the cER inheritance block. Finally, the cER inheritance block and asymmetric distribution of CFTR aggregates was observed in GFP-CFTR-expressing cells after Tm treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D–F,H</xref>), strengthening the relationship between ER inheritance and ER protein aggregate distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ER protein aggregate inheritance by daughter cells parallels the ER stress levels</title><p>Recently, it was reported that misfolded ER proteins were also retained in the mother cell when cells were exposed to relatively low levels of ER stress (0.5 μg/ml of Tm), as measured by Kar2sfGFP fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clay et al., 2014</xref>). In our experiments, the moderate expression level of UPRE-GFP revealed that CPY*-mRFP aggregates induced a moderate level of ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lane 3) and also induced a mild block in ER inheritance compared with that induced by 0.5 μg/ml of Tm (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E,F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Based on the previous report, we anticipated that CPY*-mRFP expression alone (which induced low/medium levels of ER stress) should result in retention of CPY* aggregates in the mother cells. We observed, however, that CPY*-mRFP aggregates were distributed in both mother and daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>).

As anticipated, the combined ER stresses further decreased ER inheritance by the daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Notably, distribution of CPY* aggregates to the daughter cells was also further diminished in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>) and correlated with the reduced level of cER transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

To investigate these possibilities, we synchronized yeast cells in G1 by incubation with α-factor.

The observed differences between phase I and phase II cells in cytokinesis and ER inheritance were not due to an inability of phase II cells to respond to Tm. Phase I and II cells showed similar degrees of UPR activation after ER stress, as reflected in the levels of spliced <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA resulting from activated Ire1 RNase-mediated mRNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>). Intriguingly, phase II cells exhibited a block in both cytokinesis and cER inheritance block at the second round of division, and the daughter cell arising from the first cell division did not further divide. Instead, we observed cells with two daughter cells. This was also observed for phase I cells in which the second daughter cell started to emerge after 3 hr of Tm treatment. At this point (Tm, 3 hr), ∼13% of phase II and ∼20% of phase I cells had two buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results therefore demonstrate that cells in which the cER is already in the daughter cell at the time of ER stress induction proceed through cytokinesis once, but display blocks in both cytokinesis and cER inheritance in the next cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Mother and daughter cells display similar levels of ER stress</title><p>Finally, we considered that if ER protein aggregates are preferentially retained in the mother cell independently of the ERSU pathway, then the ER stress levels in the mother cell should also be elevated relative to the daughter cells. To test this, we used a FRAP assay with WT cells expressing Kar2/BiP-sfGFP reporter (a major ER chaperone fused to ‘superfolder’ GFP), which displays significantly better folding in the oxidizing ER luminal environment than GFP or EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pedelacq et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aronson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lajoie et al., 2012</xref>). In both mammalian and yeast cells, Kar2/BiP binding to unfolded client proteins increases in response to ER stress, reducing its mobility within the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Snapp et al., 2006</xref>). This can be monitored by the reduced rate of FRAP. Small areas of the cER or pnER (indicated by black rectangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) in the mother and daughter cell were photobleached and the rate of Kar2/BiP-sfGFP fluorescence recovery from the surrounding area was assessed. In the mother cell, the fluorescence recovery rate was significantly reduced by Tm treatment when compared with control DMSO-treated cells, and this was similar for both the cER and pnER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). However, there were no significant differences between the mother and daughter cell in recovery rates in either the cER or pnER under control or Tm-treated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>), indicating that the ER stress levels are identical in mother and daughter cells. Taken together, the data presented do not support the preferential retention of ER protein aggregates in the mother cell, but instead argue that ER inheritance regulates the fate of unfolded proteins and the inheritance of ER protein aggregates by the daughter cell.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06970.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Mother and daughter cells display similar degrees of cortical and perinuclear ER stress.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantification of ER stress was performed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of cells labeled with the ER chaperone Kar2/BiP-sfGFP.

Limiting the transmission of potentially harmful components ensures that the functional capacity of the new daughter cell is reset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peraza-Reyes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Longo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ouellet and Barral, 2012</xref>). A recent report demonstrated that ER-resident misfolded protein aggregates, such as a mutant form of carboxypeptidase (CPY*), were prevented from entering the daughter cell and were retained within the mother cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clay et al., 2014</xref>). The expression of certain misfolded proteins or protein aggregates, including CPY*, in the ER lumen induces ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spear and Ng, 2003</xref>), as also shown here. In turn, ER stress activates the ERSU pathway, which blocks ER transmission into the daughter cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babour et al., 2010</xref>). These observations raise important questions about the potential mechanism(s) underlying the lack of CPY* aggregates in the daughter cell. One explanation is that transmission is blocked concomitantly with the ERSU pathway-mediated block in ER inheritance. Alternatively, independent regulatory mechanisms may also control the segregation of ER protein aggregates. The results of our experiments described here unambiguously demonstrated that the ERSU pathway governs the location of ER protein aggregates.</p><p>We found that CPY*-mRFP aggregates alone activate both the UPR and the ERSU pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>), although activation was significantly less robust than when induced by Tm (even at 0.5 μg/ml) and was more equivalent to a low/moderate level of ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). We found that a majority of class I cells (83%) retained CPY*-mRFP aggregates in the mother and only 17% of daughter cells had inherited the aggregates. At face value, these numbers appear to indicate that CPY*-mRFP aggregates are retained in the mother cells. However, daughter cells lacking the inherited cER should not contain CPY*-mRFP aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In fact, ER stress induced by CPY*-mRFP aggregate expression blocked cER inheritance in a large population of the class I daughter cells. Thus, when the analysis was restricted to daughter cells that contain the cER, we found that 63% of these cER-positive daughter cells also contained CPY*-mRFP aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Even for cells with larger buds (class II or III), we observed that CPY*-mRFP localization was dictated by the presence of the cER in the daughter cell. Thus, we conclude that the cellular distribution of CPY*-mRFP aggregates is determined by the location of the cER. Our conclusions are further supported by the observations with GFP-CFTR; we found that GFP-CFTR aggregates did not activate the ERSU pathway, in agreement with the lack of UPR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>). If a separate mechanism exists to retain ER protein aggregates in the mother cell irrespective or independently of the ER inheritance block, we would expect that GFP-CFTR aggregates should be retained in the mother cells. However, we found that GFP-CFTR aggregates entered the daughter cells effectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), and there was no evidence for preferential retention of aggregates in the mother cell. Finally, further support for the hypothesis that the distribution of ER protein aggregates is dictated by the ER inheritance status came from our study of ERSU-deficient <italic>slt2Δ</italic> cells. These cells do not undergo a block in ER inheritance in response to ER stress and accordingly, <italic>slt2Δ</italic> daughter cells contained higher levels of CPY*-mRFP aggregates than do WT CPY*-mRFP-expressing daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>One notable difference in the behavior of CPY*-mRFP and GFP-CFTR aggregates was that only CPY*-mRFP aggregates induced the ERSU pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The aggregates had similar biochemical behavior, as indicated by their detergent insolubility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, GFP-CFTR aggregates were present in almost all of the cER-positive small-budded cells (class I: &lt;2-μm diameter, gray vs yellow bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), whereas CPY*-mRFP aggregates were present in only about half of cER-positive small-budded cells (gray vs yellow bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). A similar trend was found after treatment with Tm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). These data suggest that GFP-CFTR aggregates behave like soluble proteins in the ER lumen, perhaps because of the lack of proteotoxicity. In this regard, analysis of GFP-CFTR aggregates could provide a unique opportunity to monitor the behavior of soluble non-toxic ER luminal proteins in live cells.</p><p>We found that the behavior of CPY*-mRFP and GFP-CFTR aggregates in <italic>bud1Δ</italic> cells and WT cells was indistinguishable, indicating that the mother–daughter lateral diffusion barrier established by Bud1 does not play a significant role in either the cER inheritance block or the distribution of ER protein aggregates in response to ER stress. Our data differ from those in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clay et al., 2014</xref>), which showed an increase in CPY*-GFP foci in <italic>bud1Δ</italic> daughter cells and thus suggested an important role for Bud1 in the retention of CPY*-GFP foci in the mother cell. Paradoxically, that study observed only one or two CPY*-GFP foci in WT daughter cells and up to six CPY*-GFP foci in <italic>bud1Δ</italic> daughter cells. Interestingly, Barral and colleagues argued that the greater abundance of CPY*-GFP foci in the <italic>bud1Δ</italic> daughter cells was due to increased transfer of the soluble form of CPY*-GFP from the mother and subsequent formation of CPY*-GFP aggregates in the daughter cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clay et al., 2014</xref>). However, there was no direct demonstration that soluble CPY*-GFP levels were in fact increased. During our analysis (n &gt; 100 cells per experiment with at least three independent repeats), we never observed significant differences in the average number of CPY*-mRFP aggregates in WT and <italic>bud1Δ</italic> daughter cells, or even in WT and <italic>bud1Δ</italic> mother cells (data not shown). The reason for the different findings in the two studies is currently not clear. The ERSU pathway functions in at least two different yeast strain backgrounds (W303 and BY4741). Interestingly, <italic>bud1Δ</italic> mother cells appear to have a shorter replicative lifespan than WT mother cells under optimal stress-free growth conditions. If CPY* aggregates are retained in the WT mother cell in order to preserve ER proteostasis in the daughter cell and thus ensure its longevity, one may anticipate that <italic>bud1Δ</italic> mother cells, which contain fewer CPY* aggregates, would have better ER proteostasis and thus live longer than WT mother cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clay et al., 2014</xref>). Together with other data presented here, our finding that CPY*-mRFP aggregate distribution correlates with the lack of the ER inheritance block in <italic>bud1Δ</italic> cells strengthens the hypothesis that the ERSU pathway regulates the distribution of ER protein aggregates in yeast daughter cells.</p><p>Our results suggest a potentially significant difference in the manner in which cells cope with cytoplasmic vs ER protein aggregates. To date, several distinct cytoplasmic protein aggregates have been reported: ubiquitinated cytoplasmic proteins associate with JUNQ, whereas insoluble proteins associate with IPOD upon proteasome inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>) or in the presence of amyloid proteins such as Huntingtin with extended polyQ. In cells with functional proteasomes, misfolded proteins dynamically form inclusion bodies called Q-body protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spokoini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roth and Balch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). An interesting feature of these cytoplasmic protein aggregates is their differential subcellular localization; JUNQ associates with the ER/nucleus, IPOD is found next to the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ogrodnik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Polling et al., 2014</xref>), and Q-bodies are scattered throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spokoini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). These protein aggregates are selectively retained in the mother cell, and a recent study has revealed an intriguing mechanism for retention of Q-body protein aggregates through association with the ER and eventually with the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). We found that fluorescently tagged forms of both CPY* and CFTR aggregates appeared to be scattered throughout the ER. Ultimately, the ERSU pathway blocks ER inheritance and prevents transmission of ER protein aggregates into the daughter cell. The asymmetric distribution of cytosolic protein aggregates and large inclusions such as JUNQ and IPOD is protective and allows the daughter cells to be rejuvenated during each cell division. ER aggregates may similarly be prevented from entering the daughter cell. But during ER stress, ER aggregates are retained by the ERSU mechanism that prevents transfer of the stressed ER. Cytosolic protein aggregates have been reported to associate with the ER, raising the intriguing possibility that the ER functions as a central controller for the distribution of protein aggregates in the cell. Alternatively, the association of cytoplasmic protein aggregates with the ER may somehow induce ER stress and consequently, the ERSU pathway. In this scenario, the ERSU pathway may function as a master regulator for both the ER and cytoplasmic protein aggregates.</p><p>Many of the cell cycle checkpoints that ensure accurate DNA replication and genome transmission are restricted to specific stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rhind and Russell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yasutis and Kozminski, 2013</xref>). By observing asynchronous populations of yeast cells, we found that both class II and class III cells exhibit the block in ER inheritance during ER stress, but it is less pronounced than in class I cells, as we described in our initial report. This finding suggests that ER stress must be recognized early in the cell cycle in order to induce the ERSU pathway. Significantly, ER transfer to the daughter cell had already taken place in many class II and III cells prior to encountering ER stress, and presumably, these populations contribute to the lower number of cells exhibiting the cER inheritance block. Using synchronized cells, we found that cells at later stages of the cell cycle, when the cER is already in the daughter cell at the time of exposure to ER stress, undergo cytokinesis for the first round of the cell cycle but exhibit a block in cER inheritance and cytokinesis during the second round. Thus, the ERSU pathway is effective only when ER stress is sensed at an early stage of the cell cycle and can be ignored until the second cell cycle if the cER was already present in the daughter cell.</p><p>Such a mode of ERSU pathway regulation of ER inheritance is rather unusual when compared to cell cycle checkpoints that regulate DNA replication and transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vleugel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayashi and Karlseder, 2013</xref>). Failure to align chromosomes properly, for example, activates the spindle assembly checkpoint, leading to inhibition of the anaphase-promoting complex and induction of cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang and Barford, 2014</xref>). To our knowledge, the observation that class II and III cells with cER-containing daughter cells proceed normally through the first round of cytokinesis after ER stress, <italic>and that this ‘error’ is not corrected</italic> until the second round, is unprecedented. Results of the FRAP experiments indicate that ER stress was manifested within 30 min of stress induction in both class II or III daughter cells. Thus, these cells must somehow bypass the ERSU pathway-induced cytokinesis block in the first round of division but halt the cell cycle during the next round of cytokinesis. In the case of the replication checkpoints, it would not be possible to lose a chromosome at the first division and then recover during the second cell cycle. In contrast, a functionally stressed ER might be tolerated if the problem is resolved promptly in the next cell cycle. Currently, the molecular mechanisms dictating the decisions by class I, II, and III cells to proceed—or not—through cytokinesis are unknown; the answers to these and other questions raised here await further studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>FRAP assays</title><p>Cells expressing the Kar2/BiP-sfGFP reporter were grown to mid-log phase in filter-sterilized 0.5X YPD (0.5% yeast extract, 1% peptone, and 2% dextrose) and treated with Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) or tunicamycin (Tm 1 μg/ml) for 3 hr at 30°C.

The plasmid was checked by sequencing. sfGFP-HDEL::KanMX6 was PCR amplified with primers FJP17 (ATAAATTAACAACCTTGAAGCTTCCAGCAGCAAAAATTTTTAACTATTTTATgaattcgagctcgtttaaac) and FJP37(CAGTCTCTATACTCTTCAATG) to tag KAR2 at the genomic locus of strain MNY1004 to generate strain MNY2119 using the Longtine method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Longtine et al., 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Aggregation assay</title><p>Aliquots of 20 ml of cells were collected after 2 hr of induction, washed once with water, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein extracts were prepared and the following detergent solubility test was performed (as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberti et al., 2010</xref>]) to characterize the CPY*-mRFP and GFP-CFTR foci observed under the microscope. The cell pellet was resuspended in 600 μl of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 5% glycerol) with protease inhibitors (5 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride [PMSF], aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A), 50 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and 25 μM MG132, and then lysed with glass beads at 4°C. A sample of 300 μl of the lysate was mixed with 300 μl of cold detergent-lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, (SDS) and vortexed for 10 s. The remaining 300 μl of sample was diluted with an additional 300 μl of lysis buffer. The crude lysates were centrifuged for 2 min at 800 rcf (4°C) to pellet the cell debris. Supernatant samples (250 μl each) were centrifuged in a TLA 100 rotor for 30 min at 80,000 rpm and 4°C using a TL Beckman ultracentrifuge. The pellet from the RIPA buffer lysate was resuspended in 250 μl of RIPA buffer. The pellet from the lysis buffer only was resuspended in 250 µl of lysis buffer (no detergent). Equal volumes of unfractionated (total), supernatant (S), and pellet (P) samples were incubated in sample buffer containing 2% SDS and 2% β-mercaptoethanol. CPY*-mRFP extracts were heated for 5 min at 95°C, and GFP-CFTR extracts were heated for 20 min at 37°C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. CPY*-mRFP was detected with anti-mRFP rat monoclonal antibody (1:1000, cat # ABIN334653, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, United States) and secondary HRP-conjugated anti-rat antibody (Bio-Rad). GFP-CFTR was detected with anti-GFP mouse monoclonal (1:1000, cat # 11814460001, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and secondary HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Bio-Rad).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Dr Kit Pogliano and Dr Tinya Fleming for the help with the FRAP assays.
