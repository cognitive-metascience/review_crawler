post-translational modification leading to protein degradation or delocalization, or altering protein activity. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, two E3 ligases, BIG BROTHER (BB) and DA2, activate the latent peptidases DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 by mono-ubiquitination at multiple sites. Subsequently, these activated peptidases destabilize various positive growth regulators. Here, we show that two ubiquitin-specific proteases, UBP12 and UBP13, deubiquitinate DA1, DAR1 and DAR2, hence reducing their peptidase activity. Overexpression of <italic>UBP12</italic> or <italic>UBP13</italic> strongly decreased leaf size and cell area, and resulted in lower ploidy levels. Mutants in which <italic>UBP12</italic> and <italic>UBP13</italic> were downregulated produced smaller leaves that contained fewer and smaller cells. Remarkably, neither UBP12 nor UBP13 were found to be cleavage substrates of the activated DA1. Our results therefore suggest that UBP12 and UBP13 work upstream of DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 to restrict their protease activity and hence fine-tune plant growth and development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>leaf growth</kwd><kwd>deubiquitination</kwd><kwd>enzymatic activity</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd><kwd>cell proliferation</kwd><kwd>endoreduplication</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007229</institution-id><institution>Bijzonder Onderzoeksfonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BOF08/01M00408</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vermeersch</surname><given-names>Mattias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007229</institution-id><institution>Bijzonder Onderzoeksfonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01SC3117</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201604910566</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Research Foundation Flanders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12V0218N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vanhaeren</surname><given-names>Hannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By inactivating DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 through deubiquitination, UBP12 and UBP13 regulate leaf growth, cell area and endoreduplication.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ubiquitination plays a prominent role in the signaling cascades of many plant hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Santner and Estelle, 2010</xref>), such as auxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Salehin et al., 2015</xref>), jasmonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nagels Durand et al., 2016</xref>), gibberellins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang and Deng, 2011</xref>), and strigolactones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marzec, 2016</xref>), but also in many plant developmental processes and responses to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shu and Yang, 2017</xref>). Therefore, a very tight control of this process and a high substrate specificity, which is mainly determined by the E3 ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shu and Yang, 2017</xref>), are required. The tremendous diversity of the ubiquitination system and its potential in post-translational regulation are illustrated by the presence of more than 1400 genes that encode E3 ligases in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vierstra, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, there is a high diversity of ubiquitination types and combinations with other post-translational modifications (PTMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Callis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swatek and Komander, 2016</xref>), as well as of the fate of the ubiquitinated protein, such as degradation, delocalization or changes in activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swatek and Komander, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the more intensively studied action of E3 ligases, insights into the specific roles of deubiquitination enzymes (DUBs) in plant growth and development are only recently emerging. DUBs can generate free ubiquitin from tandem-linear repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Callis et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Callis et al., 1990</xref>), are able to trim ubiquitin chains by hydrolyzing the isopeptide bond between ubiquitin molecules, and can remove covalently bound ubiquitin from proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Komander et al., 2009</xref>). The Arabidopsis genome codes for around 50 DUBs. As in yeast and mammals, they can be divided into five classes: the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UHCs), JAB1/MPN/MOV34 (JAMM) domain DUBs that are zinc metalloproteases, ovarian tumor proteases, the Machado-Josephin domain (MJD) DUBs, and the ubiquitin binding proteins (UBPs), which is the largest group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Isono and Nagel, 2014</xref>). All UBPs contain specific catalytic Cys- and His-boxes, which are highly conserved in both sequence and length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Based on their sequence homology and protein domain organization, these 27 members can be further divided into 14 subfamilies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yan et al., 2000</xref>). UBP12 and UBP13 are the largest UBPs and contain a unique meprin and TRAF homology (MATH) domain. They were first reported to be functional deubiquitinating enzymes that negatively regulate plant immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ewan et al., 2011</xref>). Since then, both proteins have been described to be involved in diverse molecular pathways. Mutations in <italic>UBP12</italic> and <italic>UBP13</italic> result in early flowering and a decreased periodicity of circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2013</xref>). Molecularly, GIGANTEA (GI) recruits UBP12 and UBP13 to the ZEITLUPE (ZTL) photoreceptor complex, which antagonizes the E3 ligase activity of ZTL and hereby stabilizes GI, ZTL and TOC1 [TIMING OF CAB (CHLOROPHYLL A/B-BINDING PROTEIN EXPRESSION) 1] protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, UBP12 and UBP13 can regulate the expression of several genes by deubiquitinating ubiquitinated H2A (H2Aub) upon associating with LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1, a plant-specific polycomb group (PcG) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Derkacheva et al., 2016</xref>). Polyubiquitination of MYC2 by the PUB10 E3 ligase can be counteracted by UBP12 and UBP13, preventing degradation of MYC2 by the 26S proteasome which then activates jasmonic acid signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeong et al., 2017</xref>). In a similar manner, ROOT GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR 1 (RGFR1) and ORESARA 1 (ORE1) are deubiquitinated and therefore stabilized by UBP12 and UBP13, leading to an increased root sensitivity to the RGF1 peptide hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2018</xref>) and an acceleration in leaf senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2019</xref>), respectively.</p><p>Mutations in <italic>UBP12</italic> or <italic>UBP13</italic> decrease rosette leaf number and double mutants display severe developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2013</xref>). However, a direct link between these deubiquitinating enzymes and leaf growth and development remains elusive. Here, we found that UBP12 and UBP13 interact with DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 in vivo. DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 have previously been documented to negatively regulate leaf growth. Upon multiple mono-ubiquitination by BIG BROTHER (BB) or DA2, these latent peptidases are activated to cleave growth regulators, such as UBP15, TCP14, TCP15 and TCP22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, the activating E3 ligases BB and DA2 are cleaved and BB is subsequently degraded by the N-degron pathway, mediated by PROTEOLYSIS 1 (PRT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2017</xref>). Single knock-outs in <italic>DA1</italic>, <italic>DAR1</italic> and <italic>DAR2</italic> only have very subtle effects on organ size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Plant growth is however strongly enhanced in the double mutant <italic>da1ko_dar1-1</italic>, comparable to <italic>da1-1</italic> mutants, which carry a point mutation (DA1<sup>R358K</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2008</xref>). The latter mutation has a dominant-negative action towards DA1 and DAR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2008</xref>) and causes a reduction in peptidase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2017</xref>). Rosette growth is however severely impaired in the triple mutant <italic>da1ko_dar1-1_dar2-1</italic>, and the size of leaf cells and the extent of endoreduplication are reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peng et al., 2015</xref>). This phenotype can be complemented by ectopic expression of <italic>DA1</italic>, <italic>DAR1</italic> or <italic>DAR2</italic>, suggesting they work redundantly in leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peng et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, overexpression of <italic>GFP-DA1</italic> results in smaller organs with fewer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vanhaeren et al., 2017</xref>). Mutants of <italic>UBP15</italic> can abolish the <italic>da1-1</italic> phenotype and give rise to smaller organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2014</xref>). Inversely, ectopic expression of <italic>UBP15</italic> enhances growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that UBP12 and UBP13 not only bind DA1, DAR1 and DAR2, but can also remove ubiquitin from these proteins, rendering them in an inactive state. Moreover, UBP12 and UBP13 were not found to be proteolytically cleaved by DA1, DAR1 or DAR2, indicating they work upstream in this pathway. In line with these findings, <italic>UBP12</italic> and <italic>UBP13</italic> mutants and overexpression lines exhibit macroscopic, cellular and molecular phenotypes overlapping with those of <italic>35S::GFP-DA1</italic> overexpression lines and <italic>da1ko_dar1-1_dar2-1</italic> mutants, respectively. Our data provide evidence for a pivotal role of UBP12 and UBP13 in restricting the protease activity of DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 during plant growth and development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 interact with UBP12 and UBP13 in vivo</title><p>Genetic modifier screens previously identified several interactors of DA1 that either activate its peptidase activity or are subjected to proteolytic cleavage by DA1. To gain further insights into the DA1 growth-regulatory pathway, we generated Arabidopsis lines that overexpressed GFP-tagged fusion proteins of DA1, DAR1 and DAR2. Total protein extracts were isolated from eight-day-old seedlings and incubated with anti-GFP beads to purify the bait proteins and their interactors. Label free quantification identified a significant enrichment (p-value&lt;0.01) of the UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 12 (UBP12) and UBP13 in the GFP-DA1 and GFP-DAR1 samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>) among other interaction candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Despite the much lower levels of DAR2 MS/MS counts and a lower DAR2 bait protein coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>), we found a significant enrichment of UBP12 at a less stringent threshold (p-value&lt;0.05) and UBP13 at the border of significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). To confirm this interaction, we performed an in vitro pull-down using UBP12 and UBP13 as bait proteins. DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 were expressed and isolated as HIS-MBP fusion proteins and UBP12 and UBP13 as GST fusion proteins; free GST was used as a negative control. We incubated equal amounts of free GST, full-length GST-UBP12 and GST-UBP13 with HIS-MBP-DA1, HIS-MBP-DAR1 and HIS-MBP DAR2. Western blot analysis after purification with anti-GST beads showed that HIS-MBP-DA1, HIS-MBP-DAR1 and HIS-MBP-DAR2 could be co-purified with either GST-UBP12 or GST-UBP13, but not with free GST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). Additionally, we co-expressed RFP-DA1, RFP-DAR1 and RFP-DAR2 with either GFP-UBP12 or free GFP from the same vector in Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures.

The latent peptidases DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 are activated upon multiple mono-ubiquitinations by BB and DA2 and can subsequently cleave several growth regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we identified two ubiquitin-specific proteases, UBP12 an UBP13, that interact with DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 in vitro and in vivo. Our experiments demonstrate that these UBPs work antagonistically to BB and DA2. Incubation of ubiquitinated DA1, DAR1 or DAR2 with either UBP12 or UBP13 resulted in strong deubiquitination. Interestingly, our in vitro immunoprecipitation (IP) shows that UBP12 and UBP13 can also interact with the unubiquitinated forms of DA1, DAR1 and DAR2. Similar deubiquitination experiments with other UBPs, such as UBP3, UBP15 and UBP24, demonstrated that this activity was specific for UBP12 and UBP13. Interestingly, <italic>UBP15</italic> has already been shown to genetically interact with <italic>DA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2014</xref>) and UBP15 proteins can be cleaved by activated DA1 peptidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2017</xref>). Our results indicate that UBP15 has no deubiquitination activity towards DA1 and acts therefore downstream in this pathway.

Most probably, UBP15 deubiquitinates and alters the fate of other downstream growth-regulating proteins. UBP12 and UBP13 have recently been described to deubiquitinate various poly-ubiquitinated proteins, preventing their proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2019</xref>).

The leaf area was only reduced in <italic>ubp12-2</italic> mutants, in which levels of both <italic>UBP12</italic> and <italic>UBP13</italic> are decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2013</xref>). The subsequently decreased deubiquitination activity towards DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 could result in an accumulation of the activated peptidases in <italic>ubp12-2</italic> mutants, leading to a decrease in cell number and leaf area. A similar phenotype is also observed in <italic>GFP-DA1</italic> overexpressing plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vanhaeren et al., 2017</xref>) and in the <italic>ubp15</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, high ectopic expression of either <italic>UBP12</italic> or <italic>UBP13</italic> would result in very low levels of ubiquitinated DA1, DAR1 and DAR2, leading to a severe disturbance of leaf development. Indeed, <italic>35S::UBP12</italic> and <italic>35S::UBP13</italic> plants were strongly reduced in growth in a similar manner as <italic>da1ko_dar1-1_dar2-1</italic> triple mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peng et al., 2015</xref>). A more detailed cellular and molecular analysis of <italic>35S::UBP12</italic> and <italic>35S::UBP13</italic> leaves revealed more parallels, such as a strong reduction in cell area and a decrease in ploidy levels at the early stages of leaf development, which were also observed in <italic>da1ko_dar1-1_dar2-1</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peng et al., 2015</xref>). The complete absence of DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 proteins in <italic>da1ko_dar1-1_dar2-1</italic> plants could however explain its stronger reduction in endoreduplication than that of <italic>UBP12</italic> and <italic>UBP13</italic> overexpression lines, in which ubiquitination of DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 can still occur, but is likely kept at a very low level. In addition, several markers of cell proliferation were found to be more highly expressed in <italic>35S::UBP12</italic> and <italic>35S::UBP13</italic> during early stages of leaf development, similarly as observed in plants that contain a DA1<sup>R358K</sup> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vanhaeren et al., 2017</xref>), which reduces the peptidase activity of DA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2017</xref>). However, the final cell number in the <italic>UBP12</italic> and <italic>UBP13</italic> overexpression lines was not increased, suggesting that a strong reduction of DA1 activity rather delays development but does not increase the duration of cell proliferation and hence the final number of cells.</p><p>Previously, it has been shown that DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 negatively regulate their own activity by cleaving their activating E3-ligases BB and DA2, resulting in an activation-repression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2017</xref>). UBP12 and UBP13 form an additional layer of post-translational regulation to limit the activity of DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 by specifically removing ubiquitin, and hence further fine-tune organ growth in this growth-regulatory pathway. This dual system to limit and fine-tune the activity of DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 demonstrates the importance of keeping a correct balance between the active and inactive pool of these proteases during leaf development. This is illustrated by the phenotype of plants in which this balance is altered. In wild-type conditions, a correct balance between an inactive and active (ubiquitinated) DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 results in an intact exit from mitosis and standard ploidy levels in leaf cells, which leads to normal plant growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). High levels of UBP12 or UBP13 can however shift the balance to a depletion of activated DA1, DAR1 and DAR2, which results in a delayed endoreduplication, a severe reduction in cell size and stunted plant growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), which is highly similar to the phenotype of <italic>da1ko_dar1-1_dar2-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peng et al., 2015</xref>). Low levels of UBP12 and UBP13 might on the other hand lead to an increase in activated DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 levels, more destabilization of its substrates and can hence limit plant growth by reducing both cell area and cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Higher levels of DA1 and mutations in <italic>UBP15</italic> have previously been reported to decrease leaf area and cell number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vanhaeren et al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>ubp12-2</italic> mutants and overexpression lines of <italic>UBP12</italic> and <italic>UBP13</italic>, leaf size and the average area of pavement cells are reduced. Because both very low and high levels of DA1 result in growth reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vanhaeren et al., 2017</xref>), a tight balance between active and inactive DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 is crucial for normal plant development. With <italic>UBP12</italic> and <italic>UBP13</italic> expression levels being relatively constant throughout leaf development, unknown post-translational modifications of UBP12 and UBP13 are likely to alter the activity or specificity towards DA1, DAR1 and DAR2, as is the case with other deubiquitinating enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang and Cochran, 2013</xref>). Additionally, it remains also unclear if this reduction in cell area in the <italic>ubp12-2</italic> mutants or <italic>UBP12</italic> and <italic>UBP13</italic> overexpression lines results only from altered levels of DA1 activity, or if UBP12 and UBP13 regulate cell expansion through other growth regulators.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of UBP12 and UBP13 levels on leaf area and cellular phenotypes.</title><p>Molecular balance and leaf phenotypes in (<bold>A</bold>) wild-type conditions, (<bold>B</bold>) high <italic>UBP12</italic> and <italic>UBP13</italic> expression lines and (<bold>C</bold>) lower levels of <italic>UBP12</italic> and <italic>UBP13</italic>.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52276-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig7s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Updated model of our current knowledge of the growth-regulating DA1 pathway.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52276-fig7-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>Over the years, it has become increasingly clear that DUBs play a greater role in the development of eukaryotes than just processing and recycling free ubiquitin.

After blocking, GFP-tagged proteins were detected with anti-GFP (Abcam, ab290, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_303395">AB_303395</ext-link>) and RFP-tagged proteins with anti-RFP antibody (Chromotek, RFP antibody [6G6], RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2631395">AB_2631395</ext-link>) and subsequently with a secondary Rabbit IgG HRP-linked antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, NA934v, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2722659">AB_2722659</ext-link>) or secondary Mouse IgG HRP-linked antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, NA931v, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2827944">AB_2827944</ext-link>), respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cell free deubiquitination assay</title><p>Proteins were freshly extracted from 8-day-old seedlings of Col-0, <italic>ubp12-2</italic>, <italic>35S::UBP12</italic> an <italic>35S::UBP13</italic> using a 0.5 M sucrose, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 5 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris-MES (pH 8.0) extraction buffer without protease inhibitors (one µl of buffer was added per mg plant material). Subsequently, 400 µg of cell-free extract was added per 200 ng ubiquitinated HIS-MBP-DA1 proteins. For each time point, equal amounts of reaction mix were taken and the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. The samples were blotted and detected as described above. To quantify the deubiquitination, a rectangle was drawn in ImageJ (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link>, NIH; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>) spanning the size of fully ubiquitinated HIS-MBP-DA1.

A 3-ml culture of competent LBA 4404 cells containing these constructs or P19 was grown overnight (28°C) in YEB medium with the appropriate antibiotics. The next day, one ml of this culture was inoculated in a 9-ml YEB, 10-mM MES, 20-µM acetosyringone solution with the appropriate antibiotics and incubated overnight at 28°C. Then, the bacteria were washed twice in a 100-mM MGCl2, 10-mM MES, 20-µM acetosyringone buffer and the OD<sub>600</sub> was adjusted to one for all cultures and further incubated for two hours at 28°C. Then, equal mixtures of the constructs were infiltrated in 4-week-old <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaves. After three nights, leaf discs were imaged with a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal inverted microscope (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_018063">SCR_018063</ext-link>, Zeiss) to image the RFP- (lasers: 561 nm: 3.0%, beam splitters: MBS: MBS 488/561, pinhole: 100 µm,, digital gain: 1.00, Master gain: 925) and GFP fusion proteins (lasers: 488 nm: 2.0%, beam splitters: MBS_InVis: Plate, pinhole: 100 µm, digital gain: 0.75, Master gain: 956).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We like to express our gratitude to our colleagues of the Systems Biology of Yield and the Proteomics group, in particular Marieke Dubois and Ting Li, for all constructive discussions and scientific advice.

Overexpression of UBP12 or UBP13 strongly decreased leaf size and cell area, and had lower ploidy levels. Mutations in UBP12 and UBP13 also produced smaller leaves that contained fewer and smaller cells. It seems interesting, but several conclusions are not justified.</p><p>1) If UBP12/13 can deactivate DA1/DAR1/2 (Figure 6), mutations in UBP12/13 could increase the accumulation of TCP15/22 and UBP15, resulting in larger and fewer cells. However, ubp12 <italic>ubp13</italic> mutants produced smaller leaves that contained smaller and fewer cells. In addition, the authors did not confirm whether ubp12 ubp13 could affect the levels of TCP15/22 and UBP15 proteins. Thus, the working model in Figure 6 might be incorrect.</p><p>2) It is unclear whether UBP12/13 can really remove monoubiquited DA1/DAR1/DAR2 or/and polyubiquitated DA1/DAR1/2 in vitro and in vivo. The polyubiquitination might affect protein stability. As the authors generated <italic>35S:UBP12 / 35S:GFP-DA1</italic> and <italic>35S:UBP13 / 35S:GFP-DA1</italic> plants, it is easy to test whether UBP12/13 could affect the stability of DA1 by Western blots.</p><p>3) If UBP12/13 can repress the activity of DA1/DAR1/2, it is necessary to test whether mutations in DA1/DAR1/2 could suppress the phenotypes of ubp12/13.</p><p>4) The authors showed the in vivo interaction of DA1 family proteins with UBP12 and UBP13 by label-free MS analyses. However, it's better to provide more interaction evidence by other approaches since MS analyses give false positive results some time.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper by Vanhaeren et al. identifies and characterises a novel role for two deubiquitinating enzymes (UBP13 and 13) in the control of peptidase activity linked to cell growth. It was previously shown that the E3 ligases BB and DA2 monoubiquitinate and activate the latent peptidases DA1, DAR1 and DAR2, which then go on to limit leaf growth through disabling a range of positive regulators. Using a combination of mass-spec based screening, genetic manipulation, phenotypic analysis of growth and cell size, and in vitro biochemistry, the authors of this work identify UBP12 and 13 as interaction partners of the DA1/DAR1/DAR2 peptidases, and show convincingly that they act upstream of peptidase function through specific and selective deubiquitination. Thus, this work identifies a new level of regulation in the control of peptidase activity linked to cell growth, and provides new insights into how deubiquitination can play a major regulatory role in growth-associated cellular processes. Overall the experimental work is of a good standard, and the data presented support the conclusions drawn. The paper is well written, and the figures are clear.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Vanhaeren and co-authors describes a potential regulatory link between Arabidopsis UBP12 and UBP13 deubiquitinases and the ubiquitin-dependent peptidases DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 (termed DAs hereafter) to fine tune leaf growth and development. It has been proven that monoubiquitination at multiple sites of DA proteins, mediated by E3 ubiquitin ligases BIG BROTHER and DA2, is crucial to activate the DA peptidases, which in turn will cleave key leaf growth regulators, such as UBP15, TCP14, TCP15 and TCP22. Therefore, by identifying a mechanism to counteract DA activation, based on DA deubiquitination, the authors provide new insights on the regulatory networks that modulate the duration of cell proliferation and the transition to endoreduplication and differentiation during leaf formation. In this context, their findings have additional clear implications for crop improvement.</p><p>However, despite the relevance and interest of these findings, a number of issues should be addressed to substantiate the model proposed by the authors.</p><p>First, whereas biochemical evidence is provided about UBP12 and UBP13 deubiquitinating activity towards DA proteins (Figure 4), in vivo data supporting these results is completely missing. The levels of ubiquitinated DA proteins should be analyzed in plants with altered expression of UBP12 and UBP13 (described in this manuscript).</p><p>Second, information about protein-protein interaction between UBP12 and UBP13 and DA proteins is limited to immunoprecipitation-MS data. Such results should be confirmed by additional means that also describe where, at the cellular and subcellular level, those interactions occur (nuclei?).</p><p>Third, UBP12 and UBP13 are known to deubiquitinate several, in principle unrelated, targets. However, it remains unknown which mechanisms provide them specificity to recognize a specific set of ubiquitinated targets (i.e. DAs) in order to modulate their activity. Thus, the authors should provide evidence on the precise environmental and developmental conditions, and the signaling mechanisms involved, that trigger UBP12 and UBP13 function towards DAs.</p><p>Fourth, reduced and increased activity of UBP12 and UBP13 in <italic>ubp12-2</italic> mutants and overexpression lines, respectively, lead to similar leaf and seedling phenotypes (Figure 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 8, summarized in Figure 6). Indeed, in the Discussion section (third paragraph) the authors mention that high levels of UBP12 and UBP13 lead to a severe reduction in cell size. On the other hand, low levels of UBP12 and UBP13 reduce cell area. This is counterintuitive. A more detailed discussion should be provided to better explain the outputs of UBP12 and UBP13 function in balancing DA protein activation/inactivation in order to control plant development.</p><p>Fifth, in the last paragraph of the subsection “Overexpression of UBP12 or UBP13 delays the onset of endoreduplication”, and Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplements 3 and 4, the authors show that overexpression of UBP12 and UBP13 induces expression, at certain time points, of several genes that positively regulate growth. This is contrary to the plant phenotype for those lines, where growth is reduced. These contradictory results should be discussed.</p><p>Sixth, Figure 4C. UBP12- and UBP13-mediated deubiquitination of ubiquitinated DAR2 is not clear at all, compared to that of ubiquitinated DA1 and DAR1. In addition, the fact that the shifted band with higher MW, corresponds indeed to ubiquitinated DA proteins should be proven (showing the in vitro DA2-mediated ubiquitination assays with appropriate controls).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52276.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers appreciated the mechanistic advance of your work, unraveling the regulatory importance of UBPs for the ubiquitin-dependent regulation of DA1, DAR1, and DAR2.

This interaction was also confirmed by the in vitro deubiquitination assay. To further confirm these interactions, we performed an in vitro pull-down using recombinant GST, GST-UBP12 or GST-UBP13 as baits proteins, and HIS-MBP-DA1, HISMBP-DAR1 or HIS-MBP-DAR2 as prey proteins. After incubation and washing, our Western blots showed a strong interaction with GST-UBP12/13 and the prey proteins (HIS-MBP-DA1, HIS-MBP-DAR1 and HIS-MBP-DAR2), but not in the negative control (Figure 1D, E and F).</p><p>In addition, we performed an additional in vivo IP in Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures. For this purpose, full expression constructs of <italic>35S::RFP-DA1, 35S::RFP-DAR1, 35S::RFP-DAR2, 35S::GFP-UBP12</italic> and <italic>35S::GFP</italic> were amplified by PCR and cloned into golden gate modules using the Gibson assembly method. Existing <italic>bsaI</italic> sites in the Gateway p35S sequence and the <italic>DAR1</italic> coding sequence were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis using <italic>dpnI</italic> to make the constructs compatible for Golden Gate cloning. Subsequently, these constructs were cloned as interaction pairs on a Golden Gate vector to ensure the co-expression of the constructs in each cell. After an IP and WB, the interaction between GFP-UBP12 and RFP-DA1, RFP-DAR1 and RFP-DAR2 could be confirmed (Figure 1G).</p><p>The Materials and methods section has been updated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please, illustrate the differences in the level of DA1 ubiquitination depending on UBP12 and UBP13 activity.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript, in vitro evidence of the deubiquitination of the DA proteins by UBP12 and UBP13 was provided. in vivo in Arabidopsis, DA1 is a very lowly abundant protein which can only be visualized after IP ((Vanhaeren et al., 2017); Supplementary Figure 3D). In addition, in vivo ubiquitination of DA1 is very challenging to demonstrate. In the past, we extensively attempted to co-express GFP-DA1 with either BB or DA2, but we could never demonstrate an ubiquitination event by Western blotting. Only by adding high amounts of TR-TUBEs, synthetic proteins that specifically bind ubiquitin and might therefore stabilize this post-translational modification, to the extract of <italic>35S::GFPDA1</italic> during the extraction, it was possible to visualize ubiquitination patterns of GFP-DA1 in vivo (Dong et al., 2017). However, the process of adding TR-TUBEs to the extract followed by an immunoprecipitation, combined with the dramatic phenotypic differences between <italic>35S::GFP_DA1</italic> and <italic>35S::GFP-DA1_35S::UBP12/13</italic> plants might however induce a lot of variability. This could complicate a proper quantification of the deubiquitination of DA1. In addition, only limited seed material was available to perform these experiments due to fertility issues of the <italic>35S::UBP12/13</italic> lines, as is mentioned in the original manuscript.</p><p>Therefore, we applied an alternative approach based on well-established cell-free degradation approaches (Cheng et al., 2017; Dong et al., 2017; Garcia-Cano et al., 2014). Is such assays, fixed amounts of recombinant proteins are incubated with cell-free extracts of plants and their stability can be visualize over time by Western blot. Similarly, we started from exactly the same amount of ubiquitinated proteins that could be monitored over time. As starting material, newly prepared protein extracts (without protease inhibitors) of 8-day old seedlings of Col-0, <italic>ubp12-2, 35S::UBP12</italic> and <italic>35S::UBP13</italic>, that contained different levels of UBP12 and UBP13, were used. Subsequently, 400µg of cell-free extract was added per 200ng ubiquitinated HIS-MBP-DA1 proteins. From this reaction mix, equal amounts were taken per time point and deubiquitination was stopped by the addition of SDS-containing buffer. The samples were then subjected to Western blot and detection was done with anti-MBP. To quantify deubiquitination, a rectangle was drawn in ImageJ spanning the size of fully ubiquitinated HIS-MBP-DA1. Then, the lane intensities were plotted and the pixels within the resulting curves were measured.</p><p>In the Western blots shown in Figure 5A, we can clearly observe a rapid decrease in molecular weight of the HIS-MBP-DA1 proteins after addition of Col-0 extract (Figure 5A), which was not observed when <italic>ubp12-2</italic> extract was added (Figure 5B-C).</p><p>Next, we performed a similar experiment that also included the overexpression lines, which have high levels of UBP12 or UBP13. First, we could observe again that a slower rate of deubiquitination in samples where <italic>ubp12-2</italic> extract was added compared to those with Col-0 (Figure 5D-E). To be as stringent as possible, the stronger HIS-MBP-DA1 band of the <italic>ubp12-2</italic> Western blot at 0 h (Figure 5E, lane 7) was taken to calculate the deubiquitination (see Figure 5—source data 1: Calculation of in vivo deubiquitination). For the other blots, the average of the two 0 h lanes were taken. In contrast with the slower deubiquitination with <italic>ubp12-2</italic> extract, a faster loss of the ubiquitinated HIS-MBP-DA1 was observed when an extract of <italic>35S::UBP12</italic> or <italic>35S::UBP13</italic> plants was added compared to Col-0 (Figure 5F-H).</p><p>Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that the level of DA1 deubiquitination depends on different in planta levels of UBP12 and UBP13 and strengthen the validity of the in vitro experiments. These data were included as Figure 5 in the manuscript and an additional Source data file containing the plots and measurements was added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please, revise the model at the end so it only reflects what has definitely been shown in this (and previous) studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have indicated in the model in a graphical manner what was demonstrated phenotypically (Figure 7, top panel) and molecularly (Figure 7, middle panel) in this study, and what the potential outcomes on the substrates of DA1 are, based on published work (Figure 7, bottom panel).</p><p>In addition, we added an updated model of the complete molecular mode of action of the entire pathway, adding the results from this manuscript to the knowledge from previous studies.

Parallels can be found however with triple mutants of DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 (<italic>da1ko_dar1-1_dar2-1</italic>; (Peng et al., 2015)) and overexpression lines of <italic>GFP-DA1</italic> (Vanhaeren et al., 2017). Both lines have contrasting levels of DA1, but produce smaller leaves. Our and previous studies suggest that a tightly controlled balance of activated DA1 is required for a correct developmental switch from cell proliferation to cell differentiation and endoreduplication. If too few ubiquitinated DA1 (DAR1, DAR2) is present, this developmental switch is delayed or severely disturbed and plants are smaller. If, on the other hand, the levels of activated DA1 are too high, too many downstream growth regulators might be cleaved, resulting in a reduction of cell division.</p><p>We further elaborated this in the Discussion section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors show that overexpression of UBP12 and UBP13 induces expression, at certain time points, of several genes that positively regulate growth.

Many genes that were selected are markers of cell proliferation and their ectopic expression indeed results in an increase in final cell number and leaf size. Most importantly, these genes also show a specific expression pattern during the transition of cell proliferation (high expression) to cell expansion (low expression). It is for the latter reason that these genes were selected. This allowed us to confirm our flow cytometry data, which showed that the leaf tissue of <italic>35S::UBP12</italic> and <italic>35S::UBP13</italic> plants was in a more proliferative stage (high expression of these marker genes and more 2C and 4C) than those of the Col-0 (lower expression of these marker genes and more 8C). We also made additional cell drawings of the tip of leaves during this developmental transition from cell proliferation to expansion (12 DAS, (Andriankaja et al., 2012)). We could observe that the cells in Col0 leaves clearly started expanding and differentiating, whereas the leaf tips of <italic>35S::UBP12</italic> or <italic>35S::UBP13</italic> plants contained almost exclusively undifferentiated cells (see Figure 3D). These results, together with our observation that cell number was not significantly altered in <italic>UBP12</italic> an <italic>UBP13</italic> overexpression lines, indicate that especially during the early developmental stages of leaf growth, endoreduplication and cell differentiation are delayed in <italic>35S::UBP12</italic> and <italic>35S::UBP13</italic> leaves.</p><p>We rephrased the choice for these Q-RT-PCR genes and elaborated the interpretation of the data more extensively in manuscript and added the cellular data to the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please, describe where, at the cellular and subcellular level, the interaction between DA1, DAR1, DAR2 and UBP12, UBP13 occur.</p></disp-quote><p>We transiently expressed combinations of 35S::RFP-DA1, 35S::RFP-DAR1, 35S::RFP-DAR2 and 35S::GFP-UBP12, GFP-UBP13 in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaves.
