Here, we report endocytic sorting signals for the receptor Patched1 (Ptch1), comprising two ‘PPXY’ motifs, that direct it to degradation in lysosomes. These signals are recognized by two HECT-domain ubiquitin E3 ligases, Smurf1 and Smurf2, which are induced by Shh and become enriched in Caveolin-1 lipid rafts in association with Ptch1. Smurf-mediated endocytic turnover of Ptch1 is essential for its clearance from the primary cilium and pathway activation. Removal of both Smurfs completely abolishes the ability of Shh to sustain the proliferation of postnatal granule cell precursors in the cerebellum. These findings reveal a novel step in the Shh pathway activation as part of the Ptch1 negative feedback loop that precisely controls the signaling output in response to Shh gradient signal.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02555.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02555.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02555.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sonic hedgehog protein fulfils many vital roles in establishing the body plan of multicellular organisms during development. And in adult organisms it regulates the stem cells that maintain organs and tissues. In the embryo, Sonic hedgehog is secreted by certain cells to create a concentration gradient; cells then measure this concentration to work out where they are, which allows them to develop into the right sort of cells. However, many details of this process are not completely understood.</p><p>At the core of this process are the interactions between the Sonic hedgehog protein, a receptor called Patched1 that is found on plasma membranes, and another membrane protein called Smoothened. The job of Smoothened is to activate proteins that enter the cell nucleus and ‘switch on’ the pathway's target genes, which encode Patched1 and a number of other proteins. The role of Patched1, on the other hand, is to repress Smoothened. However, when sonic hedgehog binds to Patched1, the latter is unable to repress Smoothened.</p><p>Increasing the production of Patched1 is thought to serve two main roles: it prevents activation of the Sonic hedgehog pathway, and it prevents the Sonic hedgehog protein spreading to neighboring cells (by binding to it). But how is the level of Patched1 itself regulated? Yue et al. now report that two proteins, called Smurf1 and Smurf2, perform this regulation role in mammalian cells.</p><p>Smurf1 and Smurf2 are enzymes that attach a molecule called ubiquitin to proteins, setting in train a series of events that leads to the degradation of the protein. Yue et al. now show that Smurf1 and Smurf2 recognize a signal on Patched1 and perform a similar modification, causing the Patched1 to be internalized through an alternate pathway and degraded in lysosomes. This series of events ultimately allow the Sonic hedgehog pathway to be activated.</p><p>The work of Yue et al. exposes a critical enzymatic step that sorts unbound Patched1 receptors from those that are bound to Sonic hedgehog proteins. Further research is needed to determine if this signaling pathway can be manipulated for therapeutic purposes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02555.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02555.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>sonic Hedgehog</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>Patched</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>Smurfs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81272238, 81261120386</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Steven Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012CB945003, 2009CB918403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Steven Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIA BC 011168</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Ying E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81101497</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yue</surname><given-names>Shen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Smurf1 and Smurf2 have essential functions in the mammalian Shh signaling pathway, binding to and ubiquitylating Patched1, leading to its endocytosis and subsequent degradation in lysosomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The secreted Sonic hedgehog (Shh) protein specifies spatial tissue patterns during development by providing positional cues embedded in its concentration gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang and Hui, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Robbins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ryan and Chiang, 2012</xref>). During embryogenesis, neighboring progenitor cells in a developing field are able to discern incremental changes in the Shh signal strength and adopt their respective fate accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ribes and Briscoe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balaskas et al., 2012</xref>). This ability requires a cell surface reception system that can transform the graded Shh signal into different levels of signaling output, but how this is accomplished is poorly understood. In the adult, Shh plays a crucial role in guiding the differentiation of tissue-specific stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jaks et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arwert et al., 2012</xref>), and inappropriate activation of Shh signaling could be the culprit that underlines neoplastic growth in the gut epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nielsen et al., 2004</xref>) or lead to outright cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Scales and de Sauvage, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stecca and Ruiz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Northcott et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>At the cell surface, whereas a network of membrane proteins, including Hip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chuang et al., 2003</xref>), Gas1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2001</xref>), Boc/iHog, and Cdo/Boi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Okada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tenzen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beachy et al., 2010</xref>), bind Shh and control the range and competence of its receiving cells, the core of Shh signal reception consists of Patched1 (Ptch1), a 12-pass membrane receptor that acts negatively on Smoothened (Smo), a G-protein-coupled, receptor-like signal transducer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rohatgi and Scott, 2007b</xref>). Binding of Shh to Ptch1 alleviates the Ptch1 inhibition of Smo, allowing the signal to propagate to three Gli proteins, the transcriptional effectors of the pathway, and activate the expression of target genes, including pathway components Ptch1 and Gli1 themselves. Since Gli1 is a potent activator of Shh target genes, its induction by the ligand ensures that pathway activation will attain the intended effect in a positive feedback loop. On the other hand, induction of the inhibitory Ptch1 amounts to a negative feedback control, which was regarded crucial to the interpretation of the Shh gradient signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ribes and Briscoe, 2009</xref>). In effect, Ptch1 serves two roles in Shh signaling: first, it acts cell autonomously in suppressing the downstream pathway, and second, the excessive Ptch1 induced by Shh acts as a sink in limiting the spread of the ligand, thereby affecting the neighboring cells in a non-cell autonomous fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Struhl, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Torroja et al., 2004</xref>). However, it is not clear what counteracts the induction of Ptch1 to achieve the precision of the regulation.</p><p>For many years, Ptch1 and Smo have been seen in punctate intracellular vesicles in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Capdevila et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ramirez-Weber et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2012</xref>), and their trafficking between the cytoplasmic membrane and intracellular vesicles found to be crucial to the activation of the Hedgehog pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denef et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Incardona et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nakano et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Milenkovic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2012</xref>). It is known that ligand engagement of <italic>Drosophila</italic> receptor Ptc triggers its internalization and membrane presentation of Smo, but membrane trafficking of Ptch1 and Smo in mammalian cells has an added complexity in that Shh signals through the primary cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huangfu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corbit et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goetz and Anderson, 2009</xref>), a microtubule-based membrane protrusion that emanates from the interphase centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lefebvre and Rosenbaum, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pazour and Witman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nachury et al., 2010</xref>). The prevailing model for mammalian Shh activation entails Ptch1 exiting from and Smo translocating into the primary cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rohatgi et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kovacs et al., 2008</xref>). Some data suggest that Smo trafficking through membranous compartments is controlled by small lipids and the sterol-sensing domain of Ptch1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bijlsma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corcoran and Scott, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yavari et al., 2010</xref>). Since the structural framework of Ptch1 resembles that of bacterial amino acid transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carstea et al., 1997</xref>), it is conceivable that Ptch1 controls Smo activity or trafficking through such a small molecular intermediate. However, little evidence is available to account for how Ptch1 internalization through endocytosis is regulated, and it is unclear whether ciliary trafficking and endocytosis are obligatorily coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nachury et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Receptor endocytosis plays crucial roles in coordinating the strength and duration of many cell signaling systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Piddini and Vincent, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Polo and Di Fiore, 2006</xref>). At various steps of the endocytic pathway, from the plasma membrane to the endosomes, receptors can be sorted to the proteolytic lumens of lysosomes, leading to desensitization, or back to the plasma membrane for a rapid recovery of cellular responsiveness. In addition to the classical Clathrin-mediated endocytosis, recent advances indicate that membrane receptors are also internalized through lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Le Roy and Wrana, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lajoie and Nabi, 2010</xref>), which are specialized membrane domains enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin and stabilized by Caveolin 1 (Cav-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2007</xref>). Unlike the Clathrin-mediated endocytosis, cargos of caveolae were shown to be unloaded to late endosomes, thereby bypassing early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Quirin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sandvig et al., 2011</xref>). A major forward endocytic sorting signal is ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hicke and Dunn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mukhopadhyay and Riezman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayer et al., 2010</xref>), and many HECT-domain E3 ligases have been implicated in the Ubiquitin control of endocytosis, including Smurf2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Di Guglielmo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Metzger et al., 2012</xref>), which was first identified as a negative regulator of TGF-β/BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kavsak et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>). Here, we present evidence that Smurf1 and Smurf2 are the Ubiquitin E3 ligases that promote Ptch1 movement from lipid rafts to late endosomes for subsequent degradation in lysosomes. This movement is essential for Ptch1's clearance from primary cilia, Shh pathway activation, and the role of Shh in sustaining the proliferation of cerebellar granule cell precursors. In light of the negative feedback control of Shh signaling by Ptch1, this destruction system would allow the level of signaling output to be set precisely according to the level of the Ptch1 protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Both PPXY-motifs deletion and endocytosis blockade cause Ptch1 to accumulate in lipid rafts</title><p>The C-terminal tails of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ptc and mouse Ptch1 play an important role in determining its membrane distribution and stability, possibly through the highly conserved ‘PPXY’ motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kawamura et al., 2008</xref>), which is recognized by the WW domain frequently found in HECT-domain E3 ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Metzger et al., 2012</xref>). Mammalian Ptch1 contains an evolutionarily conserved C-terminal ‘PPXY’ motif and a second one in the third intracellular loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), whereas Ptch2 does not and is quite stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kawamura et al., 2008</xref>). Under a confocal microscope and in transfected murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), Ptch1-GFP was primarily detected in punctate vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), consistent with what was reported in COS and HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Incardona et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Karpen et al., 2001</xref>); a large proportion of these Ptch1-GFP vesicles were likely to be endosomes (see below and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Incardona et al., 2002</xref>). In light of the ubiquitination control of endocytosis, we suspected that the ‘PPXY’ motifs of Ptch1 might be the signal that regulates its turnover through endosomes and lysosomes. To test this hypothesis, we sought to determine how Ptch1 engages the endocytic pathway by focusing our attention at the rim of the plasma membrane, where treatment with conditioned medium (CM) from HEK293 cells expressing the N-terminal signaling fragment of Shh (ShhN) for 1 hr rendered some of the Ptch1-GFP vesicles also positive for Cav-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), a specific marker of lipid rafts. To quantify the colocalization, we sampled 10 randomly selected rim areas from different cells imaged for each data point and calculated the colocalization coefficient. The results indicated that ShhN almost doubled the colocalization coefficient between Ptch1-GFP and endogenous Cav-1 from 0.37 ± 0.04 to 0.68 ± 0.04 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Blocking late endosome/lysosome passage with chloroquine (Chlq) and concanavalin A (ConA) or lysosomal proteolysis with leupeptin (Leu) showed similar effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, the mutant Ptch1Δ2PY-GFP that lacks both ‘PPXY’ motifs exhibited a higher level of colocalization with Cav-1 than its wildtype counterpart even without ShhN treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Some of the Ptch1-GFP vesicles at the plasma rim were also positive for Clathrin heavy chain that marks the Clathrin-coated pits, but in contrast to the ligand-inducible enrichment in Cav-1 lipid rafts, the fraction of Ptch1-GFP in Clathrin-coated pits was affected neither by ligand treatment nor deletion of the ‘PPXY’ motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). To complement the confocal imaging experiments, we conducted a co-sedimentation experiment in a discontinuous sucrose density gradient and found that both Ptch1-FLAG and Ptch1Δ2PY-FLAG co-sedimented with Cav-1 in 20% and 25% buoyancy fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that when expressed exogenously, Ptch1-FLAG can find its way into Cav-1 positive lipid rafts even without Shh induction. Thus, both deletion of the ‘PPXY’ motifs and blocking endocytosis cause Ptch1 to accumulate in lipid rafts.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02555.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The PPXY motifs define sorting signals from lipid rafts to late endosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal images showing colocalization of exogenously expressed Ptch1-GFP or Δ2PY (green) with native Cav-1 (red) at the rim of the plasma membrane, and (<bold>B</bold>) calculation of the colocalization coefficients in (<bold>A</bold>) in transfected MEFs.

Ciliary accumulation of the ‘PPXY’ motif mutants is likely a consequence of their inability to endocytose, rather than a specific defect of ciliary export, since these mutants also accumulate in lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) and blocking endocytosis with high concentration of leupeptin showed a similar effect without or with ShhN treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To support this notion, we made temporal measurements of endogenous Smo translocating into the primary cilium, which is an obligatory early event of Shh signaling and was reported as concurrent to the exit of Ptch1 therefrom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rohatgi et al., 2007a</xref>).

When co-transfected with Ptch1-GFP, the 8xGliBS-luc reporter showed a robust inductive response to ShhN, resulting in a dose–response curve typical of a substrate-enzyme relationship; however, this reporter was barely induced by ShhN when it was co-transfected with Δ2PY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The Shh signaling blockade imposed by Δ2PY could be by-passed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of Sufu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), a downstream negative regulator, suggesting that the blockade is pathway-specific and occurs upstream of Sufu function.

MEFs that lack one of the two <italic>Smurf</italic> genes still mounted a considerable Gli1 transcriptional response to ShhN; however, silencing the remaining <italic>Smurf2</italic> allele in <italic>Smurf1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> or <italic>Smurf1</italic> allele in <italic>Smurf2</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> MEFs, respectively, led to marked curtailment of Gli1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>).

A number of evidence demonstrates that this is the case. First, in non-permeabilizing MEFs, we found exogenously expressed Ptch1-RFP colocalized with the ligase deficient, GFP-tagged Smurf2CG mutant in Cav-1 positive lipid rafts at the rim of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Although first identified as modulators of TGF-β/BMP signaling, Smurfs are preferentially localized in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kavsak et al., 2000</xref>) and play a crucial function in maintaining genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blank et al., 2012</xref>). Serendipitously, we found that treatment with ShhN ligand or co-expression with Ptch1-RFP each caused Smurf2GFP to move from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In light of the Shh induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>), these results indicate that Shh signaling could increase the cytoplasmic pool of Smurfs. Third, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis showed that Ptch1-CFP was localized in close proximity with Smurf1-YFP or Smurf2-YFP at punctate intracellular vesicles in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>), and ShhN treatment enhanced this colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). However, Δ2PY-CFP failed to generate FRET with Smurf2-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). Theses result were further corroborated in the discontinuous sucrose gradient sedimentation experiment described earlier, in which the ligase-deficient Smurf2CG-Myc co-sedimented in the Cav-1-containing 20–25% sucrose fractions readily with Ptch1-FLAG, whereas Δ2PY was inefficient in bringing Smurf2CG-Myc into these fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Finally, using co-immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that Ptch1 specifically binds either Smurf1 or Smurf2, and Ptch1 mutants lacking either PY-1 or PY-2 motif can still bind Smurfs, albeit with reduced affinity; however, Δ2PY completely lacks affinity for either Smurf1 or Smurf2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02555.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Colocalization and interaction between Ptch1 and Smurfs in Cav-1 positive lipid rafts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal images showing colocalization of GFP-Smurf2CG and Ptch1-RFP in Cav-1 positive lipid rafts.

Cell surface reception of Shh signaling is a multistep process that entails, but is not limited to, ligand engagement, reciprocal movements of Ptch1 exiting from and Smo translocating into the primary cilium, and activation of the G-protein-coupled Smo by still-controversial mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ogden et al., 2008</xref>). The central task of this process is to sense and convert incremental changes in the Shh gradient into corresponding levels of signaling output, thereby allowing the positional cues to be executed. In this study, we extended our knowledge of the Shh signaling activation process by revealing a ubiquitination switch that regulates Ptch1 endocytosis, which is essential in clearing Ptch1 from its site of action in the primary cilium, and to ligand sequestration, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Incardona et al., 2000</xref>). Our data demonstrate that ubiquitination of Ptch1 mediated by the two ‘PPXY’ motifs is controlled by HECT-domain E3 ligases Smurf1 and Smurf2, which are induced by Shh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,G</xref>) and redistributed into the cytoplasm under Shh influence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Shh also promotes the association of Ptch1 and Smurfs in intracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), most likely the Cav-1 positive lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), as well as ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>) and endosomal entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>), leading to lysosomal turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig8">Figures 1F, 8A–D</xref>). So, an increase in the Shh signal strength would cause a corresponding increase in both the production of Ptch1 and its rate of turnover en route from the primary cilium to the lipid rafts and to the endosomes/lysosomes. This regulatory scheme is reminiscent of an electronic amplification circuit, in which a feedback loop added to an open-loop amplifier has the effect of stabilizing the gain and increasing the linearity of the output signal to a given range, which can be controlled by adjusting the feedback strength. By analogy, Shh induction of Gli1 can be viewed as the open-loop amplifier, with Ptch1 providing the negative feedback. In this wiring logic, the graded Shh morphogenic signal can be stably transformed into stepwise output responses tailored for a predetermined cell fate specification. Without endocytosis, Ptch1 would accumulate in the primary cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), thus hampering Smo import and function. More importantly, without Ptch1 removal/degradation, the amplitude of Shh signaling would be restricted by the accumulation of newly synthesized inhibitory Ptch1. Oversupplied Ptch1 could also impact on signaling in neighboring cells through non-cell autonomous inhibition. So, Ptch1 endocytosis plays a crucial role in setting the output range of Shh signaling.</p><p>The presence of Ptc in membranous vesicles has long been noted in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Capdevila et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denef et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ramirez-Weber et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu et al., 2003</xref>), but its significance was not fully appreciated and regulation unknown. Ptc or Ptch1 is a 12-pass transmembrane protein, whose internal sequence spanning from IV to X transmembrane domains resembles the resistance, nodulation, division (RND) family of bacterial proton-driven transporter and the sterol-sensing domain found in SREBP and NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carstea et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Taipale et al., 2002</xref>). Substantial evidence in the literature suggests that Ptch1 inhibition of Smo occurs by way of small molecular intermediates that may be transported by Ptch1 through the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Di Guglielmo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bijlsma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yavari et al., 2010</xref>). Perhaps it is not a coincidence that we found Ptch1 exits the primary cilium and enters the endocytic pathway via cholesterol and sphingomyelin-rich lipid rafts, whereas Smo was shown previously to enter the primary cilium via Clathrin-coated pits when induced by Shh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kovacs et al., 2008</xref>). It is possible that Ptch1 and Smo are required to be sorted into different membranous compartments and to keep a mutually exclusive presence in the primary cilium, so that a cross-membrane imbalance of the small molecular intermediates is attained. The RND/sterol-sensing domain is critical to Ptch1 function as multiple inactivating mutations in this region have been found in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as well as in Gorlin syndrome patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Strutt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Taipale et al., 2002</xref>). However, although certain RND mutants of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ptc accumulate in endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Strutt et al., 2001</xref>), this domain may be more important to Ptch1 function than to its endocytic turnover, since we found that combining a RND mutation with the 2-PY deletion did not alter the latter's impact on Ptch1 stability (data not shown).</p><p>Through cDNA-mediated screens, we have identified Smurf1 and Smurf2 as the E3 ligases responsible for generating the sorting signal for Ptch1 endocytosis. Although subsequent experiments indicated that deletion of one <italic>Smurf</italic> gene was not sufficient to inactivate Shh signaling, siRNA-mediated knockdown of either <italic>Smurf1</italic> or <italic>Smurf2</italic> was enough to dampen the 8xGliBS reporter response in transfected MEFs. This apparent discrepancy is likely to be reconciled by the mutual, compensatory upregulation of either of the two <italic>Smurf</italic> genes upon the loss of the other, resulting in the adaptation of single-<italic>Smurf</italic>-knockout MEFs for a robust Shh signaling response. On the other hand, such an adaptive response might not have been established in time under the conditions found in transiently transfected MEFs in response to siRNA-mediated knockdown. The observation of Shh induction of Smurf expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,G</xref>) and cytoplasmic pivoting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) further implicated Smurfs in Shh signaling. Previously, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ptc was shown to interact with and regulated by Nedd4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2006</xref>), another HECT-domain E3 ligase. In addition, the mouse Ptch1 was also shown to bind Nedd4, but this interaction triggers apoptosis through ubiquitination of Caspase 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fombonne et al., 2012</xref>). It is likely that Ptch1 is regulated by multiple E3 ligases with different functional outcomes. Recently, <italic>Drosophila</italic> DSmurf was identified as a Ptc-interacting partner in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, and shown subsequently as a specific E3 ligase that regulates Ptc stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). However, DSmurf was shown to promote Ptc turnover in the presence of activated Smo<sup>SD</sup>, bind Smo, and prefer ligand-unbound Ptc as a substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). We did not observe interaction between mammalian Smurfs and Smo by Co-IP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), and found that Shh induction of Ptch1 turnover proceeded unabatedly even in the absence of Smo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G,H</xref>). In Huang et al., when ectopically expressed in the anterior compartment of the wing disc, activated Smo<sup>SD</sup> induced massive amount of Ptc; these two proteins could form a complex at the high levels, much like their mammalian counterparts do when overexpressed in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stone et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Taipale et al., 2002</xref>). Perhaps, DSmurf could recognize this unnatural complex and triggers a proteasomes-mediated degradation, even specifically.</p><p>Smurf2 was shown previously to function in lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Di Guglielmo et al., 2003</xref>), and the necessity of removing both <italic>Smurf1</italic> and <italic>Smurf2</italic> to reveal their requirement in Shh signaling strongly argues that this shared function has a deep root in evolution. In any event, our work presents a rather comprehensive view of the Shh pathway activation process. Considering two neighboring cells in a given Shh influence field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>), the cell that receives lower Shh input (upper cell) encounters a stronger feedback inhibition due to lower endocytic turnover of Ptch1, resulting in a lower level of Shh signaling output represented by Gli1. In the cell that receives higher Shh input (lower cell), although the synthesis of Ptch1 is induced, upregulation of Smurfs and the induction of colocalization in lipid rafts ensure a faster Ptch1 turnover such that the level of Ptch1 feedback inhibition is actually low, resulting in higher pathway activity. The endocytic turnover also has impact on the ligand sequestration role of Ptch1 through controlling the availability of the ligand ‘sink’ on cell surface. In this regard, the Smurf-mediated endocytosis of Ptch1 is an essential signaling event, and it is theoretically possible to block Shh function both cell and non-cell autonomously using Smurf inhibitors, thus opening a new route for Shh-targeted cancer treatment.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02555.023</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>A model for the role of Smurf-mediated Ptch endocytosis in Shh signaling.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02555.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02555.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02555-fig11-v2.tif"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All mice were maintained and handled according to protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Cancer Institute, NIH.

They provided evidence that Shh promotes Ptch1 enrichment in the lipid rafts and that the PPXY sorting signals (PY motifs) in Ptch1 promotes endocytosis and degradation of Ptch1. They further showed that the PY motifs are required for Shh-induced ciliary exit of Ptch1 and optimal Hh pathway activation. They identified Smurf 1 and 2 as two E3 critical ligases that promote Ptch1 ubiquitination and degradation through the PY motifs. Interestingly, they found that the expression of Smurf1/2 is upregulated in response to Shh. By using FRET and CoIP, they provided evidence that Smurf and Ptch1 physically interact depending on the PY motifs. Finally, they showed that genetic ablation of Smurf1 and 2 specifically affected Shh-induced proliferation of GCPs. Overall, the experiments were well executed and the data are convincing. The work is complementary to a recent publication that mainly described a role of Smurf in targeting Drosophila Ptc (Huang et al., PLOS Bio 2013), and represents an important advance in the field, allowing one to compare and contrast the fly and mammalian systems. However, the authors should address the following concerns either by discussion or by additional experiments before publication is recommended.</p><p>1) Whereas the evidence for Smurf/PY-mediated Ptch1 endocytosis and degradation is strong, it is not so clear how this process is promoted by Shh. Although Shh-induced upregulation of Smurf could contribute, other mechanisms may exist. Have the authors examined whether Shh promotes the binding of Smurf to Ptch1? For example, does Shh treatment increase the FRET between GFP-Smurf2CG and Ptch1-RFP shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A-C</xref>? On the other hand, Smurf-mediated degradation of Ptch1 could be Shh independent, as suggested by Casali (Science Signaling, 2010). For example, Ptch1Δ2, which has the Shh binding domain deleted (Briscoe et al., Mol Cell 2001), might still be regulated by Smurf/PY. Furthermore, Huang et al suggested that Smurf prefers degrading ligand-unbound Ptc (Huang et al., PLOS Bio 2013). How could the authors reconcile their finding that Shh promotes Ptch1 degradation? Could they examine whether Ptch1Δ2 is degraded more or less effectively by Smurf than Ptch1 in the presence of Shh?</p><p>2) Huang et al argued that Smurf-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of Ptc are promoted by activated forms of Smo (Smo<sup>SD</sup>) in Drosophila (Huang et al., PLOS Bio 2013). Have the authors examined whether Shh promotes Ptch1 degradation through Smo? For example, does overexpression of mammalian Smo<sup>SD</sup> promote Smurf-mediated ubiquitination/degradation of Ptch1?</p><p>3) The authors showed that mutating the PY motifs or Smurf1/2 affected both Ptch1 ciliary exit and endocytosis. Is the failure of Ptch1 ciliary exit the result of defective endocytosis? Or could Shh induce Ptch1 ubiquitination in the primary cilium, which may directly regulate ciliary exit of Ptch1? Is there any evidence that Smurf1/2 can be found in the primary cilium with or without Shh treatment? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, can Shh trigger ciliary exit of Ptch1 in the absence of Smurf1/2? Does pharmacological blockage of Ptch1 endocytosis/degradation affect Ptch1 ciliary exit?</p><p>4) The effect of Δ2PY-GFP on Smo ciliary localization presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> does not match the quantification well, especially at 4 hours after Shh treatment where there is almost no difference in the ciliary Smo levels between Δ2PY-GFP and Ptch1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) while there is a 2-told difference in the quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The authors need to provide a better image reflecting the quantification. Of note, it has been shown that Shh/Ptch1 regulates both the ciliary localization and conformation of Smo (Zhao et al., nature 2007). Have the authors examined whether Δ2PY-GFP affect mSmo conformation using FRET analysis?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>In this manuscript Yue et al. uncover a role for the Hect E3 ligases Smurf1 and Smurf2 in promoting Hedgehog-dependent changes in the subcellular localization of the Patched receptor that leads to their increased turnover. This Smurf1/2-mediated trafficking of Patched is also important for its exit from primary cilia during pathway activation. Using cultured cells including MEFs knockout for Smurf1&amp;2, the authors show that this trafficking event is, in turn, important for the ciliary accumulation of Smoothened and for the activation of Gli-mediated transcription. The authors show that the Shh-promoted proliferation of granule cell progenitors requires Smurf1 and Smurf2, suggesting an important function of this regulatory mechanism in a well-characterized physiological context dependent on Hedgehog ligands.</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript that adds to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying Hedgehog signaling. In particular, although it has been speculated that endocytic trafficking may be implicated in Patched and Smoothened localization, ciliary accumulation and signaling, the molecular mechanisms implicated in this process are poorly defined.</p><p>The strongest aspects of this manuscript are the loss of function experiments conducted with the Sf1-/-,Sf2fl/fl MEFs and GPCs. Indeed, the complete absence of Sf1 and Sf2 leads to a remarkable inhibition of Smo and Gli3 ciliary localization and blunting of Shh-promoted induction of Gli1 levels in MEFs. These results are strongly supported by the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> showing a reduction of neural progenitors in cerebellar slice cultures knockout for Sf1 and Sf2 and an inability of Shh to promote the in vitro proliferation of granule cell progenitors when Sf1 and Sf2 are knocked out. These experiments strongly support an important functional requirement of Smurf proteins for Hedgehog signal transduction.</p><p>In terms of mechanisms describing the function of Smurf proteins, the evidence presented in the manuscript are however disappointing in that they are too often not convincing, confusing or incomplete. For example, according to their model, Hedgehog ligands are shown to promote the localization of Patched in caveolae, a transitory localization that promote the Smurf dependent ubiquitination of Patched and its endosomal routing to the lysosomes where it is degraded. First of all, although scattered evidence suggests that caveosomes and endosomes may physically interact in specific contexts, the authors present their evidence supporting a role of Rab proteins and endosomal trafficking in promoting Patched exit from caveolae as a well defined and accepted mechanism. However, caveolae-mediated endocytosis is most often described to be separate from endosomal sorting. Although this could represent a novel sorting mechanism for cell surface receptors, the characterization of this process needs to be strengthened and better discussed.</p><p>Moreover, all of the evidence supporting the localization of Ptch in different subcellular fraction relies on overexpression experiments and on colocalization with overexpressed markers tagged with fluorescent proteins (especially important for Rab7). These experiments should be repeated using endogenous proteins and images obtained at higher resolution to more precisely follow the fate of Ptch trafficking and more convincingly support the implication of caveolae and/or endosomal trafficking.</p><p>In addition in my opinion the biggest question that is left unanswered is how ubiquitination of Patched by Smurf proteins contributes to its function. Do Smurfs lead to Patched mono-ubiquitination or to K63 or K48 ubiquitin chain conjugations? Is ubiquitination involved in Patched endocytosis per se or in its sorting from endosomes to lysosomes? Does Hedgehog ligand promote the interaction of Patched with Smurfs? Do Hedgehog ligands promote Patched ubiquitination?</p><p>There also seems to be a disconnection between the results obtained using the Ptch-d2PY mutant (when rescuing the Ptch1-/- MEFs) and the results obtained in the Sf1, Sf2 double KO cells. Indeed, whereas the Shh-promoted accumulation of Smo and Gli1 activation are blunted in the dKO cells, Smo accumulation is only reduced when the d2PY mutant is expressed (4C,D). Since the interaction between the d2PY mutant and Smurf proteins seems to be completely abolished (9E) how is this explained? If there is more Ptch1-d2PY in cilia, why do Smo enters at all?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>In the manuscript entitled “Requirement of Smurf-Mediated Endocytosis of Patched 1 in Sonic Hedgehog Signal Reception”, Yu et al. present evidence that Smurf1 and Smurf2 promote ubiquitination of PTCH1 resulting in endocytic turnover that is required for HH pathway activation. In particular, the authors provide significant experimental data examining the subcellular localization of PTCH1 and the role of two PPXY motifs in regulating PTCH1 localization turnover, and downstream effects on HH pathway function. While, overall the results appear to be of high quality, there are some issues with both interpretation of the data and proper acknowledgement of previous work that the authors must address.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) There is an unfortunate lack of proper citation of previous work by other labs in this field. Two essential examples include the recent publication of work identifying a role for Smurfs in regulating Drosophila Ptc turnover (Huang et al., PLOS Biology, 2013), and work from Tom Kornberg that defined a role for the PPXY motif in regulating the turnover of vertebrate PTCH1 (Kawamura et al., JBC, 2008). These two papers directly impact the current study by Yue et al., and this work should be considered in the context of these previous studies.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the authors utilize Ptch1-/- MEFs to address differences in the ability of PTCH1 and PTCH1Δ2PY to promote ligand-dependent signaling. However, the authors miss an opportunity to distinguish between the ligand-dependent and ligand-independent effects of PTCH1 in the HH pathway. They should use these cells and constructs to examine the ability of PTCH1 or PTCH1Δ2PY to antagonize SMO in the absence of ligand. That is, Ptch1-/- MEFs display constitutive HH pathway activation; however, re-expressing PTCH1 rescues this pathway activity. The question is whether PTCH1Δ2PY is equally effective? Do the authors observe equivalent antagonism of SMO in these cells? Or is PTCH1Δ2PY a more effective antagonist of SMO than wt PTCH1? These are straightforward questions to address since the authors have all the necessary tools and reagents in hand.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02555.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>In this manuscript, Yue et al investigated the role of Smurf-mediated Ptch1 ubiquitination in the regulation of Shh signaling.

Our previous and new data indicate that Shh promotes the Smurf-mediated endocytosis of Ptch1 in several ways. First, Smurfs are preferentially localized in the nucleus in normal cells (Kavsak et al., Mol Cell 6:1365-75, 2000) and play important roles in maintaining the genomic stability (Blank et al, Nature Medicine 18:227-34, 2012). In the revised manuscript, we show that Shh promotes a re-pivoting of Smurf2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, our data also show that Shh induces Smurfs expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, 5G</xref>). So, these two events should lead to an increase of the effective cytoplasmic concentration of Smurfs. Third, as requested, we conducted a new FRET experiment and found that Shh indeed promotes the colocalization of Ptch1 and Smurf2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Fourth, we further add new data showing that ShhN treatment enhances the ubiquitin modification of Ptch1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), consistent with our data showing that Shh promotes Ptch1 turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>In Huang et al, the authors ectopically expressed activated Smo mutants, Smo<sup>SD</sup>, in the entire A-compartment, which drastically increased the level of Ptc (Huang et al, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). They argue that DSmurf prefers the ligand-unbound Ptc as a substrate because ectopic expression of DSmurf reduced Ptc staining selectively in the A compartment. However, comparing their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and 4E</xref>, one could find that the intensity of Ptc staining at the A/P boundary was also reduced by DSmurf, notwithstanding the fact that Ptc is normally high at the boundary. On the other hand, since the authors did not examine the distribution of Hh in the disc that received the ectopically expressed Smo<sup>SD</sup>, it would be an unsupported assumption that the elevated Ptc in the A compartment was still in the unbound form. After all, the Hh ligand is normally restricted to the compartmental border by the high level of Ptc there. If the border stripe of high level Ptc was made to expand, Hh zone should expand with it. Furthermore, it is well known in the field that Ptc and Smo, when over-expressed, tend to form a nonphysiological complex (Stone et al, Nature 384:129, 1996, and Taipale et al, Nature 418:892, 2002).This raises a possibility that the nonphysiological Ptc-Smo complex could trigger an “unfolded protein response” of some sort that leads to the DSmurf-mediated destruction. This type of degradation is very different from the one that we describe in our manuscript, although both could be mediated by the Smurf E3 ubiquitin ligases, even specifically.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above analysis, assuming DSmurf does prefer the ligand unbound form of Ptc for degradation, this would put the site of DSmurf action in the A compartment, where Ptc level is low and Smo is in an inactive state. However, their data indicated that Smo has to be activated in order to promote Ptc degradation. In Huang et al, there is no data that either indicate or imply the source of the activated Smo for activating the Smurf-mediated Ptc turnover or to explain this conspicuous conflict.</p><p>We measured the turnover rate of the loop2 mutant of Ptch1 in wt MEFs, and found that the effect of Shh ligand induction was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E, 8F</xref>). We further quantified the turnover rate of Ptch1 in Smo<sup>null</sup> cells, and found that Shh still promotes Ptch1 turnover there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig.8G, 8H</xref>). Moreover, we did not detect interaction between Smo and Smurfs by co-IP experiments, even though Smurf was shown to bind Ptch1 readily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure7–figure supplement 2</xref>). So, these results demonstrate that Smurfs likely promote Ptch1 endocytic turnover through direct binding, rather than using Smo as an intermediate, as suggested by Huang et al. However, Smo probably still has a long term feedback role through enhancing downstream Smurf gene expression.</p><p><italic>2) Huang et al argued that Smurf-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of Ptc are promoted by activated forms of Smo (Smo</italic><sup><italic>SD</italic></sup><italic>) in Drosophila (Huang et al., PLOS Bio 2013). Have the authors examined whether Shh promotes Ptch1 degradation through Smo? For example, does overexpression of mammalian Smo</italic><sup><italic>SD</italic></sup> <italic>promote Smurf-mediated ubiquitination/degradation of Ptch1?</italic></p><p>As stated above, we examined Ptch1 turnover in Smo<sup>null</sup> cells, and found that Shh still promotes Ptch1 turnover. We also found by Co-IP experiment that Ptch1 binds Smurf but Smo does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7-figure supplement 2</xref>). These data strongly argue that Shh-induced, Smurfs-mediated Ptch1 endocytic turnover is independent of Smo.</p><p><italic>3) The authors showed that mutating the PY motifs or Smurf1/2 affected both Ptch1 ciliary exit and endocytosis. Is the failure of Ptch1 ciliary exit the result of defective endocytosis? Or could Shh induce Ptch1 ubiquitination in the primary cilium, which may directly regulate ciliary exit of Ptch1? Is there any evidence that Smurf1/2 can be found in the primary cilium with or without Shh treatment? In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6C</italic></xref><italic>, can Shh trigger ciliary exit of Ptch1 in the absence of Smurf1/2? Does pharmacological blockage of Ptch1 endocytosis/degradation affect Ptch1 ciliary exit?</italic></p><p>It is our interpretation that Ptch1Δ2PY fails to exit cilia because of defective endocytosis. Despite an initial hypothesis, we found neither endogenous nor transfected Smurfs in the cilia with or without Shh treatment. Our data also show that the Shh-induced ciliary export of Ptch1 was compromised when Smurf1 and Smurf2 were knocked down with siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). We further show that blocking Ptch1 endocytosis with Leupeptin also blocked its ciliary exit (this result were not included in the previous submission, but is now added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> in the revised manuscript).</p><p><italic>4) The effect of Δ2PY-GFP on Smo ciliary localization presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>does not match the quantification well, especially at 4 hours after Shh treatment where there is almost no difference in the ciliary Smo levels between Δ2PY-GFP and Ptch1-GFP (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref><italic>) while there is a 2-told difference in the quantification (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4D</italic></xref><italic>). The authors need to provide a better image reflecting the quantification. Of note, it has been shown that Shh/Ptch1 regulates both the ciliary localization and conformation of Smo (Zhao et al., nature 2007). Have the authors examined whether Δ2PY-GFP affect mSmo conformation using FRET analysis?</italic></p><p>We replaced the images in the old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> with better ones in the revision (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). By using a sophisticated FRET imaging approach, Zhao et al elegantly demonstrated that Hh induces phosphorylation and a conformational change of Smo c-tail that result in Smo dimerization and activation of downstream signaling. Their work also extended this observation to mammalian Smo. However, this regulation, albeit a likely key event in the Shh pathway activation, lies downstream to Ptch1 functions. Since we have demonstrated that Shh-induced Ptch1 endocytic turnover is independent of Smo, and analyzed extensively the ciliary trafficking of Smo, another well recognized key event of the Shh pathway activation, we felt that examining Δ2PY-GFP on mSmo conformation would be a repetition of an already well-addressed issue. In addition, setting up the FRET experiment on Smo conformation would not be a trivial endeavor, if one needs to do it properly. If this reviewer and the editors deem this FRET experiment absolutely essential, which we would respectfully disagree, we will perform as demanded, provided that we are granted additional time.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>In this manuscript Yue et al. uncover a role for the Hect E3 ligases Smurf1 and Smurf2 in promoting Hedgehog-dependent changes in the subcellular localization of the Patched receptor that leads to their increased turnover</italic>. <italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>The strongest aspects of this manuscript are the loss of function experiments conducted with the Sf1-/-,Sf2fl/fl MEFs and GPCs. Indeed, the complete absence of Sf1 and Sf2 leads to a remarkable inhibition of Smo and Gli3 ciliary localization and blunting of Shh-promoted induction of Gli1 levels in MEFs. These results are strongly supported by the experiments in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11"><italic>Figure 11</italic></xref> <italic>showing a reduction of neural progenitors in cerebellar slice cultures knockout for Sf1 and Sf2 and an inability of Shh to promote the in vitro proliferation of granule cell progenitors when Sf1 and Sf2 are knocked out. These experiments strongly support an important functional requirement of Smurf proteins for Hedgehog signal transduction</italic>.</p><p><italic>In terms of mechanisms describing the function of Smurf proteins, the evidence presented in the manuscript are however disappointing in that they are too often not convincing, confusing or incomplete. For example, according to their model, Hedgehog ligands are shown to promote the localization of Patched in caveolae, a transitory localization that promote the Smurf dependent ubiquitination of Patched and its endosomal routing to the lysosomes where it is degraded. First of all, although scattered evidence suggests that caveosomes and endosomes may physically interact in specific contexts, the authors present their evidence supporting a role of Rab proteins and endosomal trafficking in promoting Patched exit from caveolae as a well defined and accepted mechanism. However, caveolae-mediated endocytosis is most often described to be separate from endosomal sorting. Although this could represent a novel sorting mechanism for cell surface receptors, the characterization of this process needs to be strengthened and better discussed</italic>.</p><p>We agree with this reviewer that caveolae was a recently recognized alternative route for internalization of membrane-bound ligand-receptor complexes, but this phenomenon was actually noted more than two decades ago. At that time, a term of “potocytosis” was coined to distinguish it from the Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Anderson RG, Science 255:410-1, 1992; Gleizes PE, Eur. J. Cell Biology 71:144-53, 1996), because the cargo of potocytosis was thought to be emptied directly into the cytosol. Later studies demonstrated that caveolae-mediated internalization actually feeds into the conventional endocytic pathway, and “caveosomes”, which were previously regarded as independent organelles distinct from endosomes, were actually late endosomes modified by the accumulated Caveolin-1 therein (Hayer et al, J Cell Biol 191:615-29, 2010; Sandvig et al, Curr Opin Cell Biol 23:413-420, 2011). To clarify this issue, we made modifications in the Introduction and cited several key references.</p><p><italic>Moreover, all of the evidence supporting the localization of Ptch in different subcellular fraction relies on overexpression experiments and on colocalization with overexpressed markers tagged with fluorescent proteins (especially important for Rab7). These experiments should be repeated using endogenous proteins and images obtained at higher resolution to more precisely follow the fate of Ptch trafficking and more convincingly support the implication of caveolae and/or endosomal trafficking</italic>.</p><p>Antibodies again mouse Ptch1 are not commercially available, precluding a direct visualization of the endogenous Ptch1, which is present at extremely low level in cells (Rohatgi et al Science). Fluorescence labeled Rab5, Rab7, and Lamp1 are widely used for marking early endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes, and the data in question were generated through confocal imaging on a newly acquired Zeiss LSM710 microscope. We have repeated the experiments in question using Ptch1GFP and antibodies against endogenous Rab5, Rab7, and Lamp1, respectively. The data are displayed in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1 fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplements 1 and 3</xref>. Signals from antibody staining of endogenous proteins were quite low, probably reflecting the low abundance of the interacting species or the low avidity of this commercial antibody, nevertheless, colocalization between Ptch1GFP and Rab7 poitive late endosomes was confirmed. We also showed colocalization between Ptch1GFP and Lamp1 positive lysosomes using leupeptin to block proteolysis. However, we were unable to detect colocalization between Ptch1GFP and early endosomes (Rab5) without or with ShhN treatment, confirming our previous finding that Ptch1 traverses from lipid rafts directly to late endosomes, bypassing early endosomes. Finally, the d2PY mutant was not colocalized with any of these vesicles. We want to emphasize that these confocal images presented were taken in z-stack using a 63x oil lens. Some images may appear fuzzy, particularly in colocalizing areas/vesicles. This is likely because only a very small fraction of cytoplasmic Ptch1 is channeled to the endocytic pathway; the bulk of forced expressed Ptch1 still turns over via proteasomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p><italic>In addition in my opinion the biggest question that is left unanswered is how ubiquitination of Patched by Smurf proteins contributes to its function. Do Smurfs lead to Patched mono-ubiquitination or to K63 or K48 ubiquitin chain conjugations? Is ubiquitination involved in Patched endocytosis per se or in its sorting from endosomes to lysosomes? Does Hedgehog ligand promote the interaction of Patched with Smurfs? Do Hedgehog ligands promote Patched ubiquitination?</italic></p><p>In our humble opinion, elucidation of the type of Smurfs-mediated ubiquitin modification of Ptch1is certainly informative, but is nevertheless a mechanistic detail in our investigation. It is also extremely difficult to visualize monoubiquitination of Ptch1 under natural settings, given the size of this protein. We did however use mutant forms of ubiquitin and found that Smurf2 promotes Ptch1 to undergo both K63 and K48 ubiquitin chain-mediated ubiquitination (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). We further show that Shh-N promotes interaction of Ptch1 with Smurfs (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) and Ptch1 polyubiquitination (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Because Ptch1 ΔPY is accumulated in Caveolin-positive lipid raft but not in late endosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figs.1A, 1B, and 2A, 2B</xref>), we believe that Smurf-mediated Ptch1 ubiquitination is involved in sorting of Ptch1 from lipid raft to late endosomes.</p><p><italic>There also seems to be a disconnection between the results obtained using the Ptch-d2PY mutant (when rescuing the Ptch1-/- MEFs) and the results obtained in the Sf1, Sf2 double KO cells. Indeed, whereas the Shh-promoted accumulation of Smo and Gli1 activation are blunted in the dKO cells, Smo accumulation is only reduced when the d2PY mutant is expressed (4C,D). Since the interaction between the d2PY mutant and Smurf proteins seems to be completely abolished (9E) how is this explained? If there is more Ptch1-d2PY in cilia, why do Smo enters at all?</italic></p><p>We replaced the d2PY images in old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> as well as those in old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> with new ones that better reflect the corresponding statistic graphs. We apologize for those images that may have exaggerated the difference. Judging from the data graphs, it is clear that the reduction in Smo ciliary localization and Gli1 activation caused by d2PY deletion is clearly in line with that by Smurfs knockdown (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, time point 1-4 hours vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, 6C</xref>).</p><p>With regard to the last question, the current paradigm of Ptch1 inhibiting Smo by preventing the latter entry into cilia is based on the observation that Smo moves in whereas Ptch1 moves out of cilia under the influence of Shh (Rohatgi et al, Science 317:372-8, 2007). However, there is no evidence to indicate that the presence of these two membrane receptors in the cilium is mutually exclusive. To the contrary, there are published studies reporting cyclopamine actually promotes Smo entry into the cilium, suggesting that Smo and Ptch1 can co-exist in cilia.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>In the manuscript entitled “Requirement of Smurf-Mediated Endocytosis of Patched 1 in Sonic Hedgehog Signal Reception”, Yu et al. present evidence that Smurf1 and Smurf2 promote ubiquitination of PTCH1 resulting in endocytic turnover that is required for HH pathway activation. In particular, the authors provide significant experimental data examining the subcellular localization of PTCH1 and the role of two PPXY motifs in regulating PTCH1 localization turnover, and downstream effects on HH pathway function. While, overall the results appear to be of high quality, there are some issues with both interpretation of the data and proper acknowledgement of previous work that the authors must address</italic>.</p><p><italic>Major comments:</italic></p><p><italic>1) There is an unfortunate lack of proper citation of previous work by other labs in this field. Two essential examples include the recent publication of work identifying a role for Smurfs in regulating Drosophila Ptc turnover (Huang et al., PLOS Biology, 2013), and work from Tom Kornberg that defined a role for the PPXY motif in regulating the turnover of vertebrate PTCH1 (Kawamura et al., JBC, 2008). These two papers directly impact the current study by Yue et al., and this work should be considered in the context of these previous studies</italic>.</p><p>We have cited these two papers and discussed extensively the Huang’s recent publication.</p><p><italic>2) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>, the authors utilize Ptch1-/- MEFs to address differences in the ability of PTCH1 and PTCH1Δ2PY to promote ligand-dependent signaling. However, the authors miss an opportunity to distinguish between the ligand-dependent and ligand-independent effects of PTCH1 in the HH pathway. They should use these cells and constructs to examine the ability of PTCH1 or PTCH1Δ2PY to antagonize SMO in the absence of ligand. That is, Ptch1-/- MEFs display constitutive HH pathway activation; however, re-expressing PTCH1 rescues this pathway activity. The question is whether PTCH1Δ2PY is equally effective? Do the authors observe equivalent antagonism of SMO in these cells? Or is PTCH1Δ2PY a more effective antagonist of SMO than wt PTCH1? These are straightforward questions to address since the authors have all the necessary tools and reagents in hand</italic>.</p><p>We did the experiment as requested and the results indicate that Δ2PY is equally effective as the wt Ptch1 in antagonizing Smo in Ptch1-/- MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This is different from the results obtained from Shh-induced signaling events.</p></body></sub-article></article>
