pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37122.001</object-id><p>The RAS family of proteins is amongst the most highly mutated in human cancers and has so far eluded drug therapy. Currently, much effort is being made to discover mutant RAS inhibitors and in vitro screening for RAS-binding drugs must be followed by cell-based assays. Here, we have developed a robust set of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based RAS biosensors that enable monitoring of RAS-effector interaction inhibition in living cells. These include KRAS, HRAS and NRAS and a variety of different mutations that mirror those found in human cancers with the major RAS effectors such as CRAF, PI3K and RALGDS. We highlighted the utility of these RAS biosensors by showing a RAS-binding compound is a potent pan-RAS-effector interactions inhibitor in cells. The RAS biosensors represent a useful tool to investigate and characterize the potency of anti-RAS inhibitors in cells and more generally any RAS protein-protein interaction (PPI) in cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37122.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A group of proteins known as the RAS family plays a critical role in controlling animal cell growth and division. RAS proteins are normally active only some of the time, but genetic mutations can create permanently active forms of the proteins. These constantly interact with other proteins called effectors. In response, cells multiply uncontrollably and give rise to cancers.</p><p>In an attempt to find new cancer treatments, researchers across the globe are trying to develop inhibitor drugs that prevent RAS and effector proteins from interacting. New drugs are often tested in laboratory experiments that directly apply the drugs to the proteins that they are designed to work on. But in some cases a drug may work wellin the laboratory but fail to work when used in cells. Unfortunately, there are few ways to judge how well inhibitor drugs work inside living cells.</p><p>Bery et al. have now developed RAS biosensors – a collection of proteins that bind to RAS and produce light more brightly when RAS interacts with effector proteins in living cells. Tests on cells treated with an antibody that works inside cells and is known to prevent interactions between RAS and effector proteins confirmed that the RAS biosensors work well. Bery et al. then used the RAS biosensors to show that a new RAS inhibitor works in human cancer cells.</p><p>The RAS biosensors are available upon request to researchers across the globe. They should form an important tool for testing potential treatments for cancers that contain mutated RAS proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RAS</kwd><kwd>BRET</kwd><kwd>biosensors</kwd><kwd>protein-protein interaction inhibition</kwd><kwd>cell-based assays</kwd><kwd>intracellular antibody</kwd><kwd>small molecule inhibitors</kwd><kwd>drug development</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/J000612/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rabbitts</surname><given-names>Terence H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>099246/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rabbitts</surname><given-names>Terence H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007903</institution-id><institution>Bloodwise</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rabbitts</surname><given-names>Terence H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100842/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rabbitts</surname><given-names>Terence H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A biosensor resource has been developed to monitor the intracellular interactions of RAS family proteins with effector molecules and the effects of inhibitors as an aid to drug development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>RAS</italic> is the most prominent oncogene identified in cancer. Mutation in RAS proteins can be found in approximately 30% of all human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Downward, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Prior et al., 2012</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic">http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic</ext-link>) prompting interest in the discovery of anti-RAS therapeutics. However, there are still no RAS-targeted drugs currently available in the clinic even though such molecules could prove widely efficacious in many human cancers as front-line drugs for therapy. Some forms of cancer, like pancreatic cancer, present late and are difficult therefore to treat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kleeff et al., 2016</xref>) but these contain a high proportion of <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations and are thus potentially susceptible to RAS-binding drugs.</p><p>RAS has been regarded as undruggable partly because so far attempts to interfere with the protein have not been efficacious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cox et al., 2014</xref>). RAS is a membrane-bound small GTPase switching between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. RAS signaling to the cell nucleus occurs after interaction of RAS-GTP with its effectors to trigger the activation of downstream signaling pathways. This activation thereby promotes cell survival and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wennerberg et al., 2005</xref>) via gene modulation so that the blockade of mutant RAS signaling in tumors cells is an attractive therapeutic option. There are several ways in which this could be achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Athuluri-Divakar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burns et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spiegel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zimmermann et al., 2013</xref>) but methods such as implementing farnesylation inhibitors have limited success due to side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berndt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">James et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whyte et al., 1997</xref>). One avenue that has largely been avoided in inhibiting RAS is the interaction with its effectors, such as RAF, RALGDS and PI3K. However, the effectiveness of the orthosteric RAS-effector PPI inhibition was shown using intracellular antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tanaka and Rabbitts, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>) (herein called macrodrugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanaka and Rabbitts, 2008</xref>) to distinguish them from conventional small molecule drugs) and a single domain intracellular antibody that blocks effector interaction sites of RAS-GTP. This PPI inhibition can prevent tumor growth in xenograft models and tumor initiation in a transgenic mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka and Rabbitts, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>). Other macrodrugs, such as DARPins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guillard et al., 2017</xref>), have also been shown to be effective in interfering with RAS PPIs. Moreover, for many years, RAS was regarded as a protein without any pockets suitable for small molecule interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCormick, 2016</xref>) but recent studies have described compounds that are able to bind RAS-associated pockets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gentile et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lito et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maurer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ostrem et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Patricelli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Waldmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Welsch et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Most of the current RAS inhibitors have been selected and identified through in vitro techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ostrem et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trinh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Upadhyaya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Welsch et al., 2017</xref>) but cell-based assay technologies are needed to assess initial hits for efficacy before hit to lead development is undertaken. Indeed, a robust cell-based assay is a mandatory step in any drug discovery programme, as it provides insights into the behavior of compounds in physiological conditions, including cell permeability, stability and potency in the cellular complexity of a whole cell. We now describe a toolbox of mutant and wild-type RAS BRET-based biosensors that can be used to assess PPI between activated, GTP-bound RAS (KRAS, HRAS or NRAS) and effectors such as CRAF, RALGDS or PI3K in living cells. We validate the toolbox using a published anti-RAS intracellular domain antibody (hereafter named iDAb RAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>), which is an inhibitor of RAS PPI to establish the RAS biosensor resource. We have further used this methodology to test a RAS-binding compound (herein referred to as 3344) that we have derived from an in vitro medicinal chemistry programme starting with an intracellular antibody fragment. By monitoring the change in BRET2-specific signal in transfected HEK293T cells expressing different RAS-effector donor-acceptor combinations, we have been able to characterize the pan-RAS-effector PPI inhibitor properties of 3344. This inhibitory mechanism shown using the BRET biosensor toolbox was supported by the crystal structure of KRAS with bound 3344, showing binding to a pocket close to the RAS switch. Therefore, the BRET2 toolbox we describe here is a critical resource and is available for all investigators in the international effort to produce anti-RAS drugs, that can be employed in the treatment of cancers with RAS mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Engineering and validation of mutant RAS biosensors</title><p>RAS biosensors were developed for use in the BRET2 method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bacart et al., 2008</xref>) as a real-time system allowing the monitoring of protein-protein interactions and their inhibition in live cells. The scheme used is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. The intracellular localization of BRET donor RAS proteins was recapitulated by expressing the full-length proteins including the CAAX box, which is the farnesylation site for trafficking to the plasma membrane. The CAAX sequences were fused to the carboxy terminal end of the <italic>Renilla</italic> Luciferase variant 8 (RLuc8) to act as the donor molecule in BRET2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De et al., 2007</xref>) (for simplicity of the nomenclature, CAAX has been omitted from the RAS construct names). We used available structural data for RAS/effector and RAS/iDAb complexes to optimize the proximity of donor and acceptor moieties. Hence, RLuc8 was fused to the amino termini of full-length RAS family proteins and the GFP<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ramsay et al., 2002</xref>) fused to the C-termini of the effectors (RALGDS, CRAF, PI3K) or of the iDAbs. Other parameters can influence the BRET2 signal such as the linker length between RLuc8/RAS and effector-iDAb/GFP<sup>2</sup>. For our study, we observed a higher BRET signal with a (GGGS)<sub>3</sub> linker between RLuc8-KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> construct, a (GGGS)<sub>3</sub> linker between the CRAF RBD-GFP<sup>2</sup> molecule and a (GGGS)<sub>2</sub> linker between iDAb RAS-GFP<sup>2</sup> construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, we implemented these observations to all our BRET biosensors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). When donor and acceptor plasmids are transfected into HEK293T cells (although any cell line of choice would be suitable), the resultant cells are fluorescent and bioluminescent if treated with the luciferase substrate (coelenterazine 400a). If an interaction occurs between RAS and a partner-GFP<sup>2</sup> fusion, bringing the RLuc8 and GFP<sup>2</sup> within 100 Å, an energy transfer occurs from the RLuc8-RAS donor to the GFP<sup>2</sup> acceptor and a BRET2 signal is achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle panel). Inhibitors of the donor-acceptor molecule interaction will decrease the BRET signal whilst maintaining the RLuc8 bioluminescence and GFP<sup>2</sup> fluorescence signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right hand panel). The BRET signal (or BRET ratio) is calculated as the light emitted by the GFP<sup>2</sup> acceptor constructs (at 515 nm) upon addition of coelenterazine 400a, divided by the light emitted by the RLuc8 donor constructs (at 410 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pfleger et al., 2006</xref>). A background BRET signal is only observed with the donor-only construct where the RLuc8 plasmid is transfected alone into the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and this signal is therefore subtracted from that BRET ratio. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, un-transfected cells and those transfected with GFP<sup>2</sup>-only construct have a negligible auto-luminescence and emission at 515 nm upon addition of the BRET substrate and are not considered in the calculation of the BRET ratio.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37122.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RAS-effector BRET biosensors and interference of KRAS-effector interactions by a RAS-binding compound.</title><p>An outline of the BRET2-based RAS biosensor system is shown in <bold>A</bold>. RAS bound to the plasma membrane (PM) is fused at its amino terminal end to the RLuc8 moiety (donor). When a protein fused to the GFP<sup>2</sup> moiety (acceptor) does not bind to RAS, it only produces a background BRET signal. However, when an acceptor binds to RAS, it induces a BRET signal, if the luciferase and GFP domains are within 100 Å. The BRET signal can be decreased by addition of a competitor (either by a macrodrug or a small molecule inhibitor).

Introduction of mutations in the three CDRs of the iDAb RAS to generate a dematured iDAb RAS (iDAb<sub>dm</sub> RAS), was shown to reduce its affinity towards RAS-GTP from 6.2 nM to ~1 μM affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Assi et al., 2010</xref>). While this did not alter the protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>), there was an expected BRET signal reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Indeed, it significantly increased the BRET<sub>50</sub> (an approximation of the relative affinity of the acceptor fusion for the donor fusion proteins, corresponding to the acceptor/donor ratio necessary to reach 50% of the BRET<sub>max</sub>) and significantly reduced the BRET<sub>max</sub> (an approximation for the total number of complex RAS/iDAb and the distance between the donor and the acceptor within the dimer), which together are consistent with a decreased affinity of this mutant iDAb toward RAS. Therefore, the results obtained with the iDAb RAS confirmed the sensitivity and accuracy of the RAS biosensors.</p><p>Finally, we tested the inhibition of interaction between RAS and its effector partners using BRET in a competition assay. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>, each of the RAS-effector domain and a competitor (non-GFP<sup>2</sup>) version of the iDAb RAS or iDAb control. This competition showed that iDAb RAS, but not the control, drastically decreased the BRET ratio of all the interactions tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

We have identified compounds that bind to KRAS using in vitro screening and one compound 3344 (chemical structure and 1-D NMR characterization shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>) binds to KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> with an affinity of 126 nM using <sup>1</sup>H Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baldwin and Kay, 2009</xref>) (data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>).

In view of the in vitro inhibition by the anti-RAS scFv of 3344 binding to RAS and because the iDAb RAS interferes with BRET signal in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), 3344 was used for validation of the BRET2 toolbox for RAS-effector PPI inhibitors. In the subsequent experiments reported here, we compare 3344 with an initial compound (Abd-2) obtained through a SPR in vitro screening, which binds HRAS/KRAS with low affinity. It is the precursor of the 3344 compound and both share the same benzodioxane group (the structures of 3344 and Abd-2 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,F</xref>). These compounds have been selected from a medicinal chemistry programme in order to validate the BRET-based RAS biosensors.</p><p>HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with BRET pairs and, after 24 hr to allow protein expression, the cells were seeded in 96-well plates. The compounds were added at different concentrations (5, 10 and 20 μM) and incubated on cells for a further 20 hr before the BRET reading. For each assay, the donor protein was RLuc8-KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> and the acceptor proteins were PI3Kα RBD-GFP<sup>2</sup>, PI3Kγ RBD-GFP<sup>2</sup>, CRAF RBD-GFP<sup>2</sup> or RALGDS RA-GFP<sup>2</sup>. We observed a dose response reduction in BRET signal for the assays with compound 3344 but not with the Abd-2 indicating that only 3344 interferes with the RAS-effector PPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To rule out the possibility of false positive compounds (for instance, that might interfere directly with the BRET signal), we included control BRET-based biosensors. We tested the RAS compounds with the iDAbs RAS biosensors, either with RLuc8-LMO2 donor and iDAb<sub>dm</sub> LMO2 (a dematured anti-LMO2 iDAb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sewell et al., 2014</xref>)) acceptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3G</xref>), RLuc8-KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> donor with the iDAb RAS acceptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3H</xref>), or RLuc8-KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> donor with the iDAb<sub>dm</sub> RAS acceptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3I</xref>).

Whereas 3344 does not make direct contact with the switch regions, the BRET data show that the binding geometry and potency of 3344 is sufficient to interfere with the interaction of RAS-effector molecules that bind close to the 3344 site.</p><p>While the RAS biosensors rely on transfection and expression of RAS with one of its partner proteins rather than observations of endogenous proteins, it nevertheless offers several advantages for the study of RAS-effector interactions inhibition. It provides a direct and quantitative measurement of the PPI interference with inhibitors (i.e. small molecules or macrodrugs), which could allow the comparison of different compounds (e.g. for structure-activity-relationship studies) or macrodrugs and therefore the selection of more potent inhibitors. It is also sensitive and consequently requires a small quantity of cells to study the inhibition of the interaction. Nonetheless, 3344 prevents endogenous RAS-dependent signaling in two different human tumor cell lines at a lower concentration (IC<sub>50</sub> around 5 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>) than in the BRET assay with observed IC<sub>50</sub> around 20 μM. This difference probably reflects the expression levels of the target proteins in the two assays, where the BRET2 assay relies on transient transfection. Indeed, the overexpression in HEK293T cells probably produces higher amount of mutant RAS/effector proteins than the endogenous counterparts in cancer cells. Therefore, it might be more difficult to quantitatively inhibit the exogenous RAS/effector interaction than the endogenous one with 3344 compound. Generating stable BRET2 cell lines could minimize this difference.</p><p>Another advantage of this toolbox has been shown by using the iDAb RAS as an acceptor within the RAS biosensors allowing a recapitulation of the published features of this intracellular single domain antibody. Therefore, the biosensors are also important tools to study RAS protein interactions in living cells and their effect on the RAS downstream pathways before being tested in cancer cell lines. RAS biosensors use should not be limited to the discovery and characterization of RAS inhibitors. Indeed, studies suggested that isoform and residue- or codon-specific RAS mutants show differences in their ability to engage effectors and signaling properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hunter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakhaeizadeh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yan et al., 1998</xref>). Accordingly, RAS biosensors could also be a methodology to decipher RAS isoform/mutant properties in cells. Our toolbox is an available resource for RAS-drug development programmes, and more generally for the RAS community, since our results demonstrate the possibility of using these RAS biosensors as a generic method to characterize cell-potent RAS-binding compounds or RAS-binding macrodrugs.</p><p>The BRET2 biosensor system could also be used for direct screens of PPI inhibitors with libraries of compounds. However, because initial compounds from a library are not expected to have high affinity for their target, relatively weak interactions between donor and acceptors should be involved in the generation of BRET2 signal. This provides a further use of intracellular domain antibodies where reduction of affinity (dematuration) from a tool initially used for target validation, can be achieved to make a screening tool. Thus, the method is an approach that is transferable to other PPI situations required for drug development programmes in cancer or any other clinical indication.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Roger Davis as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen Philip Cole as the Senior Editor.

This approach will be of great interest to the cancer research community. The high quality data presented support the conclusions of the study.

The titration study (Figure 1—figure supplement 2D) is interpreted to show an approximate Kd of 126nM, but the x-axis shows that the lowest concentration of 3344 studied is 2.5µM, which is many-fold above the estimated Kd and would presumably saturate the interaction. The interpretation of this study is therefore unclear. Moreover, while the x-axis is labeled as the concentration of 3344, the figure legend suggests that the x-axis refers to GST-KRAS.

We have also added additional explanations in the corresponding figure legend and Materials and methods section to clarify how the 3344 Kd was estimated with the <sup>1</sup>H CPMG NMR method. Regarding the Kd measurement, the focus of our Resource paper the implementation of the complete set of BRET2 reagents and using the 3344 compound as an exemplar. We have used the saturation CPMG NMR as a method to assay Kd since this is considered a reliable approach (e.g. Baldwin and Kay (2009); Abboud et al. (2016)) and utilises technology and expertise available locally. The detailed characterisation of 3344 would be the subject of a larger medicinal chemistry study that we hope to undertake later when resources allow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) These types of probes are usually subject to multiple rounds of optimization. However, no information is provided concerning the optimization procedures that were employed. The absence of this information means that it is unclear whether the BRET probes described can be further optimized.</p></disp-quote><p>As the referees suggest, we indeed performed optimization steps on our biosensors but did not included the data in the study in a first instance. Different parameters need to be controlled to get an optimal BRET signal such as the fusion position of the RLuc8 and GFP<sup>2</sup> moieties on their respective protein. Indeed, even if two proteins interact the GFP<sup>2</sup> and the RLuc8 moieties need to be close enough (&lt;10 nm) to induce a detectable and reliable BRET signal. Therefore, our BRET probes were optimized in the following ways. For our study, many RAS-effectors crystal structures are already available allowing us to rationalize the design of the donor and acceptor pairs with respect to the spatial arrangement of the donor and acceptor part of the BRET pairs. As the RLuc8 molecule had to be on the N-terminus end of RAS protein, since we used full-length RAS protein (with the prenylation site), we checked which position (N or C-terminus) on the effectors, or iDAbs, the GFP<sup>2</sup> moiety should be for proximity of the RLuc8 moiety to the donor. If the structure was not available, we used a try and test strategy (e.g. with CRAF<sup>FL</sup> and PI3Kα<sup>FL</sup>). We have added these data in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and new Figure 4—figure supplement 1A.</p><p>We also optimized the linker length between the donor/acceptor moieties and the protein of interest. Three different linker lengths have been tested for two BRET pairs: KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>/CRAF RBD and KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>/iDAb RAS. Accordingly, we applied the same linker length (GGGS)<sub>3</sub> for all the effector constructs and (GGGS)<sub>2</sub> for the iDAb constructs. The RAS linker was always (GGGS)<sub>3</sub> as very little difference was visible on the BRET ratio between the three linker tested. An additional supplementary figure has been added showing these linker optimization data (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). We also added a discussion of the optimization in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The DNA constructs are described in outline form. As a resource paper, it would be very helpful to the reader if more information could be provided. For example, Supplementary files showing full sequence information should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>This sequence information has now been included for all the constructs used in our study (Supplementary file 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) No information is provided concerning how the small molecule 3344 was designed/identified.</p></disp-quote><p>The 3344 molecule was one of a set of compounds that arose from a RAS/antibody-fragment based medicinal chemistry programme. It was chosen to validate our BRET2 biosensor toolbox because its binding to RAS was inhibited by the anti-RAS intracellular scFv. Furthermore, we had found full electron density of the compound in KRAS crystal soaking work that validates the use of that compound. An explanatory statement about 3344 has been added to the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The structure of the control small molecule Abd-2 is not presented. Why was this molecule chosen rather than any other control molecule? How was this molecule obtained?</p></disp-quote><p>The structure of Abd-2 has been added in the Figure 1—figure supplement 3F. This molecule originated from an SPR screen of a fragment library using HRAS and, because it was closely related to an initial hit, it has very low affinity for RAS binding and therefore serves a good and relevant control compound. An explanatory statement has been added to the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The amount of bleed-through between the two channels should be characterized, and corrections for this bleed-through should be included in the calculations. RAS-RLuc8 alone and GFP alone should be used to characterize such bleed-through.</p></disp-quote><p>All the BRET measurements from our study are background corrected with the donor only construct as specified in the corresponding Materials and methods section. Indeed, GFP<sup>2</sup> constructs alone do not give any background when tested with the BRET substrate and are usually not taken into account in the BRET background correction (Pfleger et al., 2006) (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). We added an explanatory statement to the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors should comment on and address the amount of autoluminescence and autofluorescence from untransfected cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The autoluminescence of untransfected cells is negligible compared to the RLuc8 transfected cells, which is why it was not subtracted from the BRET calculation. The autofluorescence of untransfected cells is similar to the GFP<sup>2</sup> signal detected with cells transfected with the RLuc8 construct only (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). We have commented about this in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Long incubation times (20h) are employed in the inhibitor studies of Ras signaling (e.g. Figures 3 and 4). This is a potential problem for studies to dissect signaling mechanisms because the inhibitor may act on signaling pathways indirectly by altering autocrine pathways (e.g. by blocking cytokine expression) that cause secondary activation of the ERK and AKT pathways. Short-term inhibition assays would prevent this caveat on the interpretation of these data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that short-term assays are important to avoid potential misinterpretation/ indirect effect of the compound on RAS signalling data. Figures 6C and D did show a short-term inhibition (3h incubation rather than 20h). However, we performed further short-term incubation of the inhibitor (3 hours incubation) in BRET and Western Blot experiments and present these new data in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1E-G, new Figure 3—figure supplement 1D-F and new Figure 4—figure supplement 1D-F.</p><p>We observed that, after 3 hours of incubation with the compound, there was a decrease of the interaction of RAS with CRAF<sup>FL</sup> and PI3Kα<sup>FL</sup> (BRET experiments), which correlated with a decrease of pMEK, pERK and pAKT signal (Western blot experiments) showing the direct effect of the compound on RAS signalling. We also added a commentary in the corresponding Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 6B is simply an enlargement that does not provide additional information beyond what is obvious in Figure 6A. This panel should be replaced by a panel illustrating how the compound interferes with effector binding – this would support conclusions concerning the mechanism of inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, Figure 6B has been replaced by the superimposition of the structures of three RAS-effector protein complexes with the structure of KRAS-3344 complex. These data show an overlap between the compound and the bound effectors. Therefore, the competition effect of 3344 can be explained by straightforward steric hindrance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Although 3344 does not interact with the switch regions in the crystal structure, it would be helpful to clarify whether there are any changes (or not) in the conformation or b-factors in the switch regions compared with the un-soaked crystal structure.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not directly compared the KRAS crystals alongside those soaked with 3344 in one experiment. However, we do not detect conformation alterations by aligning superimposition of KRAS with and without 3344.</p></body></sub-article></article>
