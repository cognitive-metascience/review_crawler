autophagy. Amino-acid-induced activation of mammalian TORC1 is initiated by its recruitment to the RagA/B-RagC/D GTPase heterodimer, which is anchored to lysosomal membranes through the Ragulator complex. We have identified in the model organism <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> a Ragulator-like complex that tethers the Gtr1-Gtr2 Rag heterodimer to the membranes of vacuoles, the lysosome equivalent in yeasts. Unexpectedly, the Ragulator-Rag complex is not required for the vacuolar targeting of TORC1, but the complex plays a crucial role in attenuating TORC1 activity independently of the Tsc1-Tsc2 complex, a known negative regulator of TORC1 signaling. The GATOR1 complex, which functions as Gtr1 GAP, is essential for the TORC1 attenuation by the Ragulator-Rag complex, suggesting that Gtr1<sup>GDP</sup>-Gtr2 on vacuolar membranes moderates TORC1 signaling for optimal cellular response to nutrients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Target of Rapamycin</kwd><kwd>TORC1</kwd><kwd>Rag GTPase</kwd><kwd>Ragulator</kwd><kwd>GATOR1</kwd><kwd>cell growth</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26840069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fukuda</surname><given-names>Tomoyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007434</institution-id><institution>Suzuken Memorial Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fukuda</surname><given-names>Tomoyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17K07330</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fukuda</surname><given-names>Tomoyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26291024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shiozaki</surname><given-names>Kazuhiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chia</surname><given-names>Kim Hou</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Panasonic Corporation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sofyantoro</surname><given-names>Fajar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Rag-family GTPases, known activators of TOR complex 1 (TORC1), also function as attenuator that prevents deregulated hyperactivation of TORC1 signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Target of rapamycin (TOR) is serine/threonine-specific protein kinase highly conserved among eukaryotes from yeast to humans. By forming two distinct protein complexes known as TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2), mammalian TOR (mTOR) and its counterparts in diverse eukaryotes control cell growth, proliferation and metabolisms in response to various intra- and extracellular signals (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wullschleger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>]). Mammalian TORC1 (mTORC1) signaling has been attracting much attention, partly because its inhibition by rapamycin is effective in suppressing growth of some human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guertin and Sabatini, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shimobayashi and Hall, 2016</xref>). mTORC1 promotes cellular growth through the regulation of both anabolic and catabolic processes; amino acids serve as stimulatory signals that activate mTORC1, which phosphorylates S6K1 and 4E-BP1 to increase protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hara et al., 1998</xref>). Activated mTORC1 also phosphorylates ULK1, resulting in suppression of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ganley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jung et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The molecular mechanism that mediates mTORC1 activation in response to amino acid stimuli has recently been a focus of very active research. In the currently prevailing model, a critical step in amino-acid-induced activation of mTORC1 is its translocation to the surface of lysosomes, where the small GTPase Rheb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Inoki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tee et al., 2003</xref>) triggers mTORC1 activation. Recruitment of mTORC1 to lysosomes is mediated by the Rag GTPase heterodimer that is anchored to lysosomal membranes through a protein complex called Ragulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sancak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sancak et al., 2010</xref>). The Rag heterodimer consists of RagA or RagB bound to either RagC or RagD, and it has been proposed that guanine nucleotide loading to RagA/B is regulated in response to amino acid signals; the Ragulator complex, which is composed of LAMTOR1/p18, LAMTOR2/p14, LAMTOR3/MP1, LAMTOR4/C7orf59 and LAMTOR5/HBXIP, functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RagA/B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bar-Peled et al., 2012</xref>). In the presence of amino acid stimuli, RagA/B are in the GTP-bound form and the Rag heterodimer can interact with the <italic>raptor</italic> subunit of mTORC1 for lysosomal recruitment of mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sancak et al., 2008</xref>). On the other hand, the GATOR1 complex composed of DEPDC5, Nprl2, and Nprl3 has GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity toward RagA/B, whose GDP-bound form induces the release of mTORC1 from lysosomes in the absence of amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bar-Peled et al., 2013</xref>). Without functional GATOR1, mTORC1 signaling is resistant to amino acid starvation and, interestingly, inactivating mutations to the GATOR1 components have been found in human cancers. GATOR1 forms a larger GATOR complex together with GATOR2, which comprises WDR24, WDR59, MIOS, SEH1L and SEC13, and gene knockdown experiments suggest that the GATOR2 subcomplex negatively regulates the GAP activity of GATOR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bar-Peled et al., 2013</xref>). It should be noted, however, that further intricacy may remain to be added to the model described above. There is a discrepant report that guanine nucleotide loading to the Rag GTPases is not responsive to amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oshiro et al., 2014</xref>). RagA/B-independent activation of mTORC1 has also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jewell et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The mTORC1 regulators enumerated above are conserved also in unicellular eukaryotes. The Gtr1-Gtr2 GTPase heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakashima et al., 1999</xref>) is the budding yeast counterpart of RagA/B-RagC/D, interacting with the Ego1-Ego2-Ego3 complex that tethers Gtr1-Gtr2 to the membrane of the vacuole, a lysosome-like organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dubouloz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao and Kaiser, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Powis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kira et al., 2016</xref>). The Ego ternary complex is likely to be the yeast equivalent of mammalian Ragulator, although their constituents share little sequence homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kogan et al., 2010</xref>). The yeast SEACIT and SEACAT complexes apparently correspond to mammalian GATOR1 and GATOR2, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Neklesa and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dokudovskaya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Panchaud et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Panchaud et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kira et al., 2014</xref>). However, these TORC1 regulators in budding yeast might function differently from those in mammals, because the Rheb GTPase, the primary mTORC1 activator, is not part of the TORC1 signaling pathway in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Urano et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, a Rheb ortholog called Rhb1 is an essential activator of TORC1 in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, another model eukaryote distantly related to budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mach et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Urano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Uritani et al., 2006</xref>). Like mammalian Rheb, Rhb1 is under the regulation of the Tsc1-Tsc2 complex that functions as GAP for Rhb1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsumoto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van Slegtenhorst et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murai et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, <italic>S. pombe</italic> is expected to serve as an excellent experimental system to explore the TORC1 regulatory mechanisms that are conserved also in mammals. Fission yeast TORC1 is composed of the Tor2 kinase associated with the regulatory subunits Mip1 and Wat1, which are orthologous to mammalian <italic>raptor</italic> and mLST8, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Álvarez and Moreno, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsuo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayashi et al., 2007</xref>). The heterodimeric Rag GTPases Gtr1-Gtr2 are also implicated in <italic>S. pombe</italic> TORC1 regulation, although their exact role is ambiguous because of contradictory reports of their mutant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Valbuena et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Laor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we have identified Ragulator- and GATOR1-like complexes in fission yeast, which regulate the cellular localization and nucleotide-binding state of Gtr1-Gtr2, respectively, as has been found with their mammalian counterparts. Unexpectedly, however, these conserved regulatory machineries are all required to attenuate TORC1 activity, and mutants lacking any of them show severe growth defects due to deregulated TORC1 activation. Our data collectively suggest that TORC1 activation in <italic>S. pombe</italic> does not require the Rag-like GTPases and that they rather play an important role in moderating TORC1 activity on vacuolar membranes for optimal cellular response to nutrients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of proteins interacting with Rag GTPases in fission yeast</title><p>Aiming to identify proteins that physically interact with the Rag-family GTPases in fission yeast, affinity purification of the Gtr1-Gtr2 heterodimer was performed using strains that express Gtr1 and Gtr2 from their chromosomal loci as fusions with different epitope tags, FLAG and <italic>myc</italic>. Two successive immunoprecipitation procedures using anti-FLAG and anti-<italic>myc</italic> antibodies to collect the Gtr1-Gtr2 heterodimer complex were followed by mass spectrometry, which identified four co-purified proteins encoded by open-reading frames SPBC29A10.17, SPBC1778.05c, SPAC222.19, and SPAC23D3.16 in the <italic>S. pombe</italic> genome database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The protein encoded by SPBC1778.05c has been named Lam2 because of its sequence similarity to the mammalian Ragulator subunit LAMTOR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, the protein products of SPBC29A10.17, SPAC222.19 and SPAC23D3.16 show no apparent sequence homology to any known proteins. However, they form a complex with Lam2, and the predicted secondary structure of the SPAC222.19 protein resembles the αββαβββα structure of the roadblock domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koonin and Aravind, 2000</xref>), which has been identified among the human Ragulator components and the Ego proteins in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bar-Peled et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>); therefore, we refer to those proteins as Lam1 (SPBC29A10.17), Lam3 (SPAC222.19), and Lam4 (SPAC23D3.16). Their physical interaction with the Gtr1-Gtr2 GTPases was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, immunoprecipitating any one of the Lam proteins resulted in co-purification of the other three Lam proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>), confirming complex formation among Lam1, Lam2, Lam3 and Lam4.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30880.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of the Lam proteins that interact with the Gtr1-Gtr2 Rag GTPase heterodimer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Affinity-purification of the Gtr1-Gtr2 heterodimer from <italic>S. pombe</italic>.

The Lam proteins were also detectable on vacuoles even in strains lacking Gtr1 and Gtr2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the vacuolar targeting of the Lam proteins does not require the Gtr1-Gtr2 GTPases. We next assessed the interdependency among the Lam proteins for their vacuolar localization. In the <italic>lam1∆</italic> mutant, Lam2, Lam3 and Lam4 diffused throughout the cytoplasm, while Lam1 was observed on vacuoles even in <italic>lam2∆</italic>, <italic>lam3∆</italic> and <italic>lam4∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>); thus, Lam1 appears to be indispensable for anchoring the Lam complex to vacuoles. On the other hand, the vacuolar localization of Lam2 and Lam3 is also dependent on Lam4 but not vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), implying that Lam4 mediates association of Lam2 and Lam3 with Lam1 anchored to vacuoles.

Moreover, the vacuole/lysosome localization signal sequence composed of acidic residues followed by di-leucine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Darsow et al., 1998</xref>) is also conserved within the N-terminal regions of Lam1, LAMTOR1, and Ego1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, underlines). We found that simultaneous alanine substitutions of both myristorylation and palmitoylation sites in Lam1 resulted in its dispersal throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> '<italic>lam1GCC-AAA</italic>'). On the other hand, Lam1 was distributed to both vacuolar and plasma membranes when the conserved di-leucine motif of Leu-21 and Leu-22 was replaced by two alanine residues (<italic>lam1LL-AA</italic>). These observations suggest that specific targeting of Lam1 to vacuolar membranes requires its N-terminal lipid modifications as well as the di-leucine motif.</p><p>In addition to the detectable sequence similarity of Lam2 to mammalian LAMTOR2, the aforementioned characteristics conserved among Lam1, LAMTOR1 and Ego1 suggest that the Lam protein complex is a Ragulator equivalent in fission yeast. The vacuolar localization of the Lam proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and their physical association with the Gtr1-Gtr2 GTPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) are also consistent with such a possibility. Therefore, we investigated whether the Lam protein complex is responsible for the localization of the Gtr1-Gtr2 GTPases to vacuolar membranes, as is the case with mammalian Ragulator for the lysosomal localization of the Rag GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sancak et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, the vacuolar localization of Gtr1-Gtr2 is impaired in the absence of any one of the Lam proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that the intact Lam complex is required for the recruitment of Gtr1-Gtr2 to vacuoles.

Thus, it appears that the GATOR1-Gtr signaling axis and the Tsc-Rhb1 pathway independently impinge on TORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>) and that loss of both negative regulatory mechanisms results in a severe growth defect.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>TORC1 activity is elevated in the absence of GDP-bound Gtr1</title><p>The genetic analyses presented above led to a working model that GATOR1 and Gtr1<sup>GDP</sup>-Gtr2 temper TORC1 activation induced by the Rhb1 GTPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>); loss of Gtr1<sup>GDP</sup>-Gtr2 from vacuolar membranes results in deregulated TORC1 signaling and growth defects that can be suppressed by rapamycin or Tor2 hypomorphs. In order to further substantiate this model, we next examined how GATOR1 and Gtr1-Gtr2 affect TORC1 activity by monitoring phosphorylation of Psk1, a <italic>S. pombe</italic> S6K1 ortholog. The hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of Psk1 by TORC1 results in reduced electrophoretic mobility of Psk1 and is also detectable using antibodies against phosphorylated S6K1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakashima et al., 2012</xref>). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hatano et al., 2015</xref>), phosphorylated Psk1 became undetectable in wild-type cells within 30 min of nitrogen starvation that inactivates TORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In contrast, Psk1 remained phosphorylated until later time points in strains lacking the Tsc1-Tsc2 complex, a known negative regulator of TORC1 signaling, as well as in those carrying the activating mutations of Tor2 and Rhb1, <italic>tor2E2221K</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Urano et al., 2007</xref>) and <italic>rhb1-DA4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murai et al., 2009</xref>), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Similar delays in TORC1 inactivation were observed in the <italic>gtr1∆</italic> and <italic>gtr2∆</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), indicating that absence of Gtr1-Gtr2 results in deregulated TORC1 signaling that cannot promptly respond to starvation. The GTP-locked <italic>gtr1Q61L</italic> mutant and <italic>iml1∆</italic> mutant also exhibited a delay in the nitrogen-starvation response, while no apparent difference was observed between the GDP-locked <italic>gtr1S16N</italic> mutant and the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). These data are consistent with our model that GATOR1 functions as GAP for Gtr1 and that the Gtr1<sup>GDP</sup>-Gtr2 heterodimer plays a role in restraining TORC1 activation. As expected, the GDP-locked <italic>gtr1S16N</italic> mutation suppressed the delayed starvation response of the <italic>iml1∆</italic> mutant that lacks the functional GATOR1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), consistent with the observed phenotypic complementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In addition, the parallel TORC1 regulation by the Tsc1-Tsc2 and GATOR1-Gtr pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>) was also observed by monitoring the TORC1 activity; the TORC1 response to nitrogen starvation was further delayed in the <italic>gtr1∆ tsc2∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) and <italic>iml1∆ tsc2∆</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>) in comparison to the respective single mutants. We thus examined further the possibility that the GATOR1-Gtr pathway can regulate TORC1 signaling independently of the Rhb1 GTPase. The Rhb1 is an essential activator of TORC1 and the <italic>rhb1∆</italic> mutant is viable only in the presence of an activated allele of Tor2, such as <italic>tor2E2221K</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mach et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Urano et al., 2007</xref>). Also in the <italic>tor2E2221K</italic> background, the <italic>gtr1∆</italic> and <italic>iml1∆</italic> mutations caused significant delays in the TORC1 response to starvation, indicating that TORC1 carrying the <italic>tor2E2221K</italic> mutation is still subject to the regulation by the GATOR1-Gtr pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Interestingly, even in the absence of Rhb1, the <italic>gtr1∆</italic> and <italic>iml1∆</italic> mutations caused apparent delays in the TORC1 inactivation upon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>), suggesting that Gtr1<sup>GDP</sup>-Gtr2 can control TORC1 activity in a Rhb1-independent manner, at least in the <italic>tor2E2221K</italic> background.</p><p>In the presence of plentiful nutrients, Psk1 appeared to be mostly in the phosphorylated, slow-migrating form and very little unphosphorylated Psk1 was detectable (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, middle panel at time 0). On the other hand, the slow-migrating, phosphorylated form of Sck1, which is another known substrate of TORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakashima et al., 2012</xref>), significantly increased in growing <italic>gtr1∆</italic>, <italic>gtr2∆</italic> and <italic>iml1∆</italic> mutant cells, comparing to that in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). This observation suggests that absence of GATOR1 or Gtr1-Gtr2 results in elevated TORC1 activity also under nitrogen-replete conditions. In contrast, loss of the Tsc1-Tsc2 complex seems to have little impact on TORC1 activity under the same conditions.</p><p>Together, the above results demonstrate hyperactive TORC1 signaling in the absence of GATOR1 or Gtr1<sup>GDP</sup>-Gtr2, consistent with the phenotypic analyses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The growth defect in the absence of Gtr1<sup>GDP</sup>-Gtr2 is partly attributed to impaired amino-acid uptake</title><p>Our studies described above showed that loss of Gtr1<sup>GDP</sup>-Gtr2 results in deregulated TORC1 activation that brings about a growth defect in the yeast extract medium.

Lastly, the Lam protein complex is localized to the membranes of vacuoles, lysosome-like organelles in yeast and is essential for the vacuolar localization of the Gtr1-Gtr2 GTPase heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the limited sequence similarity of the Ragulator subunits between mammals and fission yeast, the primary structures of the GATOR1 subunits are relatively well conserved through evolution; Iml1, Npr2 and Npr3 in fission yeast are orthologous to human DEPDC5, Nprl2 and Nprl3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2013</xref>) and the three proteins indeed form a complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>iml1∆</italic>, <italic>npr2∆</italic> and <italic>npr3∆</italic> defects are complemented by expression of the GDP-locked Gtr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6F</xref>), consistent with the idea that the GATOR1 function as GAP for the RagA/B GTPases is conserved in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, as has also been found in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Panchaud et al., 2013a</xref>). On the contrary, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma et al. (2016)</xref> recently reported that expression of Gtr1<sup>S20L</sup>, their assumed GDP-locked mutant of Gtr1, failed to complement the <italic>npr2∆</italic> and <italic>npr3∆</italic> defects, concluding that those mutations do not alter the nucleotide-bound state of Gtr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma et al., 2016</xref>); however, the Ser-20 substitution has never been characterized in any Rag family GTPases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>) and may not behave as intended. Their study also proposed the function of Npr2 and Npr3 in tethering Gtr1-Gtr2 to vacuoles, based on the result that the expression and vacuolar localization of Gtr1-GFP and Gtr2-GFP were compromised when either of them was ectopically overexpressed in the <italic>npr2∆</italic> and <italic>npr3∆</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). Unbalanced expression of the heterodimer constituents may explain the observations, as the GATOR1 mutations did not affect the protein levels and vacuolar localization of GFP-fused Gtr1 and Gtr2 that were expressed from their chromosomal loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F–H</xref>). Thus, the vacuolar localization of GATOR1 appears to be independent of the Ragulator-Gtr complex, and may be mediated by an additional mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wolfson et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our gene deletion experiments found that the null mutants of the Gtr1-Gtr2 GTPases, Ragulator (Lam1, Lam2, Lam3 and Lam4) and GATOR1 (Iml1, Npr2 and Npr3) exhibit very similar growth defects, which are rescued by the TORC1 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The double mutant analyses confirmed that they all belong to the same epistasis group, consistent with the idea that both Ragulator and GATOR1 complexes function through the Gtr1-Gtr2 heterodimer. Together with other data presented in this paper, we propose that the Gtr1<sup>GDP</sup>-Gtr2 heterodimer tethered to the vacuolar surface by the Ragulator complex plays a role in moderating TORC1 activation induced by the Rhb1 GTPase. Although TORC1 activity is essential for cell viability in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Álvarez and Moreno, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsuo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weisman and Choder, 2001</xref>), its attenuation by Gtr1<sup>GDP</sup>-Gtr2 enables appropriate response to limitation in nitrogen source, allowing localization of the amino acid transporters to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). It is currently unknown how Gtr1<sup>GDP</sup>-Gtr2 counteracts the Rhb1-dependent activation of TORC1. In amino-acid-starved mammalian cells, Tsc2 is recruited to lysosomal membranes by the Rag GTPases and inhibits Rheb, resulting in inactivation of mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Demetriades et al., 2014</xref>). However, such a Tsc2-dependent mechanism cannot explain the observations that the effects of the <italic>gtr1∆</italic> and <italic>tsc2∆</italic> mutations are additive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6G</xref>) and that the Gtr1-dependent attenuation of TORC1 appears to be in effect even in the absence of Rhb1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>).</p><p>It remains possible that GTP-bound Gtr1 is capable of promoting TORC1 activation, as has been found for GTP-bound RagA/B in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sancak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sancak et al., 2010</xref>). However, such functionality of Gtr1<sup>GTP</sup> would be cryptic in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, where TORC1 can be strongly activated in the <italic>gtr1</italic> null mutant as well as in strains expressing mostly Gtr1<sup>GTP</sup>, such as <italic>gtr1Q61L</italic> and GATOR1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In this organism, TORC1 localization to vacuolar membranes is not dependent on the Ragulator-Gtr complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting Gtr-independent targeting of TORC1 to the vacuolar surface where the Rhb1 GTPase activates TORC1. Rag-independent recruitment of mTORC1 to lysosomal membranes has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jewell et al., 2015</xref>), and there might be a conserved mechanism for such TORC1 localization. Moreover, it is conceivable that GDP-bound RagA/B also plays a role in attenuation of mTORC1 signaling, a possibility compatible with the observed hyperactivation of mTORC1 in the absence of functional GATOR1 on lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bar-Peled et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wolfson et al., 2017</xref>). Because deregulated mTORC1 activation is implicated in cancerous cell proliferation and neurological disorders including epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang and Manning, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldassari et al., 2016</xref>), the molecular mechanisms that negatively regulate mTORC1 warrant further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fission yeast strains and general techniques</title><p><italic>S. pombe</italic> strains used in this study are listed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary File 1</xref>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Philip Cole (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Mammalian cell studies have led to a model in which TORC1 activation by amino acids is triggered by its recruitment to the RagA/B GTPase heterodimer that is anchored to lysosomal membranes by the multi-subunit Ragulator complex, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). These activities are counteracted by GATOR, which has GAP activity toward RagA/B to cause the release of TORC1 from lysosomal membranes. Chia et al. identify the Ragulator-like complex in fission yeast and show that it tethers the Gtr1-Gtr2 Rag heterodimer to vacuolar membranes. However, in contrast to mammals, TORC1 localizes to vacuolar membranes independently of the Ragulator-Rag complex. Moreover, Chia et al. report that Gtr1-GDP acts to suppress TORC1 activity.</p><p>This is an interesting and well-executed study of the Rag pathway in fission yeast that provides important new insights relevant to the evolution and function of this system of regulation and amino acid sensing at the vacuole/lysosome. The difference in Rag function between mammals and fission yeast is intriguing and suggests that adaptation has occurred in each organism to meet the regulatory needs for the control of TORC1 activity.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The title of the paper should be changed to better reflect the study. First, the title should note that the analysis was performed with fission yeast (or <italic>S. pombe</italic>). Second, while Gtr1-GDP is identified as a suppressor of TORC1 activity, the link to Rheb is not fully established and should not be stated in the title. The title should reflect the more balanced approach to stating conclusions employed by the authors in the Abstract.</p><p>2) &quot;Growth&quot; in all of the genetic experiments in the study is classified as a single cellular process/phenotype. Are growth defects from too much or too little TORC1 activity really the same (proliferation effects, cell cycle, cell size)? Given that TORC1 is established to promote cell growth, rather than impair it, these cellular phenotypes are worth a more careful analysis.</p><p>3) The presumptive effects on amino acid uptake in the final section of the study are interesting and might provide insight into the growth defect of the mutants analyzed. The authors should directly test whether elevated TORC1 signaling causes a defect in the uptake or utilization of exogenous amino acids in the context of these mutants.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>.

As reported previously (Matsuo et al., 2007, cited), inactivation of TORC1, such as that in <italic>tor2</italic> mutants, results in phenotypes indistinguishable from those induced by nitrogen starvation, even in the presence of rich nitrogen source. Therefore, the <italic>tor2</italic> mutant phenotypes are not suppressed even by a preferred nitrogen source, ammonium, in contrast to the growth defects from too much TORC1 activity in the <italic>gtr1∆</italic> and <italic>iml1∆</italic> mutants (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In addition, like nitrogen-starved cells, <italic>tor2</italic> mutant cells with too little TORC1 activity are significantly smaller (Matsuo et al., 2007), while the mutants with too much TORC1 activity, such as gtr1, iml1 and lam1 mutants, are not any smaller than wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>; new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The presumptive effects on amino acid uptake in the final section of the study are interesting and might provide insight into the growth defect of the mutants analyzed.

When these mutants carry mutations in the arginine (<italic>arg3-D4</italic>) or leucine (<italic>leu1-32</italic>) biosynthesis pathways, they fail to grow on the growth media supplemented with arginine/leucine, confirming that the mutants are defective in utilizing exogenous amino acids. These results are also consistent with the defective amino-acid uptake due to deregulated TORC1 signaling in the tsc1/tsc2 mutants (e.g., van Slegtenhorst et al., 2004; Aspuria and Tamanoi 2008; both cited).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>.

Although ammonium does not further stimulate TORC1 that is already active in rich YES medium, it does not attenuate TORC1 either, as confirmed by a new experiment added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>. Therefore, it is very likely that the rescue of the mutant phenotypes by ammonium in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> is due to restoration of nitrogen source.</p></body></sub-article></article>
