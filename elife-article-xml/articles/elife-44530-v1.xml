This limits their application to the study of adult human neuromuscular junction (NMJ) development, a process requiring maturation of muscle fibers in the presence of motor neuron endplates. Here we describe a three-dimensional (3D) co-culture method whereby human muscle progenitors mixed with human pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons self-organize to form functional NMJ connections. Functional connectivity between motor neuron endplates and muscle fibers is confirmed with calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings. Notably, we only observed epsilon acetylcholine receptor subunit protein upregulation and activity in 3D co-cultures. Further, 3D co-culture treatments with myasthenia gravis patient sera shows the ease of studying human disease with the system. Hence, this work offers a simple method to model and evaluate adult human NMJ de novo development or disease in culture.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>3D

highly organized synapse formed between a motor neuron (MN) axon and a muscle fiber. It is designed to transmit efferent signals from projecting MNs to muscle fibers in order to actuate fiber contraction. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) clustered at the NMJ’s postsynaptic muscle fiber membrane mediate this signal by binding acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmitters released from vesicles at the presynaptic MN axon terminal. AChRs are ligand-gated ion channels composed of five protein subunits.

In side-by-side studies of muscle fibers cultured in 2D, we show that the 3D culture system enables long-term maintenance of maturing muscle fibers in culture. It supports the formation and morphological maturation of AChR clusters primed for synaptogenesis and the de novo transition from the embryonic to the adult NMJ composition upon contact with MN endplates. We confirm formation of functional NMJ connections by imaging muscle fiber calcium transients and capturing electrophysiological recordings in response to glutamate-induced MN firing and demonstrate that treatment with inhibitors targeting pre- and post-synapse function block this firing. We show that the 3D co-culture platform, and not a 2D co-culture system, supports the transition from the embryonic to the adult AChR, thereby enabling the functional assessment of the adult neuromuscular junction in vitro.

Moreover, in these muscle fibers, we captured an event that resembled an action potential in response to glutamate stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F</xref>).

Selective transcription of the AChR subunits occurs during different developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martinou et al., 1991</xref>) and neural derived glycoprotein neuregulin-1 (NRG1), a motor neuron-derived factor, is thought to stimulate expression of the epsilon subunit of the AChR gene (CHNRE), which encodes an adult muscle AChR subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Falls et al., 1993</xref>). Using western blot experiments, we confirmed the expression of NRG1-β1 in our PSC-derived MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

To test whether the increase can be associated with NRG1-β1-mediated induction of the CHRNE gene, we supplemented our 2D and 3D muscle-alone cultures with recombinant NRG1- β1 (5 nM) and detected a significant increase in CHRNE expression in the supplemented muscle fiber cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Treating 3D muscle-alone cultures with motor neuron-derived conditioned media did not induce epsilon subunit gene expression above untreated 3D muscle alone cultures (CHRNE 0.5 ± 0.4% of GAPDH expression), suggesting that MN axon contact with muscle fibers may be necessary to locally deliver concentrated neurotrophic factors and modulate epsilon gene expression in muscle fibers.

The AChR channel contains two binding sites for ACh, and one of those sites sits between the epsilon and a beta subunit in the adult AChR.

Our focus is distinct, but complementary to recent work reporting strategies to co-culture hPSC-derived skeletal muscle progenitors and motor neurons in 3D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maffioletti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Osaki et al., 2018</xref>), and that implement the 3D co-culture approach in the context of a microfluidics platform to model human disease (i.e. ALS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Osaki et al., 2018</xref>). We demonstrate that functional innervation is achieved in 3D, but not 2D neuromuscular co-cultures, within 2 weeks of culture. Indeed, we find that innervation in 3D neuromuscular co-cultures is ~4 fold faster and more efficient than a prior report of a 2D human neuromuscular co-culture system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Steinbeck et al., 2016</xref>), and we show that this simplifies and expedites studies of myasthenia gravis in a dish. With side-by-side comparisons of 2D and 3D muscle-alone and neuromuscular co-cultures, we confirmed that CHRNE transcription is supported by MN co-culture in 2D and 3D, and then show that the AChR epsilon subunit protein is only functionally integrated into the AChR in the context of 3D neuromuscular co-cultures. Therefore, this is the first report of a culture method to study the de novo AChR gamma to epsilon subunit developmental switch in culture and to model diseases of the adult human NMJ in a dish.</p><p>Our side-by-side comparison of human skeletal muscle fiber cultures in 2D and 3D indicates the structural and functional advantages of a 3D culture model over currently available 2D systems. The value of 3D culture is reported in previous studies for other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014</xref>), and in this study we provide the first quantitative evidence that 3D culture conditions lend to the maturation of multinucleated muscle fibers due to their capability to accommodate the inherent contractile nature of the muscle fibers in the long-term. This in turn leads to muscle fiber hypertrophy, improved calcium handling, and muscle fiber maturation as evidenced by expression of adult forms of MHC, and elaborated clustering of AChRs. This makes 3D neuromuscular cultures an ideal platform for studying NMJ synaptogenesis given the inherently long process required for functional NMJ development to occur. However, it should be noted that single fiber level analyses may be easier to perform in a 2D culture setting. As such, we expect that focusing efforts on modifying 2D cultures to control the microenvironment in ways that can accommodate myofiber contractility and alignment, might result in the formation of functional NMJs in vitro at earlier time-points, as was recently demonstrated in work with rodent myoblasts and neural cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ko et al., 2019</xref>). If successful, it is feasible to imagine de novo AChR subunit switching in 2D neuromuscular cultures as well.</p><p>Consistently, electrophysiological recordings of single muscle fibers in these neuromuscular co-cultures detected putative endogenous and glutamate-stimulated EPPs, suggesting that MNs form functional neuromuscular junctions, similar to that observed in in vivo mammalian models. However, we will note that in the absence of pre- or post-synaptic blocking studies during these recordings, we can speculate, but not conclude definitively, that the activity we recorded was in fact evoked by glutamate stimulation. The properties of action potentials recorded in these cultures is consistent with the possibility that the 3D human neuromuscular co-cultures are not fully mature. This observation concurs with the relatively small muscle fibers, and indicates that additional chemical or physical cues are necessary to mature the tissues further. We saw a large action potential-like response in 1 out of the seven fibers we assessed. This suggests that although the NMJs are functional, exhibit endogenous activity, and that motor neurons respond to glutamate application by increasing the basal rate of neurotransmitter release, most motor neurons are still in an immature state and do not trigger synchronous neurotransmitter release in response to glutamate application. This could be at the level of action potential generation in response to glutamate application, or converting action potentials to synchronous release at the pre-synapse. We anticipate increasing culture time, providing electrical stimulation, and/or adding trophic or synaptogenesis factors might improve the maturity of the neuromuscular co-culture and their connections.</p><p>Alternatively, our electrophysiological conclusions may simply reflect the technical challenges we faced in the course of our recordings (see Materials and Methods). In general, analyses at the single fiber level require the user to develop or implement tools or adapt the protocol to improve feasibility. Electrophysiological recordings in the co-culture system are feasible, but highly challenging for a number of reasons. First, spontaneous or induced muscle tissue contractions in 3D neuromuscular co-cultures frequently resulted in the loss of pipette contact with the cell membrane during recordings. As a result, recording where glutamate is added to the culture bath as a stimulation method, which elicits tissue movement via multiple muscle fibers contracting in unison (as seen in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>), were challenging and as such, only successful in few events, as we reported in the manuscript. However, this challenge can be overcome by performing targeted stimulation of single motor neurons with electrical or neurotransmitter stimulation, or by stimulating with blue light in the case of motor neurons genetically modified to express a light sensitive channel (e.g.) channelrhodopsin. In addition, identifying innervated muscle fibers is challenging. Using fluorescently labeled muscle cells (e.g. GCaMP6+, membrane anchored fluorophore) and motor neuron (e.g. HB9-GFP, mCherry, neurofilament-GFP) cells dramatically improves the success rate in identifying innervated muscle fibers in 3D neuromuscular co-cultures. Notably, the 3D nature of the co-culture system reduces the incidence of pipette breakage common in studies of plastic cultured myotubes. However, without added myotube maturation through contraction regimes or otherwise, it should be noted that myotubes in culture are somewhat smaller than those in adult animals, which can introduce some difficulty in recording.</p><p>Perhaps most strikingly, 3D neuromuscular cultures possess AChRs containing functional adult AChR epsilon subunit, which is, to our knowledge, the first report of a system that supports the de novo gamma to epsilon AChR subunit switch in culture. Given challenges associated with maturing hPSC-derived skeletal muscle fibers beyond embryonic-like states, we hypothesize that our success may be due in part to the use of primary adult human myoblasts. In a proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate the application of our NMJ model to study adult NMJ activity by using a peptide that specifically blocks the epsilon subunit. Treatment with the peptide dampened glutamate-induced GCaMP6 calcium reporter activity in neuromuscular co-cultures demonstrating the utility of the system for adult NMJ studies.</p><p>Tissue culture affords the opportunity to deconstruct the complexity of a tissue system and to systematically rebuild complexity as a means to identify physical and chemical factors that influence biological processes. This method is particularly powerful in studies of the NMJ where decoupling nerve and muscle influences during development and in the adult, within the context of an animal model, is confounded by tissue death. Through an iterative comparison of 2D and 3D muscle alone and neuromuscular co-cultures, we found that CHRNE transcript expression is upregulated in both 2D and 3D neuromuscular co-cultures. Bathing 2D or 3D muscle fiber cultures with a high concentration of recombinant neuregulin-1 phenocopied the effect of MN co-culture on CHRNE transcript, but CHRNE transcript levels were not induced in 3D muscle-alone culture treated with conditioned media from MNs. Since our PSC-derived motor neurons express neuregulin-1 protein, but we do not observe appreciable NMJ activity in our 2D neuromuscular co-cultures, we speculate that if CHRNE transcript induction is reliant on NRG-1, then localized MN-mediated delivery of the protein may be necessary to achieve physiologically relevant concentrations of the protein, and that transmission via the NMJ is not required. Importantly, epsilon protein levels further increased and its function was detected (WTX-responsivity) only in the context of 3D neuromuscular co-cultures.</p><p>Our culture data indicates that the epsilon subunit of the AChR is subjected to post-transcriptional modifications and/or intracellular trafficking events that are only supported in the context of 3D neuromuscular co-culture. Indeed, our observations that muscle fibers established in 3D culture are more mature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <bold>2</bold>) and that 3D neuromuscular co-cultures exhibit spontaneous endogenous endplate potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>) fit well with studies linking muscle fiber maturation state and activity to AChR subunit conversion and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caroni et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Missias et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Witzemann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu and Salpeter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yampolsky et al., 2008</xref>). Through the availability of a methodology supporting de novo adult NMJ development, it is now possible to delve deeper into the mechanisms regulating metabolic stability of the epsilon subunit in normal development and in disease states. Studies aimed at understanding the intricacies of subunit integration, recycling, and stability are poised for exploration upon the availability of antibodies that allow for immunostaining studies of the human epsilon protein, or the generation of genetically modified lines in which subunits are fluorescently tagged.</p><p>In summary, this approach to model the adult human NMJ in a dish provides a versatile and simple way to study skeletal muscle and NMJ development, but more importantly, constitutes the first report of a method to study adult, rather than embryonic, human NMJ activity in as early as two weeks of co-culture time. Our calcium reporter neuromuscular tissues can easily be integrated with other optogenetic methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Steinbeck et al., 2016</xref>), and would benefit from such an approach, to further elucidate synaptic transmission mechanisms of adult NMJ, such as adult AChR conductance. Furthermore, neuromuscular co-cultures may be integrated with other neuron populations such as upper MNs and/or myelinating Schwann cells to support studies aimed at a better understanding of signal transmission in the central nervous system. Finally, our method is amenable to modeling diseases that target the adult NMJ (e.g. congenital myasthenia gravis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu and Salpeter, 1997</xref>) and to assess drugs to support personalized medicine applications.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human primary myoblast derivation and propagation</title><p>Small skeletal muscle samples (~1 cm<sup>3</sup>) were obtained from the multifidus muscle of patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery.

Videos were processed exactly as described above (calcium transient analysis) to eliminate the spontaneously active fibers from the analysis. The location of the motor neuron cluster was identified from a bright field image, which was used to outline the structure with a circle in the epifluorescent images. Using NIH ImageJ software, concentric circles, each 100 μm larger in radius than the prior, were outlined around the motor neuron cluster until the circles encompassed all the glutamate responsive fibers (i.e. GcAMP6<sup>+</sup>) on the subtracted image. The number of active fibers in each circle were then quantified to determine the number of fibers in each concentric circle ‘bin’.

Data were digitized at 10 kHz and filtered at 2.6 kHz. Data were quantified using MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft). Each fiber was allowed to recover for a few minutes, to allow its resting membrane potential to stabilize before recordings were performed. For electrophysiological recordings following optogenetic stimulation, 3D muscle tissues were generated using human skeletal muscle progenitors transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding humanized ChR2 with H134R mutation fused to EYFP and driven by EF1a (AddGene plasmid #20942). Cells were sorted to purify the infected cells based on the EYFP signal. Optogenetic stimulation was performed using blue LED (KSL-70, RAPP OptoElectronic) with a wavelength of 470 nm, and controlled by the Axon amplifier software. In glutamate stimulation experiments, glutamate was pipetted by hand into the edge of the bath and allowed to diffuse to the tissue.

Addition of the neurotransmitter glutamate generates ripples and disturbs the equilibrium in the culture bath that may lead to the loss of sharp microelectrode recording. Therefore, the bolus of the neurotransmitter should be added from the side of the culture bath gently to then allow for its diffusion the tissue.</p><p><bold>Remark:</bold> Spontaneous contractions of the neuromuscular tissues complicate the sharp microelectrode recordings. Neuromuscular tissues are most spontaneously active once removed from the incubator. As such, resting the tissue at room temperature for 5–10 min after transferring from the 37 C incubator reduces the spontaneous activity and facilitates the sharp microelectrode recordings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Myasthenia gravis disease modeling</title><p>Serum from three patients diagnosed with Anti-AChR MG (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) was collected and IgG fractions were purified using a Protein A IgG purification kit (Thermofisher) based on the manufacturers instruction.

For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, healthy and MG IgG treated tissues were analyzed to quantify the area of GCaMP6 signal at the same ROIs after glutamate (glut) and then acetylcholine (ACh) stimulation and the ratio of glutamate- to ACh-induced GCaMP6 signals was reported.</p><p>In a subset of experiments, we performed serial glutamate stimulation experiments in which we stimulated the same neuromuscular co-culture on Day 11 and then Day 14 of culture with a 50 μM L-glutamate solution and measured the area of GCaMP6<sup>+</sup> tissue as described above. Our analysis indicated that the area of glutamate responsive tissue increased from ~2% at Day 11 to more than 13% on Day 14, arguing against glutamate-induced cytotoxic effects arising from our experimental methods.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>FM 1–43 labeling and imaging</title><p>Motor neuron clusters were separated from undifferentiated single cells using Accutase (ThermoFisher) and transferred to a Geltrex coated 6-well plate on Day 14 of differentiation. Clusters were then cultured for an additional week in E6 media supplemented with 10 ng/mL BDNF and 10 ng/mL GDNF, to permit the regrowth of the neurites, and were then labeled with the FM 1–43 styryl dye (Molecular Probes) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, MN clusters were stimulated using high potassium solution (60 mM) and incubated with FM 1–43 (2 μM) in HBSS (+Mg<sup>2+</sup>and + Ca<sup>2+</sup>) for 20 min to enable dye loading. Clusters were washed with HBSS for at least one hour at room temperature before imaging. Samples were imaged using an IX83 Olympus confocal microscope with FV-10 software at physiological conditions (37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). MN clusters were then stimulated with either high potassium solution (60 mM in PBS), L-glutamate (50 μM in HBSS), or control solutions (HBSS or PBS) while acquiring time-lapse video sequences. Videos were analysed for fluorescence intensity before and after stimulation at each indicated time-point using NIH ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Gene expression analysis</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from three technical replicate muscle tissues or neuromuscular co-culture for each of 3 biological replicate experiments using the PureLink RNA Micro Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (ThermoFisher). cDNA was reverse transcribed from 400 ng of RNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). For quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), CHRNE and CHRNG primers were acquired from Bio-Rad and reactions were run according to manufacturer’s protocol on the Roche LightCycler 480 (Roche) using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche). All results were normalized to the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Gene expression is reported in % of GAPDH expression ±SEM. To assess agrin gene expression in differentiated MNs, cDNA samples were prepared from three consecutive MN differentiations. Genes were amplified using Arktik thermal cycler according to the manufacturer’s protocol (ThermoFisher). PCR amplification products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel with SYBR safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen). GAPDH gene expression served as the loading control.

First of all, it's not clear to me how easy the system described in this manuscript would be to establish in a non-engineering based lab. A guide to its use or an outline of the type of future developments that would make this system more routine would be useful. Many of the authors' measurements are made on &quot;bulk&quot; cultures, with fewer being done on individual fibers or individual NMJ's. So, certainly one downside may be that 2D does make some of that more straightforward (many of my questions listed below relate to what can be observed at a single fiber level in 3D and a few require additional straightforward experiments.)</p><p>My final general comment is that the myasthenia gravis work seems like an almost unnecessary add-on. Was this done to compare the current system to that used by Steinbeck et al., 2016?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In vitro studies of skeletal muscle can be problematic because the in vivo function of these cells requires interaction with multiple other cell types including motor neurons, however these interactions are difficult to replicate ex vivo. This article describes a method for generating de novo differentiated muscle fibers 3D culture in vitro, coupled with generation of pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons, which will self-assemble into functional units in coculture. To validate the technique, the authors showed that these muscle fibers express myosin heavy chain and acetylcholine receptor isoforms specific to mature adult muscle (which are not usually upregulated in vitro) and demonstrated that the neuromuscular synapses (NMJs) respond in a physiologically appropriate fashion to electrical and chemical stimulation, as measured by muscle contractile activity, calcium flux, and electrophysiology. These muscle fibers and motor neurons were generated from human cells, so as a final proof-of-principle the authors treated the matured neuromuscular units with serum from patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), an autoimmune disease which targets the mature isoform of NMJ receptors and diminishes their function. Within two weeks of treatment, they observed alterations in the in vitro generated NMJs mimicking clinical signs in patients, supporting the potential utility of these in vitro cultures for modeling human disease.</p><p>This paper is a fairly straightforward paper; the experiments are well designed and documented and the paper itself is clearly written. The authors are correct in stating that there is an unmet need in the field for an in vitro model of the mature NMJ, and the culture system they describe is better than anything currently in use in the field. As this is primarily a technique paper, I don't think additional studies beyond what is already included are necessary, although there are several that could be done which come to mind- if this is published, I think it will be of significant use to the field and those experiments will be carried out by this group and others.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44530.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewers felt that the authors provide compelling evidence for the use of 3D muscle cultures.

We did not observe any examples of AChR clusters co-localizing with either rapsyn or MuSK proteins in our 2D muscle-alone or neuromuscular cultures (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C).</p><p>We observed a single incidence of MuSK protein co-localization with an AChR cluster in our 3D muscle-alone cultures (Figure 2—figure supplement 2D) and no incidences of rapsyn co-localization with AChR clusters in our 3D muscle-alone cultures.</p><p>By comparison, the prevalence of rapsyn and MuSK co-localizing with bungarotoxin stained AChR clusters was substantially higher in 3D neuromuscular co-cultures. Two representative examples where we observed co-localization of rapsyn (Figure 2D) and MuSK proteins (Figure 2—figure supplement 2E) with MN neurites at bungarotoxin stained AChR cluster sites are shown. However, we note that not all the AChR clusters co-localized with MuSK and rapsyn in 3D neuromuscular co-cultures at the experimental time point we evaluated (Day 12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Does curare block all of the activity?</p></disp-quote><p>We use 25 μM treatment of d-tubocurarine in our system. At this concentration we observe over 99% blocking of changes in muscle fiber calcium transients post glutamate stimulation of motor neurons. This is matched with the results from Ko et al., 2019 were they observe a full block at 50 μM. In addition, we do not observe a change in calcium transients of d-tubocurarine treated (25 μM) myofibers stimulated with 100 μM, ACh (data not shown) which demonstrates the potency of d-tubocurarine blocking at this concentration. These data are consistent with previous reports (Madden et al., 2015) using similar concentration of curare and recent work from our laboratory deposited on BioRxiv (https://doi.org/10.1101/562819). We now make this point and refer to these citations in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The increase in EPP frequency is not obvious. The authors should apply TTX to the cultures to at least distinguish between EPPs and mEPPS. Do the authors see action potentials prior to glutamate application?</p></disp-quote><p>As (correctly) alluded to by all reviewers, we faced challenges in performing electrophysiological recordings. We did indeed set up neuromuscular co-cultures to address this concern, but in the end, ran into technical hurdles that precluded the gathering of data. As the protocol requires 5 weeks from beginning to end, we faced some pressure in collecting the data in the 2-month window, but we did try. As suggested by all reviewers, we now make clear in the Discussion challenges associated with performing e-phys in culture and offer suggestions to adapt methods for future users who wish to perform e-phys in this system.</p><p>We have updated the text to faithfully reflect the data we have in hand. Specifically, we never saw spontaneous activity in 3D muscle-alone recordings (Figure 1—figure supplement 3E), whereas, it was commonplace to capture spontaneous activity in 3D neuromuscular co-cultures (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C). We now speculate (rather than conclude), that these spontaneous endogenous end plate potentials (EPPs) are caused by spontaneous release of ACh from the motor neuron axon terminals at the NMJs, and in the Discussion we acknowledge that without performing blocking studies, we cannot make this conclusion definitively. While our analysis indicated a glutamate evoked change in EPP frequency, we understand that the trace provided was less than satisfactory. We now provide more representative traces we collected in the course of studies aimed at capturing evoked potentials using e-phys (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C). In the Discussion we acknowledge that without performing blocking studies, we cannot make this conclusion definitively.</p><p>Action potential-like events were only observed post glutamate stimulation. We now make this point in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Are there lessons that can be learnt from the 3D cultures that could be implemented to improve 2D cultures?

See corresponding text below.</p><p>Based on our comparative analysis, a major advantage of a 3D culture system is the ability to support the contractility of maturing myofibers, which then are the ideal template for motor neuron innervation in as early as 12 days of differentiation. In addition, myofibers form packed and aligned structures in a 3D system which is not observed in standard tissue culture plastic 2D cultures.</p><p>As such, we expect that focusing efforts on modifying 2D cultures to control the microenvironment in ways that can accommodate myofiber contractility and myofiber alignment, might result in the formation of functional NMJs in vitro at earlier time-points, and perhaps even support the de novo embryonic to adult switch in AChR subunit type. Indeed, a recent report by Ko and colleagues (Ko et al., 2019) working with rodent myoblast and neural cells highlights a role for matrix topography and myofiber alignment as it relates to innervation efficiency in 2D culture, though more comparative analysis is required to understand how this type of approach impacts human NMJ formation in culture as compared to a 3D co-culture system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] I have one request for the authors, which stems from the fact that the take away message is the ease of the method.

Here we provide additional detail to address the issue of technical challenges and reproducibility. We have added text to the Materials and methods to provide tips for success. We also expand on technical limitations and suggest adaptations that will expand the usability of the system.</p><p>1) While the muscle culture protocol consistently yields muscle tissues, the use of Velcro as an anchor points is not ideal. Glue-ing the Velcro into each side of the culture depression is time consuming and requires some practice. In some instances, for example if the Velcro hooks were broken and/or weak, a 3D muscle tissue might rupture at an early time point. As a result, the user must assess the quality of the anchor points thoroughly to ensure the successful formation and maintenance of the muscle tissues. To overcome this technical issue, we designed and produced a 96 well plate that enables reproducible bulk production of muscle microtissues in vitro that uses deflective rubber posts cast directly into the plate as ‘tendon’ anchor points, rather than Velcro (BioRxiv,: https://doi.org/10.1101/562819).</p><p>2) Challenges associated with specifying pluripotent stem cells to the motor neuron lineage can delay planned experiments. This is a particular hurdle given that current motor neuron specification protocols are 2-3 weeks long. Common issues include the batch to batch variability and/or limited shelf-life of the motor neuron differentiation factors (retinoic acid, purmorphamine, sonic hedgehog, and DAPT) which can have a significant impact on the success of the motor neuron differentiation protocol. The initial seeding density of Olig2<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells also impacts motor neuron cluster formation and differentiation yields. As such, potential adaptors need to test each new batch of differentiation factors and also ensure consistent seeding criteria of progenitor cells to ensure high differentiation yields. Finally, it should be noted that excessive shearing of Olig2<sup>+</sup> cells upon thawing and plating, reduces the differentiation efficiency in subsequent steps.</p><p>3) The co-culture protocol relies on collecting individual motor neuron clusters to mix together with muscle progenitor cells, as explained in the Materials and the methods. This is advantageous as it enables the user to collect a defined number of uniformly sized clusters that are free of any contaminating, undifferentiated cells. However, this step is very labor intensive and limits the throughput of the co-culture tissue production. Therefore, future work aimed at defining protocols for enzymatic collection of clusters followed by a stepwise straining process to support high throughput collection of uniformly sized motor neuron clusters is needed.</p><p>4) To ensure easy fabrication of neuromuscular co-culture tissues, motor neuron clusters are mixed directly into the hydrogel mix containing the mononucleated muscle progenitor cells. While this allows for easy fabrication of neuromuscular tissues, the process precludes control over the final localization of motor neuron clusters as the neuromuscular tissues form. As such, the proximity of motor neuron clusters to one another, and the degree of innervation within co-culture tissues can vary a bit from one tissue to another.</p><p>5) Compared to 3D muscle only tissues, we observed a lot of contractile activity in neuromuscular co-cultures, which we expect is due to the spontaneous firing of motor neuron cells present in co-cultures. Based on the literature, we surmise that the higher motor neuron induced muscle fiber activity contributes to the advanced contractile maturation of muscle fibers in our co-cultures (aligned with previous reports Akaaboune et al., 1999; Andreose et al., 1993; Caroni et al., 1993; Skorpen et al., 1999), but in turn also led to higher rates of muscle rupture in co-cultures. Based on a recent report (Cvetkovic et al., 2017) highlighting the influence of plasmin, cathepsin L, MMP-2, and MMP-9 proteases on in vitro muscle tissue longevity, we propose that using an array of protease inhibitors, in addition to ACA, might aid in preventing contraction-induced neuromuscular co-culture demise.</p><p>6) In general, analyses at the single fiber level require the user to develop tools or adapt the protocol to improve feasibility. For example, electrophysiological recordings in the co-culture system are feasible, but highly challenging for a number of reasons. First, spontaneous or induced muscle tissue contractions in 3D neuromuscular co-cultures frequently resulted in the loss of pipette contact with the cell membrane during recordings. As a result, recording where glutamate is added to the culture bath as a stimulation method, which elicits tissue movement via multiple muscle fibers contracting in unison (as seen in Video 7) were exceedingly challenging and as such, only successful in few events, as reported in the manuscript. However, this challenge can be overcome by performing targeted stimulation of single motor neurons with electrical or neurotransmitter stimulation, or by stimulating with blue light in the case of motor neurons genetically modified to express a light sensitive channel (e.g.) channelrhodopsin. In addition, identifying innervated muscle fibers is challenging. Using fluorescently labelled muscle cells (e.g. GCaPM6+, membrane anchored fluorophore) and motor neuron (e.g. HB9-GFP, mCherry, neurofilament-GFP) cells will dramatically improve the success rate in identifying innervated muscle fibers in 3D neuromuscular co-cultures. Notably, the 3D nature of the co-culture system reduces the incidence of pipette breakage common in studies of plastic cultured myotubes. However, without added myotube maturation through contraction regimes or otherwise, it should be noted that myotubes in culture are somewhat smaller than those in adult animals, which can introduce some difficulty in recording. Other types of single fiber or single molecule analyses, such as immunostaining or time-lapse microscopy to follow a single acetylcholine receptor subunit, are more challenging in 3D as compared to 2D culture, but are feasible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The paper by Bakooshli et al. presents a new system to study human muscle development, neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation, and, perhaps, neuromuscular disorders.
