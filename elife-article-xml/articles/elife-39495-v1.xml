In teleost fish, altering the adult sex steroid milieu can effectively reverse sex-typical mating behaviors, suggesting remarkable sexual lability of their brains as adults. In the teleost medaka, neuropeptide B (NPB) is expressed female-specifically in the brain nuclei implicated in mating behavior. Here, we demonstrate that NPB is a direct mediator of estrogen action on female mating behavior, acting in a female-specific but reversible manner. Analysis of regulatory mechanisms revealed that the female-specific expression of NPB is dependent on direct transcriptional activation by estrogen via an estrogen-responsive element and is reversed in response to changes in the adult sex steroid milieu. Behavioral studies of NPB knockouts revealed that female-specific NBP mediates female receptivity to male courtship. The female-specific NPB signaling identified herein is presumably a critical element of the neural circuitry underlying sexual dimorphism and lability of mating behaviors in teleosts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuropeptide B</kwd><kwd>sexual dimorphism</kwd><kwd>sexual lability</kwd><kwd>sex steroid</kwd><kwd>mating behavior</kwd><kwd>female receptivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25132705</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Okubo</surname><given-names>Kataaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H06429</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Okubo</surname><given-names>Kataaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16H04979</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Okubo</surname><given-names>Kataaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H03044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Okubo</surname><given-names>Kataaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12J07446</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hiraki-Kajiyama</surname><given-names>Towako</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006264</institution-id><institution>RIKEN</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Special Postdoctoral Researcher Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hiraki-Kajiyama</surname><given-names>Towako</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In the brain of medaka fish, neuropeptide B acts directly downstream of estrogen in a female-specific but reversible manner to mediate female receptivity to male courtship.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>From invertebrates to humans, males and females of a given species exhibit profound differences in mating behavior; in general, males perform elaborate courtship displays to attract females for mating, and females evaluate male courtship displays to decide whether to mate. Such differences in mating behavior between males and females result from sexually dimorphic development and activation of the underlying neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang and Shah, 2016</xref>). In vertebrates, sex-typical mating behaviors and the underlying neural circuits are highly dependent on the sex steroid hormone milieu, which is unique to each sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCarthy and Arnold, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McCarthy et al., 2017</xref>). Males have higher circulating levels of androgen derived from the testis, whereas females have a cyclic pattern of estrogen and progestin arising from the ovary. Sex steroids largely exert their effects by binding to intracellular receptors, which subsequently interact with sex steroid-responsive elements in the genome to modulate the transcription of target genes. Recent work, particularly in rodents and songbirds, has identified sex steroid-responsive neural circuits that underlie the divergent mating behaviors of males versus females, as well as the genes downstream of sex steroids that mediate these behaviors. However, the identity of the sex-specific direct transcriptional targets of sex steroids that mediate sex-typical mating behaviors remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang and Shah, 2014</xref>).</p><p>It is generally viewed that differences between the sexes in mating behavior are robust and essentially irreversible in mammals and birds. Several studies, however, have challenged this view and showed that they exhibit some degree of sexual lability in mating behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Edwards and Burge, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">SÃ¶dersten, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adkins-Regan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balthazart et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ball et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kimchi et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, sexual lability in mating behavior can be seen much more frequently and completely in teleost fish, where experimental manipulations that alter the sex steroid milieu effectively lead to the reversal of sex-typical mating behaviors, even in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Munakata and Kobayashi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Paul-Prasanth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">GÃ¶ppert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghosal and Sorensen, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, a large number of teleost species spontaneously undergo phenotypic sex reversal, involving both behavioral and anatomical changes, in response to social and physiological stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Capel, 2017</xref>). Despite several studies, the neural mechanisms responsible for the reversal of sex-typical mating behaviors remain unknown.</p><p>In the teleost species medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>), we previously found that estrogen and androgen receptors are expressed almost exclusively in females in two brain regions: the supracommissural/posterior nucleus of the ventral telencephalic area (Vs/Vp) and the magnocellular/gigantocellular portion of the magnocellular preoptic nucleus (PMm/PMg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hiraki et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). These regions are therefore likely to represent female-specific target sites for both estrogen and androgen in the teleost brain. This finding, together with classic lesion and stimulation studies suggesting that Vs/Vp and PMm/PMg are involved in mating behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demski et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kyle and Peter, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koyama et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Satou et al., 1984</xref>), led us to search for genes that are directly activated by estrogen and/or androgen in these brain regions and mediate female-typical mating behavior. As a result, we identified a candidate gene, <italic>npb</italic> (encoding neuropeptide B; NPB), whose expression in Vs/Vp and PMm/PMg is virtually confined to females and dependent on gonadal estrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hiraki et al., 2014</xref>). NPB, together with its close relative, neuropeptide W (NPW), was originally identified as a ligand for the orphan receptors GPR7 and GPR8 (now designated NPBWR1 and NPBWR2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujii et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brezillon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2003</xref>). NPB and NPW have been implicated in a wide array of physiological processes, including food intake, energy homeostasis, inflammatory pain response, regulation of pituitary hormones, and social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sakurai, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Watanabe and Yamamoto, 2015</xref>); to our knowledge, however, there is no information regarding their role in mating behavior.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39495.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sexually dimorphic <italic>npba</italic> expression is independent of sex chromosome complement but dependent on direct transcriptional activation by estrogen.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Lateral view (anterior to left) of the medaka brain showing approximate levels of sections in panel B.

We addressed whether the pattern of <italic>npba</italic> expression coincides with the chromosomal sex and/or gonadal sex by producing sex-reversed medaka and examining <italic>npba</italic> expression in their brains. Real-time PCR performed on the whole brain revealed that sex-reversed XY females exhibited the same high level of overall <italic>npba</italic> expression as wild-type XX females, whereas sex-reversed XX males showed a much lower level of overall <italic>npba</italic> expression (p&lt;0.0001 versus XX and XY females), comparable to that in wild-type XY males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

In agreement with these results, in situ hybridization analysis revealed a smaller total area of <italic>npba</italic> expression in Vs/Vp and PMm/PMg of ÎERE mutant females as compared with wild-type females (p=0.0202 for Vs/Vp, and 0.0058 for PMm/PMg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), whereas <italic>npba</italic> expression in these nuclei was not detected in ÎERE or wild-type males. We also evaluated <italic>npba</italic> expression in the whole brain of ÎERE mutant females that were sham-operated, ovariectomized, or ovariectomized and treated with estradiol-17Î² (E2; the primary estrogen in vertebrates including teleosts) by real-time PCR. In the mutant female brain, <italic>npba</italic> expression was significantly reduced by ovariectomy and restored by E2 treatment, but E2 was not able to restore <italic>npba</italic> expression to the level present in wild-type females (p=0.0023 for the mutant versus wild-type females) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that estrogen elicits the female-specific expression of <italic>npba</italic> by direct transcriptional activation through the ERE present in the <italic>npba</italic> promoter, although other mechanisms are also likely involved in this estrogen effect.</p><p>The possibility that decreased <italic>npba</italic> expression in âERE mutant females was due to a decrease in estrogen levels in their brains was ruled out by the observation that âERE mutant females had brain levels of E2 comparable to those of wild-type females (p=0.782) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sexually dimorphic <italic>npba</italic> expression can be reversed by altering the sex steroid milieu</title><p>We determined whether the sexual phenotype of <italic>npba</italic> expression can be reversed from the female to the male pattern, and vice versa, by altering the adult sex steroid milieu.

Here, we first tested whether <italic>npba</italic> expression in these brain nuclei can be induced in males by castration and sex steroid supplementation. Indeed, in situ hybridization results showed that treating castrated males with E2 induced <italic>npba</italic> expression in both Vs/Vp and PMm/PMg (p=0.0013 for Vs/Vp and 0.0006 for PMm/PMg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The effects of altering the sex steroid milieu on the sexually dimorphic pattern of <italic>npba</italic> expression was further evaluated in fish with intact gonads. In situ hybridization results showed that treating ovary-intact adult females continuously with 11-ketotestosterone (KT; the most prominent, non-aromatizable androgen in teleosts) caused a gradual decline in <italic>npba</italic> expression in Vs/Vp, decreasing both the number of <italic>npba</italic>-expressing neurons (p&lt;0.0001 on days 5 and 9) and the total area of <italic>npba</italic> expression (p=0.0002 on day 2; p&lt;0.0001 on days 5 and 9) to undetectable or nearly undetectable levels over the treatment period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâC</xref>).

Comparative synteny analysis of NPB genes in the gar, basal (early-branching) teleost (arowana and catfish), and medaka genomes revealed that, in the basal teleost and medaka genomes, <italic>npba</italic> is located in a segment of conserved synteny containing <italic>sstr2</italic>, <italic>sox9</italic>, <italic>rnf213</italic>, <italic>pcyt2</italic>, and <italic>mafg</italic>, while <italic>npbb</italic> is in a segment of conserved synteny containing <italic>slc26a11</italic>, <italic>sgsh</italic>, <italic>gnav1</italic>, and <italic>pcyt2</italic>. On the other hand, the NPB gene in the gar genome is located in a segment containing all of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). These lines of evidence strongly suggest that the two NPB genes arose from the whole-genome duplication that occurred early in teleost evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amores et al., 1998</xref>). No other <italic>NPB</italic>/<italic>NPW</italic>-like genes were found in our EST library or public medaka genome/EST databases, indicating the absence of NPW in medaka as in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bu et al., 2016</xref>).

Npbb displayed greater potency than Npba with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 4.3 nM versus 240 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined the spatial expression of <italic>npbb</italic> with a focus on possible differences between the sexes and colocalization with <italic>npba</italic> expression. First, the relative levels of regional <italic>npbb</italic> expression were measured by real-time PCR and compared between male and female brains dissected into three parts: (i) the olfactory bulb, telencephalon, diencephalon, and midbrain tegmentum; (ii) the optic tectum; and (iii) the cerebellum and medulla oblongata.Expression of <italic>npbb</italic> was observed in all three parts, but was highest in the optic tectum, where males had slightly higher levels than females (p=0.014) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Subsequent examination by in situ hybridization revealed that <italic>npbb</italic> was expressed in the following nuclei: Vs/Vp in the ventral telencephalon; Pbl, PMp, and PMm/PMg/PPp in the preoptic area (note that <italic>npbb</italic> was continuously expressed across PMm/PMg and PPp, whereas <italic>npba</italic> was expressed separately in PMm/PMg and PPp); VL and PPv/DP/CP in the pretectum/thalamus; NVT, NRP, NPT, and PGc in the hypothalamus; DT/IR/MR and IQ/RT in the midbrain tegmentum; gc, ra/ttb, and RS in the brain stem; and OT and PGZ3 in the optic tectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,F</xref>). A marked difference between the sexes was observed in Vs/Vp (p&lt;0.0001), where <italic>npbb</italic> expression was observed in females, but completely absent in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,F</xref>). Similarly, <italic>npbb</italic>-expressing neurons in PMm/PMg/PPp were more abundant in number and displayed a much larger total area of expression in females than in males (p=0.0011 for number of neurons; p&lt;0.0001 for total area) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4DâF</xref>). In contrast, in VL and PGZ3, a marginally higher number of <italic>npb</italic>-expressing neurons were seen in males than in females (p=0.020 for VL, and 0.045 for PGZ3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>The simultaneous detection of <italic>npba</italic> and <italic>npbb</italic> expression showed that these genes are expressed in the same subset of neurons within Vs/Vp and PMm/PMg/PPp; in contrast, no neurons in other brain nuclei were found to express both genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Taken together, these findings show that there is an additional NPB gene, <italic>npbb</italic>, in medaka that is coexpressed with <italic>npba</italic> in a female-biased manner in Vs/Vp and PMm/PMg/PPp.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Sexually dimorphic <italic>npbb</italic> expression can also be reversed by altering the sex steroid milieu</title><p>Following identification of <italic>npbb</italic>, we investigated whether the sexually dimorphic pattern of <italic>npbb</italic> expression in Vs/Vp and PMm/PMg/PPp can be reversed by altering the adult sex steroid milieu, as observed for <italic>npba</italic>. First, we evaluated the effects of sex steroids on <italic>npbb</italic> expression by means of gonadectomy and sex steroid supplementation, followed by in situ hybridization analysis. In adult females, ovariectomy caused a significant reduction in <italic>npbb</italic> expression in both Vs/Vp (p=0.0271) and PMm/PMg/PPp (p=0.0041), which was restored by treatment with E2 (p=0.0091 for Vs/Vp, and 0.0173 for PMm/PMg) but not by KT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In adult males, E2 treatment following castration induced a few <italic>npbb</italic>-expressing neurons in Vs/Vp (p&lt;0.0001), whereas <italic>npbb</italic> expression in PMm/PMg/PPp did not show clear responses to any treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The effects of the altered sex steroid milieu on <italic>npbb</italic> expression was further tested in fish with intact gonads. Both KT and AI treatment of ovary-intact adult females resulted in a gradual decline in <italic>npbb</italic> expression in Vs/Vp, both in the number of <italic>npbb</italic>-expressing neurons and in the total area of <italic>npbb</italic> expression, to undetectable or nearly undetectable levels (p&lt;0.0001 for number of neurons in KT-treated fish on days 5 and 9; p=0.0235,&lt;0.0001, andÂ &lt;0.0001 for total area in KT-treated fish on days 2, 5, and 9, respectively; p=0.0002 and&lt;0.0001 for number of neurons in AI-treated fish on days 5 and 9, respectively; p=0.0013 and 0.0009 for total area in AI-treated fish on days 5 and 9, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AâF</xref>). KT treatment, but not AI treatment, also led to a significant decrease in <italic>npbb</italic> expression in PMm/PMg/PPp (p=0.0038 for number of neurons in KT-treated fish on day 9; p=0.0021 and&lt;0.0001 for total area in KT-treated fish on days 5 and 9, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AâF</xref>). E2 treatment of testis-intact adult males caused no clear changes in <italic>npbb</italic> expression in either Vs/Vp or PMm/PMg/PPp, but a few <italic>npbb</italic>-expressing neurons were newly induced in Vs/Vp (p=0.0369) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5GâI</xref>). Collectively, these results show that, similar to <italic>npba</italic> expression, the sexually dimorphic pattern of <italic>npbb</italic> expression can be reversed, at least in part, in response to changes in the sex steroid milieu.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39495.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Sexually dimorphic <italic>npbb</italic> expression can also be reversed by altering the sex steroid milieu.</title><p>Temporal changes in <italic>npbb</italic> expression in Vs/Vp and PMm/PMg of 11-ketotestosterone (KT)-treated females (<bold>A, B, C</bold>), aromatase inhibitor (AI)-treated females (<bold>D, E, F</bold>), and estradiol-17Î² (<bold>E2</bold>)-treated males (<bold>G, H, I</bold>) (nÂ =Â 5 per treatment and sampling day).

Most homozygous females of both knockout strains spawned successfully, similar to wild-type and heterozygous females. However, subsequent quantitative behavioral testing uncovered a latent abnormality in <italic>npba</italic> knockout strain. The mating behavior of medaka consists of a sequence of stereotyped actions that are easily quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ono and Uematsu, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Walter and Hamilton, 1970</xref>). The sequence begins with the male approaching and following the female closely. The male then performs a courtship display, in which he swims quickly in a circular pattern in front of the female. If she is receptive, the male grasps her with his dorsal and anal fins (termed âwrappingâ), and they quiver together (termed âquiveringâ) until eggs and sperm are released. If the female is not receptive, she either assumes a rejection posture in which she raises her head or rapidly moves away from the male. Here, we found a significant increase in latencies from the first courtship display to the first wrapping and to the wrapping that resulted in spawning for <italic>npba</italic><sup>-/-</sup> females as compared with <italic>npba</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>npba</italic><sup>+/-</sup> females (p=0.0256 and 0.0002, respectively, for the latency to the first wrapping; p=0.0104 and 0.0026, respectively, for the latency to the wrapping that resulted in spawning) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In contrast, <italic>npbb</italic><sup>-/-</sup> females compared with controls showed no significant difference in any of the behavioral parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). To further evaluate the role of NPB signaling, we generated <italic>npba</italic>/<italic>npbb</italic> double knockout (<italic>npba</italic><sup>-/-</sup>/<italic>npbb</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) and <italic>npbwr2</italic> knockout (<italic>npbwr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) medaka (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and assessed the mating behavior of these females. Homozygous females, as well as males, of both strains were found to be fertile, sexually active, and to spawn successfully. However, as was the case with <italic>npba</italic><sup>-/-</sup> females, a significant increase in the latency from the first courtship display to the first wrapping was observed for both <italic>npba</italic><sup>-/-</sup>/<italic>npbb</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>npbwr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> females as compared with wild-type females (p=0.0064 for <italic>npba</italic><sup>-/-</sup>/<italic>npbb</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, and 0.0002 for <italic>npbwr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). <italic>npbwr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> females also showed a significant increase in latency from the first courtship display to the wrapping that resulted in spawning (p=0.0013) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Collectively, these results indicate that NPB signaling affects female receptivity to male courtship.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In a previous study, we showed that <italic>npba</italic> expression in Vs/Vp and PMm/PMg, two brain nuclei implicated in mating behavior, is specific to females in medaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hiraki et al., 2014</xref>). That finding, together with the fact that sex differences in mating behavior can be reversed in teleosts, led us to investigate whether <italic>npba</italic> has a role in female-typical mating behavior and whether its sex-specific expression pattern may be reversed between males and females. The present results indicate that NPB signaling constitutes a female-specific but reversible component of the female sexual receptivity pathway.</p><p>Our previous study showed that female-specific <italic>npba</italic> expression is dependent on gonadal estrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hiraki et al., 2014</xref>). In mammals and birds, many sex differences in behavior and gene expression in the brain are robustly influenced by sex chromosome complement, with chromosomal sex occasionally exerting an influence as large as that of gonadal sex steroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCarthy and Arnold, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forger et al., 2016</xref>). It therefore seemed possible that sex chromosome complement as well as gonadal estrogen might contribute to the female-specific expression of <italic>npba</italic> in medaka brain. Here, however, we found that the sexually dimorphic pattern of <italic>npba</italic> expression is independent of sex chromosome complement, and relies exclusively on gonadal sex steroids. The lack of sex chromosome effects certainly underlies the reversibility of the sexually dimorphic <italic>npba</italic> expression.</p><p>We also showed that the female-specific expression of <italic>npba</italic> results, at least in part, from direct transcriptional activation of <italic>npba</italic> by estrogen via an ERE present in its promoter. Consistent with this, female-specific <italic>npba</italic>-expressing neurons coexpress estrogen receptors (ERs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hiraki et al., 2014</xref>). The identification of <italic>npba</italic> as a direct target of estrogen action is interesting because very few genes involved in female mating behavior in any species have been found to be direct targets of estrogen, although such genes can be highly estrogen-responsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang and Shah, 2014</xref>). The exceptions are the genes encoding the progesterone receptor, oxytocin, and oxytocin receptor; however, those genes are expressed in behaviorally relevant brain regions of both males and females, and affect the mating behaviors of both sexes, in contrast to <italic>npba</italic> in medaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wagner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Veening et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dumais and Veenema, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pfaff et al., 2018</xref>). Collectively, our findings indicate that the female-specific expression of <italic>npba</italic> has a distinct regulatory mechanism.</p><p>Another distinctive aspect of <italic>npba</italic> expression is the bidirectional reversibility of sexual dimorphism (both from female-typical to male-typical pattern and from male-typical to female-typical pattern). We found that <italic>npba</italic> expression in Vs/Vp and PMm/PMg disappeared in females and appeared in males in response to changes in the adult sex steroid milieu, in contrast to genes that exhibit sexually dimorphic expression and mediate sex-typical mating behaviors in mammals. In mice, for example, the cholecystokinin receptor gene (<italic>Cckar</italic>) implicated in female sexual receptivity is expressed in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus at much higher levels in females owing to estrogen stimulation. Although <italic>Cckar</italic> expression in this nucleus is reduced by ovariectomy and reinstated by treatment with estrogen in adult females, treating adult males with estrogen does not induce expression of <italic>Cckar</italic> in this nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Such irreversibility of sexually dimorphic gene expression in the adult brain is attributed to the specific action of gonadal sex steroids during the perinatal period, in addition to the sex chromosome effects mentioned above. Studies in rodents indicate that perinatal sex steroids have long-lasting or even permanent effects on brain gene expression and behavior via epigenetic mechanisms involving DNA methylation and histone modifications, which establish and maintain differences between the sexes across the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McCarthy and Nugent, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McCarthy et al., 2017</xref>). The reversible sex difference in adult <italic>npba</italic> expression in medaka suggests either that perinatal sex steroids induce few, if any, epigenetic modifications in <italic>npba</italic> or that such modifications can easily be reversed for some reason. This unique mode of sexual differentiation of <italic>npba</italic> expression probably contributes to the adult reversal of sex-typical mating behaviors observed in teleosts. Given that mammals and birds also exhibit some degree of sexual lability in mating behavior, behavior-relevant genes for which expression in the adult brain is sexually dimorphic but bidirectionally reversible in response to sex steroids may remain to be identified.</p><p>Importantly, our results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the reversal of sexually dimorphic <italic>npba</italic> expression. The profound decrease in <italic>npba</italic> expression observed in ovary-intact females treated with non-aromatizable androgen indicates that androgen/androgen receptor (AR) signaling plays an inhibitory role in <italic>npba</italic> expression, alongside the stimulatory role of estrogen/ER signaling. However, expression of <italic>npba</italic> was not induced in males deprived of androgen by castration, suggesting that the androgen/AR signaling does not directly inhibit <italic>npba</italic> expression. Considering a concomitant decrease in brain levels of E2 in androgen-treated males, the androgen/AR signaling pathway presumably exerts its influence by attenuating the stimulatory action of estrogen through a reduction of brain E2 levels. Given that ER expression in Vs/Vp and PMp/PMg is strongly suppressed by androgen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hiraki et al., 2012</xref>), the inhibitory action of androgen on <italic>npba</italic> expression may involve repression of estrogen/ER signaling not only at ligand, but also at receptor level.</p><p>The estrogenic induction of <italic>npba</italic> expression in Vs/Vp and PMm/PMg of males showed a slower kinetic response than would be expected of a model of direct transcriptional activation. However, we previously found that ERs are not expressed at detectable levels in Vs/Vp and PMm/PMg of males and that treating males with estrogen induces ER expression therein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hiraki et al., 2012</xref>). Considering these findings, it seems plausible that this estrogen-induced <italic>npba</italic> expression is not fully realized until sufficient ER expression is achieved.</p><p>The brains of teleosts exhibit extensive adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chapouton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ganz and Brand, 2016</xref>) and estrogen has significant effects on adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mahmoud et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heberden, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ponti et al., 2018</xref>). These facts suggest the possibility that adult neurogenesis may be involved in the reversal of sexually dimorphic <italic>npba</italic> expression. However, our recent work showed that the Npba-expressing neurons emerged in adult males treated with estrogen, not through neurogenesis, but through the activation of pre-existing, quiescent male counterpart neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kikuchi et al., 2019</xref>). This evidence suggests the relevance of an activationâinactivation process on existing neurons, rather than neurogenesis, in the reversible sexual dimorphism in <italic>npba</italic> expression.</p><p>We found that the female-specific <italic>npba</italic>-expressing neurons project their axons to various regions of the central nervous system, particularly the brainstem and spinal cord, but not to the pituitary. The latter observation is surprising, given that most of the isotocin neurons that are intermingled with the female-specific <italic>npba</italic>-expressing neurons in PMm/PMg project to the pituitary in teleosts including medaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hiraki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamashita et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with the widespread projection of <italic>npba</italic>-expressing neurons, <italic>npbwr2</italic> was found to be widely expressed in the central nervous system, corroborating the idea that the female-specific Npba peptide has multiple action sites. In the spinal cord, <italic>npbwr2</italic> was expressed in the medial part of the dorsal horn and the lateral part of the ventral horn, which respectively contain sympathetic preganglionic neurons and motoneurons in teleosts as well as in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Westerfield et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schneider and Sulner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Funakoshi and Nakano, 2007</xref>). Thus, the female-specific Npba probably acts on either or both of these neurons in the spinal cord, as well as in various neuronal subsets in the brain. Although NPBWR1/2 primarily couples to the inhibitory G protein (Gi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujii et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2003</xref>), activation of NPBWR1 reportedly leads to increased excitability of some neuronal populations in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Price et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, whether Npbwr2 activation has inhibitory or stimulatory effects on each type of neuronal population in medaka remains to be defined.</p><p>Our study identified a second functional NPB gene, designated <italic>npbb</italic>, in medaka. Phylogenetic and syntenic analyses indicated that this gene probably originated from the teleost-specific whole-genome duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amores et al., 1998</xref>) and is thus confined to teleosts. Similar to <italic>npba</italic>, <italic>npbb</italic> was found to be preferentially expressed in females in Vs/Vp and PMm/PMg/PPp; in addition, <italic>npba</italic> and <italic>npbb</italic> were expressed in the same neurons in these brain nuclei, suggesting that the two genes share common regulatory mechanisms. Indeed, the sexually dimorphic expression of <italic>npbb</italic> in Vs/Vp and PMm/PMg/PPp could also be reversed by altering the sex steroid milieu, although the changes were less marked as compared with <italic>npba</italic>. In addition, a putative ERE, though not yet proven to be functional, was found in the <italic>npbb</italic> promoter at a similar position as in the <italic>npba</italic> promoter, suggesting that <italic>npbb</italic> is also directly activated by estrogen and that a cis-regulatory region that confers estrogen-responsive NPB gene expression is evolutionary conserved. This idea is further supported by the observation that NPB genes in gar and several other teleosts also contain a putative ERE at a similar position. The results also suggested that the two genes have a shared function in female mating behavior; indeed, part of the altered behavioral phenotypes was evident in <italic>npba</italic><sup>-/-</sup>/<italic>npbb</italic><sup>-/-</sup> females, but not in single knockouts of either of the two genes, presumably due to functional redundancy. Importantly, coexpression of <italic>npba</italic> and <italic>npbb</italic> was observed exclusively in Vs/Vp and PMm/PMg/PPp and not in other brain nuclei, which strongly suggests that their expression in these nuclei is responsible for the phenotypes observed.</p><p><italic>npba</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, <italic>npba</italic><sup>-/-</sup>/<italic>npbb</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, and <italic>npbwr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> females showed increased latency from courtship display to wrapping, and furthermore, <italic>npba</italic><sup>-/-</sup>/<italic>npbb</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>npbwr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> females showed increased incidence of spawning without any preceding courtship display. These results illustrate the relevance of NPB signaling to female sexual receptivity. However, the two phenotypes are seemingly inconsistent in that the increased latency from courtship to mating may be associated with decreased receptivity, whereas the increased incidence of spawning without receiving courtship may be associated with increased receptivity. The most likely explanation is that the deficiency of NPB signaling reduces the significance of courtship display in female receptivity. In medaka, as in other animals, courtship display serves to stimulate female receptivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grant et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grant and Green, 1996</xref>). Conceivably, courtship display is somehow less important and less effective for females deficient in NPB signaling; in other words, they require more time to accept males after receiving courtship stimulation, but simultaneously tend to accept males without being courted. Thus, female-specific NPB signaling may play an important role in female mate choice by facilitating the acceptance of males performing courtship display and the refusal of males exhibiting no courtship.</p><p>This raises the question of what specific process in female mate choice is primarily influenced by female-specific NPB signaling. The answer remains to be found, but <italic>Npbwr1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have been shown to exhibit behavioral abnormalities in social interaction: when confronted by a conspecific intruder, they approach rapidly and spend more time close to the intruder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nagata-Kuroiwa et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, a single nucleotide polymorphism in human <italic>NPBWR1</italic> has been shown to influence the evaluation of facial expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Watanabe et al., 2012</xref>). These observations, together with the extensive effective area of female-specific NPB signaling in the brain, suggest that NPB signaling may be involved in the process of perceiving and/or evaluating male performance during courtship. Alternatively, given that the spinal cord is the major target site of female-specific NPB signaling, it is possible that NPB signaling, by influencing motor and/or sympathetic function, may be involved in executing the decision of whether or not to mate.</p><p>In summary, the present study has identified NPB as a critical element of the female sexual receptivity circuitry in medaka, exhibiting reversible sexual dimorphism under the direct control of estrogen. The female-specific NPB neurons are located in Vs/Vp and PMm/PMg, regions that are considered homologous to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis/subpallial amygdala and the supraoptic nucleus/paraventricular nucleus, respectively, in the mammalian brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Northcutt, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moore and Lowry, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O'Connell and Hofmann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goodson and Kingsbury, 2013</xref>). Similar to medaka, NPB/NPW neurons have been detected in these nuclei in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dun et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jackson et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the role of NPB in female sexual receptivity may be conserved across a wide array of vertebrate taxa. Further studies will be required to test this possibility.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>)</td><td><italic>npba</italic></td><td>DOI:Â <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2013-1806">10.1210/en.2013-1806</ext-link></td><td>Genbank:NM_001308979</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>O. latipes</italic>)</td><td><italic>npbb</italic></td><td>NBRP Medaka</td><td>clone ID:olova57o22;

For more than two groups, continuous variables were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by either Bonferroniâs (for comparisons among experimental groups) or Dunnettâs (for comparisons of experimental versus control groups) <italic>post hoc</italic> test. If Bartlettâs and Brown-Forsythe tests indicated that the variance differed significantly among groups, data were log-transformed to normalize distributions prior to analysis. If the variance remained heterogeneous after transformation, data were analyzed by the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunnâs <italic>post hoc</italic> test. For the analysis of <italic>npba</italic> expression in ovariectomized and E2-treated ÎERE mutant females, a two-way ANOVA was conducted to test for main effects and interactions between genotype and treatment. Behavioral time-series data sets were further analyzed using Kaplan-Meier plots with the inclusion of fish that did not spawn within the test period, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jahn-Eimermacher et al. (2011)</xref>. Differences between Kaplan-Meier curves were tested for statistical significance using Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroniâs correction. Fisherâs exact test was used to compare categorical variables. Statistical outliers were determined with a ROUT test, using a false-positive rate (Q) of 0.1%, and were removed from the behavioral time-series data sets.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the National BioResource Project (NBRP) Medaka for providing the BAC clone used in this study and Drs.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Neuropeptide B mediates female sexual receptivity in medaka fish, acting in a female-specific but reversible manner&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Scott Juntti (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Hiraki-Kajiyama et al. follow up work on the sexually dimorphic expression of NPB with a series of experiments to understand its gene regulation and directly test its role in sexual behaviors using reverse genetics. An outstanding problem in molecular biology has been the linking of hormone receptors to individual target genes. A second problem is in discovering genes in the pathways that drive mating behavior. This paper addresses both, and makes an attempt to link the two. They report that the two paralogs of <italic>npb, nbpa</italic> and <italic>npbb</italic>, display female specific expression in Vs/Vp and PMm/PMg region of the medaka brain. They found that this female specific expression depends on estrogen and an ERE site in the case of <italic>npba</italic>, and is responsive to altered sex hormone milieu. Furthermore, they uncovered that in mutants lacking either the ligands (Npba and Npbb) or the receptor (Npbwr2) are less receptive to male courtship. Overall, the manuscript is well written, the data is of high quality, and the conclusions are supported by the results. There are a few issues need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The decreased expression of <italic>npba</italic> in the âERE mutants supports the hypothesis that ER acts directly on the ERE to activate <italic>npba</italic> expression. However, the conclusion may be strengthened if <italic>npba</italic> expression in the mutants is not or less responsive to exogenous estrogen treatment.</p><p>The slow kinetics of estrogen induction of <italic>npba</italic> and <italic>npbb</italic> expression in Vs/Vp and PMm/PMg regions does not agree with the model of direct ER regulation. Other permissive changes may be necessary.</p><p>Regarding the change in the number of <italic>npba/npbb</italic> expression neurons, the authors only considered changes in gene expression.

Although the significant difference disappeared in the latency from the first courtship display to the wrapping that resulted in spawning between <italic>npba</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>npba</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, all other significant differences detected were also detected by this analysis, supporting the robustness of our results (the latency to the first wrapping; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0480 for <italic>npba</italic><sup>+/+</sup> versus <italic>npba</italic><sup>-/-</sup> females, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0291 for <italic>npba</italic><sup>+/-</sup> versus <italic>npba</italic><sup>-/-</sup> females, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0162 for wild-type versus <italic>npba</italic><sup>-/-</sup>/<italic>npbb</italic><sup>-/-</sup> females, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0002 for wild-type versus <italic>npbwr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> females: the latency to the wrapping that resulted in spawning; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0129 for <italic>npba</italic><sup>+/+</sup> versus <italic>npba</italic><sup>-/-</sup> females, <italic>p</italic> = 0.1158 for <italic>npba</italic><sup>+/-</sup> versus <italic>npba</italic><sup>-/-</sup> females, <italic>p</italic> = 0.1068 for wild-type versus <italic>npba</italic><sup>-/-</sup>/<italic>npbb</italic><sup>-/-</sup> females, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0006 for wild-type versus <italic>npbwr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> females) (Figure 6C, D and Figure 7B).â has been added.</p><p>2) Materials and methods: âBehavioral time-series data sets were further analyzed using Kaplan-Meier plots with the inclusion of fish that did not spawn within the test period, following Jahn-Eimermacher et al., 2011. Differences between Kaplan-Meier curves were tested for statistical significance using Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroniâs correction.â has been added.</p><p>3) Reference list: the following reference, which is cited in the above text, has been added.</p><p>Jahn-Eimermacher, Lasarzik I, and Raber, 2011.</p><p>4) Legend for Figure 6: â(A, B)â has been added.</p><p>5) Legend for Figure 6: â(C, D) The latency data for <italic>npba</italic> (C) and <italic>npbb</italic> (D) single knockouts were further analyzed using Kaplan-Meier plots.
