In contrast to the extensive studies of feeding, its obligate counterpart, defecation, has received much less attention until recently. In this study, we report our characterizations of the defecation behavior of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae and its neural basis. <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae display defecation cycles of stereotypic frequency, involving sequential contraction of hindgut and anal sphincter. The defecation behavior requires two groups of motor neurons that innervate hindgut and anal sphincter, respectively, and can excite gut muscles directly. These two groups of motor neurons fire sequentially with the same periodicity as the defecation behavior, as revealed by in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. Moreover, we identified a single mechanosensitive sensory neuron that innervates the anal slit and senses the opening of the intestine terminus. This anus sensory neuron relies on the TRP channel NOMPC but not on INACTIVE, NANCHUNG, or PIEZO for mechanotransduction.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03293.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03293.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03293.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In animals, the final stage in the digestion of food is the removal of waste from the body.

It eliminates waste (feces) from the digestive tract via the anus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thomas, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heaton et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lembo and Camilleri, 2003</xref>), an unglamorous but essential body function. Compared to the extensively studied feeding behavior, defecation has received relatively little attention. Malfunction of defecation can lead to constipation and other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lembo and Camilleri, 2003</xref>), and abnormal development of neural circuits governing defecation may underlie birth defects such as Hirschsprung's disease due to elimination of intestinal ganglion cells required for bowel peristalsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Romeo et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Passarge, 2002</xref>), one of the major birth defects of the digestive system afflicting one in 4000 of the population.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae provide a useful model system for the studies of feeding behavior and nutrition intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ikeya et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rulifson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hwangbo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bader et al., 2007</xref>). With an array of feeding assays and powerful genetic tools, these animals have yielded valuable information regarding the basis of the feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhao and Campos, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhatt and Neckameyer, 2013</xref>). However, modulation of defecation behaviors has received much less attention until recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Edgecomb et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cognigni et al., 2011</xref>). Harnessing the experimental resources of this model system for the study of gut movements and the underlying neural basis should also help us understand the mechanisms of the defecation behavior.</p><p>In the larval intestines, peristaltic movements of the digestive tract push food from the anterior towards the posterior end. The rate of flow depends on various signals from gut cells and associated neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benoit and Tracy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schoofs et al., 2009</xref>). In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> two groups of excitatory GABAergic motor neurons have been identified with partially redundant functions in activating enteric muscle cells (EMCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McIntire et al., 1993</xref>). Little is known about the motor control of gut movements in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae or any involvement of sensory neurons for defecation.</p><p>Mechanosensation is essential for many activities of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Studies in adult flies have demonstrated that internal sensory neurons are important in regulating behaviors such as feeding, defecation, and egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2009</xref>). Whereas recent studies have identified mechanosensitive channels in specific sensory neurons in the larval body wall for harsh or gentle touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yan et al., 2013</xref>), whether and how a larva senses stretches of its internal organs is unknown nor have the neurons and channels mediating such mechanosensation been identified.</p><p>In this study we establish <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae as a model system to study defecation behavior by performing studies of larvae 96 hr after egg laying (AEL). First, we show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae exhibit rhythmic cycles of sequential contractions of the hindgut and the anal sphincter to expel feces. Second, we identify the motor neurons that innervate the hindgut and anal sphincter and show that these two groups of neurons fire sequentially with the same periodicity as the defecation cycle. Unexpectedly, we found that a single sensory neuron innervates the anal slit to sense its opening. Finally, we show that the TRP channel NOMPC but not other known mechanosensitive channels in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is required for the mechanosensation of this anus sensory neuron.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sequential contractions and innervations of the hindgut and anus sphincter</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval hindgut is the last part of the intestine, posterior to the Malpighian tubule, on the dorsal side under larval cuticle. At the posterior end of the hindgut is anal sphincter, which has a layer of thick sphincter muscles and a much narrower canal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murakami and Shiotsuki, 2001</xref>). Because the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval body wall is transparent, contractions of the hindgut and anal sphincter can be monitored in vivo. Fluorescent markers, expressed with a hindgut-specific byn-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johansen et al., 2003</xref>), allowed visualization of contractions of the larval hindgut and anus sphincter in whole-mount of living larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The defecation behavior consists of sequential contractions of the posterior hindgut and anal sphincter in a very stereotypical manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>), leading to opening of the anal slit to expel feces out of the lumen. This defecation process is repeated every 38 s at 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To demonstrate those gut movements triggered defecation, we fed the larvae with yeast laced with blue food dye and video taped their defecation cycle. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>, each sequential contraction of hindgut and anus sphincter triggered a defecation cycle to expel feces out of the body.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03293.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The periodical defecation process of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae and the innervation of hindgut and anal sphincter by motor neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Sequential contractions of the posterior hindgut and anal sphincter.

Since the axons that innervate the hindgut are from the most posterior pair of the axon bundles in the ventral nerve cord (VNC), the cell bodies of the neurons that innervate the hindgut and anal sphincter are most likely in the terminal segments of the VNC. We identified two groups of neurons, labeled by PDF-Gal4 and HGN1-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nassel et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Edgecomb et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Renn et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Landgraf et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cognigni et al., 2011</xref>), which innervate the posterior hindgut and anal sphincter, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>). These neurons have their cell bodies in the terminal segments of VNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and send their axons along the midline of the ventral body wall to the posterior end of the larva, where they enter the hindgut. Within the hindgut, the HGN1 axons extend posteriorly to the anus sphincter surface to form dense arborizations over the muscles, while the PDF axons arborize over the posterior two-third of the hindgut with refined branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>). The PDF and HGN1 neurons are glutamatergic, as they could be labeled with antibody staining against <italic>Drosophila</italic> vGlut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daniels et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K,L</xref>). The axonal branches of PDF neurons on the hindgut can also be labeled with vGlut-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mahr and Aberle, 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that they are likely glutamatergic motor neurons. The labeled neurons in both cases have their axon terminals in close proximity of the gut muscles and form abundant bouton structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>). These results suggest that PDF and HGN1 neurons, which are likely motor neurons, might play a role in regulating hindgut contractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Gut muscles receive excitatory input from PDF and HGN1 neurons</title><p>In order to explore the functional connection between HGN1 neurons and anal sphincter muscles, we expressed Channlerhodopsin-2 (ChR2), a light activated cation channel, in the HGN1 neurons and recorded the excitatory junction potentials (EJPs) in the gut muscles before and after activating ChR2 by light. The gut muscles received tonic excitatory inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Due to the fillet recording methods we used to gain access of anus sphincter muscles, this firing pattern might differ from those in intact animals. Illumination of the larval VNC with blue light caused a dramatic increase of EJPs in the anus sphincter muscles in the larva with ChR2 expression in the HGN1 neurons but not in the control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>), providing evidence for HGN1 innervation of sphincter muscles. The PDF neurons have been previously shown to promote visceral muscle contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Talsma et al., 2012</xref>). Activation of PDF neurons expressing ChR2 with blue light also triggered a dramatic increase of EJPs in the anus sphincter muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>), indicating that PDF neurons also play a role in regulating anal sphincter contractions, although PDF neurons do not directly form synapse with these muscles. This light-induced activation was absent in UAS or Gal4 control larvae and dependent on retinal, which is the chromosphere for ChR2 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03293.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Excitatory output from VNC neurons to gut muscles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spontaneous EJP activity of the anus sphincter muscles.

We then imaged the cell bodies of HGN1 neurons in the VNC and found abnormality of their rhythmic firing pattern, which displayed a much longer interval compared to control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that the central neurons in the VNC receive excitatory feedback from ASN to increase motor neuron firing. Together with the GRASP analysis revealing the physical proximity of the processes of ASN and PDF neurons, our results indicate that the sensory neuron in the anus might sense the stretch when the anal slit is open and respond by provide feedback modulation of the PDF neurons and HGN1 neurons in the central nervous system.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>NOMPC is required for mechanotransduction in the ASN</title><p>To search for the putative mechanotransduction channel in the ASN, we examined the defecation behavior of several mechanotransduction channel mutants. We found that the defecation rhythm remains normal in the <italic>iav</italic>, <italic>nan</italic>, and <italic>piezo</italic> mutants. However, the defecation interval in the <italic>nompC</italic> mutants was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). NOMPC is a TRPN channel essential for adult hearing and larval gentle touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yan et al., 2013</xref>). We found that NOMPC is highly expressed all over the dendrites and soma of the ASN, as revealed by staining with antibody against the NOMPC protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), raising the possibility that it might play a role in ASN sensing of radial stretch. Indeed, we found that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response is absent in the ASN of <italic>nompC</italic> null mutant larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref>).

Our study thus identified a new role of the NOMPC channel, namely for sensing redial stretch of the intestinal terminus.

We found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae exhibit periodic defecation cycles, involving sequential contractions of the hindgut and the anal sphincter. We also found two groups of neurons, which innervate the hindgut and anal sphincter respectively, and can excite the hindgut and anal sphincter muscle in a sequential manner. In addition, we found a single sensory neuron that could sense the opening of the anal slit and send feedback to the motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

In this study of the defecation behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, we have identified not only the motor neurons innervating gut muscles but also a sensory neuron strategically located to sense radial stretch during defecation and provide feedback to the central nervous system.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03293.027</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Graphic summary of the motor neurons and a mechanosensitive sensory neuron in the defecation circuitry.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03293.027">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03293.027</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03293-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Different features of larval and adult defecation behaviors</title><p>Previous studies of the defecation behaviors of the adult fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cognigni et al., 2011</xref>) have revealed that its defecation rate is regulated by both the internal state and environment, rather than showing a robust rhythm. However, at the larval stage, the motor neurons and gut muscles as well as the sensory neuron responding to anus movement, all show very robust rhythmic activities. Given that feeding and defecation are dominant behaviors for third-instar larvae, conceivably robust rhythmic feeding and defecation behaviors may facilitate their nutrition intake and waste expulsion. In contrast, adult flies will likely encounter more complex environments and may need to conduct their defection behaviors in a more controllable manner.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mechanosensation involved in the defecation behavior</title><p>Mechanosensation serves a number of important physiological functions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. The radial stretch sensation is a special type of mechanosensation essential for the function of many organs with luminal structures such as the digestive system and the blood vessels. However, how the organs sense radial stretch remains unclear.</p><p>We have identified a sensory neuron that can sense radial stretch with its highly specialized morphology in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. In addition, we found that the TRP channel NOMPC but not other TRP channels tested, such as IAV that is often associated with NOMPC function, is required for normal ASN mechanotransduction. Interestingly, the ASN could be labeled by both class III da neuronal marker and class IV da neuronal maker, raising the question whether it might have the dual functions to sense different stimuli. The ASN may provide a neuronal model to study the distinct and cooperative roles of different channels in a single neuron in the sensing of different intensity of stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>An entry point to study <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval defecation circuitry</title><p>The two motor neurons and the sensory neuron ASN provide an entry point to elucidate defecation circuitry. The two motor neurons appear to be functionally connected, possibly involving synaptic connections between them, although we cannot exclude the possibility of multiple neurons being engaged in their functional connections. It remains to be determined as to how they are entrained with this rhythmic firing pattern, and whether it involves a central pattern generator upstream of PDF neurons. Interestingly, PDF is a peptide that has important roles in multiple neuropeptide signaling pathways in the fruit fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Renn et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2013</xref>); it would be interesting to test whether this neuropeptide also plays a role in the regulation of defecation behaviors by PDF neurons in the VNC. It is also of interest to explore possible contributions of indirect effects of PDF over muscle contraction, such as an influence of tracheal branching in the hindgut that may affect muscle contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Linneweber et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, a study has suggested a novel role of HGN1 neurons in regulating the long-term food intake behaviors of adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Olds and Xu, 2014</xref>). In our study we found that HGN1 neurons control the rhythmic pattern of larval defecation. These two studies suggest that <italic>Drosophila</italic> HGN1 neurons at different developmental stages might have multiple functions in regulating feeding and defecation behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Potential evolutionary conservation of defecation circuitry among different organisms</title><p>Though separated in evolution millions years ago, the structures of <italic>Drosophila</italic> gut and human gut share striking similarity. There are circular and longitudinal muscles lining the gut ending with the anal sphincter that controls defecation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Netter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murakami and Shiotsuki, 2001</xref>). It remains an open question as to the extent of similarity of the mechanisms that control the gut movements. Diseases such as Hirschsprung's disease and anorectal malformation with failure to pass meconium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loening-Baucke and Kimura, 1999</xref>) are caused by developmental abnormality related to the gut and its innervation. Several genes and specific regions on the chromosomes have been shown or suggested to be associated with Hirschsprung's disease. Mutations in two human genes could lead to the absence of certain nerve cells in the colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Puri and Shinkai, 2004</xref>). With the powerful genetic tools, further study of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval gut rhythmicity and its neural modulation will help us identify evolutionarily conserved features as well as strategies that may have been adopted by different organisms for their fitness.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>All the larvae were raised in the normal fly medium (for the light activation assay, 100 µM all-trans retinal was added to the food).

Your article has been evaluated by Vijay Raghavan (Senior editor) and 2 reviewers, one of whom, Howard Baylis, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Senior editor and the two reviewers discussed their comments before we reached the decision that the manuscript needs revisions, and the Senior editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an interesting paper that seeks to define the defecation programme in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae and to identify neuronal and molecular substrates for this behaviour. The paper has three main topics in the results; characterisation of the defecation motor programme, characterisation of three neuronal populations which control hind-gut muscle contractions and identification and characterisation of a neuronal TRP channel involved in mechanosensory feedback. Some of the data is of high quality (e.g. calcium imaging experiments) and the potential finding of a mechanosensitive neuron involved in the process is novel and potentially interesting. The work could have wider implications for understanding defecation and the generation of rhythmic behaviour, but there are substantial concerns with the paper as it stands.</p><p>Contrary to what the manuscript seems to imply, defecation behaviour has been previously studied in flies (see Edgecomb J Exp Biol 1994 and Cognigni et al Cell Metab 2011). In particular, Cognigni et al developed a method that allows quantification of diuresis, enteric function, and food intake, and showed complex dietary and reproductive modulation of some of these features. The characterisation of the neuronal circuitry underlying defecation per se is useful but linking to the above features is of broader interest and should be attempted. Furthermore, contrary to what the authors state, only one of the three neuronal populations that they “identify” is novel in this context, given that: 1) The PDF neurons have been previously shown not only to innervate the hindgut (Nassel et al J Comp Neurol 1993, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Talsma et al 2012</xref> PNAS), and also to promote visceral muscle contractions (Talsma et al PNAS 2012), and 2) The RN2 neurons have also been shown to innervate the hindgut and to regulate faecal output (Cognigni et al Cell Metab 2011, line referred to as HGN1-Gal4). [The authors should refer to the HGN1-Gal4 as this will allow other workers to connect the two studies.]</p><p>Both the Abstract and the body of the manuscript contain over-interpretations of the data and important omissions of previously published data. These need to be addressed in a revised manuscript. A revised manuscript should also show that what is being examined is indeed a circuit and that it controls actual defecation (as opposed to subtly modulating muscle contractions of the hind-gut). The experiments suggested below are achievable in a reasonable timeframe of about three months if the authors have the tools to manipulate those neurons with cellular resolution (all three drivers are much more broadly expressed so the observed behavioural effects, if any, could be secondary to interfering with all those other neurons). Substantial points are elaborated and listed below.</p><p>Characterization of “defecation behaviour” and its rhythmicity. The authors infer, but never show, effects of these neurons on defecation based on their effects on hindgut muscle contractions. Defecation rate could be subject to additional layers of neuronal control involving both visceral and somatic muscles, so the authors would need to show that these neurons do regulate defecation by, for example, using Fluoropoo (Cognigni et al Cell Metab 2011) if it works in larvae or by loading larval guts with dye-supplemented yeast and then recording defecation rate on unlabelled yeast. Related to this, the authors often make statements about defecation “rhythms/cycles” akin to those reported in C. elegans. These are based, as far as one can tell, on the rhythmic Ca2+ oscillations observed in resting PDF and RN2 neurons. However, the muscle recordings are not particularly rhythmic in resting conditions, and no evidence for rhythmic defecation events has been provided. For example, the pattern of EJPs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> is described as rhythmic, however whilst it looks sporadic it does not look overtly rhythmic, analysis should be performed to support this statement and in support of a correlation between hind-gut contraction and defecation itself. Previously published data (Edgecomb J Exp Biol 1994 and Cognigni et al Cell Metab 2011) argues against a robust rhythm at least in adults, where defecation rate is regulated by both environmental (e.g. dietary content) and internal (e.g. reproductive) state. Thus, the conditions in which rhythmic defecation is observed should be precisely described.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> which describes defecation data is not clear. What is being measured? The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> is described as hind-gut contraction, but 3A is simply described as “defecation” in the text. “Defecation” is too vague in this context, the exact step that is being measured needs to be defined. If the two measurements are the same thing, which one would hope, then the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref> should be presented using the same measure, i.e. either both should be period in seconds or both should be defecation per period. This reflects a need as mentioned above to give precise details of the behavioural assays and data.</p><p>Gut peristalsis and defecation rate may vary depending on the larval stage. The authors seem to do all their experiments in L3 larva. Were these early, post-feeding, post critical weight or wandering L3s? Quantifications would need to be confined to one of these substages or data should be provided showing no differences between substages. Again there is a need for precise details of the behavioural assay and data.</p><p>Loss and gain-of-function phenotypes of PDF and RN2 neurons. Loss-of-function experiments were carried out constitutively throughout embryonic and larval development using Pdf-Gal4 and RN2-Gal4. Both drivers are expressed in other neurons that, when inactivated, could affect behaviours (e.g. feeding, circadian) that could indirectly impact gut movements (Thus, getting these experiments done at cellular resolution is important). Importantly, PDF has been shown to regulate tracheal branching in the hindgut, which could also affect muscle contractions (Linneweber et al Cell 2014). In the GoF muscle physiology experiments, no “raw” data has been provided for PDF neurons, and different experiments seem to have been conducted for the two neuronal populations. Only one control seems to have been used for the ChR2 experiments – several are normally required (+/- all-trans retinal, Gal4 and UAS parental controls). More details would also have to be provided about quantifications (how are the effects of tissue compression on fluorescence controlled? The hindgut diameter should become smaller. How would the ROI remain the same if the gut is actively contracting?).</p><p>The authors state that both PDF and RN2 neurons are motor neurons, based on comparisons with the gut innervation seen using VGLUT-Gal4. This is unconvincing. The authors should show the positions of the PDF, RN2 and OK371 axons on the hindgut muscles side by side, and use a broad neuronal marker like 22c10 to co-label the major nerves. What functional data shows a motor rather than neuromodulatory role for these neurons, especially for PDF?</p><p>The role of RN2 (see above too) is unclear. Activation of RN2 by ChR2 causes EJPs in the anal sphincter. This is the only direct evidence for the proposed role of RN2 as exciting the anal sphincter muscles. Other evidence suggests a more complex situation, ablation of RN2 does not prevent sphincter opening but does act additively with ablation of PDF on hindgut contraction period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, also see comments re <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> below). So does RN2 activation, by ChR2, alone have an effect on hind gut peristalsis? This data should be added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>.</p><p>The sequential firing is very neat. There are several experimental predictions that come from this. One is that activation of PDF by ChR2 should induce anal muscle contraction (via RN2), data should therefore be included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> on the anal sphincter muscle contraction when PDF is activated by ChR2. Similarly activation of PDF by ChR2 would be expected to give rise to anal sphincter EJPs. Another expectation is that inactivation of PDF may result in no Ca2+ signals in RN2, this could be tested by combining available reagents. Finally would it also be possible to test whether activation of PDF using ChR2 led to calcium signals in RN2?</p><p>The authors seem to have used HGN1-Gal4 to label the RN2 neurons. As described in Cognigni et al, HGN1-Gal4 is a particular line (the D insertion) resulting from mobilizing the initial RN2-Gal4 (Landgraf et al). This is an important distinction because other RN2-Gal4 lines are either expressed more broadly, or are not expressed in those hindgut-innervating neurons and HGN1-Gal4 should be used in the text as this will allow other workers to connect the two studies.</p><p>The data showing that PDF neurons are presynaptic to RN2 is not very convincing (especially the sytGFP/Denmark figure) - both neurons could be putting out dendrites in the same VNC region in order to respond to the same presynaptic partner.</p><p>The sensory role of the ASN is potentially interesting, but there is no data linking that particular ppk neuron (as opposed to other ppk+ neurons) with the hindgut muscle contraction phenotypes and/or defecation control. The authors could use the elegant approach previously used by this lab (Yang et al Neuron 2009, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>) to strengthen this link.</p><p>ASN is identified as sensory neuron providing mechanosensory feedback from the anus. ASN shows periodic Ca2+ oscillations. These correlate to the opening of the anus and activity in PDF and RN2, however no functional test of the hypothesis that ASN activation lies downstream of PDF, RN2 and anal opening is shown. One experiment would be to show that inactivation of PDF results in a loss of Ca2+ signals in ASN. A more positive experiment would be to show that activation of RN2 (using ChR2 or dTRPA1) in turn activates ASN. The feedback experiments use a very indirect test of feedback onto PDF and/or RN2, EJPs in the anal sphincter muscles. This may be acting through ASN-PDF-RN2-anal sphincter muscle series. However there are other explanations, in particular it does not rule out other routes of ASN feedback onto the anal sphincter muscles. It would be much better to test the effect of ASN activity more directly on PDF. For example do NOMPC mutants have changes in PDF Ca2+ signals, which are alleviated by NOMPC rescue in ASN? Does ablation of ASN change PDF calcium signals? Even better would be activation of ASN and direct measurement of signals in PDF. This would add significant weight to the argument that ASN is a functional modify of PDF properties.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03293.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Major additions and changes made in the revised paper:</p><p>1<bold>)</bold> We have extensively cited the work on adult fly defecation (Cognigni et al., Cell Metab 2011) and clarified the correspondence of our RN2-Gal4 with HGN1-Gal4 by using the latter terminology in the revised manuscript.

We have clarified this point by rephrasing the descriptions of the EJP recordings and making note of the likely difference in firing patterns observed in fillet preparations compared to intact animals in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Previously published data (Edgecomb J Exp Biol 1994 and Cognigni et al Cell Metab 2011) argues against a robust rhythm at least in adults, where defecation rate is regulated by both environmental (e.g. dietary content) and internal (e.g. reproductive) state. Thus, the conditions in which rhythmic defecation is observed should be precisely described</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the suggestion of the referees. We think the defecation behaviors in larvae could exhibit a more robust rhythm, which is different from that in adult flies, possibly because larvae spend the majority of their time consuming food to sustain their rapid growth whereas adult flies may need to command greater control of their feeding and defecation behaviors to cope with a more complex environment. It is very possible that larval defecation behavior is also modulated by other cues; however, exploration of such modulation is beyond the scope of this study which focuses on neuronal control of rhythmic defecation cycles. We have also discussed this point and compared the larval and adult fly behaviors in the revised text.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>which describes defecation data is not clear. What is being measured? The data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3b</italic></xref> <italic>is described as hind-gut contraction, but 3A is simply described as “defecation” in the text. “Defecation” is too vague in this context, the exact step that is being measured needs to be defined. If the two measurements are the same thing, which one would hope, then the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3A and B</italic></xref> <italic>should be presented using the same measure, i.e. either both should be period in seconds or both should be defecation per period. This reflects a need as mentioned above to give precise details of the behavioural assays and data</italic>.</p><p>We thank the referees for pointing out this issue. We have clarified this in the revised text and added more details on methods of behavioral test and analysis. Also, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> annotations have been modified to provide more accurate descriptions of the results. We have also provided more details on behavioral assays in the Methods section.</p><p>The reason we used gut contraction time as a measurement in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> was that larvae with both PDF and HGN1 neurons silenced showed very little gut movements. This made it hard to quantify the gut contraction by measuring defecation intervals. We have made this point more clearly in the revised text.</p><p><italic>Gut peristalsis and defecation rate may vary depending on the larval stage. The authors seem to do all their experiments in L3 larva. Were these early, post-feeding, post critical weight or wandering L3s? Quantifications would need to be confined to one of these substages or data should be provided showing no differences between substages. Again there is a need for precise details of the behavioural assay and data</italic>.</p><p>Throughout our experiment, we used larvae 96 hrs AEL. They are at active feeding stage. We have spelled it out in our revised text.</p><p><italic>Loss and gain-of-function phenotypes of PDF and RN2 neurons. Loss-of-function experiments were carried out constitutively throughout embryonic and larval development using Pdf-Gal4 and RN2-Gal4. Both drivers are expressed in other neurons that, when inactivated, could affect behaviours (e.g. feeding, circadian) that could indirectly impact gut movements (Thus, getting these experiments done at cellular resolution is important). Importantly, PDF has been shown to regulate tracheal branching in the hindgut, which could also affect muscle contractions (Linneweber et al Cell 2014). In the GoF muscle physiology experiments, no “raw” data has been provided for PDF neurons, and different experiments seem to have been conducted for the two neuronal populations. Only one control seems to have been used for the ChR2 experiments - several are normally required (+/ - all-trans retinal, Gal4 and UAS parental controls). More details would also have to be provided about quantifications (how are the effects of tissue compression on fluorescence controlled? The hindgut diameter should become smaller. How would the ROI remain the same if the gut is actively contracting?)</italic>.</p><p>Loss-of-function experiments were carried out with reagents that are currently available. PDF-Gal4 was the Gal4 line with the most restricted expression pattern for those neurons. Although we weren’t able to reach single cell resolution, our data support the notion that PDF and HGN1 neurons in the VNC are important for larval defecation. We have spelled out the caveats concerning the broader expression patterns of Gal4 lines in Discussion.</p><p>We have tried to study the connectivity specificity between PDF neurons and hindgut muscles but failed to do so due to the special structure of hindguts. They only have a very thin layer of muscles, which tend to be more vigorously contracting even in a fillet preparation. We were unable to achieve stable intracellular recording of hindguts as we have done for anus sphincter muscles. However, we managed to activate PDF via ChR2 and induce anal muscle contraction, similar to what was done in HGN1&gt;ChR2 larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Recording of anal sphincter in PDF&gt;ChR2 larvae revealed that PDF neuron activation gave rise to anal sphincter muscle EJPs (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>). These results suggested PDF neurons also regulate anal sphincter movement, probably via HGN1 neurons.</p><p>We have added the data of control experiments (+/- all-trans retinal, Gal4 and UAS parental controls) to the figures.</p><p>We have also provided more details about the quantification of this behavior.</p><p><italic>The authors state that both PDF and RN2 neurons are motor neurons, based on comparisons with the gut innervation seen using VGLUT-Gal4. This is unconvincing. The authors should show the positions of the PDF, RN2 and OK371 axons on the hindgut muscles side by side, and use a broad neuronal marker like 22c10 to co-label the major nerves</italic>. <italic>What functional data shows a motor rather than neuromodulatory role for these neurons, especially for PDF?</italic></p><p>We have performed additional experiments to address this question:</p><p>For PDF neurons: We carried out anti-vGlut staining on hindgut and found the PDF axons are vGlut positive (in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). We also used vGlut-Gal4 to label motor neurons and found they labeled the same group of axons that are marked by PDF-Gal4 (in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>). These data suggest that PDF neurons are likely motor neurons.</p><p>For HGN1 neurons: We have found the HGN1 axons over anal sphincter are vGlut positive (in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Together with the functional study of connection between HGN1 neurons and anus sphincter muscles, these data suggest that HGN1 neurons are motor neurons.</p><p>Additionally, we have performed imaging and whole-cell recording of HGN1 neurons in dissected VNC, which were devoid of sensory inputs. We observed a robust rhythmic activity for HGN1 neurons. HGN1 neurons also exhibited burst firing patterns, which is a feature for fly motor neurons (in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>These new data have been integrated into our revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>The role of RN2 (see above too) is unclear. Activation of RN2 by ChR2 causes EJPs in the anal sphincter. This is the only direct evidence for the proposed role of RN2 as exciting the anal sphincter muscles. Other evidence suggests a more complex situation, ablation of RN2 does not prevent sphincter opening but does act additively with ablation of PDF on hindgut contraction period (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>, also see comments re</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>below). So does RN2 activation, by ChR2, alone have an effect on hind gut peristalsis? This data should be added to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref>.</p><p>We have monitored the contraction of hindgut while stimulating HGN1 neurons using a setup similar to the one we used to observe the contraction of anus sphincter. We found activation of HGN1 neurons had no effect on hindgut movement (in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the question why “ablation of HGN1 does not prevent sphincter opening but does act additively with ablation of PDF on hindgut contraction period”, one speculation is that the remaining PDF neurons can still trigger hindgut contractions, which generate pressure and push the feces along the intestine to induce passive sphincter opening. We have included possible explanation in the revised text.</p><p><italic>The sequential firing is very neat. There are several experimental predictions that come from this. One is that activation of PDF by ChR2 should induce anal muscle contraction (via RN2), data should therefore be included in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref> <italic>on the anal sphincter muscle contraction when PDF is activated by ChR2. Similarly activation of PDF by ChR2 would be expected to give rise to anal sphincter EJPs. Another expectation is that inactivation of PDF may result in no Ca2+ signals in RN2, this could be tested by combining available reagents</italic>. <italic>Finally would it also be possible to test whether activation of PDF using ChR2 led to calcium signals in RN2?</italic></p><p>We used PDF-Gal4 to drive ChR2 in PDF neurons and stimulated these neurons with blue light. We found that activation of PDF via ChR2 induced anal muscle contraction, similar to what was observed in HGN1&gt;ChR2 larvae (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Recording of anal sphincter in PDF&gt;ChR2 larvae revealed that PDF neuron activation gave rise to anal sphincter muscle EJPS (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>).</p><p><italic>The authors seem to have used HGN1-Gal4 to label the RN2 neurons. As described in Cognigni et al, HGN1-Gal4 is a particular line (the D insertion) resulting from mobilizing the initial RN2-Gal4 (Landgraf et al). This is an important distinction because other RN2-Gal4 lines are either expressed more broadly, or are not expressed in those hindgut-innervating neurons and HGN1-Gal4 should be used in the text as this will allow other workers to connect the two studies</italic>.</p><p>We have replaced RN2 with HGN1 throughout the manuscripts. We agree with the referees that the latter terminology will help the readers to connect our study with the previous work in the adult system.</p><p>The data showing that PDF neurons are presynaptic to RN2 is not very convincing (especially the sytGFP/Denmark figure) - both neurons could be putting out dendrites in the same VNC region in order to respond to the same presynaptic partner.</p><p>We have modified the text in the revised manuscript accordingly. For now we don’t have enough evidence to show PDF neurons are direct pre-synaptic partner of HGN1 neurons even though their aborizations overlap intensely. Based on our functional study (dual-imaging of the two groups of neurons), they are likely two components within the defecation motor circuitry where PDF neurons fire shortly before the firing of HGN1 neurons.</p><p><italic>The sensory role of the ASN is potentially interesting, but there is no data linking that particular ppk neuron (as opposed to other ppk+ neurons) with the hindgut muscle contraction phenotypes and/or defecation control. The authors could use the elegant approach previously used by this lab (Yang et al Neuron 2009,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Fig 3</italic></xref><italic>) to strengthen this link</italic>.</p><p>The method suggested by the referees would provide one test as to whether ASN itself is important for the defecation. With the reagents currently available, the experiment we could do is to use 19-12-Gal4/UAS-Kir to silence all class III da neurons and PPK-Gal80 to suppress the silencing effect in ASN (19-12-Gal4 and PPK-Gal4 only overlap in the ASN). However, this would generate indirect evidence.</p><p>We used an alternative and more direct approach instead. We labeled all PPK neurons with PPK-Gal4 and used 2-photon laser to specifically ablate the ASN soma near the anal slit. Then we imaged the HGN1 neurons to see if ablation of ASN altered the activity of HGN1 neurons. Indeed, we found alteration of the periodicity of rhythmic firing of HGN1 neurons (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K and L</xref>).</p><p>The result supports the conclusion that ASN (a particular PPK neuron) but not other PPK neurons modulates motor control of gut movements.</p><p><italic>ASN is identified as sensory neuron providing mechanosensory feedback from the anus. ASN shows periodic Ca2+ oscillations. These correlate to the opening of the anus and activity in PDF and RN2, however no functional test of the hypothesis that ASN activation lies downstream of PDF, RN2 and anal opening is shown. One experiment would be to show that inactivation of PDF results in a loss of Ca2+ signals in ASN. A more positive experiment would be to show that activation of RN2 (using ChR2 or dTRPA1) in turn activates ASN. The feedback experiments use a very indirect test of feedback onto PDF and/or RN2, EJPs in the anal sphincter muscles. This may be acting through ASN-PDF-RN2-anal sphincter muscle series. However there are other explanations, in particular it does not rule out other routes of ASN feedback onto the anal sphincter muscles. It would be much better to test the effect of ASN activity more directly on PDF. For example do NOMPC mutants have changes in PDF Ca2+ signals, which are alleviated by NOMPC rescue in ASN? Does ablation of ASN change PDF calcium signals? Even better would be activation of ASN and direct measurement of signals in PDF. This would add significant weight to the argument that ASN is a functional modify of PDF properties</italic>.</p><p>We agree that recording from gut muscles while stimulating ASN didn’t provide direct evidence that ASN feedback to PDF and HGN1 neurons. Hence we carried out experiments using new strategies in order to show that ASN does send feedback to PDF and HGN1 when it receives mechanical stimulus. We imaged PDF neurons and HGN1 neurons with GCaMP5 while inserting a tapered glass probe to the anus slit and advanced it to split the anus sphincter, which mimicked anus opening during defecation. We found that PDF and HGN1 neurons responded to this stimulation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). As a control experiment to show that this probe stimulation activates ASN but not other PPK neurons, we imaged PPK neurons’ axonal projection in the VNC. Stimulation with a probe on the anus induced an asymmetric Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase in the VNC (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>), which is consistent with asymmetric projection of ASN axons to the VNC.</p><p>This result, together with the previous GRASP experiments between ASN and PDF neurons, support our model that ASN provide feedback to motor neurons.</p></body></sub-article></article>
