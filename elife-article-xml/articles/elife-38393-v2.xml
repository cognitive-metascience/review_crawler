Most have focused on cell-intrinsic gene functions and mechanisms. Much less is known about how transformed, or otherwise functionally disrupted, cells interact with healthy ones toward a favorable or pathological outcome. This is largely due to technical limitations. We developed new genetic tools in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> that permit efficient multiplexed gain- and loss-of-function genetic perturbations with separable spatial and temporal control. Importantly, our novel tool-set is independent of the commonly used GAL4/UAS system, freeing the latter for additional, non-autonomous, genetic manipulations; and is built into a single strain, allowing one-generation interrogation of non-autonomous effects. Altogether, our design opens up efficient genome-wide screens on any deleterious phenotype, once plasmid or genome engineering is used to place the desired miRNA(s) or ORF(s) into our genotype. Specifically, we developed tools to study extrinsic effects on neural tumor growth but the strategy presented has endless applications within and beyond neurobiology, and in other model organisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell non-autonomous effects</kwd><kwd>reproducible tumor</kwd><kwd>neural stem cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Development Fellowship to Rita Sousa-Nunes</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sousa-Nunes</surname><given-names>Rita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel genetic strategy for induction of reproducible neural tumors (or any other deleterious phenotype) in a single <italic>Drosophila</italic> stock (applicable to other organisms).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite numerous and versatile genetic mosaic strategies available for genetically amenable model organism <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, none up to now was suited for efficient large-scale screening for cell non-autonomous effects on a developmentally deleterious genotype. Given the requirement for combinations of genetic manipulations, non-autonomous effects are more challenging to investigate yet well known to play crucial roles in development and disease contexts such as cancer. The challenge applies to any tissue but is particularly evident in the central nervous system (CNS) due to diversity of cell types and uniqueness of each lineage with respect to gene expression, size, projection patterns, as well as lethality frequently associated with their disruption. A much needed, transformative, new tool would be: (i) a viable parental stock in which (ii) chosen individual lineages could be (iii) triggered to assume a deleterious genotype (iv) with temporal control (v) from which point they would become permanently labeled by a reporter and (vi) with which a single cross to existing stocks would produce progeny with genetically perturbed cell types of interest other than the labeled lineages. To illustrate in our specific case: no available genetic tool allowed large-scale screening for non-autonomous effects on neural tumor growth as animals harbouring neural tumors cannot be kept as a stable stock.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> has been a canvas for pioneering mosaic tools, at the heart of which lie heterologous binary systems for transcriptional activation or recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Griffin et al., 2014</xref>). Transcriptional activation systems include the yeast transcription factor GAL4 and its binding site, named Upstream Activating Sequence (UAS); the bacterial LexA/LexA Operator (LexAop); and the fungal QF/QUAS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yagi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Potter et al., 2010</xref>). Recombination systems include the bacteriophage Cre recombinase and its loxP target; the yeast Flippase/Flippase Recognition Target sites (FLP/FRT) and its variant mFLP5/mFRT71; and other yeast recombinases (KD, R, B2, and B3) and their cognate recognition sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Golic and Lindquist, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Siegal and Hartl, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hadjieconomou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nern et al., 2011</xref>). The modularity of binary systems grants them combinatorial flexibility, and ingenious Boolean logic gates between recombination and transcriptional activation/silencing systems have expanded their applications (eg., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Struhl and Basler, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee and Luo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Griffin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yagi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hadjieconomou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hampel et al., 2011</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Awasaki et al., 2014</xref>). Binary systems have been extensively employed to perform large-scale screens using publically available UAS libraries to provide molecular understanding into numerous conserved cell intrinsic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">St Johnston, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawakami et al., 2016</xref>). Genome-wide screens remain to be applied to extrinsic processes modifying an adverse genotype.</p><p>We wished to determine the effects of microenvironment or systemic cues on tumor progression. To this end we needed to generate reproducible neural tumors in order to quantitatively assess growth. Tumor reproducibility requires control over lineage, induction time and consistency of levels of downregulation of tumor-suppressors and/or upregulation of oncogenes. We therefore aimed at generating tumors in restricted lineage subsets with a fast inducing event in parental (F0) animals, independently of GAL4/UAS so that we might employ this binary system (for which most modules exist in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, including for near genome-wide gain- and loss-of-function, readily available to the community) to cause non-autonomous perturbations on F1 progeny. Due to possible fate transformations and expression-level variations of regulatory sequences, we wanted tumors to become irreversibly labeled under the control of a ubiquitous and strong regulatory sequence from the time of induction. Various but not all of these features can be achieved with suppressible/inducible LexA, Q and FLP systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weigmann and Cohen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yagi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Riabinina et al., 2015</xref>). Maintenance of an F0 stock with capacity for tumor induction requires suppression of the deleterious genotype until desired. However, whilst the lexA<sup>GAD</sup> derivative (superscript indicating the GAL4 activation domain) can be suppressed by GAL80, it is not compatible with continuous non-autonomous gene inductions via GAL4 as these would also be affected. Also, alleviation of QF suppression by quinic acid, or estrogen induction of FLP<sup>EBD</sup> (superscript indicating an estrogen-binding domain) requires ingestion and metabolization of the effector molecule, resulting in relatively long induction kinetics and variability, thus impairing reproducibility in the fast-developing fly tumor models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weigmann and Cohen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Potter et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our design presented achieves the desired features via the employment of two very efficient transcriptional termination sequences (STOP cassettes) upstream of an oncogenic sequence and reporter. Each STOP cassette is flanked by recombinase target sequences selective for two distinct recombinases, one constitutively expressed in selected lineages, conferring spatial specificity; the other whose expression is induced by heat-shock (hs), conferring rapid temporal resolution. We tested and refined the new genetic tools by recapitulating two well-established <italic>Drosophila</italic> neural tumor models, one generated by downregulation of the homeodomain transcription factor Prospero (Pros), which can lead to tumorigenesis in all neural lineages (of which there are around 100 per central brain lobe); another by downregulation of the NHL-domain protein Brain tumor (Brat), whose depletion leads to tumorigenesis specifically in so-called type II lineages (of which there are eight per brain lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2010</xref>). Starting from the units presented here our design can be multiplexed beyond two to produce further spatial intersections, or multiple temporal steps, along with any assemblies of gene expression downstream (downregulation and/or upregulation, plus reporter labeling). This strategy is therefore of broad interest, applicable to other tissues, organisms and biological questions, opening-up large-scale screening for non-autonomous effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>FOFO</italic> tool design features</title><p>Key to the design of this tumor-generating tool is that expression of deleterious sequences by the ubiquitous strong <italic>actin5C</italic> promoter, was blocked by not one (as commonly done), but two stringent STOP cassettes. Each STOP cassette was flanked by the selective recombination sites FRT and mFRT71, specifically recognized by FLP and mFLP5, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hadjieconomou et al., 2011</xref>). We called this design ‘FOFO’, for Flp-Out-mFlp5-Out. The prediction was that expression would be unblocked only in the presence of the two Flippases, with spatiotemporal control achieved by lineage-restricted expression of FLP and hs-induction of mFLP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38393.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FOFO design and application.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) FOFO construct design: the actin5C promoter is blocked from inducing transcript expression by two efficient transcriptional terminator (STOP) cassettes. Each of these is flanked by FRT or mFRT71, specifically recognized by FLP and mFLP5, respectively. Therefore, miRs and EGFP will only be expressed in cells containing the two flippases. Spatial and temporal control is achieved by providing a spatially restricted FLP and hs-induced mFLP5. SD, splice donor; SA, splice acceptor. Following excision of the <italic>fushi tarazu</italic> (<italic>ftz</italic>) intron, miRs are processed without detriment to reporter expression. Gypsy insulators minimize position effects whilst enhancing expression levels; attB sites allow site-specific insertion into attP-containing host strains. (<bold>b</bold>) Schematic of FOFO application. With the insertion sites chosen for this study, flies of the following genotype can be generated: <italic>enhancer-FLP; hs-mFLP5, FOFO-EGFP; enhancer2-GAL4</italic> (exemplifying with the GAL4 transgene on the third chromosome, though it could be placed elsewhere). Expression of deleterious sequences (either knock-down by miRs or overexpression alongside the reporter by means of T2A) can be induced (by heat-shock) in a single fly stock (without need to cross) carrying FOFO, a lineage-specific enhancer1-FLP and hs-mFLP5. The point is then to add in the same flies (F0 generation) a GAL4 transgene (enhancer2-GAL4) and cross to UAS responders. The FOFO containing stock expresses FLP in the spatially restricted domain defined by enhancer1 (yellow) in a tissue represented by the grey shape. FLP expression will constitutively excise the first STOP cassette but the presence of a second STOP cassette precludes expression of anything downstream unless flies are subject to hs. The F1 progeny expresses a transgene (purple) in the GAL4-expressing domain defined by enhancer2 (black). Following hs, mFLP5 expression leads to excision of the second STOP cassette and thus expression of miRs and EGFP in the domain covered by the lineage-specific enhancer. Even if the domain of the latter overlaps with that of enhancer2 as depicted, GAL4 miRs will delete GAL4 expression in the EGFP-expressing domain so that the GAL4 domain never overlaps with that of enhancer1 and only cell nonautonomous effects are assessed.

EGFP-labeled neural tumors (green) are generated within brain lobes (grey shape) in a stock also carrying a GAL4 expressed in glia (purple).

Multicistronic expression of oncogenic and reporter proteins can be easily achieved by sandwiching T2A peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">González et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diao and White, 2012</xref>) codons between coding sequences (cds). We therefore focused on achieving a layout that reconciled strong reporter expression with gene downregulation by short hairpin artificial microRNAs (miRs). Artificial miRs consist of 21 bp sequences designed for RNA interference, embedded into a sequence backbone of a naturally occurring miR; they are very effective in downregulating gene expression (more so than long double-stranded RNAs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ni et al., 2011</xref>), can be transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2004</xref>), and can be concatenated for synergistic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). We placed the EGFP cds downstream of an intron as this increases transcript expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haley et al., 2010</xref>) and has the additional advantage of being able to host miRs without disrupting transcript stability by their processing, unlike when miRs are placed in the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bejarano et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Wishing to study strictly cell non-autonomous effects employing the GAL4/UAS system, we included miRs targeting GAL4 as well as those targeting a tumor suppressor (two miRs per target). Therefore, if the GAL4 expression domain overlapped with the tumor domain, GAL4 would be silenced within the tumor. miRs targeting the neural tumor suppressors <italic>pros</italic> or <italic>brat</italic> were used for tumor induction and those targeting CD2 were used as control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). To minimize position effects and enhance expression, all constructs generated for this study were flanked by gypsy insulators and integrated into the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome by PhiC3-mediated transgenesis, selecting sites reported to produce low basal and high induced expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Markstein et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The utility of this design lies in its combination with two distinct Flippases plus a desired GAL4 transgene in a single organism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,F0</xref> left). Once assembled, this stock can then be crossed to any other carrying a UAS-transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,F0</xref> right). The spatially restricted FLP will excise the first STOP cassette with a domain reproducibility that depends on enhancer reliability and strength as well as efficacy of the excision activity. In any case, neither reporter nor deleterious sequences should be expressed due to the additional STOP cassette. Consequently, until heat-shock, F0 and its F1 progeny should contain a single mFLP5-Out cassette within the FLP-expressing domain. F1 should also express the UAS-transgene in the GAL4 domain, and not express the miRs or reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,F1</xref> left). Following F1 heat-shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,F1</xref> middle), the mFRT71-flanked STOP cassette should be excised (without spatial constraints, its efficacy depending on heat-shock duration); following which the miRs and reporter can be expressed but only within the FLP-expressing domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,F1</xref> right). If the GAL4 domain overlaps with the FLP spatial domain (as schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), strictly non-autonomous effects can still be studied since GAL4 expression will be wiped-out therein by the GAL4<italic><sup>miRs</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,F1</xref> right). A more naturalistic schematic illustrating brain tumours and GAL4 driven in all glia is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Efficacy of STOP cassettes</title><p>Central to the success of this strategy is the efficacy of the STOP cassettes. For each, we used tandem transcriptional terminators, as others before us. Whereas some degree of STOP leakiness can be afforded to simply label cells or to generate a deleterious genetic perturbation by means of a cross, it is absolutely incompatible with our aim of harbouring a ‘locked’ deleterious perturbation within a stable stock. We tested a few transcriptional terminators until we obtained the tightly controlled expression necessary.</p><p>Removal of the <italic>lamin</italic> cds from the STOP cassette used in Flybow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hadjieconomou et al., 2011</xref>) resulted in failure to terminate transcription despite concatenated <italic>hsp70Aa</italic> and <italic>hsp27</italic> terminators, seen by EGFP expression in the absence of Flippase (data not shown). In contrast, concatenation of <italic>hsp70Bb</italic> and <italic>SV40</italic> terminators, successfully precluded unintended EGFP expression. We therefore created a version of FOFO (FOFO1.0) with the two STOPs identical to the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). FOFO1.0 was tested with publicly available stocks of FLP and mFLP5 both under the control of the strong hs promoter. Encouragingly, in the presence of both hs-FLP and hs-mFLP5 and only after hs, extensive patches of EGFP were observed in all transgenics (<italic>FOFO1.0-CD2<sup>miRs</sup>-GAL4<sup>miRs</sup></italic>, <italic>FOFO1.0-pros<sup>miRs</sup>-GAL4<sup>miRs</sup></italic> and <italic>FOFO1.0-brat<sup>miRs</sup>-GAL4<sup>miRs</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>); occasional single cells labeled with EGFP could be seen in the absence of hs (average of 0.3 per brain lobe; n = 240 pooling data for FOFO1.0 and FOFO2.0 carrying <italic>CD2<sup>miRs</sup></italic>, <italic>pros<sup>miRs</sup></italic> or <italic>brat<sup>miRs</sup></italic> with no significant difference between genotypes). Furthermore, only in the presence of the oncogenic miRs were ectopic neural stem cells (NSCs) observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> white-boxed insets: note NSC density within EGFP patches in brains expressing oncogenic miRs versus controls).

Because this was never seen in the absence of hs it was a Flippase-dependent process, likely due to inefficient termination of Pol II following excision of only one of the STOP cassettes. We concluded that our design, containing phenotype-inducing miRs ~ 200 bp downstream of STOP cassettes, was a sensitive reporter of Pol II readthrough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Proudfoot, 2016</xref>) and that this STOP cassette was unsuitable for our purpose.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38393.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>FOFO1.0 versus FOFO2.0.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) FOFO.1.0 and FOFO2.0 differ in their STOP cassettes (drawn roughly to scale unlike remainder of construct); shapes are colour-coded as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>.

Because of the report that mFLP5 can act on FRT sequences at low frequency but not the converse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hadjieconomou et al., 2011</xref>), we used FLP for constitutive spatial control (lineage-specific <italic>enhancer-FLP</italic>) and mFLP5 for transiently induced temporal control (<italic>hs-mFLP5</italic>). Few lineage-specific FLP lines are currently available so we set out to generate some suited for our purpose.

Induction of <italic>pros</italic> or <italic>brat</italic> tumors requires that these neural tumor suppressors be downregulated in progenitors, not in differentiated progeny. We thus screened selected GAL4 lines for the ability to induce supernumerary NSCs (inferred by larger reporter gene domain) when crossed to <italic>pros<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> – a functional screen for expression in neural progenitors.

Downregulation of <italic>pros</italic> should induce supernumerary NSCs in all central brain lineages (type I or II), whereas downregulation of <italic>brat</italic> should induce supernumerary NSCs only in type II. Furthermore, because we aimed to generate lines to induce an irreversible intrachromosomal recombination event, it was relevant to check not only expression at a particular timepoint but the ‘complete’ expression pattern from onset, permanently reported by a FLP-out event.

This indicates that FLP can cross-react with very low frequency with non-cognate mFRT71 sites (overall frequency of ~0.04% based on the number of such clones within the ~100 neural lineages per central brain; INPs were not included in this calculation, accounting for which would result in an even lower frequency).

Concerning reproducibility, in the first instance, we were looking for symmetry between brain lobes, suggestive of near-complete extent of recombination within the enhancer domain. The heat-shock regime that led to best tumor reproducibility in this regard was a double pulse of 1.5 hr each, with the first at the end of embryogenesis and a second during L1 (when brain NSCs are still quiescent), thus providing two doses of mFLP5 ~24 hr apart without intervening NSC divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

We demonstrate successful combination of novel FLP/FOFO tools with GAL4/UAS and efficacious GAL4 knock-down within domains of FLP/mFLP5 and GAL4 intersection. This validates our tool for independent genetic manipulations in strictly non-overlapping domains, which is transformative for the study of cell non-autonomous effects. Our design opens up for the first time the ability to perform efficient genome-wide screening for non-autonomous effects on deleterious genotypes.</p><p>We show that employment of 4 miRs is efficacious and permits simultaneous downregulation of multiple genes in the labeled domain; furthermore, T2A sequences can be added for simultaneous overexpression of coding sequences in addition to that for a reporter. The system can be used also to refine spatial domains, intersecting various enhancer-recombinases (in addition or not to hs control).</p><p>The sensitivity of our design (with miR expression inducing a readily detectable and quantifiable phenotype even in non-labeled cells) allowed us to define STOP cassettes appropriate to curb even short Pol II readthrough. The discrete number of progenitors from which tumors are initiated provided a convenient platform to quantify Flippase cross-reaction and revealed low-level cross-reaction of FLP(D) with mFRT71 sites, not described before. The degree of tumor reproducibility reported differences in expression dynamics of the lineage-restricted enhancers (e.g. as seen by more asymmetric <italic>brat</italic> tumors with <italic>R19H09-FLP(D)</italic> than with <italic>stg<sup>14</sup>-FLP(D)</italic>) and incomplete extent of recombination within the enhancer domain. Reproducibility could be improved by increased loading of recombinases so in cases where reproducibility is desired we recommend using multiple copies of recombinase transgenes.</p><p>With this setup, any desired GAL4 line can now be added to the stock containing the other elements (spatially restricted-FLP, hs-mFLP5, FOFO) and screens can be performed with a number of convenient criteria. For example, the presence of larval neural tumors induces developmental delay whose extent is proportional to tumor size (our unpublished observation); and in some lineages leads to adult sub-lethality (i.e. presence of adults bearing tumors in a sub-Mendelian proportion). Therefore, the extent of developmental delay and of adult escapers can be used as first-pass proxies for tumor size, for speedy screening of non cell-autonomous modifiers of these parameters. Tumor volume can be subsequently measured directly. Additionally, a FOFO version containing a Luciferase reporter can be generated in order to use Luciferase activity as an efficient method of quantifying reporter-expressing cells (in our case tumor volume) in homogenized tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Homem et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Custom-made FOFO tools can be applied to any desired topic and cell types. Control flies (those with miRs against CD2) will be available ‘off the shelf’ and experimental ones can be generated by either gene synthesis or modification of the control plasmid; or by CRISPR-modification of control host flies. It would be interesting to compare efficacy of these strategies as host flies could contain already other modules of interest. Other recombinase pairs can also be employed where mFLP5/FLP cross-reactivity is a concern. Within the CNS, other applications include investigating cell non-autonomous modifications of axon misguidance, perturbed arbor growth or synapse formation, roles of glia on neurodegeneration, etc. Furthermore, even without gene perturbations, the FOFO tool allows sparse labeling of specifically targeted cells (sparseness achieved by short heat-shock and cell-type targeting provided by <italic>enhancer-FLP</italic>), which is extremely useful for studying cellular morphology and/or migration. Beyond the CNS, the resurgence of interest in metabolism and physiology, for example, has had strong contribution from <italic>Drosophila</italic> research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rajan and Perrimon, 2013</xref>). These are disciplines that involve interplay between cell types and different organs and tools like the ones described here will undoubtedly propel them forward.</p><p>The principles of the FOFO design can be applied to other model organisms where distinct site-specific recombinases work, such as is the case for zebrafish and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nern et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Olorunniji et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carney and Mosimann, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yoshimura et al., 2018</xref>) for refined spatial and/or temporal control of gene expression. In zebrafish, heat-shock induced gene expression allows for faster and/or focal induction of gene expression as compared to drug-induced expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Halloran et al., 2000</xref>). Direct translation of a FOFO tool with the aim here described (large-scale screening for non-autonomous effects) is feasible in zebrafish by employment of the GAL4/UAS or Q/QUAS systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Subedi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawakami et al., 2016</xref>). In mouse, one-way thermal shock can be focally-induced (thus minimizing unwanted damage of most cells) is by Brownian motion of iron oxide nanoparticles when subject to a magnetic field. Once injected into specific tissues, these nanoparticles remain static and can be visualized by magnetic resonance imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pankhurst et al., 2003</xref>), which means the site of injection, and therefore of heat-shock, can be located any time post-injection. Translating the example of this study into mice, induction of tumorigenesis focally in specific cell types by a combination of heat-shock and a cell-type-specific recombinase, in a way that allows identification of exactly where the tumor was initiated, will be invaluable to study the earliest events in mammalian tumorigenesis. This is largely a ‘black box’ in in vivo mammalian cancer studies, with assumed extrapolation from in vitro findings, since by the time a tumor can be visualized it is usually already of a substantially advanced stage. FOFO applications are thus myriad and versatile.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid backbone</title><p>A modified <italic>pCaSpeR</italic> plasmid containing an <italic>actin5C</italic> promoter and a PhiC31-Integrase <italic>attB</italic> site was kindly provided by C.

Mouse anti-Miranda (mAb81 1/50; gift from F. Matsuzaki) was used to label NSCs. Secondary antibodies were conjugated to either Alexa-Fluor-488 or Alexa-Fluor-555 (Molecular Probes) and used at 1/500. Tissues were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and images obtained using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope.

Maximum intensity z-stack projections were generated and brightness/contrast of whole images adjusted with FIJI software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantifications and statistics</title><p>Neither randomization nor blinding was used except for data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b–c</xref>, where NSC counts and tumour volume measurements were performed blind for genotype. Here, each data point corresponds to a different individual of the designated genotype or condition. Sample size calculation is unwarranted due to the small standard deviation of the number of NSCs per central brain lobe in WT and the large effect that tumour induction has on this (many standard deviations above the mean). Data was checked for normalcy via the Liliefors test; significance of difference between each genotype and WT was tested by Ordinary One Way ANOVA, multiple comparisons. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, a complete Z-stack was acquired for every brain (both lobes). Quantification of tumor volume in each lobe was performed with Amira-Avizo Software (Thermo Scientific) using overlapping EGFP and anti-Miranda to identify tumors. Here, tumors were traced throughout the Z-stack to generate the volume of the traced tumour using the segmentation tool in the software package. Tumor volume of each animal was obtained by summing the volume of both brain lobes. The proportional difference of tumor volumes between brain lobes of each animal was obtained by subtracting the smaller volume (S) from the bigger volume (B) and dividing this by the sum of the two (S + B), that is (B-S)/(B + S). Significance of difference between each condition was tested by Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test as post hoc analysis. Each experiment was performed twice (biological replicates). Biological replicates refer to biologically distinct samples (independent crosses) grown in the same conditions and undergone the experimental procedure; sample number is indicated in each appropriate figure legend. No data was excluded. Statistical tests and graphs were generated using Prism software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Reagent availability</title><p>Plasmids and transgenic flies are deposited in stock centres.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Spatiotemporally controlled genetic perturbation for efficient large-scale studies of cell non-autonomous effects&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Hugo Bellen as the Reviewing Editor, and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Chris Doe (Reviewer #1); Marc Freeman (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes a genetic toolkit that can be used to generate a specific phenotype in a targeted patch of cells (which I will call the screening phenotype) while concurrently performing gene knock-down/misexpression in the adjacent cells to detect non-cell autonomous modification of the screening phenotype. The screening phenotype transgene is kept inactive until spatial and temporal cues lead to 'flip out' of stop codons, thereby allowing expression of the transgene and initiation of the screening phenotype.</p><p>Chai et al. describe this novel method for temporal and spatial control of genetic perturbation using two flip-out cassettes that can be regulated by different transgenes. The method only uses the FLP FRT system and leaves other genetic tools such as other binary expression systems free to use for further genetic manipulation of samples. The authors included a miRNA targeting GAL4 in their construct to silence GAL4 in the expression domain. This allows cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous effects to be separated. Moreover, all the components to induce the expression of the construct can be included in a single parental stock, enabling crossing a single stock to effectors such as RNAi libraries to conduct F1 screens. The authors generate multiple versions of this construct to knock down tumor suppressors and GAL4. They generated enhancer FLPase stocks that can be used for neuronal expression and optimized stop cassettes, flippase constructs and knock down constructs separately. Overall this is a sophisticated method that can address niche questions quite nicely. I believe the method will be very useful for the laboratories that aim to address such questions. This elegant system provides a new tool for <italic>Drosophila</italic> researchers interested in performing screens for non-cell autonomous functions. The idea and execution of this system are quite impressive, yet we have some concerns about the general utility of the system described below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Using the system 'off the shelf' is a stated goal of the authors, and an admirable one. But the system is designed to create just one, very specific screening phenotype: neuroblast tumor formation. This is because the screening transgene has miR against prospero or brat only. Generating other screening phenotypes would require significant molecular genetics to adapt the system to create different phenotypes. As it stands, this tool is only useful for research into non-cell autonomous modifiers of neuroblast-derived tumors.</p><p>2) Using the system 'off the shelf' would also be limited to a single Gal4 line, named <italic>enhancer2-gal4</italic>, as described in Figure 1B. Subsequent figures show crosses to different Gal4 lines, but I don't understand how that works if the gal4 is part of the parental screening fly as shown in the schematic in Figure 1.</p><p>3) I have some concern about 'leaky' expression of the screening phenotype, due to unwanted FLP/mFLP5 recombination. The number of events per lineage is calculated, but since there are 100 neuroblasts and 1000 or more INPs in the brain, a low frequency per lineage may translate into an unacceptable level of events per brain. Could the authors give the tumor frequency per brain for each genotype?</p><p>4) Figure 2A should have a key for the colored boxes: what do each represent?</p><p>Also, in Figure 2 there is small number of green cells that can be seen in both FOFO1 and FOFO2 non heat shocked samples. These do not seem to cause a problem since tumors only form when pros or brat are removed in progenitors. For other applications this leakiness (which most likely results from heat shock promoters leakiness) can be problematic. This should be discussed and quantified.</p><p>5) The authors aim to obtain reproducibility of tumor induction but never really compare the tumors in different animals. Is the increase in number of NSC similar between samples induced the same way? How does it change when heat shock regime is changed? These should be quantified.</p><p>6) The temporal control of expression is inherently dependent on the expression dynamics of enhancers. Judging from Figure 4—figure supplement 1, almost all the enhancers that the authors use unlock the construct in a larger set of cells that end up expressing the enhancer at third instar (comparing enhancer-<italic>GAL4 Tub&gt;Stop&gt;GAL4</italic>, UAS-FLP mediated GFP expression to direct enhancer-GAL4 mediated expression). Therefore both the temporal control and special control is limited. The wording in the text should be toned down when it comes to spatial and temporal control of expression and caveats should be more clearly stated.</p><p>7) The heat shocks are conducted so early for tumorigenesis and conducting two heat shocks completely ablates the temporal control aspect in the experiments. Is this tumor induction method better/more robust than a single flip out regulated by enhancer specific Flp? A head to head comparison should be included.</p><p>8) The authors should deposit their plasmids in Addgene or BDGRC and explain how to expand applications for different applications by customizing their tools. They should also deposit their transgenic flies in the BDSC. They nowhere mention that they are planning or willing to do this. These reagents and stocks should be deposited before the paper is accepted or at the time the paper is going to press.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Spatiotemporally controlled genetic perturbation for efficient large-scale studies of cell non-autonomous effects&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by three reviewers, Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor, and Hugo Bellen as the Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>One of the reviewers wrote the following:</p><p>The Abstract and end of the Introduction still makes it look like this method can be used &quot;off the shelf&quot; when in fact any different application from their example requires genome engineering to replace their example microRNAs with different microRNAs or misexpression ORFs. So I would like to see the Abstract changed from &quot;Altogether, our design opens up efficient genome-wide screens on any deleterious phenotype.&quot; to &quot;Altogether, our design opens up efficient genome-wide screens on any deleterious phenotype, once genome engineering is used to place the desired miRNA or ORF into our genotype.&quot;</p><p>We agree that this change should be implemented.</p><p>Also, we want to ensure that all the reagents will be available from the BDSC without MTA at publication time.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38393.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Using the system 'off the shelf' is a stated goal of the authors, and an admirable one.

As detailed in the Summary, this involved optimization of a number of features, which resulted in a “template design” that will benefit the community going forward. Depending on their biological question, each researcher can adapt the system for their own purposes (designing their own module downstream of the STOPs). We stated that (Discussion) “Custom-made FOFO tools can be applied to any desired topic and cell types.” We have now added: “Control flies (those with miRs against CD2) will be available ‘off the shelf’ and experimental ones can be generated by either gene synthesis or modification of the control plasmid; or by CRISPR-modification of control host flies. It would be interesting to compare efficacy of these strategies as host flies could contain already other modules of interest.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Using the system 'off the shelf' would also be limited to a single Gal4 line, named enhancer2-gal4, as described in Figure 1B. Subsequent figures show crosses to different Gal4 lines, but I don't understand how that works if the gal4 is part of the parental screening fly as shown in the schematic in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the intention is to combine in a single stock the FOFO-containing strain with appropriate recombinases and GAL4 transgenes (single or multiple GAL4 transgenes, or split GAL4 modules) dependent on each researcher’s goal (as per the parental fly shown on the left of Figure 1B). The only figure in which we show an example of FOFO and GAL4 combination is Figure 3; here, the aim was to test the miRs against GAL4 rather than the generation of a screening fly so instead of combining FOFO and GAL4 in the same stock we crossed the two genotypes (indicated in separate lines on the left of the figure with an ‘x’ between them) as that served our purpose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I have some concern about 'leaky' expression of the screening phenotype, due to unwanted FLP/mFLP5 recombination. The number of events per lineage is calculated, but since there are 100 neuroblasts and 1000 or more INPs in the brain, a low frequency per lineage may translate into an unacceptable level of events per brain. Could the authors give the tumor frequency per brain for each genotype?</p></disp-quote><p>Two tests were called-for in this respect, which we performed:</p><p>i) FOFO tumor frequency in the presence of hs-mFLP5 and absence of enhancer-FLP;</p><p>ii) FOFO tumor frequency in the presence of enhancer-FLP and absence of hs-mFLP5.</p><p>i) Consisted of testing a single genotype and the frequency was given in the last paragraph of the subsection “Efficacy of STOP cassettes”.</p><p>ii) Consisted of testing 9 genotypes (corresponding to the 9 different enhancerFLPs) and had been given only as the overall frequency. We have now added the numbers obtained for each of the 5 genotypes in which we did not observe cross-reactivity and the 4 in which we did. We state: “Most lines behaved as expected (no EGFP clusters containing supernumerary NSCs in the absence of hs: 0/33 for R14E01; 0/41 for R73G11; 0/31 for R19H09; 0/30 for R51F05; 0/36 for R71A05) but some <italic>enhancer-FLPs</italic> did very occasionally lead to induction of EGFP clusters containing supernumerary NSCs in the absence of hs (1/34 for R66B05; 5/39 for R12H06; 3/40 for R16C01; 4/28 for stg14); in all cases with a single spurious clone per brain.” The combined frequency was therefore 13/31,200 NSCs (9 genotypes pooled), which amounts to ~0.04% . We also added: “(INPs were not included in this calculation, accounting for which would result in an even lower frequency).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2A should have a key for the colored boxes: what do each represent?</p><p>Also, in Figure 2 there is small number of green cells that can be seen in both FOFO1 and FOFO2 non heat shocked samples. These do not seem to cause a problem since tumors only form when pros or brat are removed in progenitors. For other applications this leakiness (which most likely results from heat shock promoters leakiness) can be problematic. This should be discussed and quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>Colored boxes in Figure 2A were the same as had been detailed in Figure 1A; we have now indicated that in Figure 2A legend.</p><p>Regarding single EGFP-positive cells in the absence of heat shock in Figure 2B, we considered it might be an analogous phenomenon to that frequently observed in UAS-reporter lines in the absence of GAL4 – suggesting reporter expression independent of the intended promoter. We have quantified these as appearing at a frequency of 0.25-0.33 cells per brain lobe across all 6 genotypes with no significant difference between them (n=240 brain lobes total) and have added the following: “Occasional single cells labeled with EGFP could be seen in the absence of hs (average of 0.3 per brain lobe; n=240 pooling data for FOFO1.0 and FOFO2.0 carrying <italic>CD2<sup>miRs</sup>, pros<sup>miRs</sup></italic> or <italic>brat<sup>miRs</sup></italic> with no significant difference between genotypes).”</p><p><italic>5) The authors aim to obtain reproducibility of tumor induction but never really compare the tumors in different animals. Is the increase in number of NSC similar between samples induced the same way? How does it change when heat shock regime is changed? These should be quantified.</italic> </p><p>The number of NSCs in tumors is too large to count so we measured tumor volume. We performed measurements of EGFP-positive tumor volumes obtained with single and double 1.5 h heat-shock regimes on the <italic>enhancer-FLP; hsmFLP5, FOFO brat<sup>miRs</sup></italic> stock crossed out to the control strain <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>(to mimic having a single copy of each recombinase and of FOFO as would be the case in a screen) as well as with the double 1.5 h heat-shock on the compound stock homozygous for <italic>enhancer-FLP</italic> (on X) thus carrying 2 copies of FLP as another way of loading more FLP into cells. We found a significant increase in mean tumor volume with an increase in recombinase loading. Mean tumor volume does vary between animals even when both recombinases are loaded “twice”, presumably due to exponential growth of tumor cells. However, their distribution follows a normal distribution in double heat shocked single and double FLP copy animals but not in the single heat shocked single FLP copy animals In a genetic screen, we would judge the candidate modifier on its ability to shift the distribution of mean tumor volume. We also assessed tumor reproducibility as the variation in tumor size between brain lobes (in proportion to the sum volume of tumor burden in both lobes per animal since the absolute values varied greatly), calculated for each animal for each condition. Normalized variation between tumor volume decreased significantly with the increase in recombinase loading, i.e., between single and double heat shock regimes (1 versus 2 loads of mFLP5) in animals with a single FLP copy; and between animals subject to the same heat shock regime when two genomic copies of FLP were provided instead of one. We added representative images of specimen generated with each of the regimes above, and quantifications to Figure 6. In light of these results, we recommend generating stocks with two copies of the recombinases when reproducibility of phenotype domain is key; and have edited/added the following to the Results: “Concerning reproducibility, in the first instance we were looking for symmetry between brain lobes, suggestive of near-complete extent of recombination within the enhancer domain. […] The double-load of mFLP5 and of FLP(D) greatly reduced tumor asymmetry between lobes (Figure 6C).”</p><p>We also added to the Discussion: “The degree of tumor reproducibility reported differences in expression dynamics of the lineage-restricted enhancers (e.g., as seen by more asymmetric <italic>brat</italic> tumors with <italic>R19H09-FLP(D)</italic> than with <italic>stg<sup>14</sup>FLP(D)</italic>) and incomplete extent of recombination within the enhancer domain. Reproducibility could be improved by increased loading of recombinases so in cases where reproducibility is desired we recommend using multiple copies of recombinase transgenes.”</p><p>We also added to the Quantifications and statistics section of Materials and methods: “For Figure 6, a complete Z-stack was acquired for every brain (both lobes). […] Significance of difference between each condition was tested by Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test as post hoc analysis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The temporal control of expression is inherently dependent on the expression dynamics of enhancers. Judging from Figure 4—figure supplement 1, almost all the enhancers that the authors use unlock the construct in a larger set of cells that end up expressing the enhancer at third instar (comparing enhancer-GAL4 Tub&gt;Stop&gt;GAL4, UAS-FLP mediated GFP expression to direct enhancer-GAL4 mediated expression). Therefore both the temporal control and special control is limited. The wording in the text should be toned down when it comes to spatial and temporal control of expression and caveats should be more clearly stated.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, it is precisely because no snapshot of direct enhancer-GAL4 expression can be relied upon to report the complete expression domain (due to dynamic variations over time) that we added images of FLP-out for comparison with images of “snapshot” expression at third instar expression (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We have now added the following: “Spatiotemporal control is constrained by the dynamics of the enhancer in <italic>enhancer-FLP</italic>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The heat shocks are conducted so early for tumorigenesis and conducting two heat shocks completely ablates the temporal control aspect in the experiments. Is this tumor induction method better/more robust than a single flip out regulated by enhancer specific Flp? A head to head comparison should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>A screening phenotype can be induced with FOFO with a single heat-shock and for many applications this will be fine as reproducibility of screening phenotype volume is not necessary (e.g., studying dendritic branching pattern). When studying growth, the latter is desirable and depends on the extent of recombination within the enhancer-FLP domain. This in turn depends on recombination efficacy (we said: “The degree of reproducibility of FOFO-induced tumors depends on reproducibility of the expression domain of FLP, the strength of this expression and recombination efficiency”). The double heat shock regime (providing two loads of hs-mFLP5) led to increased tumor volume reproducibility relative to a single heat shock, as did providing two copies of FLP. As stated in response to point 5 above, we have now added this data to Figure 6 and reflected upon it in the Discussion. In our case, the timings of the double heat shock regime were carefully planned to <italic>not</italic> ablate temporal control over NSC tumor induction as both were performed during the time-window when NSCs are quiescent and thus with no intervening divisions. Therefore, what was achieved was merely two opportunities for loading cells with mFLP5 and only after both would tumor induction initiate (following NSC reactivation from quiescence).</p><p><italic>8) The authors should deposit their plasmids in Addgene or BDGRC and explain how to expand applications for different applications by customizing their tools. They should also deposit their transgenic flies in the BDSC. They nowhere mention that they are planning or willing to do this.
