vaccine development. Among these is the lack of a convenient small animal model in which to study antibody elicitation and efficacy. We describe a chimeric Rhabdo-Immunodeficiency virus (RhIV) murine model that recapitulates key features of HIV-1 entry, tropism and antibody sensitivity. RhIVs are based on vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSV), but viral entry is mediated by HIV-1 Env proteins from diverse HIV-1 strains. RhIV infection of transgenic mice expressing human CD4 and CCR5, exclusively on mouse CD4+ cells, at levels mimicking those on human CD4+ T-cells, resulted in acute, resolving viremia and CD4+ T-cell depletion. RhIV infection elicited protective immunity, and antibodies to HIV-1 Env that were primarily non-neutralizing and had modest protective efficacy following passive transfer. The RhIV model enables the convenient in vivo study of HIV-1 Env-receptor interactions, antiviral activity of antibodies and humoral responses against HIV-1 Env, in a genetically manipulatable host.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>One of the main obstacles to developing a vaccine against HIV-1 is teaching the immune system to recognize the envelope proteins on the surface of the virus, which are also found on infected cells. Envelope proteins allow HIV-1 to attach to and infect a type of human immune cell known as a T-cell, by interacting with proteins on its membrane called CD4 and CCR5.</p><p>Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that can stop HIV-1 from spreading. They can recognize and attach to envelope proteins, thus tagging infected cells so the immune system can attack them, and ‘neutralizing’ viral particles to prevent them from infecting more cells. To make a vaccine against HIV-1, scientists need to teach the immune system how to make neutralizing antibodies. Unfortunately, HIV-1 only replicates in humans and chimpanzees, making it difficult to study how these antibodies are generated.</p><p>Now, Liberatore et al. have developed a hybrid virus that recreates key features of HIV-1 infection in mice. The interior of these viruses is made up of components from a rhabdovirus, which replicates well in mice, with envelope proteins from HIV-1 incorporated into the viruses’ exterior. Therefore, despite having different replication machinery, these hybrid viruses – nicknamed ‘RhIV’ – are able to infect the cells of mice using the same attachment mechanism as HIV-1.</p><p>Next, Liberatore et al. genetically modified mice to produce human CD4 and CCR5 proteins, so RhIV could attach to their T-cells and get inside. The virus rapidly killed the cells it infected, similar to early HIV-1 infection in humans. But, unlike HIV-1 infection in humans, the mice were able to get rid of the virus within a couple of weeks. When the mice were exposed to RhIV a second time, they were partially protected against re-infection. This ‘vaccine effect’ was even stronger if the mice were exposed a third time, making them almost immune to the virus. However, the effect could not be attributed exclusively to antibodies, since mice unable to make antibodies still gained some immune protection after infection with RhIV.</p><p>The results showed that antibodies produced by the infected mice could recognize HIV-1 envelope proteins, but were unable to neutralize viral particles. Nevertheless, transferring antibodies from infected mice after recovery into healthy mice that had never been exposed to the virus partially protected the healthy mice from infection.</p><p>This new model system for HIV-1 infection should make it easier to test new types of vaccines in a context where the vaccinated animal can be challenged with RhIV. Additionally, the ability to genetically engineer both the virus and the mouse host – for example by making mice that produce human antibodies – allows further studies into the development of antibodies that recognize the HIV-1 envelope.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HIV-1</kwd><kwd>antibody</kwd><kwd>envelope</kwd><kwd>CD4</kwd><kwd>CCR5</kwd><kwd>neutralization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37AI064003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bieniasz</surname><given-names>Paul D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI078788</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hatziioannou</surname><given-names>Theodora</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI50111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bieniasz</surname><given-names>Paul D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bieniasz</surname><given-names>Paul D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new animal model permits the in vivo study of HIV-1 entry, as well as the elicitation and antiviral activity of antibodies, in a genetically manipulatable host.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Numerous challenges have impeded the development of a vaccine that protects against HIV-1 infection. Perhaps the most important of these are intrinsic obstacles to the elicitation of antibodies that recognize the trimeric HIV-1 envelope (Env) spike and inhibit viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burton and Mascola, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Escolano et al., 2017</xref>). Large portions of the HIV-1 Env trimer are conformationally flexible and shielded by glycosylation, and such properties inhibit recognition by antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burton and Mascola, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Escolano et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, large HIV-1 in vivo population sizes and short generation times, accompanied by error prone replication (~10<sup>−4</sup>/base/cycle) and recombination, means that vast numbers of sequence variants are generated every day in each infected individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coffin, 1995</xref>). Thus, while infected individuals generate strain-specific neutralizing antibodies that impose selective pressure on viral populations and influence viral sequence evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wei et al., 2003</xref>), the discrepant evolutionary rates that characterize HIV-1 Env and antibody-generating B-cells ensures that antibodies present in each individual are generally poorly effective against contemporaneous autologous viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wei et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, HIV-1 sequence diversification has occurred in millions of individual humans over approximately 100 years, yielding vast global diversity of HIV-1 Env proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Korber and Gnanakaran, 2009</xref>). This large and evolving population of HIV-1 Env proteins with intrinsic antibody evasion mechanisms makes the elicitation of broadly effective antibodies by vaccines a formidable task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mascola and Haynes, 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, rare HIV-1 infected individuals generate potent, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that are capable of neutralizing many circulating HIV-1 strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). However, they typically arise only after years of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Landais and Moore, 2018</xref>). The breadth with which bNAbs neutralize HIV-1 strains is likely a function of their rarity, as any frequently occurring bNAbs would drive frequent resistance (i.e. loss of activity against circulating strains). What distinguishes the rare individuals who generate bNAbs, and whether it is possible to generate bNAbs in a significant fraction of humans through vaccination, are key issues confronting the HIV-1 vaccine research field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Landais and Moore, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Another significant impediment to HIV-1 vaccine development is the availability of a convenient animal model system in which to study antibody elicitation and efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hatziioannou and Evans, 2012</xref>). HIV-1 host range is confined to humans and chimpanzees, severely curtailing options for testing vaccines and other prevention strategies. To partly circumvent this problem, chimeric retroviruses based on simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that express HIV-1 Env proteins, termed (simian HIVs or SHIVs), have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luciw et al., 1995</xref>). Following engineering and a period of adaptation to overcome the sub-optimal use of macaque CD4 receptors, these viruses can often replicate persistently and cause AIDS-like disease in macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Del Prete et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Joag et al., 1996</xref>). Additionally, particular minimally modified HIV-1 strains have been adapted to replicate in pig-tailed macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hatziioannou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schmidt et al., 2019</xref>). Though useful, these models require the significant resources associated with investigations in primates. Small animal models based on immunodeficient mice engrafted with human cells and tissues have provided an experimental system for the in vivo testing of antibodies and other molecules as preventative agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hatziioannou and Evans, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mosier et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Namikawa et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watanabe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wege et al., 2008</xref>). However, these models are also inconvenient and costly, and human cell engrafted mice generate weak and inconsistent immune responses. Moreover, an important advantage of mouse models, that is the ability to genetically manipulate their immune systems, is lost when the viral target cells and immune system are derived from a human graft.</p><p>Here, we describe the development of a virus/host animal model that incorporates the critical feature of the HIV-1 viral particle (the Env spike), that is the target of antiviral antibodies, and recapitulates key features of HIV-1 entry and tissue tropism. Specifically, we generated recombinant derivatives of the rhabdovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), in which the native envelope glycoprotein (G) is replaced by HIV-1 Env from various subtypes, including transmitted founder strains. In these Rhabdo-Immunodeficiency viruses (RhIV), replication is entirely dependent on HIV-1 Env, as well as human CD4 and coreceptors on target cells. In parallel, we constructed transgenic mice that express human CD4 and CCR5, exclusively in mouse CD4-positive cells, at levels mimicking those on human CD4+ T-cells. Infection of these transgenic mice with RhIVs results in rapid, specific depletion of CD4+ T-cells and an acute viremia that resolves, followed by development of antibodies directed against the HIV-1 envelope. The RhIV model thus enables the convenient in vivo study of HIV-1 Env-receptor interactions, and their inhibition by antibodies in a genetically manipulatable host.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and characterization of Rhabdo-Imunodeficiency viruses (RhIV)</title><p>HIV-1 itself cannot replicate in murine cells, even when they are engineered to expressed human versions of HIV-1 receptors and essential Tat cofactors that enable HIV-1 entry and transcription in murine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bieniasz and Cullen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mariani et al., 2000</xref>). However, VSV has a very broad tropism and numerous VSV-based chimeric viruses expressing functional, heterologous envelope proteins, including that of HIV-1, have been generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boritz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rabinovich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rose et al., 2001</xref>). We generated a panel of chimeric <underline>Rh</underline>abdo-<underline>I</underline>mmunodeficiency <underline>v</underline>iruses (RhIVs) encoding Env proteins from diverse HIV-1 strains including those representative of strains circulating in human populations. Initially we constructed RhIV strains encoding the subtype B Env proteins of HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub>, a laboratory adapted X4-tropic strain, HIV-1<sub>ADA</sub>, a macrophage tropic primary isolate and HIV-1<sub>AD17</sub>, an R5 tropic transmitted founder (T/F) HIV-1 strain. The ectodomain and transmembrane domains of HIV-1 Env were fused to the cytoplasmic tail of VSV-G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Retaining the VSV-G cytoplasmic tail has the potential to perturb the tertiary structure of the HIV-1 ectodomain, but this strategy improves HIV-1 Env incorporation into VSV particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnson et al., 1997</xref>). RhIV<sub>NL4-3</sub>, RhIV<sub>ADA</sub>, and RhIV<sub>AD17</sub> strains were rescued from recombinant DNA, plaque purified and expanded. Western blot analysis of RhIV<sub>ADA</sub> showed that the HIV-1 envelope protein was readily detectable in lysates from infected cells and pelleted virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). RhIV<sub>NL4-3</sub> and RhIV<sub>AD17</sub> strains displayed the appropriate receptor specificity when used to infect GHOSTX4 or GHOSTR5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and infection of these cells with RhIV, but not VSV, led to the appearance of large syncytia, in addition to a pronounced cytopathic effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We therefore generated a larger panel of RhIV constructs expressing a variety of physiologically relevant envelope proteins from HIV-1 clades A, B, and C, including T/F viruses. All of these viruses replicated well in vitro, reaching titers of ~10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> plaque forming units (PFU)/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization and in vitro replication properties of RhIV strains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of RhIV genomes in which VSV-G ectodomain and transmembrane sequences are replaced with HIV-1 Env counterparts.

In general, matched RhIV (nLuc) and HIV-1 (nLuc) viruses exhibited similar neutralization properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). While most RhIV and HIV-1 strains were sensitive to the quaternary epitope targeting PG16 and PG9 antibodies, the RhIV<sub>1054</sub>/HIV-1<sub>1054</sub>, RhIV<sub>SF162</sub>/HIV-1<sub>SF162</sub> and RhIV <sub>V1</sub>/HIV-1<sub>V1</sub> virus pairs each shared the property of being resistant to PG9 and PG16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). The HIV-1<sub>V1</sub> strain was unusual in exhibiting near complete resistance to all bNAbs tested, except 10–1074 and this property was preserved in the corresponding RhIV<sub>V1</sub> chimeric virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). There were, nevertheless, some discrepancies in the potencies with which matched HIV-1 (nLuc) and RhIV (nLuc) viruses were neutralized by bNAbs.

The second challenge with RhIV<sub>BG505</sub> resulted in only low-level plasma viremia in a subset of mice and an attenuated degree of CD4+ T-cell depletion. The third challenge with RhIV<sub>SF162</sub> gave no detectable plasma viremia and minimal CD4+ T-cell depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>).

Specifically, RhIV strains exhibit the tropism and, to a large extent, the neutralization properties of HIV-1. The transgenic mice that are a key component of the RhIV model expressed hCD4 and hCCR5 at the same level as human T-cells, and this expression was restricted to T-cells that normally express mCD4. RhIV infection results in acute, resolving viremia and CD4+ T-cell depletion. This model can therefore be used to test the activity of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies in an in vivo setting, where the effector functions of antibodies can contribute to their antiviral activity in a way that is difficult to recapitulate in vitro.</p><p>Because RhIV employs the intracellular replication machinery of VSV, there are some obvious caveats associated with the RhIV/mouse model. First, the replication cycle of VSV is more rapid than that of HIV-1, with a single cycle of replication typically requiring 6–8 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cuevas et al., 2005</xref>). Second, the mode of replication (‘stamping machine’ with a DNA provirus for HIV-1, versus geometric RNA replication for VSV) might affect the propensity to accumulate escape mutations under antibody driven selective pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Safari and Roossinck, 2014</xref>). In practice, however, the early onset of peak viremia and rapid clearance of RhIV infection precluded an assessment of RhIV evolution in the presence and absence of selective pressure. The absence of latency in VSV replication is also a key distinction from HIV-1 infection. The mice generated herein differ from humans in that 100% of their CD4+T-cells also expressed CCR5, because of the tight linkage of CD4 and CCR5 in the transgene construct. In humans, the proportion of CD4+ T-cells that also express CCR5 varies according to tissue source and inflamation; approximately 5–10% of peripheral blood CD4+ T-cells express CCR5, while most gut associated lymphoid tissue and rheumatoid arthritis synovial fluid CD4+ T-cells are CCR5+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agace et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qin et al., 1998</xref>). The elevated frequency with which CCR5 is expressed in blood cells in our transgenic mice may accelerate CD4+ T-cell depletion during RhIV infection.</p><p>A property of RhIV particles that might be relevant to tropism and neutralization properties is spike density (the number of envelope trimers per virion). HIV-1 has a lower spike density than does VSV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McSharry et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>). While we were unable to precisely determine the spike density on RhIV particles, our semi-quantitative estimates indicated that the number of envelope proteins on a RhIV particle was greater than that present on an HIV-1 particle but less than that on a VSV particle. Importantly, however, RhIV strains mimicked the diversity of properties associated with parental HIV-1 strains. A RhIV strain generated using a T/F envelope protein (RhIV<sub>CH505</sub>) exhibited a requirement, typical of that associated with many T/F HIV-1 strains, for the high hCD4 levels found on human T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chikere et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, a RhIV strain constructed using a macrophage tropic envelope (RhIV<sub>ADA</sub>) replicated well in mice whose T-cells expressed lower levels of hCD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Joseph et al., 2014</xref>). Most crucially, the neutralization properties of RhIV strains were similar to those of HIV-1 strains bearing a cognate envelope protein.</p><p>An interesting feature of RhIV infection was that mice seroconverted to the HIV-1 Env proteins and generated a prominent Env binding antibody response, albeit one that was largely non-neutralizing. The low titer neutralizing antibodies that were elicited by repeated RhIV<sub>SF162</sub> infection were autologous, and strain specific neutralization was evident only against an easy-to-neutralize HIV-1 strain, SF162 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seaman et al., 2010</xref>). The relatively poor generation of neutralizing antibodies should be expected, given the short period of viremia associated with RhIV infection. In HIV-1 infected humans, autologous neutralizing antibodies typically arise after months of persistent HIV-1 infection, with neutralization breadth only developing (to varying degrees) over the ensuing years of chronic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Landais and Moore, 2018</xref>). Elaborations of this model that would increase the amount of time that replication occurs in the presence of neutralizing antibodies (for example substitution of HIV-1 Env into other viruses that are capable of replication in mice, or ablation of CD8-mediated cytotoxic responses) may allow the co-evolution of Env sequence and antibody to be studied.</p><p>Additionally, the apparently unfavorable nature of the mouse immunoglobulin repertoire may also contribute to the absence of neutralizing antibodies in the current iteration of the RhIV model, as C57BL/6 mice have previously been reported to be unable to generate autologous neutralizing antibodies following BG505 SOSIP protein immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). Future iterations of the RhIV model could benefit from the crossbreeding of A1 mice to mouse strains with human immunoglobulin repertoires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murphy et al., 2014</xref>), although the availability of the such mouse strains to the academic community remains restricted.</p><p>Despite the paucity of neutralizing antibodies generated by RhIV infected mice, primary infection conferred at least partial protection against a second, and especially a third, RhIV challenge. The bulk of this ‘vaccine’ effect was Env-independent and likely cell mediated. This finding suggests that protective immunity against a cytopathic, CD4+ T-cell tropic virus can, at least in principle, be established without protective antibodies. Nevertheless, convalescent serum from animals that had been challenged three times with RhIV strains exhibited modest protective efficacy in passive transfer experiments with an RhIV<sub>SF162</sub> challenge. This protective activity was evident even in the absence of in vitro neutralizing activity. It is therefore likely that protection was mediated by an effector-dependent activity of the antibodies present therein, although we cannot exclude the possibility that sub-detectable neutralizing activity might be responsible. The protection afforded by convalescent sera was limited and manifested as modest reductions in acute RhIV<sub>SF162</sub> viremia in most mice. In other animal models, and perhaps in the context of human vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rerks-Ngarm et al., 2009</xref>), non-neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 Env may also be responsible for modest protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haynes et al., 2012</xref>). Conversely, we found that broadly neutralizing antibodies readily conferred apparently sterilizing protection upon challenge with RhIV<sub>CH505</sub> and RhIV<sub>BG505</sub> that bear Env proteins from more representative HIV-1 strains. The apparent protective effect of non-neutralizing antibodies in this model could, potentially, be enhanced by the absence of accessory genes that mediate CD4 or tetherin downregulation. Entrapment of envelope protein or virions on the surface of infected cells or exposure of CD4-induced epitopes may sensitize infected cells to effector-dependent activities.</p><p>In conclusion, we have developed a virus-host model system that recapitulates some key features of acute HIV-1 infection. The genetic manipulability of both host and virus in this model could permit a wide range of studies on the factors that influence the elicitation of HIV-1 Env specific antibodies and antiviral efficacy of neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies and sera in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (Vesicular Stomatitis Virus)</td><td>pVSV-FL+(2) Plasmid Expression Vector System</td><td>Kerafast</td><td>Cat#EH1002</td><td>Anti-genomic sense plasmid with helper plasmids N, P, G and L</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57BL/6J-Tg(Cd4-CD4,CCR5)A1Bsz;

VSV<sub>MLV-E</sub> had a similar design, except that MLV-E Env ectodomain and transmembrane domains (amino acids 1–634) were fused to the cytoplasmic tail of VSV-G (amino acids 486–511, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>RhIV viruses were generated by infecting 293 T cells with T7-expressing vaccinia (vTF7-3) at a MOI of 5, followed by transfection with pRhIV plasmids and plasmids encoding VSV-N, P, L, and G under the control of a T7 promoter. Supernatants were harvested 48 hr post transfection, filtered (0.2 μm) to remove the bulk of the vaccinia virus and plaque purified on GHOST R5 cells. Plaque purified virus was expanded on 293T CD4/R5 cells and cell culture supernatant was harvested, passed through a 0.2 μm filter and frozen in aliquots.

Mice were infected with RhIV stocks (10 to 10<sup>5</sup> PFU in 500 μl DMEM) by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Thereafter, blood was collected in EDTA coated tubes (Sarstedt) from the facial vein at the indicated timepoints, typically 1, 4, 7, 14 and 21 days after infection, and weekly thereafter for longer term experiments. Plasma was separated from cells and used for extraction of RNA or in ELISA while cells were processed for FACS analysis of cell populations. For analysis of tissues, mice were euthanized using carbon dioxide. Spleen, thymus, and lymph node tissue was removed and processed for RNA extraction or FACS analysis. In experiments involving serum transfer, previously infected donor animals were bled several times, 3 to 4 days apart, serum isolated from each bleed and pooled with serum from the same individual mouse. Thereafter, 200 μl of heat inactivated serum was injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into naïve animals one day prior to an i.p. RhIV challenge.

It is interesting that the chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus constructs encoding various clade A, B and C HIV-1 Env proteins are replication competent and cause CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell depletion in transgenic mice expressing human CD4 and the coreceptor CCR5. Your work shows that this new animal model recapitulates some aspects of acute HIV-1 infection in humans. It will be of interest for everybody interested in HIV-1 neutralization and entry and hopefully support development of effective and safe AIDS vaccines.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Rhabdo-immunodeficiency virus, a murine model of acute HIV-1 infection&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Frank Kirchhoff as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Welkin E Johnson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Liberatore et al. describe a novel and potentially useful small animal model for the study of HIV-1 entry and anti-Env antibodies in vivo. Specifically, they engineered replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)/HIV Env chimeras (RhIVs) by replacing the G gene of VSV with sequences encoding the ecto and transmembrane domains of various clade A, B and C HIV-1 Env proteins fused to the cytoplasmic tail of VSV G. Infection of hCD4/hCCR5 transgenic mice with these RhIVs resulted in acute viral loads in plasma and transient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell depletion reminiscent of HIV-1 infection. RhIVs display appropriate coreceptor tropism, are sensitive to the CCR5 inhibitor Maraviroc and induce Env-specific antibody responses in vivo. The chimeric viruses replicated more efficiently and elicited higher Env-specific antibody responses in IFNAR-/- Tg mice compared to IFNAR+/+ Tg mice. The CD4 dependence of the RhIVs mirrored their corresponding HIV-1 Envs as reflected by differences in their ability to replicate in transgenic mice with high versus low levels of CD4. Passive transfer of two HIV-1 bNAbs (PG16 and 3BNC117) resulted in dose-dependent protection against RhIV challenge, consistent with similar experiments in NHPs. RhIV infection conferred robust protection against reinfection with RhIVs expressing homologous or heterologous Envs; however, this protection did not require B cells as indicated by experiments in <italic>µMT-/-</italic> mice and with a VSV recombinant expressing ecotropic MLV Env (VSV MLV-E). Repeated RhIV infection elicited antibodies in serum that were capable of binding to SOSIP trimers by ELISA, but with the exception of weak stain-specific neutralization of HIV-1<sub>SF162</sub>, did not neutralize Env-matched HIV-1 isolates. Finally, convalescent sera from mice repeatedly infected with RhIV was tested for the ability to confer protection by passive transfer. Although mice that received sera from animals with weak neutralizing activity against HIV-1<sub>SF162</sub> had lower peak viral loads after RhIV<sub>SF162</sub> challenge, none were completely protected. In contrast, some of the mice that received sera from mice exposed to different combinations of RhIVs that lacked detectable neutralizing activity were protected against RhIV<sub>SF162</sub> challenge.</p><p>Overall, this is a highly innovative study that offers a novel model for investigating antibody responses to HIV-1 Env in mice. As discussed by the authors, the model has a number of limitations, such as lack of persistence and rapid clearance. However, these caveats are discussed and the RhIV platform is of significant interest since it potentially allows for in vivo assessment of both antibody-mediated neutralization and antibody-mediated effector mechanisms, pre-testing of vaccine immunogenicity, and in vivo testing of small molecule entry inhibitors. The conclusions of the study are supported by an extensive, high-quality dataset and the manuscript is well written.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is one caveat that should be straightforward to address – the study lacks a profile of the binding antibodies that are produced by infection, and how that basic profile compares to published HIV serum profiles. As the authors point out, their use of chimeric HIV Envs with the VSV-G cytoplasmic tail may have altered the arrangement of the extracellular domains. In combination with the binding of SOSIP proteins (already done and displayed in Figure 6—figure supplements 3-5), serum western blots and/or peptide ELISA would reveal whether there is a similar distribution of binding specificities to HIV infection, or whether the mice are mounting responses against just one or a few targets or targets that completely differ from HIV infection. The result would not change the importance of the study, but would potential alert adopters of the RhIV platform that additional optimization might be necessary.</p><p>2) For the most part, the results are adequately presented and discussed. Some statements, however, should be tempered. For example, the statement in the summary that the RhIV model &quot;faithfully represents HIV-1 entry, tropism and antibody sensitivity&quot;. As the authors well know, the viral cell tropism is determined by many factors in addition to entry, and the observation that IFNAR1 deficient mice are much more susceptible to RhIVs suggest that ISGs also have a significant impact on the tropism of the chimeric viruses. The authors show that the transgenic mice express human CD4 and CCR5 at levels &quot;precisely mimicking those on human CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells&quot;, but it would be of interest to know a bit more about the phenotype and state of activation of these cells.</p><p>3) As stated by the authors, the genetic manipulability of the mice and the chimeric virus will allow further studies on the elicitation of HIV-1 Env-specific antibodies. However, the rapid clearance of the infection limits the value of this model; e.g. examining the evolution of antibody specificities over time, may not be feasible or will require additional boosting (perhaps with divergent RhIV backbones). Are there possible strategies to delay viral replication and hence potentially clearance in this model? Given the almost complete loss of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, do the authors think the infection is cleared by the immune response to infection or due to target cell exhaustion?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49875.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is one caveat that should be straightforward to address – the study lacks a profile of the binding antibodies that are produced by infection, and how that basic profile compares to published HIV serum profiles.

Thus, it is quite difficult to compare the detailed (i.e. epitope specific) serological response in ‘mice’ compared to ‘humans’ without detailed analysis of cohorts in both species. Nevertheless, we did some analysis using commercially available nitrocellulose strips loaded with HIV-1 antigens, as well as competition ELISAs. These data show that RhIV infected mice (i) generate antibodies to both gp41 and gp120 (ii) the antibodies generated do not compete with sCD4 or bnAbs from a small panel the recognize the CD4bs, the V2 apex and the V3 loop. These data are presented in a new supplementary figure (Figure 6—figure supplement 6) and described in the first paragraph of the subsection “Serological responses to HIV-1 Env in RhIV-infected mice”. The details of the serological response in RhIV infection are obviously of interest, but we feel that a more detailed analysis of the serological profile would go beyond the scope of the study and would require considerable additional effort.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For the most part, the results are adequately presented and discussed.

The reviewer is correct in that an optimal model would be one in which the RhIV persists, enabling co-evolution of Env and antibody to be studied. We have tried a number of approaches, such as insertion of HIV-1 accessory genes into RhIV stains and serial passage of RhIV strains in mice to achieve persistent replication, as yet without success. Alternatively, the ability to re-infect with HIV-1 enveloped viruses with different backbones would enable further ‘development’ of an antibody response. We have added and modified some text in the Discussion to highlight limitations of the current model and the potential utility of other viruses with HIV-1 envelopes as ‘boosters’ that would potentially enable the evolution of the HIV-1 antibody response to be studied (Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p><p>We do not think (although this is opinion – not necessarily fact) that the infection is cleared due to target cell exhaustion. Some of our attempts to make more persistent viruses have resulted in viruses that have reduced peak viremia, and incomplete CD4 T-cell depletion, yet have clearance kinetics that are essentially the same as those reported herein. We favor the hypothesis that a cell mediated adaptive response (the most obvious candidate being that mediated by CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells) is responsible for clearance and subsequent protection. We are currently investigating the role of CD8<sup>+</sup> cells in clearance.</p></body></sub-article></article>
