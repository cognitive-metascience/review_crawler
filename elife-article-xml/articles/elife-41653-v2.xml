domain. A VSD in a VSP regulates the cytoplasmic catalytic region (CCR). However, the mechanisms by which the VSD couples to the CCR remain elusive. Here we report a membrane interface (named ‘the hydrophobic spine’), which is essential for the coupling of the VSD and CCR. Our molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the hydrophobic spine of <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> VSP (Ci-VSP) provides a hinge-like motion for the CCR through the loose membrane association of the phosphatase domain. Electrophysiological experiments indicate that the voltage-dependent phosphatase activity of Ci-VSP depends on the hydrophobicity and presence of an aromatic ring in the hydrophobic spine. Analysis of conformational changes in the VSD and CCR suggests that the VSP has two states with distinct enzyme activities and that the second transition depends on the hydrophobic spine.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>voltage sensor</kwd><kwd>ascidian</kwd><kwd>phosphoinositide</kwd><kwd>phosphatase</kwd><kwd>membrane interaction</kwd><kwd>domain to domain coupling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. intestinalis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP15K18516</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawanabe</surname><given-names>Akira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16H02617</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Okamura</surname><given-names>Yasushi</given-names></name><name><surname>Nishizawa</surname><given-names>Kazuhisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25253016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Okamura</surname><given-names>Yasushi</given-names></name><name><surname>Nakagawa</surname><given-names>Atsushi</given-names></name><name><surname>Sakata</surname><given-names>Souhei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003382</institution-id><institution>Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJCR14M3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakagawa</surname><given-names>Atsushi</given-names></name><name><surname>Okamura</surname><given-names>Yasushi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15H05901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Okamura</surname><given-names>Yasushi</given-names></name><name><surname>Nakagawa</surname><given-names>Atsushi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrophysiological and fluorometric studies of Ci-VSP expressed in Xenopus oocyte revealed two states of the enzyme region with distinct enzyme activity and distinct coupling to the voltage sensor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Changes in membrane potential induce structural changes in membrane proteins such as ion channels, transporters, and receptors, and underlie membrane excitability, neurotransmitter and hormone release, muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Proenza et al., 2002</xref>), cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jehle et al., 2011</xref>), and reactive oxygen species production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeCoursey, 2013</xref>). Voltage-sensor domains (VSDs) are sophisticated protein modules that sense changes in transmembrane voltage and regulate downstream effectors. VSDs consist of four transmembrane helices and a fourth helix that contains a signature pattern of positively charged residues that align to form salt bridges with acidic residues on the other helices. In classical voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs), VSDs are connected to a pore-gate domain (PGD) composed of two transmembrane helices that form an ion-permeation pathway.</p><p>Voltage sensing phosphatases (VSPs) belong to a family of enzymes that include phosphoinositide phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN). VSPs contain a VSD and PTEN-like cytoplasmic catalytic region (CCR), which consists of a phosphatase domain (PD) and C2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Okamura et al., 2018</xref>). The motion of the VSD in response to membrane depolarization activates the enzymatic activity of the CCR, leading to dephosphorylation of phosphoinositides, mainly PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and providing a direct pathway to translate electric signals to chemical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murata and Okamura, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sakata et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sakata and Okamura, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Okamura et al., 2018</xref>). The structures of both the VSD and CCR of <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>-VSP (Ci-VSP) were individually solved by X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matsuda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Compared to VGICs, VSPs show two contrasting features. First, the motion of the VSD activates the cytoplasmic structure that dephosphorylates phosphoinositides, unlike the action of VGICs, which ultimately results in structural changes in the transmembrane PGD. Second, a single VSD regulates a single CCR, in contrast with VGICs, in which four homologous units (repeat or subunit) assemble to regulate a central pore gate in a complex manner. Although a recent study suggested that VSPs can form dimers with high density expression and that dimeric VSPs exhibit slightly different molecular properties than those of monomers, the basic nature of voltage-dependent enzyme activity is innate to monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rayaprolu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>One of the central questions about VSPs is how the VSD motion triggers the catalytic activity of the CCR. Two major findings provide clues to the mechanisms underlying VSD and CCR coupling. First, deletion or mutation of the linker between VSD and the phosphatase domain (which is called ‘the VSD-PD linker’) eliminates coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Villalba-Galea et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kohout et al., 2010</xref>). The crystal structure of the CCR of Ci-VSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) showed that two residues of Lys-252 and Arg-253 directly interact with residues in the enzyme active center. Based on multiple crystal structures of the CCR, Liu et al. proposed a model where a loop region, called a ‘gating loop,’ which is not present in PTEN, moves dynamically upon VSD activation to regulate steric hindrance in substrate binding. These reports suggest that the VSD-PD linker of the VSP works as a hub to translate information from the movement of VSD to a conformational change in the CCR.</p><p>Another important clue about the mechanisms of VSD-CCR coupling is the multiple active states of the enzyme, which are coupled with distinct states of the VSD. A zebrafish VSP with a double mutation in the S4 domain, Dr-VSP (T156R/I165R), exhibits two-step activation of the VSD, and its phosphatase activity depends on the extent of VSD motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sakata and Okamura, 2014</xref>), suggesting that enzyme activity can be tuned by the extent of motion of the VSD at the single protein level. In another study, the CCR phosphatase activity of several VSD mutants was analyzed by fast-responding phosphoinositide (PIP) sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grimm and Isacoff, 2016</xref>), and the results showed that the distinct activation states of the VSD induce the activation of enzymes with distinct substrate preferences. Hille’s group showed, in a simple two-state transition model for activation of the enzyme, a reconstituted time course of voltage-evoked signaling of a fast fluorescent reporter sensitive to PIPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Keum et al., 2016</xref>). Our recent analysis of a version of Ci-VSP containing an environmentally sensitive unnatural fluorescent amino acid, Anap, at Lys-555 showed a biphasic change in Anap fluorescence that was dependent on the membrane voltage: the Ci-VSP exhibited a decrease in fluorescence at low membrane voltage and then an increase at higher membrane voltages, consistent with the notion that the CCR in Ci-VSP has multiple conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakata et al., 2016</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying the adoption of these multiple conformations of CCR upon VSD activation remain unclear.</p><p>In this study, we attempted to gain more mechanistic insights into voltage-induced activation of the CCR. To achieve this goal, we combined coarse-grained (CG) and atomistic (AT) molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analyses of the interaction between the whole CCR and the membrane with biophysical characterization of the conformational changes of the VSD and CCR in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. MD simulations revealed a novel site in the PD with two hydrophobic residues (here, named ‘the hydrophobic spine’; Leu-284 and Phe-285 in Ci-VSP) that protrude from the CCR and contact the membrane. AT MD simulations suggested a 'compromised nature' of the hydrophobic spine; despite hydrophobicity that should favor penetration into the hydrophobic core of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MacCallum et al., 2008</xref>), the simulations showed its anomalously loose association with the bilayer surface, shallow positioning in the bilayer, and high mobility in and near the phospholipid head group layer. Electrophysiological studies of numerous versions of Ci-VSP with mutations in the two residues showed that hydrophobicity of the residues is critical for voltage-dependent phosphatase activity, and that an aromatic residue on the hydrophobic spine facilitates VSD and CCR coupling. A voltage-clamp fluorometry analysis with cysteine-based incorporation of a fluorophore on the VSD and genetic incorporation of Anap into the CCR indicated that the CCR is activated by the VSD via two steps and that the transition from an intermediate state to a fully-activated state involves the hydrophobic spine.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MD simulation of the cytoplasmic catalytic region of VSP reveals the possible function of the VSP hydrophobic spine</title><p>The voltage-sensing phosphatase (VSP) consists of a voltage sensor domain (VSD) and a cytoplasmic catalytic region (CCR).

The CCR was initially placed in four distinct orientations/positions (cg_po_1–4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), with its center of mass placed ~3.5–4.0 nm away from the plane and containing the phosphorus atoms of the proximal monolayer ('phosphorus layer'). Neither the C2 domain nor the PD formed a stable complex with the bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To determine the potential for the CCR to weakly bind to the bilayer, we performed 1-μs CG runs starting with the CCR pre-bound to the POPC bilayer (cg_po_5a to 5 hr) in the productive orientation ('The productive orientation' and 'the protein binding to the bilayers' are defined in the section of MD simulation in Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). In all eight runs, the PD detached from the bilayer, but, intriguingly, in four runs, the C2 domain remained bound throughout the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). This result raised the possibility that the C2 domain has an affinity for the POPC bilayer that is stronger than that for the PD. When POPC/PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> bilayers, instead of the POPC bilayer, were used, most runs showed the formation of CCR-bilayer complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E–H</xref>), in agreement with a report on the stabilization of the CCR-bilayer complex with the addition of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> to the POPC bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalli et al., 2014</xref>). The effect of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> appeared more pronounced for PD binding than for binding of the C2 domain to the bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement

The time of the <italic>z</italic>-positions (i.e., positions along the z-axis, which is parallel to the membrane normal) of the C2 domain and PD showed membrane binding that was different between the two domains (at_po_1 to 6 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The C2 domain quickly bound to the POPC bilayer in all runs, but the PD slowly approached the bilayer over 50–80 ns in three of the six runs, whereas it approached the bilayer relatively quickly in the remaining three runs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A–C</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> demonstrates two representative runs; one (at_po_4) that showed binding of both domains (blue and black lines indicating the C2 domain and PD, respectively) and another (at_po_5) that showed binding of the C2 domain but not of PD (light blue and grey lines). When four PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> molecules were randomly added in the lipid monolayer facing the Ci-VSP of the POPC bilayer, binding of both domains to the bilayer were expedited (at_po_pi_1 to 7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Overall, the presence of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> appeared to enhance the affinity of the CCR to the membrane; however, this enhancement effect was more evident for PD. Thus, our simulation data suggested that the C2 domain had substantial affinity for the POPC bilayers in the absence of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> molecules and that the presence of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> can increase affinity of the PD to phospholipid bilayers.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41653.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>MD simulation of the cytoplasmic catalytic region.</title><p>Two selected AT runs.

The loop containing Leu-284 and Phe-285, which we call the ‘hydrophobic spine,’ was located near the distal end of this putative rotational motion and served as the point of contact between the PD and the bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>). In addition to its membrane-facing location, the hydrophobic spine attracted our attention because it appeared compromised. Specifically, despite its hydrophobic property, which should have favored penetration into the hydrophobic core of the phospholipid bilayer, neighboring residues were polar or ionizable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), likely hampering this penetration. In support of this, our steered MD simulations, in which the hydrophobic spine was pulled upward with an external force and forced into the phosphorus layer, resulted in the hydrophobic spine bouncing back to shallower positions when the pulling force was turned off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>), suggesting that the spine cannot penetrate the hydrophobic core of the bilayer, likely because of the hydrophilicity of residues near the spine. During the period when the PD apparently associated with membrane, the spine residues (Leu-284 and Phe-285) showed a superficial positioning that suggested a loose association with the bilayer, with their center of mass located ~3–4 Å from the phosphorus layer, and the <italic>z</italic>-position showing fluctuations in the range of ~3 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>).

F-V curves were fitted by one or the sum of two Boltzmann distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). For both G214C-TMRM and K555Anap, F-V curves of WT and L284F were fit well by the sum of two Boltzmann distributions, indicating that they had two individual components (red and blue lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>; fitting parameters are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The voltages of half-maximum changes (V<sub>1/2</sub>) were identical to each other in the early components of WT/G214C-TMRM and WT/K555Anap, as well as L284F/G214C-TMRM and L284F/K555Anap (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, later components were only observed in the WT and L284F, both with fluorescence probes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), providing strong evidence for tight coupling between the VSD and CCR in the WT and L284F. On the other hand, a Boltzmann distribution was sufficient to fit the F-V curves of L284Q and F285Q with both fluorescence probes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Signal amplitudes of fluorescence from L284Q/K555Anap and F285Q/K555Anap were similar to those of early components of WT/K555Anap and L284F/K555Anap (A versus A<sub>1</sub> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), suggesting that the early components of WT and L284F share molecular events with the conformational change of the CCR in L284Q and F285Q.</p><p>These findings indicate that the CCR is activated through two steps that are tightly coupled with the VSD activation state. The second activation step is more closely associated with enzyme activity, in which the hydrophobic spine plays a role.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, through computational and experimental approaches, we identified a novel membrane-interacting site in the cytoplasmic catalytic region (CCR) of the voltage-sensing phosphatase (VSP), which plays an important role in coupling of the voltage sensor domain (VSD) to the CCR. Our MD simulations of the CCR suggested that the combination of the hydrophobic spine, consisting of two conserved hydrophobic amino acids (Leu-284 and Phe-285 in Ci-VSP), and the flanking hydrophilic residues provide high mobility to the PD in and near the membrane/water interface. Electrophysiological studies of constructs with systematic mutations in the hydrophobic spine showed that voltage-dependent phosphatase activity depends on the hydrophobicity of the amino acid side chain. Interestingly, the addition of extra aromatic ring residues significantly enhanced this phosphatase activity. Voltage clamp fluorometry showed that both hydrophobicity and the presence of an aromatic ring on the hydrophobic spine controlled the later state transition of the two sequential CCR activation steps. We propose that the hydrophobic spine plays a critical role in regulating coupling of the VSD to dynamic rearrangements in the CCR for enzymatic activity.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The hydrophobic spine controls the later transition of enzyme activation</title><p>Previous studies have suggested the presence of multiple activation states of enzymes that are coupled with distinct states of the VSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kohout et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sakata and Okamura, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grimm and Isacoff, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakata et al., 2016</xref>). However, detailed mechanisms of the multiple conformations of the CCR upon VSD activation remain unclear.</p><p>The biphasic fluorescence changes of Anap incorporated into the CCR (K555Anap) with a mutation in the hydrophobic spine were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The second slowly increasing component of fluorescence at higher membrane voltages was absent in the mutants L284Q and F285Q, which showed lower voltage-dependent phosphatase activity. On the other hand, the second phase of the fluorescence change was enhanced in the mutant L284F, which showed strong voltage-dependent phosphatase activity. To gain more insight, we also measured another two mutants in the hydrophobic spine (L284T for a mutation with a moderate enzyme activity and L284K for a mutation with a low enzyme activity) with K555Anap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the case of L284T, biphasic fluorescence changes of Anap were observed. Interestingly, the later increase was significantly smaller than that of WT, which is strong evidence for the later component as the conformation of a high enzymatic activity. On the other hand, L284K showed only a small fluorescent decrease, as L284Q. These findings indicate that VSP has two-active states with different CCR activities and that the hydrophobicity and presence of an aromatic ring in the hydrophobic spine drive the state transition to a fully activated state, thus ensuring robust enzyme activity.</p><p>These ideas were also supported by retrograde effects of mutation of the hydrophobic spine on the VSD, which was examined in a VCF experiment. The fluorescence changes of TMRM introduced in Gly-214, an extracellularly facing movable site of the VSD, demonstrated similar effects of mutation to those of Ci-VSP K555Anap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). F-V curves were fitted by the sum of two Boltzmann distributions in the WT and L284F, which had distinct voltage dependence, and the voltage dependence of the second component was shifted leftward in L284F as in the case for K555Anap, whereas L284Q and F285Q showed curves fitted by only one Boltzmann distribution. These results indicate that the transition states of the VSD are linked with those of the CCR, consistent with the idea that a mutation in the hydrophobic spine influences the transition between the two-active states of the CCR. To summarize, there are two CCR active states and the transition between the two active states requires tight coupling between the VSD and CCR that is dependent on the nature of the hydrophobic spine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41653.041</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of VSP activity: A model of two-step activation.</title><p>Two-step conformational and activity changes in VSP. The black sticks on the PD shows the hydrophobic spine consisting of amino acid side chains of Leu-284 and Phe-285.

The fluorescence changes of TMRM introduced into another site (Gln-208) in weak enzyme activity mutants (L284Q and F285Q, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5</xref>) showed similar voltage-dependent changes in fluorescence as those of Ci-VSP with mutations that affected the positive charges in the VSD-PD linker (K252Q, R253Q) in which the VSD is completely decoupled from the CCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kohout et al., 2010</xref>). These results suggested that the VSD-PD linker is required to couple VSD motion to the CCR, which initiates VSP enzyme activity. The hydrophobic spine also affects VSD-CCR coupling, but it has a different role than that of the VSD-PD linker. This spine mainly affects the later transition of the CCR, suggesting that it is needed to promote the state transition from the intermediate state to the fully activated state, whereas interaction between the VSD-PD linker and the active center of the PD is indispensable for initiating all enzymatic activities.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mechanistic insights into coupling between the VSD and CCR</title><p>The CG and AT MD simulations of the isolated CCR in this study show that the C2 domain is anchored to the plasma membrane through positive charges at the membrane interface of the C2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). On the other hand, PD is more loosely bound to the membrane because of the hydrophobic nature of the hydrophobic spine, suggesting that phosphatase activity is regulated by the hinge-like motion of the CCR through membrane binding and unbinding of PD in the membrane-anchored C2 domain. The location of the hydrophobic residues in such a polar microenvironment (i.e., phosphate and choline groups and water) is an anomalous feature of the hydrophobic spine, given that the side chains of Leu and Phe favor interactions with the deep hydrophobic core of phospholipids, with an approximate free energy of −20 and −14 kJ/mol, as inferred from simulations and experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">MacCallum et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MacCallum et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cordomí et al., 2012</xref>). This result may seem to conflict with our previous results that the distance between the CCR and plasma membrane was not significantly changed upon voltage-induced activation, based on the measurement by FRET between Anap and a membrane-embedded FRET quencher, dipicrylamine (DPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakata et al., 2016</xref>). However, it should be noted that we estimated the change in distance between the membrane and the C2 domain but not the phosphatase domain. Alternatively, there may be a detection limit for distance change in the FRET analysis.</p><p>Our MD simulation analyses suggested that the hydrophobic spine, likely in combination with flanking hydrophilic amino acid residues, regulates the membrane-PD interaction by fine-tuning the balance of hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity in the region. This suggestion was confirmed by electrophysiological and in vitro studies of Ci-VSP mutants. An experiment with a series of mutations into the hydrophobic spine showed that hydrophobicity is essential for maintaining phosphatase activity. The addition of an aromatic ring in the hydrophobic spine greatly enhanced voltage-dependent phosphatase activity but showed no effect on the innate phosphatase activity of the CCR. Further analysis of voltage-dependent conformational changes showed that the aromatic ring of the hydrophobic spine affects the transition of CCR between two active states, suggesting that the aromatic ring may stabilize the high activity state through tight interactions with the plasma membrane. There are some examples in which aromatic amino acids help proteins insert themselves into membranes. Studies of the membrane-tethered β2 subunit of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (Ca<sub>V</sub>) suggested that Ca<sub>V</sub> binds to the plasma membrane through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with basic and aromatic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miranda-Laferte et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim and Suh, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2017</xref>). In a study of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>), tryptophan plays an important role in binding to the plasma membrane, and removal of tryptophan at the interface lowers the affinity of PLA<sub>2</sub> to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gelb et al., 1999</xref>). Subtle differences among hydrophobic amino acid side chains in their dynamics in and near the phospholipid head groups can have profound impacts on voltage-dependent phosphatase activity.</p><p>We propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>) based on our results. When the VSD stays in the down state (the resting state), PD demonstrates no or weak interactions with the membrane phospholipids, so that the CCR cannot form a stable complex with substrates and no catalytic activity occurs. Under mild depolarization in which the VSD is partially activated, VSD motion is transmitted to the PD through the VSD-PD linker by pulling the PD up toward the membrane surface to form weak interactions with the membrane. At higher membrane voltages, the VSD is fully activated and the PD is tightly anchored to the membrane surface, inducing conformational changes in the CCR and a fully activated state with high phosphatase activity. In contrast, the C2 domain can tightly bind to membrane phospholipids at any time, supporting a fast response to membrane potential changes in VSP by keeping the PD close to the membrane.</p><p>In this model, we suggest that the hydrophobic spine in the VSP assists the tight coupling between the VSD and CCR by fine-tuning the membrane association of the PD. The hydrophobicity and aromatic ring in the hydrophobic spine are critical for this membrane association. Detailed mechanisms from a structural point of view will be discussed in the next section.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The hydrophobic spine shows features that are common among phosphoinositide phosphatases</title><p>The amino acid sequence of the CCR is highly homologous to that of PTEN, and the two crystal structures are similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matsuda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). The hydrophobic spine is also conserved in PTEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and its structure is directed toward membrane phospholipids, similar to VSP. Results of our in vitro malachite green assay showed that the hydrophobic spine affects the enzyme activity of PTEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Crystal structures suggest that hydrophobic amino acids near the substrate binding site play important roles in substrate binding and recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hsu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). A <italic>Legionella</italic> PI 3-phosphatase, SidF, hydrolyzes the 3-phosphates of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>. In the crystal structure of SidF with diC<sub>4</sub>-PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, Trp-420 and Phe-421 form hydrophobic protrusion loops that are oriented toward membrane lipid and show hydrophobic interactions with the acyl chain at the sn-2 position of diC<sub>4</sub>-PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> in the substrate binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hsu et al., 2012</xref>). Structures of the catalytic domains of proteins in the human 5-phosphatase family, INPP5B, OCRL, and SHIP2 also contain a highly hydrophobic cluster at the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). The INPP5B structure reveals that two hydrophobic clusters, LC1R (Phe-311, Phe-312, and Phe-313) and LC2R motifs (Ile-373, Met-374, and Met-377), interact with the acyl chain at the sn-2 position of the diC<sub>8</sub>-PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> substrate. OCRL has similar hydrophobic structure for binding the acyl chain of substrates, whereas SHIP2 lacks the region corresponding to the LC1R motif in INPP5B, and an in vitro phosphatase activity assay showed an isolated catalytic domain of SHIP2 with very low activity compared to that in the INPP5B and OCRL catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>). These structures are necessary for interaction with the acyl chain of the phosphoinositide and are anchored to the plasma membrane, suggesting that its binding to phosphoinositides allows substrate recognition. Interestingly, all of the hydrophobic clusters containing aromatic residues interact with the sn-2 acyl chain, not with the sn-1 chain.</p><p>Therefore, a characteristic cluster formed by hydrophobic residues near the binding pocket seems to be a common structural feature of phosphoinositide phosphatases. The hydrophobic spine of VSP may interact with the acyl chain of the substrate, as found in INPP5B, OCRL, and SHIP2. From a structural point of view, the spine contributes to the formation of the stable substrate binding pocket with active center, CBR3 loop, and gating loop, because mutations in the hydrophobic spine affect innate phosphatase activity in the CCR. The substrate must be pulled from membrane phospholipids for dephosphorylation by VSP. The hydrophobic spine may help the hydrophobic acyl chains of the substrate stabilize in the hydrophilic cytoplasmic environment. A detailed understanding of the relationships between the VSD, the CCR, and the substrate await elucidation of the high resolution structure of the whole VSP protein with phosphoinositide substrates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene <break/>(Ci.intestinalis)</td><td valign="top">Ci-VSP</td><td valign="top"><break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murata et al.

The reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 μg of recombinant hPTEN or the CCR of Ci-VSP at 23°C in 10 μL buffer solution [100 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.0)] including 1.0 nmol PIPs [di-C<sub>16</sub>-PI(3,4,5)<sub>3</sub>: hPTEN, di-C<sub>16</sub>-(PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>: Ci-VSP] and 9.0 nmol POPS. After 30 min of incubation, 100 mM NEM was added to terminate the reaction, and the mixture was centrifuged to remove aggregates. BIOMOL Green reagent (Enzo Life Sciences, USA) was added to the supernatants and incubated at 37°C to 30 min, and then the OD<sub>620</sub> was measured with a microplate reader (MultiScan FC: Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).

The injected oocytes were incubated for 2–3 days at 18°C in ND96 solution (5 mM Hepes, 96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.5), supplemented with gentamycin and pyruvate). The macroscopic current was recorded under a two-electrode voltage clamp using an Oocyte Clamp amplifier (OC-725C: Warner Instruments, USA). Stimulation, data acquisition, and analysis were performed on a Macintosh computer using an ITC-16 AD/DA converter and Pulse software (HEKA Electronik, Germany). Intracellular glass microelectrodes were filled with 3 M KCl. The microelectrode resistances ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 MΩ, and the ND96 solution was utilized as a bath solution.

BP535-555, BP570-625, and DM565 (Olympus, Japan) were used for the excitation filter, emission filter, and dichroic mirror, respectively. Fluorescence was detected using one PMT (H10722-20; Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan). The output of the PMT was digitized using an AD/DA converter (Digidata1440A: Molecular Device, USA) with a TEVC setup. ND96 was utilized as a bath solution. The amount of fluorescence bleaching was not subtracted from the values determined. Averaged traces from 4 to 8 traces were shown and were digitally filtered at 300 Hz.</p><p>Voltage clamp fluorometry with 3-(6-acetylnaphthalen-2-ylamino)−2-aminopropanoic acid (Anap) was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakata et al., 2016</xref>). For Anap incorporation, 20 nL of pAnap DNA solution (10 ng/μL) was injected into the nucleus of oocytes. Oocytes placed in Terasaki plates were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10–15 min. One day later, 1 mM Anap (FutureChem, Korea) and cRNA encoding Ci-VSP mutants, in which Lys-555 was mutated to a TAG codon (0.1–0.5 ng/nl), were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, and 50 nL of the mixture was injected into the oocytes under a dim red light. The oocytes were then incubated for 2–3 days in the dark. Equipment used to measure Anap signals was the same as for TMRM measurement, except for the following differences in the mirrors and PMTs. BP330-385 and DM400 (Olympus, Japan) were used for the excitation filter and dichroic mirror, respectively, and the fluorescence signal was separated by a second dichroic mirror (DM458: Olympus, Japan) and detected using two PMTs with emission filters (BP420-460 and BP460-510: Olympus, Japan). ND96 was utilized as the bath solution, and we did not correct for fluorescence bleaching.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yesylevskyy et al., 2010</xref>). A developer-provided script (Martinize) was used to assign CG particles to the peptide backbone and side chains of the crystal structure of the cytoplasmic catalytic region of Ci-VSP (PDB entry 3V0D covering 246–575) determined by Liu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Topological parameters, including dihedral angles, were set as recommended by the Martini 2.1 developer. Both the N- and C-terminal backbone atoms of the protein were left uncharged and were represented by a P5 particle. The topology parameters for CG PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> were prepared in a manner similar to that described by Stansfeld et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stansfeld et al., 2009</xref>); the inositol ring was represented by three SP1 particles, and two of them were bonded to one and two Qa particles, respectively, to represent the phosphate groups. Bond lengths of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> were adjusted based on our atomistic simulation data. For the protein, an elastic network was applied to all backbone particles using a force constant of 10 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup> and a cutoff distance of 7 Å to maintain the overall secondary and tertiary structures. PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> molecules were added to the monolayer of the bilayer that was closer to the initial position of the protein. In addition to the lipid components shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref> Cl<sup>-</sup> and 26 Na<sup>+</sup> ions were added to the simulation box for the POPC and POPC/PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> sets, respectively, to neutralize the total charge. For hydration, 5774 and 7069 PW particles were used for the POPC and POPC/PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> sets, respectively. Run parameters were taken from our previous analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishizawa and Nishizawa, 2014</xref>). Briefly, the relative dielectric coefficient was set at 2.5. The Lennard-Jones interactions smoothly shifted to zero between 0.9 to 1.2 nm, and the electrostatic interactions shifted to zero between 0 to 1.2 nm. The integration time step was set at 20 fs, the temperature was held at 320 K using the Berendsen algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berendsen et al., 1984</xref>), and the pressure was controlled at 1 bar using semi-isotropic coupling with the Berendsen algorithm, with and without the compressibility of the 3 × 10<sup>−4</sup> bar<sup>−1</sup>. Bond lengths were restrained using LINCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hess et al., 1997</xref>), and the protonation states of the titratable side chains of amino acids were the same as those in the atomistic (AT) simulations.

SPC (simple point charge) water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berendsen et al., 1984</xref>), and the crystal structure of the cytoplasmic catalytic region of Ci-VSP (PDB entry 3V0D) was used. The N- and C-termini were left uncharged using NH<sub>2</sub> and COOH groups, respectively. The AT topology parameters for PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> were prepared by grafting of the arachidonate parameters, as described by Ollila et al.

All of the 3'-, 4'-, and 5'-phosphate groups were assigned a charge of −2 and, in total, the PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> model had a charge of −7. The initial structure of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> was prepared using the original version of Winmoster provided by N.

The CCR was initially placed such that the center of mass of the CCR was 2.6–3.4 nm away from the layer of POPC phosphorus atoms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Run parameters, including temperature control at 323 K, were those recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nishizawa and Nishizawa, 2018</xref>), with the following differences.

In this orientation, the C<sub>β</sub> atom of His-332 and the C<sub>α</sub> atom Lys-367 in the catalytic center reside at nearly equal distances (with a difference &lt;0.3 Å) from the bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We considered this orientation to correspond to the productive orientation discussed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalli et al., 2014</xref>). For both present CG and AT simulations, we defined the productive orientation as the orientation with which the vector product of the vector 1 (the vector that arise from the C<sub>α</sub> atom of Arg-281 of the PD to the middle point between the Lys-516 C<sub>α</sub> and Arg-520 C<sub>α</sub> atoms) and the vector 2 (the vector that arises from the Arg-281 C<sub>α</sub> to the middle point of the Lys-555 C<sub>α</sub> and Lys-558 C<sub>α</sub> atoms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) forms an angle of 0–30° with the z-axis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Binding</title><p>To facilitate discussion of simulation results, it is important to define the 'binding' of proteins to phospholipid membranes. To help intuitive understanding, in the present simulation analyses we chose to define the 'binding' based on the distance of the protein atom with the highest z-coordinate (which we refer to as the 'top atom') from the phosphorus layer of the inner (lower) monolayer of the bilayer. We further chose to use distinct definitions of binding between the POPC and the POPC/PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> sets to allow for the effect of the phosphate groups linked to the inositol ring to prevent protein atoms from directly contacting with phosphorylcholine groups. For the AT POPC and POPC/PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> sets, we regarded the protein as being in the bound state when the top atom was located at 0 and −4 Å or at a higher z-position relative to the phosphorus layer, respectively. For the CG POPC and POPC/PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> sets, the bound state was similarly defined using the cutoff of −2 and −12 Å, respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Dr. Yoshihisa Kurachi (Osaka University) for providing the Kir3.2d plasmid, Drs.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The hydrophobic nature of a novel membrane interface regulates the enzyme activity in voltage-sensing phosphatase&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors show data in support of the role of two hydrophobic residues in VSP for regulating the phosphates activity of VSD. MD simulations show that two hydrophobic residues allow better contact with the membrane and that nearby hydrophilic residues prevent the insertion of the hydrophobic residues in the hydrophobic core of the membrane, so that there is some flexibility of the PD. Experimental results show that the hydrophobic nature of these residues promotes the phosphatase activity and also affects the VSD motion. The data and the story are convincing and complete.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection “Retrograde effects of mutations in the hydrophobic spine on VSD motion”, second paragraph, &quot;The normalized F-V relationship of L284F/G214C-TMRM shows that the fluorescence reached the -1 level over 100 mV as in WT/G214C-TMRM, whereas it did not reach the -1 level at greater than 100 mV in L284Q/G214C-TMRM and F285Q/G214C-TMRM&quot;: I don't understand this sentence. You mean that the FV didn't saturate at voltage &gt;100 mV for the mutants, but it saturated for WT?</p><p>2) Subsection “Retrograde effects of mutations in the hydrophobic spine on VSD motion”, fourth paragraph: Insert &quot;for WT&quot;, because you are not measuring at the peak for mutants. It is not clear what you are quantifying by measuring at this time and why? Just to show it is different at this particular time point?</p><p>3) Subsection “Retrograde effects of mutations in the hydrophobic spine on VSD motion”, fourth paragraph: You are mixing phases in time and voltage. What do you really mean at &gt; 100 mV? Along the voltage axis the first two phases have already occurred at &lt;100mV.</p><p>4) Subsection “Retrograde effects of mutations in the hydrophobic spine on VSD motion”, fourth paragraph: Is the third component the only one connected to coupling? If so, why is the first and second altered at V &gt;100mV also?</p><p>5) Subsection “Analysis of the fluorescence of an unnatural amino acid, Anap, suggests two-step activation of the CCR”, second paragraph: This is not a clear description of what happens. A relative larger fluorescence signal at higher voltages (meaning that the F saturates at a less positive voltage) should give a leftward shift. As written right now, it sounds like there are two effects.</p><p>6) Discussion section, first paragraph, &quot;provide high movability&quot;: It seems like it is the hydrophilic residues that provides mobility, not the hydrophobic residues which would anchor it more to the membrane.</p><p>7) Subsection “The hydrophobic spine controls the later transition of enzyme activation”, fourth paragraph: It is not clear how you distinguish between effect directly on VSD of mutations and retrograde coupling.</p><p>8) Subsection “Mechanistic insights into coupling between the VSD and CCR”, end of first paragraph: This sentence is not clear, tell what was found earlier and describe why or why not consistent with present data.</p><p>9) Subsection “Mechanistic insights into coupling between the VSD and CCR”, second paragraph, &quot;membrane-tethered β2 subunit suggested that Ca<sub>V</sub> binds&quot;: What are β2 and Ca<sub>V</sub>? This is not explained.</p><p>10) Figure 11. What happens in VSD between middle and right panel? Should voltage do anything here? If so, shouldn't S4 move further out then?</p><p>11) No evidence for two different catalytic rates were observed. Multiple VSP states have been reported by other scientists, including a report from these authors (Sakata and Okamura, 2014), revealing two VSD states when testing VSD mutants but that publication does not show a difference in the catalytic activity. Experimental evidence for two catalytic states, low and high activity is needed.</p><p>(Below is the alternative suggested by the other reviewer:</p><p>I think to measure the catalytic activity with such precision as to be able to detect the low activity state is hard. This is because there will be a monotonic increase in the amount of VSP in the high activity state with increasing voltage and the voltage range for this increase and the voltage range for the proposed low activity is partly overlapping. One possibility is to have them remove the low activity of the intermediate state and just claim that the hydrophobic spine increases the catalytic activity by just altering the population in the high activity state. I don't think to explain their data, that it is necessary for their model to have the low activity in the intermediate state (it could just be no activity in the intermediate state). So my recommendation is to remove this if they don't have more data for the low activity. Removing this will not detract from the rest of their findings or conclusions.)</p><p>12) Both the Abstract and the Discussion emphasize a two state active model for VSP based on this data. While the Anap data clearly shows two states that go to one state with the Q mutations, the TMRM data is much less clear. Previous publications have all fit the G214C-TMRM data with a single Boltzmann. I would like to see residuals or other analysis that a double Boltzmann is required to accurately fit the data. I'm also concerned that two states in a fluorescence trace (whether TMRM or Anap) is interpreted as low and high activity state.</p><p>13) Regarding the interpretation of the electrophysiology and fluorescence, one of the conclusions the authors state is that there is a preference for aromaticity in the 284 position. Many of the comparisons between WT and L284F show that they are barely or only slightly different from each other. The hydrophobicity interpretation is a much stronger conclusion.</p><p>14) I have one concern regarding how the MD data is presented. Overall, description of the MD simulations was difficult to follow. I bounced back and forth between all of the supplementary figures to be able to understand how the experiments were done and how they were being interpreted. The low resolution of the supplementary figures made this more challenging as well. One aspect that confused me was the units. The MD simulations are in nm and the text in the Results section states binding was observed in Figure 2—figure supplement 2H for example. The &quot;position from lower monolayer P atoms&quot; for panel H range from -4 to -2 nm or -40 to -20 angstroms. The Materials and methods state that the binding is defined as -2 and -12 Å in the CG set. This range does not agree with the what is written in the Results section or the data. Is one of these units or values typos? Further explanation is needed to understand why the authors chose 0 and -4 Å for the AT simulations and another set of numbers for the CG set as well.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41653.046</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection “Retrograde effects of mutations in the hydrophobic spine on VSD motion”, second paragraph, &quot;The normalized F-V relationship of L284F/G214C-TMRM shows that the fluorescence reached the -1 level over 100 mV as in WT/G214C-TMRM, whereas it did not reach the -1 level at greater than 100 mV in L284Q/G214C-TMRM and F285Q/G214C-TMRM&quot;: I don't understand this sentence.

We consider that fluorescence changes do include both of two effects, since the statistic analysis in Figure 10 and Table 2 showed significant differences in the amplitude of fluorescence intensity and voltage dependence.

We agree that a careful discussion benefits here. As the reviewer points out, and based on the MacCullum et al. (2008), we think that in the layer of the lipid head groups near the phosphorus atoms, not only the hydrophobic but also the hydrophilic residues help movability of the hydrophobic spine. So, we have now changed this sentence of the Discussion as follows: “Our MD simulations of the CCR suggested that the combination of the hydrophobic spine consisting of two conserved hydrophobic amino acids (Leu-284 and Phe-285), and the flanking hydrophilic residues provides high mobility to the PD in and near the membrane/water interface.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Subsection “The hydrophobic spine controls the later transition of enzyme activation”, fourth paragraph: It is not clear how you distinguish between effect directly on VSD of mutations and retrograde coupling?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful comment. We guess that actual molecular mechanisms by hydrophobic spine will still remain unclear until the protein structure of the full-length VSP is solved. We think that the hydrophobic spine is critical for anterograde coupling from the voltage sensor domain to enzyme activity as proposed in this paper. Effect of mutation of the hydrophobic spine on the voltage sensor motion is significant as we demonstrated in VCF results of G214C-TMRM. This retrograde coupling serves as a good quantitative indicator of coupling between the voltage sensor and enzyme region based on the tight coupling between the two regions. We think that effect on the motion of voltage sensor by mutation in the hydrophobic spine is due to the change of coupling condition between the two regions. It is unlikely that our results of changes of voltage-dependent enzyme activity upon mutation of the hydrophobic spine are due to the altered motion of the voltage sensor, since there is no evidence that hydrophobic spine stays next to the S4 or interact with other helices of the voltage sensor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Subsection “Mechanistic insights into coupling between the VSD and CCR”, end of first paragraph: This sentence is not clear, tell what was found earlier and describe why or why not consistent with present data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your helpful comment. This part was revised so that the meaning is clearer. We previously reported that the distance between the CCR and membrane was not significantly changed. However, we only estimated the distance from the C2 domain in our previous report. In the present study, we assume that the distance between the phosphatase domain and membrane is changed, whereas the C2 domain stays anchored to the membrane irrespective of the state of VSD. Then, we changed the sentence, “This result may seem to conflict with our previous results that the distance between the CCR and plasma membrane was not significantly changed upon voltage-induced activation based on the measurement by FRET between Anap and a membrane-embedded FRET quencher, dipicrylamine (DPA)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Subsection “Mechanistic insights into coupling between the VSD and CCR”, second paragraph, &quot;membrane-tethered β2 subunit suggested that Ca<sub>V</sub> binds&quot;: What are β2 and Ca<sub>V</sub>? This is not explained.</p></disp-quote><p>In this sentence, we mentioned voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, “Ca<sub>V</sub>”. We modified the sentence, “Studies of the membrane-tethered β2 subunit of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (Ca<sub>V</sub>) suggested that Ca<sub>V</sub> binds to the plasma membrane…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 11. What happens in VSD between middle and right panel? Should voltage do anything here? If so, shouldn't S4 move further out then?</p></disp-quote><p>We think that VSD has two-step activation because the F-V curve of G214C-TMRM could be fitted by the sum of two Boltzmann distributions. We therefore redrew the cartoon of the VSP in the middle panel of Figure 11, making it clearer that the position of S4 is in the intermediate state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) No evidence for two different catalytic rates were observed. Multiple VSP states have been reported by other scientists, including a report from these authors (Sakata and Okamura, 2014), revealing two VSD states when testing VSD mutants but that publication does not show a difference in the catalytic activity. Experimental evidence for two catalytic states, low and high activity is needed.</p><p>(Below is the alternative suggested by the other reviewer:</p><p>I think to measure the catalytic activity with such precision as to be able to detect the low activity state is hard. This is because there will be a monotonic increase in the amount of VSP in the high activity state with increasing voltage and the voltage range for this increase and the voltage range for the proposed low activity is partly overlapping. One possibility is to have them remove the low activity of the intermediate state and just claim that the hydrophobic spine increases the catalytic activity by just altering the population in the high activity state. I don't think to explain their data, that it is necessary for their model to have the low activity in the intermediate state (it could just be no activity in the intermediate state). So my recommendation is to remove this if they don't have more data for the low activity. Removing this will not detract from the rest of their findings or conclusions.)</p></disp-quote><p>Our idea of low enzyme activity for the middle state in our scheme mainly came from our findings of Anap fluorescence pattern from low-enzyme activity mutants (L284Q). The main conclusion in our paper is that there are at least two steps of enzyme activation until the protein reaches a full enzyme activation, and we think how enzyme is active in the middle state still needs further careful analysis. As pointed out, we did not provide conclusive experimental evidence for two reaction rates of enzyme activity of Ci-VSP although we suggested that in our scheme of enzyme activation in the previous version.</p><p>In this version, we studied Anap fluorescence from more constructs of mutants with varied enzyme activity, L284K and L284T. L284K shows lower enzyme activity than L284Q. L284T shows moderate enzyme activity between L284Q and WT. The low-enzyme activity mutant L284K showed the F-V curve with single Boltzmann function with negativity as L284Q. On the other hand, L284T showed mainly 1<sup>st</sup> component but a notch was noted at higher voltage, suggesting the presence of a small but significant later component. This is consistent with our idea that the second component is critical for robust enzyme activity. These new results are now included as Figure 10—figure supplement 2.</p><p>Nevertheless, we need to admit that we cannot completely exclude a possibility that the enzyme at the middle state (partially activated state) has no enzyme activity, since we have not provided evidence for low enzyme activity of the wild type, due to overwhelming robust enzyme activity of the second component (as discussed by another reviewer). This test must require simultaneous detection of enzyme activity and of protein conformation at the single protein level in the membrane which is not available so far. Therefore, some phrases of “low enzyme activity in the middle state” were deleted from the text, and the reason for our idea of “low enzyme activity in the middle state” was more clearly stated in the figure legend and modified the phrase in the figure from “Inactive -&gt; Low activity -&gt; High activity” to “Resting state -&gt; Partially-activated state -&gt; Fully-activated state” (Figure 11). We also weakened the phrase “showed” to “suggest” in the Abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Both the Abstract and the Discussion emphasize a two state active model for VSP based on this data. While the Anap data clearly shows two states that go to one state with the Q mutations, the TMRM data is much less clear. Previous publications have all fit the G214C-TMRM data with a single Boltzmann. I would like to see residuals or other analysis that a double Boltzmann is required to accurately fit the data. I'm also concerned that two states in a fluorescence trace (whether TMRM or Anap) is interpreted as low and high activity state.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your important comment. As the reviewers noted, in all of previous reports on VCF data of G214CTMRM, the F-V relationship could be fitted by a single Boltzmann. To confirm the reproducibility of our data, therefore, we performed more experiments of examining the fluorescence changes of G214C-TMRM. As in the results which we previously showed, a combination of two Boltzmann functions fit the data better again than single component of Boltzmann function in the new data set as shown as the modified figure showing analyses of three individual cells (Cell 1 and 2 are from the previous data and Cell 3 is from the new data: Figure 10—figure supplement 1). Kinetics of fluorescence changes upon activation could be fitted by double exponential function as observed in previous reports, suggesting that VSP takes two-step transition. However, as pointed out, contribution of the lower-voltage component (red curve in Figure 10—figure supplement 1) in fluorescence change of G214C-TMRM to the whole F-V curve is much less clear than in Anap study. This was probably the reason why in previous publications single Boltzmann function appeared to be sufficient to fit VCF data.</p><p>Regarding the comment “I'm also concerned that two states in a fluorescence trace (whether TMRM or Anap) is interpreted as low and high activity state”please see our above response to the comment 11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Regarding the interpretation of the electrophysiology and fluorescence, one of the conclusions the authors state is that there is a preference for aromaticity in the 284 position. Many of the comparisons between WT and L284F show that they are barely or only slightly different from each other. The hydrophobicity interpretation is a much stronger conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that aromaticity in the hydrophobic spine has significant contribution to its role in regulation of enzyme activity for the following reasons:</p><p>1) Voltage-dependent enzyme activity of mutant harboring additional aromatic residue on the hydrophobic spine (on the 284<sup>th</sup> residue) as estimated by GIRK channel activities was deviated to a positive direction from the linear relationship between hydrophobicity and enzyme activity as shown in the plot of Figure 5B.</p><p>2) Motion of VSD is clearly affected by addition of aromatic residue on 284<sup>th</sup> as examined by voltage clamp fluorometry of TMR attached on the voltage sensor (Figure 8—figure supplement 3) through the tight coupling between enzyme and voltage sensor in VSP. We have recently obtained similar enhancement of voltage-dependent enzyme activity of the zebrafish VSP by addition of aromatic residue.</p><p>3) Using another PIP<sub>2</sub> reporter, KCNQ2/3 channel, we found similar enhancement of voltage-dependent enzyme activity of L284F as compared with WT (Figure 5—figure supplement 3).</p><p>4) Elimination of hydrophobic residue on the spine remarkably reduces both the in vitro enzyme activity by the malachite green assay and in vivo enzyme activity in oocyte, whereas elimination of aromatic ring from the spine only affected the latter activity, indicating that aromatic ring has distinct effect than the hydrophobicity, as pointed out in the previous version of our manuscript.</p><p>Nevertheless, in the previous version, we have not demonstrated statistical differences of F-V data between WT and L284F. Therefore, we performed similar experiment of VCF measurement of Anap on the L284F mutant and obtained more data (summarized in Figure 9 and Table 2). Significant differences were found between the WT and L284F mutant after new data were added. These results indicate that Anap F-V curve from L284F shows a larger second component with leftward shift of voltage range than the WT. We thus conclude that aromaticity also plays an important role in Ci-VSP activity and its state transition as well as hydrophobicity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) I have one concern regarding how the MD data is presented. Overall, description of the MD simulations was difficult to follow. I bounced back and forth between all of the supplementary figures to be able to understand how the experiments were done and how they were being interpreted. The low resolution of the supplementary figures made this more challenging as well. One aspect that confused me was the units. The MD simulations are in nm and the text in the Results section states binding was observed in Figure 2—figure supplement 2H for example. The &quot;position from lower monolayer P atoms&quot; for panel H range from -4 to -2 nm or -40 to -20 angstroms. The Materials and methods state that the binding is defined as -2 and -12 Å in the CG set. This range does not agree with the what is written in the Results section or the data. Is one of these units or values typos? Further explanation is needed to understand why the authors chose 0 and -4 Å for the AT simulations and another set of numbers for the CG set as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the poor presentation in our original version that caused difficulty reviewing. Now we have moved the table (that summarizes of the simulations) from the supplementary file to the main text (Table 1). This would help, as we now have only two files in total.</p><p>In terms of the low resolution of the figures, we feel that some resolution is lost upon the conversion to the PDF. Just in case, we have now improved the panels of Figure 2—figure supplement 2, 4 and 5.</p><p>Regarding the issue of Å and nm in Materials and methods and Figure 2—figure supplement 2: we actually made no mistake, but we understand that our writing was confusing. In Materials and methods and in the AT data (Figure 2—figure supplement 4), we described the 'binding', so the z-position of the 'top atom' relative to the mean z-position of the P atoms was plotted. In the Table 1 as well, to summarize the time period of the bound state, we also computed the top atom position and distance from the P-layer for all AT and CG simulations. However, in the CG trajectory data, 'the peptide com (the center of mass) z-position' was plotted (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). We favor this presentation scheme because it is customary to show the z-position of the ‘com’ of the protein in CG analyses, and, unlike AT simulations, in CG simulations the protein orientation changes widely (due to the lack of the anchoring to the VSD), and therefore the top atom often changes artifactually. For these reasons, we think to show the ‘com’ movement is a reasonable presentation scheme. In this regard, we have now added some lines in the legend for Figure 2—figure supplement 2 legend to emphasize that, in the Table 1 the top atom was used whereas in the Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ‘com’ was used.</p><p>In terms of the definition of the 'binding', we used definitions differing between the AT and CG analyses, as the reviewer points out. For example, the binding to POPC membrane was defined using 0 Å (or above) for AT and -2 Å (or above) for CG, relative to the phosphorus layer. This is because the CG model employs large particles; the Lennard-Jones potential sigma parameters (i.e., the distance at which the attractive and the repulsive forces cancel each other) for most CG beads are about 4.7 Å, and that for C atom of the AT model is 3.5 Å. In the case of the PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-containig POPC membrane, we defined the 'binding' as the top atom positioning at -4 Å (or above) for AT and -12 Å (or above) for CG simulations. This large difference was based on our observation that in CG simulations, both PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> molecules and protein have smooth and round surfaces, hampering PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> to get into the groove of the protein (VSP), whereas in the AT simulations PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> can enter into the groove of the protein enabling the tight contact between the VSP and the membrane. So, we have now just added a brief comment on these matters in the Materials and methods section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
