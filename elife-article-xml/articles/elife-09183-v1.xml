(ITAMs) initiates the macrophage antimicrobial response. ITAM receptors engage Src-family tyrosine kinases (SFKs) to initiate phagocytosis and macrophage activation. Macrophages also encounter nonpathogenic molecules that cluster receptors weakly and must tune their sensitivity to avoid inappropriate responses. To investigate this response threshold, we compared signaling in the presence and absence of receptor clustering using a small-molecule inhibitor of Csk, which increased SFK activation and produced robust membrane-proximal signaling. Surprisingly, receptor-independent SFK activation led to a downstream signaling blockade associated with rapid degradation of the SFK LynA. Inflammatory priming of macrophages upregulated LynA and promoted receptor-independent signaling. In contrast, clustering the hemi-ITAM receptor Dectin-1 induced signaling that did not require LynA or inflammatory priming. Together, the basal-state signaling checkpoint regulated by LynA expression and degradation and the signaling reorganization initiated by receptor clustering allow cells to discriminate optimally between pathogens and nonpathogens.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09183.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09183.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09183.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Macrophages are white blood cells that protect the body from infection by bacteria and other microbes. Proteins and sugars on the microbe bind to receptor proteins on the surface of the macrophage, which triggers the macrophage to engulf the cell and destroy it. Macrophages also release molecules that are toxic to the microbe and activate other immune responses in the body. It is vital that macrophages can tell the difference between normal body cells and microbes because if macrophages are activated at the wrong time, they can damage tissues and cause inflammatory diseases.</p><p>When the receptor proteins are activated by contact with a microbe, they interact with a family of proteins called SFKs, which in turn stimulate communication systems called signaling pathways inside the macrophages that activate their immune responses. However, these responses are only triggered if many receptors are activated and clustered together. Thus, macrophages are able to identify whether a cell is a normal part of the body or is a foreign invader by sensing the number of receptors that cluster together as they bind to the cell. However, it is not clear if it is the clustering itself that signals a genuine encounter with a microbe, or whether this information comes from the strength of the response by the SFK proteins.</p><p>Here, Freedman et al. addressed this question by developing a new experimental system that allows SFKs to be directly activated in macrophages in the absence of receptor clusters. The experiments used macrophages obtained from genetically engineered mice and found that the direct activation of SFK proteins alone does not fully activate signaling pathways in the macrophages. A signaling blockade occurs due to the rapid destruction of an SFK protein called LynA. When the macrophages were exposed to molecules that are signals of inflammation in the body, they produced more LynA. This allowed these macrophages to be activated even without the formation of receptor clusters by interactions with pathogens.</p><p>Freedman et al.'s findings reveal that LynA acts as a checkpoint that primes macrophages to respond more aggressively when the body is under attack. Future work will be aimed at understanding how LynA is destroyed and how the detection of real pathogens overcomes the checkpoint.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09183.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09183.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>cell signaling</kwd><kwd>Src-family kinases</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>ITAMs</kwd><kwd>receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32AI082926</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freedman</surname><given-names>Tanya S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Minnesota Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Award NF-0315-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freedman</surname><given-names>Tanya S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32AR007304-33</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freedman</surname><given-names>Tanya S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32AR007304-34</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freedman</surname><given-names>Tanya S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5P01AI091580</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weiss</surname><given-names>Arthur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1AI65495</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lowell</surname><given-names>Clifford A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1AI68150</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lowell</surname><given-names>Clifford A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1AI113272</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lowell</surname><given-names>Clifford A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Degradation of kinase LynA protects macrophages from activation unless cells sense a receptor-binding pathogen or inflammation</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Macrophages are myeloid-derived hematopoietic cells that guard against infection and orchestrate a broad immune response to pathogens. Bridging the innate and adaptive immune systems, they survey tissues for signs of pathogen invasion and present antigen to T cells. When activated, they engulf and destroy foreign organisms and secrete cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mosser and Edwards, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murray and Wynn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wynn et al., 2013</xref>). While macrophage activity promotes an effective immune response to tissue distress, inappropriate activation of macrophages can cause tissue injury. Accumulation of activated macrophages is linked to diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murray and Wynn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wynn et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Macrophage stimulation through immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)- and hemi-ITAM-coupled receptors initiates pathogen destruction via phagocytosis and the production of reactive oxygen species, which require activated macrophages to be physically close to the pathogen. To prevent nonproductive activation and tissue damage, macrophages must differentiate between receptor ligands displayed during a pathogen encounter (e.g., a β-glucan-presenting fungal cell wall or an IgG-opsonized cell) vs. environmental noise (e.g., glycans shed from fungi or other cell debris). One mechanism by which cells make this distinction is by using receptor clustering to sense the size of a potential stimulus. Large-diameter stimuli that are more likely to be associated with pathogenic particles nucleate large-scale receptor clusters, forming a signaling complex called a phagocytic synapse. In contrast, small-diameter stimuli induce only small-scale or transient receptor clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goodridge et al., 2011</xref>). Hereafter, we will refer to ligands that cluster ITAM/hemi-ITAM receptors efficiently as ‘strong stimuli’ and ligands that cluster receptors poorly as ‘weak stimuli’. In mast cells, a related myeloid subtype, treatment with a high dose of weak stimulus can produce robust receptor phosphorylation without stable receptor clustering. Interestingly, the resulting membrane-proximal signaling patterns, as well as the associated immunopathologies, are qualitatively different than those produced in response to a strong stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carroll-Portillo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>), which indicates that myeloid cells can distinguish between strong and weak stimuli beyond simply sensing the degree of receptor phosphorylation.</p><p>Receptor engagement initiates interactions with an active pool of Src-family tyrosine kinases (SFKs), which phosphorylate intracellular ITAMs within the receptor, the tyrosine kinase Syk, cytoskeleton-associated proteins, and other membrane-proximal signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lowell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goodridge et al., 2011</xref>). This membrane-proximal signaling initiates downstream signaling, including the phospholipase Cγ-mitogen-activated protein kinase (PLCγ-MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-protein kinase B/Akt (PI3K-Akt) pathways. The signaling cascades initiated by the SFKs in response to strong stimuli then enact a transcriptional program of macrophage activation leading to microbicidal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lowell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byeon et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To some extent, macrophages can modulate their responsiveness to activating stimuli according to their environment. For example, inflammatory cytokines secreted by other immune cells trigger a process termed inflammatory priming, a transcriptional program that increases macrophage reactivity. Priming is known to upregulate the expression of proteins involved in signal detection, pathogen killing, and stimulation of other immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Platanias, 2005</xref>). However, it is not clear how inflammation might modulate macrophage responses to weak stimuli by changing the extent of receptor clustering necessary for downstream signaling.</p><p>It is also unclear whether strong macrophage stimuli are defined by their ability to robustly activate the SFKs or whether receptor clustering itself relays qualitative information that indicates a genuine pathogen encounter. Clustered receptors are immobilized within the cell membrane, participate in costimulatory interactions, and organize the signaling complex spatially, integrating SFK-dependent and SFK-independent steps into a productive signaling response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sohn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bethani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dustin and Groves, 2012</xref>). Until now, it has not been possible to study the contributions of SFK activity to macrophage activation independently of the integrated effects of receptor clustering.</p><p>To investigate the role of SFK activation in macrophage signaling independently of ligand-induced receptor clustering, we developed an experimental system to activate the SFKs directly by inhibiting their negative regulator, the tyrosine kinase Csk. Csk phosphorylates the inhibitory-tail tyrosine of the SFKs, promoting an autoinhibited state in which the SH2 domain of the SFK interacts with the phosphorylated inhibitory tail and constrains the kinase domain in an inactive conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown and Cooper, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Okada, 2012</xref>). The phosphatases CD45 and CD148 dephosphorylate the inhibitory-tail tyrosine of the SFK, releasing this autoinhibition and enabling subsequent activation-loop autophosphorylation and full activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chow and Veillette, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). The continuous competition of Csk and CD45/CD148 sets the steady state of SFK inhibitory-tail phosphorylation in the cell. Inhibiting Csk activity disrupts this steady state, allowing CD45 and CD148 initiate bulk SFK activation unopposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schoenborn et al., 2011</xref>). We previously described a Csk variant (analog-sensitive Csk, ‘Csk<sup>AS</sup>’) that is sensitized to inhibition by a 3-iodobenzyl analog of the kinase inhibitor PP1 (3-IB-PP1). The bulkiness of 3-IB-PP1 prevents its interaction with WT Csk and other WT kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Okuzumi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schoenborn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). We have also described a transgenic mouse that expresses Csk<sup>AS</sup> but not WT Csk and have studied the effects of Csk<sup>AS</sup> inhibition in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schoenborn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). Macrophages express a distinct subset of Src family members (Lyn, Hck, and Fgr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lowell, 2004</xref>), and, unlike naive T cells, macrophages express the ITAM-proximal kinase Syk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) and SFK-dependent negative-regulatory phosphatases associated with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Veillette et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lowell, 2004</xref>). This distinct membrane-proximal signaling environment likely modifies the signaling program initiated by macrophage receptors in service of cell-specific functions.</p><p>We derived macrophages from the bone marrow of <italic>Csk</italic><sup><italic>AS</italic></sup> mice and compared SFK signaling without receptor clustering (by inhibiting Csk<sup>AS</sup> with 3-IB-PP1) to SFK signaling induced by receptor clustering (by ligating the hemi-ITAM receptor Dectin-1 with depleted zymosan). Receptor-independent SFK activation by 3-IB-PP1 induced robust membrane-proximal signaling but no downstream signaling through the MAPKs or Akt. We determined that this signaling blockade was caused by rapid degradation of the SFK LynA, which resulted in a loss of function that could not be compensated for by the other SFKs. We were able to rescue downstream signaling by priming the macrophages, which led to the upregulation of LynA. Receptor clustering enabled the participation of the other SFKs in the activation of downstream MAPK, Akt, and calcium signaling independently of LynA. From the data presented in this article, we propose a model to explain how macrophages are prevented from responding to weak stimuli, how inflammation increases macrophage sensitivity to weak stimuli, and how receptor clustering rewires SFK signaling to enable macrophage activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SFK activation in the absence of receptor clustering fails to induce downstream signaling</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Inhibiting Csk in macrophages leads to rapid SFK activation</title><p>We generated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from <italic>Csk</italic><sup><italic>AS</italic></sup> mice and verified that they express normal levels of myeloid and macrophage surface markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

In fact, SFK activation by this maximally effective dose of 3-IB-PP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2014</xref>) produced much more robust membrane-proximal signaling than did zymosan<sup>dep</sup>, where an increase in SFK activation-loop phosphorylation was not even detectable. It is possible that our failure to detect SFK activation-loop phosphorylation in response to zymosan<sup>dep</sup> was due to only a small, local pool of SFKs being activated at the site of receptor clustering, as suggested by previous imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goodridge et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, perhaps an increase in SFK activation is not the initiating event of receptor-mediated signaling. Rather, it is the interaction of clustered receptors with a preexisting pool of active SFKs, whose function is somehow blocked outside of large-scale receptor clusters. This model would be consistent with recent studies in T cells in which a basally active pool of SFKs is the major driver of TCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nika et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Manz et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The bulky structure of 3-IB-PP1 should increase its specificity for Csk<sup>AS</sup> over WT kinases, and we have shown experimentally that 3-IB-PP1 is 30-fold more selective for Csk<sup>AS</sup> than for WT Csk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). However, all ATP-mimetic kinase inhibitors, even the bulkier analogs, have the potential for nonspecific interactions with kinase active sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bain et al., 2007</xref>). To minimize the possibility that an off-target effect of 3-IB-PP1 blocks Erk phosphorylation by a Csk<sup>AS</sup>-independent mechanism, we treated WT BMDMs with a combination of zymosan<sup>dep</sup> and increasing concentrations of 3-IB-PP1 and found no suppression of Erk phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Signaling in response to the growth factor M-CSF, which initiates Erk and Akt signaling through the CSF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pixley and Stanley, 2004</xref>), was similarly unaffected by 3-IB-PP1 in WT BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also tested 3-IB-PP1 specificity by treating WT and Csk<sup>AS</sup> BMDMs with 3-IB-PP1 and assessing global tyrosine phosphorylation by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As expected, tyrosine phosphorylation in WT BMDMs was insensitive to 3-IB-PP1. We conclude that the specific inhibitory effect of 3-IB-PP1 on Csk<sup>AS</sup>, not a nonspecific effect, causes the measured signaling responses. Interestingly, we found that 3-IB-PP1 impaired Erk and Akt responses to M-CSF in Csk<sup>AS</sup> BMDMs, suggesting that the failure of Erk signaling in response to 3-IB-PP1 arises from an active signaling blockade rather than a quantitative failure of membrane-proximal signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Treating Csk<sup>AS</sup> CD4/CD8 double-positive thymocytes with 3-IB-PP1 induces robust Erk phosphorylation only in the presence of small-molecule actin remodeling agents or when combined with costimulation through the CD28 pathway, which leads to actin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). We performed analogous experiments with BMDMs by adding Cytochalasin D, Latrunculin A, or Jasplakinolide in combination with 3-IB-PP1 or zymosan<sup>dep</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Although actin remodeling affected Erk phosphorylation in response to zymosan<sup>dep</sup>, it did not increase Erk phosphorylation in response to 3-IB-PP1. This finding suggests that the signaling blockade between activated SFKs and Erk in the absence of receptor clustering is fundamentally different in macrophages than in thymocytes, reflecting the different functions of actin remodeling and costimulatory pathways in signal initiation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Priming macrophages with inflammatory cytokines overcomes their dependence on receptor clustering for downstream signaling</title><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Inflammatory priming of macrophages rescues signaling downstream of SFK activation by 3-IB-PP1</title><p>Macrophages become more responsive to some stimuli following priming with inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ).

This observation is especially striking because Syk phosphorylation continued to increase over time during treatment with 3-IB-PP1 in either primed or unprimed cells and also during treatment with zymosan<sup>dep</sup> and was therefore kinetically uncoupled from downstream signaling through Erk and Akt. Additionally, even the transient, low-level proximal signaling in response to 3-IB-PP1 in unprimed cells was quantitatively equivalent to or higher in magnitude than the signaling in response to zymosan<sup>dep</sup>. Finally, as mentioned above, cotreatment with 3-IB-PP1 suppressed signaling through the CSF-1R pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these observations reinforce our claim that unprimed cells do not simply fail to reach a quantitative signaling threshold. Rather, a more qualitative difference in signaling circuitry explains the differential effects of priming on 3-IB-PP1 vs zymosan<sup>dep</sup> signaling.

Surprisingly, we found that priming actually enhanced the phosphorylation of proteins that negatively regulate signaling, including the ITIM-containing protein Sirpα, the inositol phosphatase SHIP1, and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), which led to activation of the negative-regulatory adaptor Dok-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data indicate that priming does not generally inhibit negative feedback in macrophages. However, the increased phosphorylation of negative regulatory proteins in primed cells provided a clue to the upstream factor driving signaling in response to 3-IB-PP1: Since the SFK Lyn is the primary kinase responsible for phosphorylating and activating ITIMs and their associated phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ravetch and Lanier, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lowell, 2010</xref>), we hypothesized that Lyn is driving signaling and that its expression or function is enhanced by IFN-γ priming.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09183.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Activated SFKs initiate negative-regulatory ITIM pathways.</title><p>Immunoblots show phosphorylation of negative regulatory proteins Sirpα, SHIP1, and SHP-1 in unprimed and IFN-γ-primed Csk<sup>AS</sup> BMDMs treated with 3-IB-PP1 or zymosan<sup>dep</sup>.

The basal expression level of Lyn sets this threshold, and this level of expression can be tuned by the extracellular milieu: inflammation initiates a program that overrides this LynA-mediated signaling checkpoint, thereby sensitizing macrophages to stimuli that fail to cluster receptors efficiently. In addition, we have found that a unique function of receptor clustering reorganizes signaling through the SFKs, bypassing LynA and enabling Hck- and Fgr-mediated downstream signaling.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we examined signaling in BMDMs induced by activating the SFKs in the absence of receptor clustering (by inhibiting Csk<sup>AS</sup> with 3-IB-PP1) and compared this to signaling induced by receptor clustering (mediated by the Dectin-1 ligand zymosan<sup>dep</sup>). Treatment with 3-IB-PP1 induced robust membrane-proximal signaling, but signal propagation was blocked downstream of PLCγ and PI3K, with no apparent activation of Erk, JNK, Akt, or NFAT. We determined that propagation of receptor-independent signaling induced by 3-IB-PP1 requires the SFK LynA, but we observed that LynA protein was almost completely degraded within the first three minutes after 3-IB-PP1 addition. This blockade was overcome by priming macrophages with IFN-γ or GM-CSF before 3-IB-PP1 treatment, which led to increased expression of LynA, thus buffering it against total degradation and leading to a more sustained presence of LynA during the first minutes of 3-IB-PP1 treatment. The other macrophage SFKs, Hck and Fgr, were also activated in response to 3-IB-PP1 treatment but were not capable of compensating for the lack of LynA activity after LynA degradation or in Lyn-deficient cells. In contrast, receptor clustering by zymosan<sup>dep</sup> induced signaling through the MAPKs and Akt independently of LynA function and inflammatory priming.</p><p>3-IB-PP1 induces SFK activation without large-scale receptor clustering or formation of a phagocytic synapse, a quality shared with weak physiological stimuli. In the experiments discussed here, we treated cells with a high dose of 3-IB-PP1 to induce robust SFK activation and unmask signaling that would otherwise be undetectable with weak stimulation. When we titrate 3-IB-PP1 to lower doses, the signaling pattern is unchanged, just generally weaker in strength. Therefore, we believe that the strong SFK activation in response to 3-IB-PP1 is an advantage of this experimental system and allows the comparison of signaling in the absence of receptor clustering, as in a weak physiological stimulus, to signaling in response to zymosan<sup>dep</sup>, which mimics a strong physiological stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goodridge et al., 2011</xref>). In this context, differences in signaling between 3-IB-PP1- and zymosan<sup>dep</sup>-treated cells reveal how receptor clustering relays signaling information. Importantly, we found that Erk, JNK, Akt, and NFAT activation patterns do not only depend on the strength of SFK activation and membrane-proximal signaling, but instead arise from the different roles of LynA and the other SFKs in the presence and absence of induced receptor clustering. We conclude, therefore, that large-scale receptor clustering does qualitatively change the chain of events necessary for signaling to occur independently of general SFK activation strength.</p><p>We propose that the responsiveness of macrophages to weak stimuli is regulated by a signaling checkpoint in which degradation of LynA occurs when weak or low-valency ligands engage surface receptors; by contrast, LynA expression is maintained but not required when strong or high-valency ligands induce large-scale receptor clustering. As a result, signaling induced in the absence of significant receptor clustering is blocked at the level of Erk, JNK, Akt, and NFAT, while signaling induced by high-valency receptor clustering proceeds through these pathways. However, when cells are primed with IFN-γ, they upregulate expression of LynA sufficiently that even weak or low-valency ligands can produce downstream Erk, JNK, Akt, and NFAT signaling. While priming sensitizes macrophages to small amounts of high-valency pathogen ligands, it will also increase the chance to signaling to host-derived or nonpathogenic low-valency ligands that may lead to immunopathology.</p><p>Our finding that LynA promotes signaling in response to 3-IB-PP1 was initially surprising because Lyn-deficient myeloid cells have defects in negative regulatory signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harder et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lamagna et al., 2013</xref>). Lyn phosphorylates ITIMs and their associated phosphatases, and so Lyn deficiency leads to hyperactivation of cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scapini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ingley, 2012</xref>). However, such Lyn-deficient cells lack both LynA and LynB. When mast cells derived from <italic>Lyn</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice are reconstituted either with LynA or LynB, LynA expression leads to more robust PLCγ phosphorylation and better association of PLCγ with the adaptor protein LAT in response to FcϵRI ligation. In contrast, LynB expression drives the formation of a LynB-SHIP1 complex and impairs calcium and degranulation responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez-Errico et al., 2010</xref>). These observations are consistent with our conclusion that in macrophages, LynA is the primary mediator of downstream signaling in response to 3-IB-PP1. The persisting activity of LynB after LynA degradation is likely to activate negative feedback responses and ensure deterioration of membrane-proximal signaling. It is likely, however, that the loss of some positive function of LynA leads to the primary blockade in signaling because Lyn-deficient macrophages (lacking both LynA and LynB) lose all capacity to signal through Erk and Akt in response to 3-IB-PP1. In addition, LynB, like LynA, is upregulated during priming and fails to suppress LynA-mediated signaling. Therefore, we conclude that the effects of LynA activity are dominant or orthogonal to any negative-regulatory effects of LynB.</p><p>We do not yet know how LynA uniquely promotes downstream signaling, but we speculate that some activity of LynA may protect PLCγ from inhibition by Dok-3. Studies in B cells have shown that a complex of Dok-3, SHIP1, and Grb2 associates with Slp76, Btk, and PLCγ and negatively regulates PLCγ, Ras/MAPK, and Akt function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Honma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stork et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Losing et al., 2012</xref>). Two phosphorylation sites of Dok-3 (Y378 and Y399) are not required for SHIP1-binding or inhibitory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lemay et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Robson et al., 2004</xref>), and we speculate that these sites could sense LynA activity and block Dok-3 function. We have detected general tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-3 and its association with SHIP1 in response to 3-IB-PP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), and the role of Dok-3 in signaling will be the subject of future studies.</p><p>Our observations diverge from the standard model of how SFK activation is reversed, namely through dephosphorylation of the activation loop by PTPN22/Pep or other phosphatases and subsequent phosphorylation of the inhibitory tail by Csk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown and Cooper, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zikherman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Negro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Okada, 2012</xref>). However, previous work has shown that activated SFKs can phosphorylate the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl, which then targets them for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rao et al., 2002</xref>). In fact, Lyn ubiquitination in mast cells has been observed within 15–30 s of FcϵRI activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kyo et al., 2003</xref>). What surprised us was that bulk protein degradation appeared to account for all loss of activated Lyn after 3-IB-PP1 treatment. This mechanism is reminiscent of the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases by Cbl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thien and Langdon, 2001</xref>) and internalization/degradation processes for deactivating the T-cell receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2000</xref>). This observation has important implications for how macrophages might respond to repeated encounters with weak stimuli. The LynA checkpoint would not only shut signaling down but also render macrophages refractory to restimulation by another weak stimulus, at least until redistribution at the membrane or new synthesis replenishes local reserves of LynA. We have observed one form of this desensitization during 3-IB-PP1 wash-out and subsequent stimulation with the growth factor M-CSF, but in vivo this process likely occurs in a highly spatially localized manner. This degradation and desensitization could prevent the accumulation of hyperactivated macrophages at sites rich in weak stimuli but lacking genuine pathogenic invaders.</p><p>Activation of macrophage subsets is a key factor in the progression and severity of autoimmune diseases, cancer cell growth and differentiation, the success of cancer immunotherapies, and induction and maintenance of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wynn et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, alterations in macrophage sensitivity through defects in membrane-proximal negative regulators have already been linked directly to disease. For example, loss of negative-regulatory receptor tyrosine kinases Tyro3, Axl, and Mer exacerbates lupus-like disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease through enhanced Toll-like receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rothlin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lemke and Rothlin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rothlin and Lemke, 2010</xref>). Loss of either SHP-1 or SHIP1, both negative regulators of ITAM signaling, causes severe myeloproliferation, skin abscesses, and lung failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Van Zant and Shultz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shultz et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsui et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Helgason et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abram et al., 2013</xref>). The LynA checkpoint constitutes an additional system by which macrophages sense inflammation and set basal sensitivity accordingly. Understanding the ways that macrophages become hypersensitive to stimulation, including the bypass of the LynA checkpoint, will provide insights into how we might limit this process and reduce the contribution of macrophage signaling to disease pathology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All mice used in these experiments were derived from the strain C57/BL6. <italic>Csk</italic><sup><italic>AS</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2014</xref>) are heterozygous for a BAC transgenic <italic>Csk</italic><sup><italic>AS</italic></sup> allele on a Csk-null background. <italic>Hck</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lowell et al., 1994</xref>) and <italic>Lyn</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 1997</xref>) were used for antibody characterization and breeding. <italic>Lyn</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup><italic>Csk</italic><sup><italic>AS</italic></sup> mice were generated by crossing <italic>Csk</italic><sup><italic>AS</italic></sup> and <italic>Lyn</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript reports an interesting phenomenon associated with macrophage priming. Using a technique that allows them to pharmacologically inhibit the CSK kinase, they report rapid activation of SFK activity and robust phosphorylation of immediate downstream effectors but inability to activate ERK, suggesting some type of block. This is in contrast to activation by zymosan, which achieves similar levels of phosphorylated downstream intermediates but also allows for strong ERK activation. The ability of CSK inhibition to activate ERK could be overcome by macrophage priming suggesting that priming allows for some rewiring. Analysis of the mechanism revealed that CSK inhibition activates SFK and results in preferential inhibition of the LynA isoform. Presumably, the loss of LynA prevents a sustained enough of a signal to allow for ERK activation.</p><p>There are many important findings in this manuscript. First, the data clearly show how dynamic the tyrosine phosphorylation of the SFK is as changes in phosphorylation are seen after 3 seconds. Second, the data show fundamental difference in LynA vs LynB, suggesting that LynA is responsible for positive signaling while LynB is responsible for negative regulator signaling. Third, it is shown that LynA is preferentially phosphorylated by CSK compared to other SFK and that LynA is also preferentially degraded. Fourth, the manuscript shows how rapidly SFK are lost after their activation. This is a little studied but important area. Lastly, the manuscript shows that an important effect of priming is up regulation of Lyn expression.</p><p>The manuscript could be improved by addressing several issues that are raised by the data:</p><p>1) The LynA degradation mechanism controls macrophage activation in response to pharmacological Csk inhibition, but does it also apply in response to a physiological stimulus?</p><p>2) It is stated that the increased expression of LynA after priming results in delayed degradation. Is it really delayed degradation or that the larger pool is able to sustained signaling longer because it takes longer to degrade to the threshold level.</p><p>3) It is proposed that LynA has an insert domain that contains a potential ubiquitination site and that this may account for the increased degradation of LynA compared to LynB. Is there any evidence to support this? Moreover, the authors point to a potential site of ubiquitination in this insert domain – is this site functionally relevant? Would a K40 mutant prevent LynA ubiquitination and degradation, and rescue activation of Erk and Akt.</p><p>4) Are both LynA and B unregulated after priming? If so, why doesn't the increased expression of LynB attenuate or block the increased signaling mediated by LynA?</p><p>5) If the inability of CSK inhibition to activate ERK is via increased degradation of LynA, it might be predicted that the kinetics of phosphorylation of immediate downstream substrates might be more transient. Is it?</p><p>6) The authors need to discuss the possibility that the effect of interferon-γ is simply quantitative. Is it possible that the ability of the cytokine to enable some activation of Erk and Akt is simply due to increased tyrosine phosphorylation?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09183.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The manuscript could be improved by addressing several issues that are raised by the data:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The LynA degradation mechanism controls macrophage activation in response to pharmacological Csk inhibition, but does it also apply in response to a physiological stimulus?</italic></p><p>To mimic a soluble, physiological stimulus like cell debris, we treated BMDMs with laminarin, a soluble form of β-glucan that interacts with Dectin-1 but forms sub-threshold-sized receptor clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goodridge et al., 2011</xref>). These new data show consistently that priming WT BMDMs with IFN-γ increases Erk phosphorylation induced by treatment with laminarin, in contrast to our observations with zymosan<sup>dep</sup>. Representative data are shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 1</xref>.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09183.030</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09183.030">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09183.030</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-09183-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>Unfortunately, Dectin-1 ligation failed to produce sufficient SFK activation to assess whether local LynA ubiquitination and degradation block signaling as we predict, and explain the suggestive data above. Although SFK activity is essential for signaling in response to zymosan<sup>dep</sup> (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> of the manuscript), we cannot visualize bulk activation of the SFKs in response to this stimulus (shown in the pSFKY416 blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of the manuscript).</p><p>To confirm this observation with zymosan<sup>dep</sup> and laminarin treatment in parallel, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments with antibodies against LynA or the activated SFKs and blotted for ubiquitination and total LynA/activation-loop-phosphorylated SFK levels in the immunoprecipitates and the lysates.

Recent studies of the T-cell SFKs have implicated a basally active pool of Lck as the major driver of TCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Manz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nika et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, previous microscopy studies have shown that a pool of activated SFKs may be enriched within the phagocytic synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goodridge et al., 2011</xref>). Please see paragraph four of the subsection “SFK activation in the absence of receptor clustering fails to induce downstream signaling” for a brief discussion on this observation.</p><p>Regardless of the cause, lack of bulk SFK activation in response to physiological stimuli has interfered with our detection of Lyn degradation. This difficulty of interpreting data from highly localized stimuli is precisely the reason that the Csk<sup>AS</sup> system is so powerful: the bulk SFK activation permitted better detection of signaling events and their downstream outcomes.</p><p>We do agree that a long-term goal of our ongoing work should be to investigate the nanoscale SFK environment around ligated receptors. However, we will need to develop new reagents and seek a collaboration to perform high-resolution microscopy, which we believe lies beyond the scope of this paper and the appropriate time-frame for resubmission.</p><p><italic>2) It is stated that the increased expression of LynA after priming results in delayed degradation. Is it really delayed degradation or that the larger pool is able to sustained signaling longer because it takes longer to degrade to the threshold level.</italic></p><p>Thank you for pointing out that our argument was not clear in the initial manuscript. We were actually arguing that the larger pool of LynA is able to sustain signaling longer because it takes longer to degrade to the threshold level. We have updated the manuscript to resolve this confusion. Please refer to the last paragraphs of the Results and first paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>3) It is proposed that LynA has an insert domain that contains a potential ubiquitination site and that this may account for the increased degradation of LynA compared to LynB. Is there any evidence to support this? Moreover, the authors point to a potential site of ubiquitination in this insert domain – is this site functionally relevant? Would a K40 mutant prevent LynA ubiquitination and degradation, and rescue activation of Erk and Akt.</italic></p><p>We have strengthened our evidence for direct modification of LynA by ubiquitination (in contrast to Hck and the inactive forms of the SFKs) by using immunoblotting to detect laddering of LynA and activation-loop-phosphorylated SFKs in whole-cell lysates from Csk<sup>AS</sup>BMDMs treated with 3-IB-PP1. These data have been added as a new figure supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9–figure supplement 2</xref>). Please see the third paragraph of the subsection “LynA is selectively degraded after Csk inhibition”.</p><p>We do not yet have direct evidence that ubiquitination at the unique residue K40 targets LynA specifically for degradation, although we mention that this is the only lysine residue present in LynA and absent in LynB.</p><p>We attempted to obtain experimental support for our model by infecting mouse bone marrow with lentivirus containing LynA, LynAK40R, Hck, or LacZ control DNA. We expected to observe enhanced signaling in response to 3-IB-PP1 in cells overexpressing LynA or expressing any LynAK40R, which lacks the uniquely predicted ubiquitination site. In fact, we found that the introduction of LynA or LynAK40R into WT or even Lyn<sup>-/-</sup> cells was toxic, whereas cells transduced instead with LacZ or Hck survived blasticidin selection. Although we were disappointed that we encountered this technical limitation, this observation of differential survival does support our model, since enhancing Lyn activity appears to affect the basal state of macrophages but enhancing Hck activity does not.</p><p>We are planning future experiments involving mass spectrometry, mutation of the other ubiquitination sites of Lyn, and using CRISPR-Cas methodology to knock the Lyn mutation into macrophages while maintaining physiological expression levels. These lines of inquiry, however, lie beyond the scope of this study and the appropriate timeframe for resubmission.</p><p><italic>4) Are both LynA and B unregulated after priming? If so, why doesn't the increased expression of LynB attenuate or block the increased signaling mediated by LynA?</italic></p><p>LynA and LynB are indeed both upregulated equally during priming, as we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>. From our observation that LynB does not override LynA function, we argue that the effect of LynA is dominant (i.e. some positive function of LynA is more consequential than (or orthogonal to) any negative-regulatory signaling by LynB.) We have clarified this point in the manuscript (Discussion). Future studies will focus on investigating the mechanism of this signaling interplay.</p><p><italic>5) If the inability of CSK inhibition to activate ERK is via increased degradation of LynA, it might be predicted that the kinetics of phosphorylation of immediate downstream substrates might be more transient. Is it?</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewers' observation and have amended the manuscript to point this out. Indeed (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), membrane-proximal signaling in response to 3-IB-PP1 is more transient downstream of Syk in unprimed cells and more sustained in primed cells, consistent with our model that sustained LynA activity is necessary to promote signaling continuously to generate an Erk response. This observation is complicated by the fact that Syk phosphorylation itself is not transient in either case, rather activated Syk continues to accumulate well beyond the point of Erk signaling initiation. Also, the quantitative amount of even the transient signaling in unprimed cells is greater with 3-IB-PP1 than with zymosan<sup>dep</sup>, so quantity of signaling cannot be the complete story. Please see the subsection “Priming macrophages with inflammatory cytokines overcomes their dependence on receptor clustering for downstream signaling”.</p><p><italic>6) The authors need to discuss the possibility that the effect of interferon-</italic><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> <italic>is simply quantitative. Is it possible that the ability of the cytokine to enable some activation of Erk and Akt is simply due to increased tyrosine phosphorylation?</italic></p><p>This comment is closely related to our discussion above of major point 5. The reviewers are correct that there are quantitative differences in signaling in primed vs. unprimed cells, depending on the level of LynA persisting during the first 5 min of 3-IB-PP1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The qualitative differences, we argue, are in the requirement for Lyn protein in the absence of receptor clustering vs. the lifting of this requirement in the context of receptor clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Again, we clarified the manuscript to emphasize that the failure of 3-IB-PP1 to initiate Erk/Akt signaling is not simply a failure to pass some threshold strength of membrane-proximal signaling. In addition, we have added a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>), which demonstrates that 3-IB-PP1 treatment actually suppresses Erk and Akt signaling through the CSF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase pathway, suggesting an active signaling block that prevents a full response to 3-IB-PP1 in unprimed cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
