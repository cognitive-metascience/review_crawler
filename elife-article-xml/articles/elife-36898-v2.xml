Transcription was also proposed to sustain a robust spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) response. Here, we used live-cell imaging of human cells, RNA-seq and qPCR to investigate the requirement for de novo transcription during mitosis. Under conditions of persistently unattached kinetochores, transcription inhibition with actinomycin D, or treatment with other DNA-intercalating drugs, delocalized the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) protein Aurora B from centromeres, compromising SAC signaling and cell fate. However, we were unable to detect significant changes in mitotic transcript levels. Moreover, inhibition of transcription independently of DNA intercalation had no effect on Aurora B centromeric localization, SAC response, mitotic progression, exit or death. Mechanistically, we show that DNA intercalating agents reduce the interaction of the CPC with nucleosomes. Thus, mitotic progression, arrest, exit or death is determined by centromere structural integrity, rather than de novo transcription.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>spindle assembly checkpoint</kwd><kwd>Aurora B</kwd><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>centromere</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008530</institution-id><institution>European Regional Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>COMPETE 2020: Norte-01-0145-FEDER-000029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferrás</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008530</institution-id><institution>European Regional Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>COMPETE 2020: Norte-07-0124-FEDER-000003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferrás</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXPL/IF/00765/2014/CP1241/CT0003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferrás</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FCT Investigator grant IF/00765/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferrás</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FCT PhD grant SFRH/BD/117063/2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Novais-Cruz</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme: 681443</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maiato</surname><given-names>Helder</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007472</institution-id><institution>Fundação Luso-Americana para o Desenvolvimento</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FLAD Life Science 2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maiato</surname><given-names>Helder</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Direct live-cell imaging of human cells, combined with RNA-seq, qPCR and in vitro reconstitution essays, reveal that mitotic progression, arrest, exit or death is independent of de novo transcription.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>When cells commit to mitosis the nuclear envelope disassembles and chromatin organizes into highly condensed chromosomes.

In line with this hypothesis, the master mitotic regulator Cyclin B1 was proposed to be actively transcribed during mitosis and to be required to sustain a robust SAC response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mena et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sciortino et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Centromere assembly, which underlies the catalytic mechanism behind the SAC, has also been recently proposed to depend on transcription of centromeric α-satellite DNA and to be regulated by non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blower, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Du et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grenfell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nakano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pezer and Ugarković, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rošić et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Topp et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>).

Moreover, it remains unclear whether transcription is required for normal mitotic progression and exit. For these reasons, we sought to investigate the requirement of de novo transcription during mitosis using direct live-cell imaging and a wide range of transcription inhibitors. We found that the capacity of human cells to progress, sustain, exit or die in mitosis is independent of de novo transcription. In agreement, quantitative RNA-seq and qPCR analysis failed to unveil potential transcripts produced de novo during mitosis. Finally, we uncovered that DNA-intercalating agents, which include well-established transcription inhibitors, such as actinomycin D, reduce the interaction of the CPC with nucleosomes and significantly compromise centromere structural integrity and function in a transcription-independent manner. Our findings raise awareness about the use of some transcription inhibitors in living cells and shed light on a long-lasting controversy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Actinomycin D compromises spindle assembly checkpoint robustness in a transcription-independent manner</title><p>We reasoned that if de novo transcription takes place during a normal mitosis, its role would be exacerbated during a prolonged mitosis. To test this, we used live-cell imaging to quantify the duration of mitosis in human HeLa cells treated with the microtubule depolymerizing drug nocodazole, which generates persistently unattached kinetochores that prevent SAC satisfaction. After 3 hr in nocodazole, we directly monitored cells that became committed to mitosis, as determined by typical cell rounding, and inhibited transcription with the well-established DNA-intercalating drug actinomycin D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with previous observations in fixed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Becker et al., 2010</xref>), we found that live cells treated with nocodazole remained in mitosis for 19.2 ± 7.0 hr (median ± SD, n = 386 cells), whereas cells treated with nocodazole followed by actinomycin D persisted in mitosis for only 16.1 ± 5.6 hr (n = 301 cells, p&lt;0.0001, Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

Proteasome inhibition with MG132 reverted the Mps1 inhibition phenotype, increasing mitotic duration and switching cell fate from mitotic slippage to death (p&lt;0.0001, Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Most important, the ability of actinomycin D to reduce the mitotic delay and induce slippage in cells treated with nocodazole was rescued after inhibition of proteasome activity with MG132 (p≤0.01, Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Overall, these experiments suggest that actinomycin D compromises SAC response and the capacity to sustain a prolonged mitotic delay, in a proteasome-dependent manner.</p><p>The conclusions above are at odds with models in which SAC response depends on de novo transcription of Cyclin B1 during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mena et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sciortino et al., 2001</xref>). To clarify this issue, we used quantitative time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to monitor the levels and respective kinetics of degradation of Cyclin B1 tagged at its endogenous genomic locus with Venus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collin et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In agreement with previous reports, Cyclin B1-Venus fluorescence decayed very slowly in the presence of nocodazole, likely due to residual APC activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brito and Rieder, 2006</xref>). Treatment of nocodazole-arrested cells with actinomycin D caused a faster decline in Cyclin B1-Venus (p&lt;0.0001, Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, Cyclin B1-Venus levels in nocodazole-treated cells remained constant for several hours after inhibition of the proteasome with MG132, regardless of the presence of actinomycin D (p≤0.05, ANCOVA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We concluded that actinomycin D compromises SAC robustness and the capacity to prevent APC-mediated Cyclin B1 degradation, independently of de novo transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Actinomycin D compromises the localization of Aurora B and Mad1 at centromeres/kinetochores</title><p>To determine how actinomycin D compromises SAC robustness during a prolonged mitosis, we investigated the localization of the SAC-related proteins Aurora B (at centromeres) and Mad1 (at unattached kinetochores). Accordingly, we added actinomycin D for 8 hr in cells pre-treated with nocodazole, which was kept throughout the entire duration of the experiment. To assist in the identification of mitotic cells, while assessing Aurora B activity on chromosomes, we also investigated the phosphorylation of Histone H3 at Serine 10 [pH3S10; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crosio et al., 2002</xref>)]. In contrast with nocodazole-treatment in which all mitotic cells showed high levels of pH3S10, addition of actinomycin D reduced or abolished pH3S10 accumulation in approximately 17% of the nocodazole-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Importantly, these cells still showed signs of chromosome condensation (as determined by DAPI staining of DNA) that were indistinguishable from neighbouring cells with normal levels of pH3S10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Moreover, the observed reduction/abolishment of pH3S10 was not associated with a pre-apoptotic state, as those cells were negative for a cleaved form of caspase 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In line with the observed reduction/abolishment of pH3S10, these cells also showed abnormally low levels of total Aurora B and its active phosphorylated form on Threonine 232 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yasui et al., 2004</xref>). Noteworthy, even in those nocodazole- and actinomycin D-treated cells that showed high levels of pH3S10, Aurora B, including its active form, was found displaced along the chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

We found that while Aurora B centromeric levels remained constant over a 5-hr period in cells treated either with nocodazole alone or nocodazole and cycloheximide, actinomycin D caused the displacement of Aurora B from centromeres onto chromosome arms 2 hr after addition of actinomycin D, leading to a 30% reduction of centromeric fluorescence after 4 hr (p&lt;0.0001, ANCOVA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).

Consequently, the role of centromeric transcription, namely of regulatory non-coding RNAs, could not be properly assessed in the previous experiment. Nevertheless, we were able to directly measure by qPCR the expression of centromeric α-satellite RNA relative to a control house-keeping gene (GAPDH) in cells that had been arrested in mitosis with nocodazole, in the presence or absence of actinomycin D. We found that actinomycin D treatment did not reduce the level of centromeric α-satellite RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Taken together, our results demonstrate that inhibition of transcription with actinomycin D during a prolonged mitosis caused by persistently unattached kinetochores does not impair normal transcript levels, including centromeric α-satellite RNA, nor the normal levels of CPC proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Inhibition of transcription independently of DNA-intercalation does not affect spindle assembly checkpoint robustness nor the capacity to trigger mitotic cell death</title><p>So far, our results indicated that actinomycin D compromises SAC response and Aurora B centromeric localization independently of de novo transcription. Therefore, we reasoned that actinomycin D could displace Aurora B from centromeres, not by inhibiting mitotic transcription, but through its ability to intercalate with DNA. In line with this hypothesis, it was previously shown that actinomycin D, but not α-amanitin [a potent and selective inhibitor of RNA polymerase II that triggers the degradation of the largest RNA polymerase II subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 1996</xref>), interferes with the normal centromeric localization of Aurora B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Becker et al., 2010</xref>). However, α-amanitin is a slow-uptake drug and inhibition of transcription was not confirmed in these studies. For this reason, we first compared the effect of α-amanitin with that of actinomycin D or triptolide, a fast and irreversible transcription inhibitor that prevents the formation of the ‘transcription bubble’ without intercalating with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Titov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vispé et al., 2009</xref>). To determine the extent of transcription inhibition by these drugs, we used qPCR to amplify Mcl1, a short half-life transcript isolated from asynchronous cells after 4 hr treatment either with α-amanitin, actinomycin D or triptolide. As suspected, we could not detect any significant effect of α-amanitin over Mcl1 transcript levels relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In sharp contrast, treatment with either actinomycin D or triptolide resulted in a 5-fold decrease in Mcl1 transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and led interphase cells to death within 4–5 hr in the presence of either actinomycin D or triptolide (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>), suggesting an efficient and equivalent inhibition of transcription in both scenarios.

The resolution of this long-lasting controversy has been hampered by the difficulty to efficiently and specifically repress transcription during mitosis, which often takes only ~30 min in human cells. It has, however, been proposed that the master mitotic regulator Cyclin B1 is actively transcribed during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sciortino et al., 2001</xref>) and de novo transcription is required to sustain a mitotic delay under conditions that prevent SAC satisfaction for several hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mena et al., 2010</xref>).

More recently, an entire transcription program was proposed to remain constitutively active during mitosis and mitotic exit in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Palozola et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Strzyz, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Timmers and Verrijzer, 2017</xref>), but whether this potential program is required for mitotic progression and exit was not elucidated.</p><p>By combining direct live-cell imaging, while monitoring the efficiency and specificity of transcription inhibition at the whole genome level, we show that the capacity of human cells to sustain, progress, exit or die in mitosis does not require de novo transcription. Moreover, we demonstrate that commonly used transcription inhibitors, such as actinomycin D and α-amanitin show serious limitations in live-cell experiments that aim to understand mitosis. Actinomycin D and other DNA intercalating agents caused partial dissociation of the CPC from nucleosomes, thereby compromising Aurora B centromeric localization and SAC response. On the other hand, the slow uptake drug α-amanitin failed to efficiently inhibit transcription even after several hours in mitosis. Most importantly, efficient inhibition of mitotic transcription independently of DNA intercalation using triptolide had no discernible effect over Aurora B centromeric localization or SAC response. We concluded that centromere integrity, rather than mitotic transcription, is required for proper localization and activity of Aurora B and to mount a robust SAC able to sustain mitosis in human cells for several hours in the event of unattached kinetochores. These findings are consistent with a role of Aurora B in the SAC under conditions that prevent microtubule attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Santaguida et al., 2011</xref>) and our work offers a possible explanation for such a role. Accordingly, we showed that both Aurora B activity and its stable association with centromeres are important for normal Knl1 and Mad1 recruitment to unattached kinetochores. However, at this stage, we cannot formally exclude other effects caused by a prolonged actinomycin D treatment under conditions that prevent SAC satisfaction.</p><p>In light of a recent study reporting the identification of over 900 nascent transcripts from allegedly metaphase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Palozola et al., 2017</xref>), it was surprising that our genome wide RNA-seq or qPCR analyses failed to reveal any significant alteration in gene expression, including Cyclin B1 and other mitotic genes, during a prolonged mitosis after transcription inhibition with actinomycin D. However, in the previous study, nocodazole-treated cells were only 95% pure and transcripts isolated 40 min after nocodazole washout might have derived from cells that had already exited mitosis and reached early G1 stage where transcription is expected to be permissive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hsiung et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the use of synchronized, yet impure, cell populations, as opposed to monitoring transcription inhibition only after cells commit to mitosis by direct live-cell imaging, might account for the differences observed between studies. Nevertheless, it remains possible that, as cells progress through mitosis and enter anaphase, de novo transcription starts to be permissive, despite its dispensability for the completion of and exit from mitosis.</p><p>Consistent with a global shut-down of transcription during prometaphase (the physiological equivalent of nocodazole-arrested cells), RNA Polymerase II is generally found displaced from chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hsiung et al., 2016</xref>), with the notorious exception of the centromeric region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan et al., 2012</xref>).

However, whether this occurs during mitosis or during G1, when centromere assembly takes place in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jansen et al., 2007</xref>) remains unclear. Centromeric transcription is involved in nucleosome disassembly during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boeger et al., 2003</xref>) to facilitate the replacement of histone H3 by CENP-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McKittrick et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>). Intriguingly, the observation that the elongating form of RNA Polymerase II is present at centromeres during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan et al., 2012</xref>) leave open the possibility that some level of local transcription of non-coding RNAs might still take place.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mitotic progression, arrest, exit or death is determined by centromere integrity, independently of de novo transcription&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jon Pines as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity:; Patrick Meraldi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study the authors have investigated whether transcription is required for exit from or arrest or death in mitosis. This is a topical and contentious issue and thus appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>. The authors have carried out a thorough study and conclude that the compounds used to inhibit transcription perturb mitosis through their action to intercalate into centromeric DNA rather than through inhibiting transcription, and that compounds inhibiting RNA Pol II directly do not have the same effect. They further show that intercalation in centromeres perturbs mitosis by displacing Aurora B from centromeres.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the comparison of ActD and Triptolide is extremely interesting the analysis in Figure 4A suggests that transcription in interphase cells is not fully blocked. To draw any conclusions from negative data upon Triptolide inhibition it is extremely important to have 100% inhibition of transcription. It can be that full inhibition of transcription would actually give an effect even from a compound that does not intercalate DNA.</p><p>2) The reason behind mislocalization of CPC in ActD inhibited cells should be further investigated.

This is a topical and contentious issue and thus appropriate for eLife. The authors have carried out a thorough study and conclude that the compounds used to inhibit transcription perturb mitosis through their action to intercalate into centromeric DNA rather than through inhibiting transcription, and that compounds inhibiting RNA Pol II directly do not have the same effect. They further show that intercalation in centromeres perturbs mitosis by displacing Aurora B from centromeres.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for recognizing the appropriateness of our study for <italic>eLife</italic> and our effort to clarify a long-lasting controversy regarding the role of transcription during mitosis. We have now built on their constructive feedback to clarify with additional experiments all the issues raised in our original submission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the comparison of ActD and Triptolide is extremely interesting the analysis in Figure 4A suggests that transcription in interphase cells is not fully blocked. To draw any conclusions from negative data upon Triptolide inhibition it is extremely important to have 100% inhibition of transcription. It can be that full inhibition of transcription would actually give an effect even from a compound that does not intercalate DNA.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point and we thank the reviewers for bringing it up to our attention for further clarification. We would like to point out that the residual levels of Mcl1 in Figure 4A should not be taken tout court to infer about the percentage of inhibition of transcription in our experiments. The quantification presented in Figure 4A was performed after 4h in the presence of the drugs in an asynchronous cell population. This time was chosen because it corresponds approximately to the minimal time from which interphase cells start dying in the presence of the drugs. Thus, the residual levels of Mcl1 in Figure 4A likely reflect the asynchronous state of the cell population and mRNAs that had just been transcribed right before the addition of the drugs. Importantly, the residual levels of Mcl1 found after Triptolide treatment were equivalent to those found after Actinomycin D, making it unlikely that a different extent of transcription inhibition accounts for the observed differences in cell response. Finally, interphase cells start to die within 4-5 hours in the presence of either Triptolide or Actinomycin D, suggesting an efficient (and equivalent) inhibition of transcription in both scenarios. These results are now highlighted in the text. We have also now represented the quantification in terms of mean and standard deviation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reason behind mislocalization of CPC in ActD inhibited cells should be further investigated. Is H3T3p affected – a readout of Haspin activity – or is it the underlying nucleosome structure? Looking at marks for CPC localization in ActD would be worth doing. Alternatively, do intercalating agents change the kinetochore structure, in particular the SAC recruitment platform (KNL1 and Ndc80 staining).</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the reviewers’ suggestions and investigated the phosphorylation of histone H3 at threonine 3 (<italic>H3T3p</italic>) as a readout of Haspin activity, as well as several structural kinetochore components (and their Aurora B-mediated phosphorylation state). We found no statistically significant differences in phosphorylation on H3T3p, CENP-A, Hec1 (Ndc80 complex), Dsn1 (Mis12 complex) and active Mps1 (Mps1 pT676; please see next point) in cells treated with nocodazole, with or without Actinomycin D. However, we found a reduction of pDsn1 and pKnl1 in cells treated with nocodazole+Actinomycin D, in agreement with perturbation of Aurora B activity on centromeres. Importantly, while total Dsn1 was not affected by treatment with Actinomycin D, total Knl1 was. We concluded that, with the exception of Knl1 (please see next point), Actinomycin D treatment for 4 hours does not compromise other key structural kinetochore components. Moreover, the observed effect of Actinomycin D treatment over Aurora B localization at centromeres appears to be independent of Haspin and Mps1 activity (note also that, contrary to Actinomycin D treatment, Mps1 inhibition immediately abrogates the SAC).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While the authors show that intercalating agents lead to lower levels of phospho (active) Aurora-B and Mad1 at kinetochores, they do not prove that the faster mitotic slippage is directly caused by lower Aurora B levels at kinetochores.

If the authors can rescue the cell fate effect by artificial recruitment of CPC to centromeres this would strongly support their model.</p></disp-quote><p>This question has been partially answered in the previous point (i.e. Mps1 recruitment, as well as total and pDsn1). In addition, because we found a reduction in total Knl1 upon Actinomycin D treatment and Knl1 is known to recruit several SAC proteins (including Mad1) to kinetochores, we tested whether Knl1 and Mad1 recruitment to kinetochore depends on Aurora B activity at the centromeres. To do so we investigated total Knl1 and Mad1 levels at kinetochores upon Aurora B inhibition with ZM447439. We found that Aurora B inhibition caused a proportional reduction in Knl1 and Mad1, comparable with Actinomycin D treatment. Together with our in vitro reconstitution data, these data strongly suggest that perturbation of Aurora B activity at centromeres is the primary effect resulting from DNA intercalation by Actinomycin D and this likely accounts for the weakened SAC response due to a downstream effect over Knl1 and Mad1 recruitment. These results are now reported in Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and are further supported by the suggested rescue experiment with a CENP-B-INCENP construct that was able to overcome the SAC deficiency caused by Actinomycin D by constitutively targeting Aurora B to centromeres. This experiment had already been performed by Bastians and colleagues (Becker et al., 2010) and is cited in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It would also be reassuring to repeat a key result with a non-transformed cell line.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now treated RPE1 cells with Actinomycin D and confirmed the mislocalization of active Aurora B from centromeres under these conditions by immunofluorescence. This result is now shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 3A,B. We have also tried hard to measure the duration of mitosis and fate after mitotic arrest in RPE1 cells upon nocodazole treatment, with and without Actinomycin D, but tracking of these cells under these conditions was extremely difficult due to their high motility, detachment and clustering. For these reasons, we prefer not to draw any definitive conclusion in this system.</p></body></sub-article></article>
