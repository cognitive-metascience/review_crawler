<italic>PAFAH1B1</italic> (coding for LIS1) results in the disruption of neurogenesis and neuronal migration via dysregulation of microtubule (MT) stability and dynein motor function/localization that alters mitotic spindle orientation, chromosomal segregation, and nuclear migration. Recently, human- induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models revealed an important role for LIS1 in controlling the length of terminal cell divisions of outer radial glial (oRG) progenitors, suggesting cellular functions of LIS1 in regulating neural progenitor cell (NPC) daughter cell separation. Here, we examined the late mitotic stages NPCs in vivo and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in vitro from <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficient mutants. <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficient neocortical NPCs and MEFs similarly exhibited cleavage plane displacement with mislocalization of furrow-associated markers, associated with actomyosin dysfunction and cell membrane hyper-contractility. Thus, it suggests LIS1 acts as a key molecular link connecting MTs/dynein and actomyosin, ensuring that cell membrane contractility is tightly controlled to execute proper daughter cell separation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LIS1</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>cleavage</kwd><kwd>neocortex</kwd><kwd>neural progenitor</kwd><kwd>embryonic fibroblast</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH-R01-NS041030</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wynshaw-Boris</surname><given-names>Anthony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH-R01-HD047380</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wynshaw-Boris</surname><given-names>Anthony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008069</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Research Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moon</surname><given-names>Hyang Mi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Novel insights into LIS1-dependent regulation of cell membrane contractility and cleavage axis specification identify a key molecular network regulating mitoses of neural progenitors and somatic cells during development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lissencephaly (smooth brain) is a brain malformation disorder associated with haploinsufficiency of Lissencephaly-1 (LIS1), also called PAFAH1B1 (Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase IB subunit alpha) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dobyns et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hattori et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reiner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moon and Wynshaw-Boris, 2013</xref>). At the molecular level, LIS1 is an important regulatoratory protein controlling cytoplasmic dynein and microtubules (MTs), that is also known to have dual roles coordinating both MTs and the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kholmanskikh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kholmanskikh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jheng et al., 2018</xref>). Besides pivotal roles of LIS1 in post-mitotic neurononal migration, <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mouse mutant studies suggest additional cellular functions of LIS1 in neocortical neural progenitor cell (NPC) division by regulating mitotic spindle orientation and cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yingling et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Youn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hippenmeyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bershteyn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moon et al., 2014</xref>). The mitotic phenotypes of <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutants are closely related and consistent with those of other mutants of MT/dynein-associated proteins such as LGN, NDE1, and NDEL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bradshaw and Hayashi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doobin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wynne and Vallee, 2018</xref>). However, unlike these other mouse mutants of LIS1-interacting proteins, <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutants displayed a significant decrease in neuroepithelial stem cells in the neocortex and subsequent neonatal death compared with a less catastrophic phenotype seen in radial glial (RG) progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yingling et al., 2008</xref>). Our recent studies with human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of Miller-Dieker syndrome, a severe form of lissencephaly caused by heterozygosity of more than 20 genes including <italic>PAFAH1B1</italic>, demonstrated a prolongation of mitotic division time of oRG progenitors but not ventricular zone radial glial (vRG) progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bershteyn et al., 2017</xref>). All of these previous studies suggest that cellular functions of LIS1 other than MT/dynein-mediated mitotic spindle regulation dictate further mitotic progression from mitotic (M) phase to anaphase/telophase in late stages of mitosis and daughter cell separation.</p><p>Although the functions of LIS1 in F-actin regulation have been studied previously, its downstream cellular signaling pathways that regulate actomyosin during late mitosis and cytokinesis has not been explored. When cytokinesis is initiated, MTs provide positional cues for the cleavage furrow location and membrane ingression at the equatorial cortex by inducing central spindle assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bement et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">von Dassow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Werner et al., 2007</xref>). At this point, dynamic crosstalk between astral MTs and cortical filamentous actin (F-actin) transmit inhibitory signals at the polar cortex, which indirectly instructs cleavage furrow positioning to the equatorial cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foe and von Dassow, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Murthy and Wadsworth, 2008</xref>). During cleavage plane formation, a small GTPase RhoA functions as a master regulator of cytokinetic furrow ingression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bement et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishimura and Yonemura, 2006</xref>) that recruits contractile ring components, including the scaffold protein Anillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Avino et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gregory et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oegema et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Piekny and Glotzer, 2008</xref>) and Septin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kinoshita et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maddox et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oegema et al., 2000</xref>). At the same time, Myosin II accumulates at the equatorial cortex and serves as a constriction force generator by interacting with F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glotzer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Straight et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou and Wang, 2008</xref>). However, when coordination between MTs and F-actin is perturbed, abnormally fewer or elongated astral MTs destabilize the cleavage furrow. This MT dysfunction induces actomyosin dysregulation, leading to cell membrane hyper-contractility, RhoA and F-actin mislocalization outside of the midzone/cleavage furrow, cell shape oscillation, and subsequent mitotic failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Murthy and Wadsworth, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rankin and Wordeman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Watanabe et al., 2008</xref>). It is important to note that LIS1 is involved in astral MT movements and F-actin polymerization, so it is possible that LIS1 contributes to important cellular processes during cytokinesis by regulating actomyosin and other cleavage furrow-associated proteins during late stages of mitosis and cytokinesis.</p><p>We hypothesized that the LIS1-dynein-MT network may be essential for cytokinesis, perhaps by fine-tuning actomyosin and cell membrane contractility. Therefore, we assessed the mitotic phenotypes of neocortical from <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficient mouse embryos, and monitored the entire duration of mitoses of <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), using time-lapse live-cell imaging. Through imaging of <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficient MEFs, we found severe defects in cleavage plane positioning and dysregulation of cell membrane contractility. Here we demonstrate that LIS1 determines cleavage plane positioning through a RhoA-actomyosin signaling pathway, defining a novel molecular mechanism of LIS1 underlying spatiotemporal regulation of cell membrane contractility during mitotic cell division.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mislocalization of RhoA and Anillin in <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant neocortical neural progenitor cells (NPCs)</title><p>To elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying LIS1-dependent NPC regulation during neocortical development, mitotic phenotypes of <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficient NPCs were analyzed by conducting genetic and immunohistochemical approaches on mouse neocortices derived at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>). We took advantage of mosaic analysis with double markers on chromosome 11 mouse line (MADM-11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hippenmeyer et al., 2010</xref>), since the <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> is located on chromosome 11 away from the centromere. To deplete <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> sparsely in neocortical NPCs during early embryonic development, we first generated <italic>MADM-11<sup>TG/TG,Pafah1b1</sup></italic> (TG: tdTomato-GFP fusion) mice co-expressing the heterozygous <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> knock-out (KO) allele.

In the WT<italic>-MADM</italic> neocortex, Anillin was accumulated at the midzone during metaphase-to-anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–a,b</xref>) and was enriched by forming a ‘U’ shape (basal-to-apical ingression) at the midbody of NPCs, consistent with previous observations of normal NPC cleavage in WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kosodo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–c,d</xref>). In the <italic>Pafah1b1-MADM</italic> neocortices, the tdTomato-positive WT NPCs (red, <italic>Pafah1b1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) similarly displayed a normal distribution of Anillin at the apical cleavage furrow between the two daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–e</xref>).

Abnormal distribution of Anillin in <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant NPCs (<italic>Pafah1b1<sup>ko/+</sup></italic>) implies that LIS1 is an important cell determinant for neocortical NPC cell cleavage and daughter cell separation during cytokinesis in a cell-intrinsic manner.</p><p>In apical NPCs of the neocortex, the highest expression of RhoA was detectable at the ventricular surface where NPC cleavage furrows were found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gauthier-Fisher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lian et al., 2019</xref>). Overexpression of dominant-negative forms of RhoA in mouse NPCs in vitro induced mislocalization of cleavage furrow with diffuse and dispersed contractile ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lian et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that RhoA dictates cytokinetic progression and cleavage furrow specification. In the present study, cell membrane-bound forms of RhoA in apical NPCs were identified by fixing the embryonic brains with a 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) solution. In the control WT<italic>-MADM</italic> neocortex (<italic>MADM-11<sup>GT/TG</sup>;Emx1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>), tdTomato illuminated the cytoplasm of dividing NPCs. At metaphase, RhoA was associated with the apical cell membrane of WT NPCs proximal to the ventricular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–i</xref>). At telophase, RhoA was enriched at the midbody located at the ventricular surface, indicating separation of the two daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> j,k,l). However, in the <italic>Pafah1b1-MADM</italic> neocortex (<italic>MADM-11<sup>GT/TG,Lis1</sup>;Emx1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>), tdTomato- and GFP-double-labeled <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> heterozygous NPCs (yellow, <italic>Pafah1b1<sup>ko/+</sup></italic>) displayed an unequal distribution of RhoA skewed to the cytoplasm of only one daughter cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–m,n</xref>).

Together, mislocalization of Anillin and RhoA in <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant neocortical NPCs (<italic>Pafah1b1<sup>ko/+</sup></italic>) indicates that LIS1 may contribute to cleavage plane specification and positioning during late stages of apical NPC mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mislocalization of Anillin in apical NPCs from <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> heterozygous neocortex</title><p>We next asked whether <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> heterozygosity leads to changes in cytoarchitecture of the apical NPC niche at the ventricular surface of the neocortex.

In addition, LIS1 plays an important role in mitotic spindle orientation by controlling MTs and dynein complex in the interphase and metaphase of MEFs and neocortical NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faulkner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yingling et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moon et al., 2014</xref>). However, during late stages of mitosis including cytokinesis, the cellular functions of LIS1 have not been clearly elucidated. Here we provide new evidence that LIS1 plays a crucial role in regulating cleavage plane positioning at late stages of mitosis and cytokinesis during early mouse development. We demonstrated the instructive functions of LIS1 in spindle orientation segregating the cell fate determinants into two daughter cells during mitosis, and LIS1 also regulates RhoA and Anillin-ring localization during cytokinesis. Collectively, this study provides key insights into underlying cellular mechanisms of which <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> deficiency leads to impairments in neurogenesis as well as defects in neuronal migration.</p><p>Since <italic>Pafah1b1<sup>hc/ko</sup></italic> NPCs display severe mitotic progression perturbation causing cell cycle arrest at prometaphase and metaphase and frequent apoptosis in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gambello et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yingling et al., 2008</xref>), we needed to employ genetically manipulated MADM mouse lines to identify the sparsely labeled apical NPCs and daughter cells in <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant embryonic brains in vivo. <italic>Pafah1b1<sup>hc/ko</sup></italic> NPCs also exhibited severe mitotic defects and it was not possible to culture viable NPCs in vitro. Thus, it was unclear that <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> deficiency in NPCs leads to the same or similar cytokinetic phenotypes seen in MEFs in vitro. In the developing mouse brains, neocortical NPCs express specific nuclear transcription factors (such as PAX6, SOX2) to maintain its proliferative capacity and potency to promote neurogenesis. Neocortical NPCs undergo complex basal-to-apical abcission-mediated cytokinetic process in vivo and they also generate one daughter cell with a different fate, a neuron with different lineage depending on the birth date and subtypes of NPCs in regionally specified neocortical domain. By contrast, MEFs only generate two MEFs with symmetric divisions. Despite the different tissue origins of these two distinct cell types (MEFs and NPCs), both MEF and NPC populations share cellular and cytoarchitectural features during cytokinesis. We confirmed that NPCs retain apical RhoA and Anillin localization when they undergo cytokinesis at the ventricular surface where F-actin polarization occurred in vivo. RhoA and Anillin play crucial roles in determining cytokinetic furrow localization by cross-interacting with F-actin and Myosin II at the equatorial cell membrane and the midbody. It appears that RhoA and Anillin-mediated cytokinetic furrow formation is controlled in a similar manner in both MEFs in vitro and apical NPCs in vivo (vRGs). Multiple in vitro studies have highlighted that genetic mutant MEFs are versatile and reliable cell types to investigate cellular mechanisms underlying cytokinetic defects, including those in the developing brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Janisch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rosario et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cook et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Serres et al., 2012</xref>). In genetically targeted MEFs with reduced protein dose (e.g. Kif20b, Plk4, Ect2, and P27), cytokinesis-associated phenotypes were found, including multi-nucleation and centrosome amplification. Therefore, the use of MEFs enabled us to perform long-term live-cell imaging for various analyses that were not possible in NPCs in vitro or in mouse brains in vivo.</p><p>These <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant MEF studies of late mitosis and cytokinesis using live-cell imaging revealed that LIS1 restricts the cleavage furrow location at the equatorial cortex by inhibiting cell membrane hyper-contractility, demonstrating that LIS1 plays a critical role in cleavage plane specification as well as in actomyosin-mediated cell membrane contractility. We discovered that <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant MEFs displayed abnormal cellular phenotypes at late stages of mitosis and cytokinesis, with increased incidence of binucleation and cell death resulted from the failure in cell separation. Cell shape oscillations and chromosome rocking along the mitotic spindles were also evident in <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant MEFs, surprisingly similar to those of Anillin-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Echard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kechad et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Piekny and Glotzer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Straight et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhao and Fang, 2005</xref>). Together, these results suggest that <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> deficiency in MEFs induces cleavage furrow mispositioning and failure in the recruitment of contractile ring components to the equatorial cortex. Intriguingly, cell shape oscillation and cytokinesis defects were also previously reported in nocodazole-treated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canman et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting that misregulation of either MT or the MT-actomyosin interface at the cell membrane may induce hyper-contractility leading to abnormal membrane contraction in <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant MEFs. During cytokinesis, <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-dependent cell membrane contractility may be mediated indirectly by the dyregulation of astral MTs reaching to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moon et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We aimed to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-dependent cell membrane contractility of MEFs. Therefore, we examined the distribution of the other proteins defining cleavage furrow formation including RhoA and its downstream effectors, like contractile ring components and actomyosin. We found that RhoA and Anillin were mislocalized in <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant MEFs. For instance, RhoA was found in ectopically localized in large polar blebs in <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant MEFs. The Myosin II-positive and F-actin focus zone were dispersed at the equatorial cortex or aberrantly located at the polar blebs in <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant MEFs. By alternatively tracing MRLC1 and SEPT6, we confirmed that LIS1 defines cleavage plane positioning by dual regulation of actomyosin and contractile ring. Finally, RhoA hyper-activation in WT MEFs phenocopied the cytokinesis defects seen in <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant MEFs, and inhibition of RhoA in <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant MEFs decreased the cytokinesis defects observed in these MEFs. Thus, these results suggest that LIS1 exerts its function to restrict the cleavage furrow at the equatorial cortex to finely modulate RhoA-Anillin-actomyosin signaling.</p><p>Previous <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant mouse studies demonstrated that LIS1 modulates GTPase-mediated F-actin dynamics in interphase cells and post-mitotic neurons. For example, <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> heterozygous (<italic>Pafah1b1<sup>ko/+</sup></italic>) post-mitotic neurons displayed F-actin dysregulation at the leading processes and aberrant GTPase activities of RhoA-Rac1-Cdc42. Similarly, <italic>Pafah1b1<sup>ko/+</sup></italic> MEFs exhibited abnormal hyper-activation of RhoA GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kholmanskikh et al., 2003</xref>). A recent <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> knockdown fibroblast study also unraveled F-actin dysfunction and focal adhesion disruption during traction-dependent migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jheng et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these previous findings indicate that LIS1 may regulate not only MTs but F-actin in migrating phases of multiple cell types. Based on the aberrant cytokinetic phenotypes seen in <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant NPCs and MEFs, we now demonstrate that loss of LIS1 results in hyper-activation of RhoA signaling and mislocalization of F-actin and Myosin II that generates hyper-contractility forces ectopically at the polar cortex, which is an abnormal site of cleavage furrow ingression.</p><p>Multiple mouse studies have suggested that RhoA GTPase regulates the integrity of the apical NPC niche, through controlling F-actin at the adherens junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cappello et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herzog et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Katayama et al., 2011</xref>). In accordance with this finding, a study of chick neural tube development indicated that RhoA activity modulation and overexpression of a DN-RhoA similarly altered mitotic spindle orientation of apical NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roszko et al., 2006</xref>). In the present study, we demonstrated that neocortical LIS1 is an important upstream mediator of signaling cascades of RhoA-actomyosin-contractile ring components during cytokinesis of apical NPCs. In mouse apical NPCs, Anillin-ring constriction from the basal to apical side determines the cleavage furrow ingression site in mouse apical NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kosodo et al., 2008</xref>).

In mice, mutations in Citron kinase alter mitotic spindles and RhoA-mediated neurogenic cytokinesis of apical NPCs. In humans, neocortical NPC phenotypes lead to primary microcephaly and microlissencephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shaheen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gai and Di Cunto, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, in addition to Citron kinase and RhoA, three members of Kinesin family, Kif20a, Kif20b, and Kif4 regulate neocortical NPC cytokinesis and mutations of these genes result in reduced cortical size with microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Janisch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moawia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geng et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these previous studies suggest that dynamic movements of RhoA and cleavage furrow-associated proteins to the midbody is the key cellular process regulating NPC cytokinesis by precisely segregating cell determinants along the cell cleavage axis.</p><p>In the developing neocortex, apical NPCs self-renew via symmetric divisions, and produce the major populations of post-mitotic neurons via asymmetric divisions. The orientiation of the cleavage plane is thought to be a major regulator of symmetric versus asymmetric cleavage. Our present study suggests that the LIS1-RhoA-actomyosin pathway sets the apical NPC cleavage plane by enrichment of cytokinetic furrow proteins to the ventricular surface, contributing to the later mitotic events when cell fate determinants separate into the daughter cells. Immunohistochemical analyses of the mouse neocortex uncovered that <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant NPCs displayed mislocalization of RhoA and Anillin skewed to only one daughter cell, indicating unequal inheritance and this may impact the segregation of cell fate determinants by inducing an imbalance of symmetric versus asymmetric divisions. Consistent with this data, we previously reported that <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficient E14.5 neocortex had an increase in TUJ1-positive neurons and cleaved caspase-3-positive apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gambello et al., 2003</xref>). This suggests that neocortical daughter cell fates and survival/death are sensitive to LIS1 expression levels in neocortical NPCs. We also demonstrated that <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficient E15.5 neocortex displayed partial diffuseness and thinning of cortical plate with weak formation of the subplate. In the cortex of postnatal day 5 NPC-specific <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> CKO mice (<italic>GFAP-Cre; Pafah1b1<sup>hc/hc</sup></italic>) also had reduced numbers of upper-layer neurons marked by FOXP1 (Layer III/VI) and CUX1 (Layer II/III) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Youn et al., 2009</xref>), indicating that <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> deficiency in NPCs leads to impairments in neuronal subtype specification and total neurogenesis accompanied with cortical patterning defects.</p><p>In the present study, we observed mitotic phenotypes from apical NPCs, the vRGs, in the E14 neocortex. <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> deficiency at earlier time points (E9.5~E11.5) resulted in neural epithelial stem cell death via apoptotis, due to disruption of symmetric mitotic division with vertical cleavage plane, so these earlier stem cells could not be studied. At mid-gestation, we were able to utilize conventional hypomorphic mutants and NPC-specific CKO mutants and circumbented mitotic arrest and death mechanisms. E14 vRGs had a sufficient amount of LIS1 to avoid severe mitotic catastrophe and still displayed robust cytokinetic defects with distorted cleavage plane and mitotic spindles.</p><p>Our novel findings of LIS1 functions in cytokinesis may explain the mechanism of the recent studies with induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of Miller Dieker syndrome, a severe form of lissencephaly with haploinsufficiency of <italic>PAFAH1B1</italic> as well as about 20 other genes. We demonstrated a prolongation of mitosis of oRG progenitors but not ventricular zone radial glial (vRG) progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bershteyn et al., 2017</xref>). The specificity of mitotic effects in the oRGs and lack of its effects in the vRGs may be the result of different dose dependencies of LIS1 in mouse vs. human, such that LIS1 deficiency results in more prolonged mitotic time specifically in oRGs rather than vRGs. Compared with vRGs, oRG populations lack their endfeet attachment to the apical VZ surface. Intriguingly, human oRGs exhibit rapid mitotic somal translocation toward the cortical plate right before cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>). These abrupt movements of human oRGs suggest dynamic cytoskeletal rearrangements during mitotic phases of oRGs. In our current mouse studies, we could not investigate oRG phenotypes due to the low number oRGs present in the neocortices of mice. By contrast, the neocortices of gyrencephalic mammals (from the ferret to primates) contain substantial number of oRGs that exhibit unique mitotic somal translocation, unrestricted mitotic spindle angles, multiple rounds NPC self-renewal and promote expansion of progenitors, neocortical folding and increased topology. Since oRGs highly express a specialized transcriptional factor, HOPX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>) on top of the pan-RG markers PAX6 and SOX2, it would be crucial to investigate the orchestrated crosstalk between HOPX-dependent transcriptional/epigenetic network and actomyosin-mediated cytokinesis in oRGs. In the future, characterization of the localization of diverse protein markers enriched to the cleavage furrow in human or primate iPSC-derived NPCs and fetal neocortical NPCs, such as RhoA, Anillin, and Citron kinase of NPCs, will need to be analyzed to better understand the oRG-specific sensitivity to LIS1 dosage especially in human. It would also be interesting to determine whether other lissencephaly or brain malformation-associated genes modulate RhoA-Anillin-actomyosin-pathways, and to test whether these genes, like LIS1, also possess dual roles in actomyosin and MT regulation important for apical NPCs by controlling key cellular processes not only mitosis but cytokinesis, a critical final step of cell determinant segregation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hongyan Wang (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All the three reviewers were enthusiastic about the new role for LIS1 that you and colleagues describe in actomyosin and membrane contractility in neocortical neural progenitor cells. They have raised a number of points, which have all been compiled below and I request you to consider them carefully. One point brought up more than once by the reviewers is the modest quantitative information in your paper. This needs to be improved.

Please indicate the exact sample size of experiment whenever possible. Very often the sample sizes in the manuscript are shown as &quot;more than twenty cells&quot;, &quot;more than twenty apical NPCs&quot;, &quot;at least thirty cells&quot;. The authors should indicate the n number in each experiment and figure and present the data as &quot;mean ± S.E.M&quot; as much as possible. The population of abnormal division of NPCs were not quantified in Figure 1 and Figure 2.</p><p>3) It would be helpful to connect the disordered division, and shifts in asymmetric and symmetric division that the authors report to the ultimate functional impact in the neuronal cell population. Further could the authors clarify if this dependence is somehow specific to this subtype of neuronal precursors?</p><p>4) How much of the data generated in the MEFs is relevant for the NPCs of the neocortex? Is it possible to isolate neuronal precursors from the Lis1 null mice, or differentiate neurons towards these lineage to validate that some of the findings in MEFs hold true for NPCs? For example, is it possible to check whether the separation defects so effectively demonstrated in MEFs actually also occur in NPCs?</p><p>5) The paper risks becoming somewhat descriptive at times. Better integration of the findings especially those in the MEFs, and connecting them to how Lis1 may impact NPC generation and functionality could help resolve this.</p><p>6) While the results are well documented, the text needs considerable improvement. The authors did raise interesting questions in the Introduction, for example: why do LIS1 mutants specifically display a decrease in neuroepithelial stem cells in the neocortex compared with a less catastrophic phenotype seen in radial glial (RG) progenitors; does LIS1 have differential roles in mitotic division time between ventricular and subventricular radial glial progenitors? However, there is little answer to these questions in the paper with the current experimental design and methods. The work was partly carried out on mouse progenitor cells without differentiation of epithelial stem cell and radial glia cells and partly on MEFs which have significant limitations relevant to answer the main the questions. The difference between neuronal migration and cortical development in lisencephalic rodent (mouse) and gyrensephlaic primate (human) is not sufficiently emphasized. The Introduction and Discussion are not scholarly written and historically informed to be useful to a multidisciplinary audience of a journal like <italic>eLife</italic>. For example, while citing themselves profusely (10 times!?), the seminal papers by Reiner Orly on LIS1 gene are conspicuously missing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51512.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All the three reviewers were enthusiastic about the new role for LIS1 that you and colleagues describe in actomyosin and membrane contractility in neocortical neural progenitor cells.

Please explain these possibilities.</p></disp-quote><p>Physical interactions.</p><p>We thank the reviewers raising these interesting points regarding physical interaction of LIS1 and cytokinesis regulators (RhoA and Anillin). Although we performed immunocytochemistry experiments on MEFs with the individual antibodies during later stage of mitosis and cytokinesis, it was not possible to perform the co-localization experiments between LIS1 and other cytokinesis regulators. Since LIS1 and Anillin antibodies are derived from the same species, Rabbit, co-localization between these two proteins (LIS1-Anillin) was not able to be examined on MEFs simultaneously. On the other hand, membrane-bound RhoA required specific fixation method (TCA solution). However, endogenous intracellular distribution of LIS1 was different in 4% PFA vs. 10% TCA-fixation. Here, in the response to reviewers, we attached immunocytochemistry images of antibodies detecting LIS1 and Anillin using MEFs. We found no evidence of substantial overlap of intercellular compartments of LIS1-Anillin. In mitotic division of wild-type (WT) MEFs, LIS1 is localized only to the centrosomes in metaphase-to-anaphase and the central MTs during cytokinesis displaying mostly cytosolic distribution (Figure 7A), while Anillin is initially seen on the lateral cortex and later specifically accumulate in the cytokinetic abcission ring between two central MT bundles, near the equatorial cortex (Figure 7B). As we have shown in WT MEFs (Figure 6A), RhoA and Anillin are co-localized at the equatorial cortex and the midbody during cytokinesis. However, these two proteins display distinct membrane-associated enrichment compared with cytosolic LIS1. Our experimental evidence supports that LIS1 may only ‘indirectly’ regulate RhoA and Anillin through F-actin cytoskeleton regulation. A previous study (Kholmanskiki et al., 2003) demonstrated that <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficient heterozygous MEFs have less amounts of the active form of GTP-bound RhoA without altering expression levels of total RhoA protein. This result suggests that RhoA may be in the downstream signaling pathway modulated by LIS1 dose. Our rescue experiments with CA-RhoA also suggest that GTPase activity and biological functions of RhoA may be indirectly modulated by LIS1 expression levels in the mitotic cells. These arguments certainly do not rule out a low level of direct interaction between LIS1 and Anilin/RhoA, which would require GST-pull down assays or two-hybrid phage array with recombinant proteins. We believe these are beyond the scope of the current manuscript and can be performed in the future.</p><p>We have inserted text in the last paragraph of the subsection “Mislocalization of RhoA and contractile ring components in mitosis of <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant MEFs&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Quantitative data need to be improved.

Further could the authors clarify if this dependence is somehow specific to this subtype of neuronal precursors?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising these important questions regarding the functional outcomes affecting neuronal subtypes born from <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficiency in NPCs and the long-term effects of daughter cell fates. At around E14.5, asymmetric divisions generate one NPC and one neuron and, in contrast, symmetric divisions generate two NPCs. Since <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficiency in NPCs induces an increase in asymmetric divisions with oblique spindle angles, it is expected that number of neuronal cells may be ultimately increased. In accordance with this, <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficient neocortex had an increase in TUJ1-positive cells abnormally located in the VZ, indicating delayed migration of post-mitotic neurons (Gambello et al., 2003). Previously published data from our laboratory of cleaved caspase-3 staining and TUNEL assay from <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficient neocortex (Yingling et al., 2008) indicate that the apoptotic events were increased at E14.5. This suggests that final cell fate determination affecting a balance between cell death and survival were disrupted by <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficiency in NPCs.</p><p>In our current study, we mainly analyzed RG phenotypes from various <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutants at E14.5 mid-gestational time point. We agreed with the reviewers that it is important to assess the long-term effects from LIS1 dose changes in RGs by the follow-up of later-gestational time point. In our previous study, we demonstrated that there were LIS1 dose-dependent changes in cortical patterning in the neocortex. Although <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficient neocortex (<italic>Pafah1b1 hc/ko</italic>) at E15.5 had a distinct cortical plate, due to weak formation of the subplate boundary, the cortical plate (CP) was partly diffused to the intermediate zone. At a later time point P0 (post-natal day 0), the diffuseness and thinning of E15.5-born BrdU labeled cells were evident in <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant neocortex with reduced cortical thickness (Gambello et al., 2003). Consistent with conventional <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficient mutant (<italic>Pafah1b1 hc/ko),</italic> NPC-specific <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> CKO mice (<italic>GFAP-Cre; Pafah1b1 hc/hc</italic>) also exhibited similar cortical patterning defects at P5. Immunohistochemistry analyses with upper layer-specific FOXP1 (Layer III/VI) and CUX1 (Layer II/III) projection neuronal makers suggest that <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> CKO neocortex has significantly reduced immunoreactive cells in both layers compared with control (<italic>GFAP-Cre; Pafah1b1 hc/+)</italic> (Youn et al., 2009). Altogether, increased TUJ1+ cells and decreased FOXP1+ and CUX1+ cells in <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficient neocortex indicate that RG-derived neuronal populations have impairments in neuronal subtype specification and total neurogenesis inputs. Reduced LIS1 dose in apical RGs has long-range adverse impact on CP patterning and layering by dysregulating neuronal production and subtype alterations of the daughter cells.</p><p>To address these points in the manuscript, we have added text to the seventh paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) How much of the data generated in the MEFs is relevant for the NPCs of the neocortex? Is it possible to isolate neuronal precursors from the Lis1 null mice, or differentiate neurons towards these lineage to validate that some of the findings in MEFs hold true for NPCs? For example, is it possible to check whether the separation defects so effectively demonstrated in MEFs actually also occur in NPCs?</p></disp-quote><p>Effects of LIS1 on long-term functional outcomes and neuronal subtype/lineage specification in neocortical development were discussed in the response to the point 3 above. Additional text was added to the Discussion to address these questions. Points discussed in this point 4 and point 5 were addressed together below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The paper risks becoming somewhat descriptive at times. Better integration of the findings especially those in the MEFs, and connecting them to how Lis1 may impact NPC generation and functionality could help resolve this.</p></disp-quote><p>[Points 4 and 5]: MEFs and NPCs.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers about importance of additional explanations of descriptions covering key limitations and advantages of MEFs compared with the usage of NPCs. We initially performed in vitro NPC primary culture from WT (<italic>Pafah1b1 +/+)</italic> and <italic>Pahah1b1 hc/ko</italic> mice. Conventional NPC protocols of NPC utilizing basal N2 medium with incubation on coated plates was used (Youn et al., 2013 – previously described in our group’s publication). Although WT NPCs normally grew in this culture condition, <italic>Pafah1b1 hc/ko</italic> NPCs did not, probably due to severe mitotic arrest at prometaphase and metaphase. It was not possible to maintain and propagate <italic>Pafah1b1 hc/ko</italic>NPCs in vitro. Therefore, we do not know whether <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficient NPCs in vitro have exactly same phenotypes or even worse cytokinetic progression than MEFs in vitro. Our previously published study (Yingling et al., 2008) suggests that <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficient NPCs have less proliferation/self-renewal capability with reduced phospho-Histone H3 mitotic index. It was assumed that asymmetric divisions generating neuronal cell types may increase in <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficient NPCs due to alterations of vertical mitotic spindle angles.</p><p>Although <italic>Pafah1b1-</italic>deficient NPCs did not grow well in culture, we were able to successfully propagate <italic>Pafah1b1 hc/ko</italic> MEFs (derived from E14.5) and perform several in-depth cellular analyses by immunocytochemistry and live-cell imaging that were not technically possible in <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficient NPCs. This suggests that <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficiency in different cell types dissected from different tissue (CNS vs. skin) leads to distinct abilities to grow in vitro. This is not surprising, since humans with heterozygous loss of LIS1 display specific brain phenotypes without noticeable defects in other tissues, Mouse neocortical NPCs express specific nuclear transcription factors (such as PAX6, SOX2) to maintain its proliferative capacity and potency to promote neurogenesis. MEFs are subsets of the fibroblasts eventually undergo cellular senescence. NPCs uniquely undergo complex basal-to-apical abcission-mediated cytokinetic process in vivo. NPCs also generate one daughter cell with a different fate, a neuron with different lineage depending on the birth date and subtypes of NPCs in regionally specified neocortical domain. By contrast, MEFs only generate two MEFs with symmetric divisions.</p><p>However, there are many similarities which we believe allow us to use MEFs to study these phenotypes. Although MEFs and NPCs are isolated from the different source of tissue origins, LIS1 mutant cells expressed the same amount of LIS1 protein (35%) compared with WT (100%). LIS1-dose sensitivity in NPCs may lead to more severe mitotic phenotypes. Despite this disparity, both MEFs and NPCs have shared cellular and cytoarchitectural features during cytokinesis. We confirmed that NPCs retain apical RhoA and Anillin localization when they undergo cytokinesis at the ventricular surface where F-actin polarization occurred in vivo. RhoA and Anillin play crucial roles in determining cytokinetic furrow localization by cross-interacting with F-actin and Myosin II at the equatorial cell membrane and midbody. Thus, it appears that RhoA and Anillin-mediated cytokinetic furrow formation is controlled in a similar manner in both MEFs in vitro and apical NPCs in vivo (vRGs).</p><p>It is noteworthy that multiple in vitro studies have highlighted that genetic mutant MEFs are versatile and reliable cell types to investigate cellular mechanisms underlying cytokinetic defects, including cytokinesis defects in the brain (Janisch et al., 2013; Rosario et al., 2010; Cook et al., 2011; Serres et al., 2012). In genetically targeted MEFs with reduced protein dose (e.g. Kif20b, Plk4, Ect2, and P27), cytokinesis-associated phenotypes are found, including multi-nucleation and centrosome amplification. Dysregulated or mislocalized RhoA are commonly found as upstream mechanisms. Ectopic actomyosin localization away from the midbody leads to abcission failure and formation of aberrant inter-cellular bridge. Although transformed cell lines are widely used cell types to study cytokinesis-related mechanisms, primary cell types like MEFs derived from the well-defined genotypes are important tools to study targeting developmentally critical early embryonic time point. In particular, <italic>Kif20b -/-</italic> KO mutant MEFs exhibited no detectable AuroraB-positive midbody indicating failure in abcission during cytokinesis. Interestingly, <italic>Kif20b -/-</italic> RGs in the neocortex also had reduced numbers of AuroraB-positive midbodies at the apical surface of VZ (Janisch et al., 2013). Therefore, unlike RGs in the neocortex in vivo, the feasibility and durability of long-term live cell imaging of primary MEFs enabled us to measure variables and help reach better statistical power. Our work tracing the fluorescently labeled intracellular and membrane markers and immunocytochemistry with cytokinetic markers in <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant MEFs are advantageous to elucidate the exact signaling pathways to regulate LIS1-dependent cytokinesis.</p><p>To address these points in the manuscript, we have added text to the second paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) While the results are well documented, the text needs considerable improvement. The authors did raise interesting questions in the Introduction, for example: why do LIS1 mutants specifically display a decrease in neuroepithelial stem cells in the neocortex compared with a less catastrophic phenotype seen in radial glial (RG) progenitors?</p></disp-quote><p>A) We previously demonstrated that <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> deficiency in neural epithelial stem cells (NESCs) (E9.5~11.5) display more severe mitotic defects than radial glial progenitor cells (RGPCs) (E12.5~E14.5) during mouse neocortical development(Yingling et al., 2008). LIS1 is essential for precise control of mitotic spindle orientation in both NESCs and RGPCs. Controlled gene deletion of <italic>Pafha1b1</italic> in vivo in neuroepithelial stem cells, where cleavage is uniformly vertical and symmetrical, provokes rapid apoptosis of those cells, while radial glial progenitors are less affected because their divisions are symmetric and asymmetric.In the present study, we designed our experiments to dissect the mouse neocortices from E14.5 time-point. We selected these time-points because we narrowed the developing critical window of active and rapid neurogenesis in order to examine the effects of <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-deficiency on NPC daughter cell’s fate and cytokinetic separation. Therefore, almost all apical NPCs observed in the current study are expected to be RGPCs. We aimed to get mild but somewhat measurable defects in cytokinesis of RGPCs which overcome significantly increased cell death events and severe mitotic arrest seen NESCs.</p><p>To address these points in the manuscript, we have added text to the eighth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does LIS1 have differential roles in mitotic division time between ventricular and subventricular radial glial progenitors? However, there is little answer to these questions in the paper with the current experimental design and methods. The work was partly carried out on mouse progenitor cells without differentiation of epithelial stem cell and radial glia cells.</p></disp-quote><p>B) In human organoid models, the time between rounding of cells and their separation is similar between control vRGs and oRGs. However, in MDS organoids, there was a profound delay in oRG division and vRG division (Bershteyn et al., 2017), a point we discussed in the text. In the mouse neocortex, there are very few oRGs since this progenitor type is greatly expanded in primates. Mouse RGPCs are nearly all ventricular RGs (vRGs) associated physically with apical membrane of VZ surface, not outer RGs (oRGs) located at the subventicular zone (SVZ) area.</p><p>To address these points in the manuscript, we have added text to the last paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>In response to these questions, additional information discussing the differences between oRG and vRG and human vs. mouse neocortical development were added in the first paragraph of the subsection “Mislocalization of RhoA and Anillin in <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant neocortical neural progenitor cells (NPCs)” (a similar issue was covered in (D) section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>…and partly on MEFs which have significant limitations relevant to answer the main the questions.
