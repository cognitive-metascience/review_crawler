A person or animal must reliably recall previous social interactions to make appropriate social responses and then update the memory with each new encounter. Previous studies have identified the hippocampal network as the brain region that tracks social encounters in both human subjects and mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Okuyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tavares et al., 2015</xref>). Functional neuroimaging in human subjects has revealed that higher covariance between hippocampal activity and changes in social environment reflect better social skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tavares et al., 2015</xref>). In mouse models, perturbing neuronal activity in both dorsal CA2 and ventral CA1 hippocampal subregions impairs social memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Okuyama et al., 2016</xref>). However, debate remains as to which long-range efferent projections from the hippocampus are required for the formation of social memories.</p><p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by difficulties in interpreting social situations and a lack of social appropriation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barendse et al., 2018</xref>). A common feature in mouse models of monogenic ASDs is an imbalance in synaptic excitation and inhibition (E/I) within different brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nelson and Valakh, 2015</xref>). Altering the E/I balance in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice mimics autism-like social deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>), and restoring the E/I balance in the <italic>CNTNAP2</italic> knockout (KO) and valproate mouse models of ASDs improves their social deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brumback et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Selimbeyoglu et al., 2017</xref>). Excitatory pyramidal neurons of the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) send long-range projections to the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DÃ©genÃ¨tais et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dembrow et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu and Carter, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thierry et al., 2000</xref>), and the activity of different populations of mPFC pyramidal neurons are correlated with the novelty of a social target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liang et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the mPFC is a prime candidate region for the relay of social memory-related signaling from the vHIP. Therefore, we tested whether altering the activity of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons affects social behavior and memory, and if this long-range projection is dysfunctional in a mouse model of the monogenic syndromic ASD Rett syndrome (RTT). We focused on the <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mouse model of RTT because of the heightened activity in the vHIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calfa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calfa et al., 2015</xref>) and the hypoactivity of cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Durand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morello et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sceniak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tomassy et al., 2014</xref>), both resulting from opposite changes in their microcircuit E/I balance.</p><p>Using a combination of unbiased behavioral analyses, pathway-specific chemogenetic manipulations with an intersectional genetic approach, high-speed imaging of network activity with voltage-sensitive dyes, trans-synaptic tracing, intracellular recordings, and dual-color optogenetics, we showed that the long-range vHIP-mPFC projection is hyperactive in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice, which results in social memory deficits. Furthermore, chemogenetic manipulation of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons in wild-type (WT) and <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice correlated with social memory performance in a specific and selective manner. Lastly, these behavioral consequences arose from alterations in the morphology and function of excitatory synapses between vHIP axons and pyramidal neurons in layer 5 of the mPFC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons are selectively activated during social encounters</title><p>Because both the vHIP and mPFC have been independently implicated in different aspects of social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Okuyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Selimbeyoglu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>), we first tested if the vHIP projection to the mPFC is selectively engaged during social encounters. To identify vHIP neurons based on their long-range projections, we bilaterally injected green RetroBeads into the prelimbic (PL) region of the mPFC and red RetroBeads into the lateral hypothalamus (LH) of male WT and <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice at postnatal day 31 (P31), and then we allowed 14 days for RetroBead transfer until P45, when male <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice are symptomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Test mice were placed in an open chamber and sequentially exposed for 10 min to either two inanimate objects (novel toy mice) or other live mice (a cage-mate WT littermate and an age-matched non-cage-mate WT mouse), with an interval of 1 hr between exposures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Forty-five minutes after the last interaction, we perfused the mice and prepared their brains for quantitative immunohistochemistry of the immediate early gene c-Fos as an estimate of neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen and Greenberg, 2008</xref>), measuring the c-Fos intensity of each RetroBead-containing neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CâD</xref>).

This manipulation was sufficient to increase the time following the novel mouse compared to the familiar littermate in 73% of the treated <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice, resulting in a significant preference for the novel mouse, and indicating a rescue of social memory (nÂ =Â 15, One-sample t-test, p=0.0312, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4A</xref>). This DI was significantly higher than control CNO-treated <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice expressing mCherry, which did not discriminate between the novel mouse and the familiar littermate (nÂ =Â 10, One-way ANOVA followed by B and H-MC, p=0.0287; One-sample t-test, p=0.1322; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4A</xref>), similar to naive untreated <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice. In addition, there were no changes in the types of social behaviors displayed by CNO-treated mice expressing DREADDs in mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons. For example, the amount of time performing the atypical âjumping onâ behavior did not differ between hM4Di-expressing and mCherry control <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice (p&gt;0.9999 within genotypes; p&lt;0.05 between genotypes; Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunnâs Multiple Comparisons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that the vHIP-mPFC projection plays a specific role in the memory aspect of social interactions. Other than a small reduction of walking time in hM3Dq-expressing WT mice (p=0.0296, One-way ANOVA), there were no differences in grooming behavior, locomotion, or anxiety-like behaviors between DREADD-expressing WT and <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice and their mCherry-expressing controls after CNO treatment (p&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4BâF</xref>).</p><p>After allowing 3â4 days for the potential effects of behavioral testing to fade, we prepared ex vivo mPFC slices from CNO-treated DREADD- and mCherry-expressing mice for VSD imaging. Consistent with their deficit in social memory, WT mice expressing the excitatory DREADD hM3Dq in mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons had larger vHIP-induced VSD signals in mPFC slices compared to mCherry-expressing WT controls, resembling those observed in mCherry-expressing <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO controls (nÂ =Â 18 slices from 9 mCherry WT mice; nÂ =Â 12/8 hM3Dq WT; nÂ =Â 17/8 <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice; p&lt;0.0001; p=0.6530; Two-way RM ANOVA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4EâF</xref>). Surprisingly, inhibiting mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons with hM4Di did not affect vHIP-induced VSD signals in mPFC slices of WT mice (p=0.0642; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E-F</xref>). While unexpected, we cannot rule out the possibility that other afferents may have increased their input to the mPFC, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guirado et al., 2016</xref>), or that other homeostatic mechanisms might have maintained proper activity levels in the mPFC. Interestingly, we still observed impaired memory performance, suggesting that dysfunction of the vHIP-mFPC pathway is sufficient to impair memory formation in the absence of large-scale changes to the mPFC network. As a control, mCherry expression in mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons followed by CNO treatment did not alter the difference in the amplitude of vHIP-induced VSD signals in mPFC slices between WT and <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice (p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), which resemble those in naive untreated mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>Because 27% of <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice expressing the inhibitory DREADD hM4Di in mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons did not show an improvement of social memory in the unrestricted test (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), we correlated their social memory DI with the amplitude of vHIP-induced VSD signals in mPFC slices on a mouse-per-mouse basis. This analysis uncovered a statistically significant negative correlation between DI and vHIP-induced mPFC responses (nÂ =Â 7 pairs, rÂ =Â â0.7895 p=0.0347, Spearman r correlation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). This correlation was also observed when data from mCherry- and hM4Di-expressing <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice were pooled together, indicating that the extent of dysfunction in the vHIP-mPFC projection underlies social memory impairments. Interestingly, this correlation is not statistically significant in any of the WT groups, which suggest an intriguing contribution of the altered mPFC microcircuit in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4âfigure supplement 5</xref>). Furthermore, vHIP-induced VSD signals in mPFC slices from <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice that showed improved social memory after expression of hM4Di in mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons were smaller than those in mCherry-expressing <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO controls (nÂ =Â 11/6, p&lt;0.0001, Two-way ANOVA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4JâK</xref>), resembling those in mCherry-expressing WT mice (p=0.3043). By contrast, vHIP-induced VSD signals in mPFC slices from <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice that still showed deficits in social memory after expression of hM4Di in mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons were significantly larger than those in mCherry-expressing WT mice (p&lt;0.0001; Two-way ANOVA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4JâK</xref>). In addition, vHIP-evoked VSD signals in the mPFC of hM4Di-expressing <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice showing improved social memory DI were also larger than mCherry <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO controls (p=0.0406). Other than these effects on the social memory DI, no behavioral differences were observed between the hM4Di-expressing <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice with improved and impaired memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4CâD</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Selective chemogenetic excitation of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons in WT mice from P34 to P45 also affected VSD signals evoked by intracortical stimulation in layer 2/3 of mPFC slices. VSD responses in hM3Dq-expressing WT mice were significantly smaller than those in mCherry-expressing WT mice, and resemble those in mCherry-expressing <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice (nÂ =Â 18 slices from 9 mCherry WT mice; nÂ =Â 12/8 hM3Dq WT; nÂ =Â 17/8 <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice; p=0.0004; p=0.8522; Two-way RM ANOVA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4GâH</xref>).

VSD signals evoked by intracortical stimulation in mPFC slices from <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice expressing hM4Di in mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons were not significantly different than those in mCherry-expressing <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO controls, and were smaller than those in mCherry-expressing WT mice (nÂ =Â 20/10; p=0.0311; p=0.5691; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4GâH</xref>). Importantly, there was no significant correlation between the social memory DI and the amplitude of VSD signals evoked by intracortical stimulation in hM4Di-expressing <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice (nÂ =Â 7 pairs, rÂ =Â â0.1519, p=0.7451, Spearman r correlation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), and no difference in these signals between <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice that showed improvement in social memory and those that did not (nÂ =Â 11/6 Memory; nÂ =Â 6/4 No memory; p=0.3359; Two-way RM ANOVA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4LâM</xref>). Combined, these results indicate that selective chemogenetic modulation of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons has specific consequences on the functional strength of this projection, but has smaller effects on other afferent inputs to the mPFC recruited by intracortical stimulation.</p><p>We next acutely manipulated neuronal activity to test whether the vHIP-mPFC projection is required for social memory recall, as opposed to the maintenance or initial formation of a social memory. We removed littermate sentinels from the home cage and administered a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of CNO (1 mL/0.5 mg/100 g body weight) 2 hr before the unrestricted social test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These i.p. CNO injections did not affect social memory in mCherry-expressing WT mice as their DI was significantly higher than chance (nÂ =Â 10, p=0.009, One-sample t-test), whereas acute excitation of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons by CNO activation of hM3Dq impaired social memory in WT mice (nÂ =Â 10 hM3Dq WT mice, p=0.7775, One-sample t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). However, the DI was not statistically different between controls and hM3Dq-expressing WT mice in the mPFC projections group due to the large variability in the behavior of hM3Dq group. (p=0.2214, One-Way ANOVA followed by B and H-MC). Intriguingly, acute inhibition of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons with the inhibitory DREADD hM4Di in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice caused them to have a significant preference for the familiar mouse (nÂ =Â 6, p=0.0004, One-sample t-test <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) and show a difference in DI compared to mCherry expressing <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice whose DI was not different than chance (nÂ =Â 10, p=0.8081, One-sample t-test; mCherry vs. hM4Di Mecp2 KO p=0.0197, One-Way ANOVA followed by B and H-MC). This effect was opposite to that of long-term inhibition of the vHIP-mPFC projection in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and the preference of naive untreated WT mice to follow the novel mouse (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

However, a quantitative analysis of the pattern of vHIP innervation onto different postsynaptic cell types was lacking. To identify the first-order postsynaptic neurons innervated by vHIP axons, we injected the trans-synaptic marker wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) into the vHIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). After 30 hr to allow axonal and trans-synaptic transport in the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ruda and Coulter, 1982</xref>), we performed immunohistochemistry for WGA and for the neuronal marker NeuN to account for potential WGA injection variability. We identified postsynaptic excitatory neurons by retrograde labeling and classified them based on their axonal projections as pyramidal tract (PT) neurons by injecting FluoroGold (FG) in the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG), or as intratelencephalic (IT) neurons by injecting FG in the contralateral mPFC (c-mPFC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6BâD</xref>).

Because the vHIP has been implicated in social memory, and due to the involvement of the mPFC PL subregion in sociability and social novelty encoding, we tested the role of the vHIP projection to the mPFC in social behaviors. By chemogenetically manipulating neuronal activity selectively in mPFC-projecting vHIP CA1 neurons, we demonstrated that these projection neurons regulate social memory in a specific and selective manner, only influencing the discrimination between social targets without affecting other aspects of social interactions.</p><p>Coherent, synchronous oscillations between the vHIP and the mPFC underlie working memory tasks in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gordon, 2011</xref>). Entrainment of these oscillations occurs in the first postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brockmann et al., 2013</xref>) and is driven by monosynaptic glutamatergic projections from pyramidal neurons of the ventral CA1 and subiculum to pyramidal neurons and GABAergic interneurons in the IL and PL subregions of the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anastasiades et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DÃ©genÃ¨tais et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dembrow et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thierry et al., 2000</xref>). Despite the wealth of information linking this projection to neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2015</xref>), little is known about the synaptic and cellular bases of this long-range projection. To better define the connectivity of this circuit, we performed trans-synaptic tracing to identify postsynaptic targets of vHIP afferents and determined how this innervation pattern is altered in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice. Although recent evidence suggests that monosynaptic excitatory vHIP inputs to the mPFC are strongest on pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of the IL, but dominated by feed-forward inhibition onto them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marek et al., 2018</xref>), there is also evidence of strong monosynaptic excitatory innervation of IT-projecting pyramidal neurons in layer 5 of the PL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu and Carter, 2018</xref>). Our trans-synaptic tracing data support the latter observations, with over 50% of WGA-positive neurons being IT-projecting pyramidal neurons. We also identified PV-positive interneurons as the inhibitory subgroup most innervated by vHIP axons, which is consistent with the observation of vHIP-driven feed-forward inhibition in the IL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marek et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice, there are fewer vHIP-innervated PT-projecting pyramidal neurons, which have been shown to encode social dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franklin et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests a basis for the impairments in social memory performance observed in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice. However, there are more vHIP-innervated PV-positive interneurons, which may lead to tonic inhibition of the mPFC network due to the hyperactivity of the vHIP in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calfa et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, the density of <italic>en passant</italic> presynaptic boutons along vHIP axons in the mPFC was not altered in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice, indicating a redistribution of excitatory vHIP inputs on different cell types in the mPFC, which results in an atypical wiring pattern.</p><p>Although the number of vHIP boutons in the mPFC was not altered, their individual volume was larger in layer 5 of the PL region of the mPFC in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice. By contrast, vHIP boutons in layer 2/3 had a more prominent bimodal distribution of volumes compared to WT mice. Because the size of presynaptic boutons is correlated with synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Murthy et al., 2001</xref>), we tested the strength of vHIP-mPFC synapses onto both pyramidal neurons and interneurons. EPSCs evoked by optogenetic excitation of vHIP fibers in layer 5 mPFC pyramidal cells were larger and had higher AMPAR/NMDAR ratios in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice compared to WT littermates. Interestingly, vHIP-evoked EPSC amplitudes and AMPAR/NMDAR ratios in interneurons were not affected in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice. Together with the trans-synaptic identification of postsynaptic targets of vHIP terminals in the mPFC, these results indicate that vHIP axons in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice innervate fewer pyramidal neurons with stronger synaptic strength, but they have similar innervation strength onto more inhibitory interneurons. Such altered connectivity is reflected in the pattern of vHIP-evoked neuronal depolarizations in mPFC slices revealed by high-speed voltage imaging. In these studies, the larger amplitudes reflect stronger excitatory synapses onto pyramidal neurons, while the spatiotemporal spread throughout the mPFC slice and over time reflects both an altered connectivity pattern and feed-forward inhibition. It is possible that a larger proportion of inhibitory neurons is chronically activated by hyperactive vHIP inputs in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice, causing tonic inhibition of the mPFC network, and that vHIP activation of IT-projecting pyramidal neurons overcomes this inhibition.</p><p>LTP at vHIP-mPFC synapses is impaired in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Together with larger vHIP-evoked VSD signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and whole-cell intracellular recordings from layer five pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), these data are similar to those observed in hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses of <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice. There, naive excitatory synapses in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice have several features of potentiated synapses due to impaired synaptic GluA1 trafficking, suggesting a saturation of the dynamic range available for LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2016</xref>).

We performed these experiments using computer vision to track multiple freely interacting mice and a computer learning algorithm trained to identify different behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kabra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ohayon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Robie et al., 2017</xref>). This automatic and unbiased screen of social interactions revealed that, despite showing typical sociability, <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice displayed an atypical behavior of jumping at other mice more than following or sniffing, which was not associated with aggression. This finding, to our knowledge, is the first description of an atypical social interaction in a mouse model of ASD. We also identified a deficit of social memory in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice, which failed to discriminate between a co-housed littermate and a novel mouse as the target of their social interactions under unrestricted conditions.</p><p>To demonstrate a causal role of altered vHIP-mPFC inputs on atypical social behaviors in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice, we mimicked the characteristic hippocampal hyperactivity of <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice in WT mice by long-term chemogenetic activation with the excitatory hM3Dq DREADD selectively expressed in mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons. Such long-term excitation impaired social memory, without affecting other types of social interactions. Chronic inhibition of vHIP-mPFC projecting neurons in WT mice also impaired social memory, indicating that there is a set level of proper neuronal activity in this long-range projection, with any deviation resulting in social memory deficits. Even though the vHIP-mPFC projection has been causally tied to anxiety-like behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Padilla-Coreano et al., 2016</xref>), long-term chemogenetic manipulation of vHIP-mPFC projection neurons had no major consequences on the time spent in the center of the arena, the time spent engaging in grooming, or the overall locomotor behavior, compared to CNO-treated WT mice expressing Cre-driven mCherry in mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons. This finding demonstrates the selectivity of this manipulation of the vHIP-mPFC projection to social memory. Voltage imaging of network responses in mPFC slices from hM3Dq-expressing mice revealed stronger vHIP inputs and, surprisingly, weaker responses evoked by stimulation of intracortical inputs (which were not chemogenitically manipulated), resembling the responses observed in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice. These results may reflect feed-forward homeostatic mechanisms within the mPFC microcircuit, as has been hypothesized to give rise to the dichotomy in the direction of E/I imbalances between limbic and cortical structures in models of neuropsychiatric diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nelson and Valakh, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite the fact that many brain regions are dysfunctional in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice, selective long-term inhibition of vHIP-mPFC projection neurons was sufficient to improve their social memory. In addition, social memory discrimination scores were negatively correlated with the amplitude of vHIP-driven depolarizations in mPFC slices: larger voltage dye signals corresponded to worse social memory performance, whereas smaller voltage dye signals corresponded with better expression of social memory. By contrast, long-term inhibition of vHIP-mPFC projection neurons did not affect voltage dye responses evoked by intracortical stimulation, and these responses did not correlate with social memory performance.</p><p>Acute manipulation of vHIP-mPFC projection neurons immediately prior to the behavioral test also affected social memory: their excitation with hM3Dq caused a discrimination index not different than chance, whereas inhibition with hM4Di improved social discrimination in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice. These data suggest that the vHIP-mPFC projection is necessary for the recall of social memory, as opposed to its maintenance or initial formation. Because acute manipulation impaired social memory in WT mice, we used this paradigm to test the specificity of the vHIP-mPFC projection to the social aspect of memory, as well as its selectivity by testing another vHIP projection target. Acute excitation of hM3Dq-expressing mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons did not affect novel object recognition in WT mice, indication that this manipulation did not affect overall hippocampal function. Furthermore, regulation of social memory was selective to mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons because excitation of hM3Dq-expressing vHIP neurons projecting to the NAc did not affect social memory, which is at odds with a previous report concluding that vHIP-NAc projection is required for social memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Okuyama et al., 2016</xref>). A key difference between these studies is our intersectional viral approach to selectively and exclusively express DREADDs in specific projection neurons of the vHIP.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate that the vHIP-mPFC projection regulates social memory in WT mice, and that its dysfunction causes social memory deficits in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice. Defining the synaptic bases of social behaviors provides insight and potential targets for therapies in psychiatric disorders associated with vHIP-mPFC dysfunction, such as autism and schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Mice were aligned in a stereotactic frame (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA), and their body temperature was measured with a rectal probe and maintained with a heating pad. A midline incision was made down the scalp, and a dental drill used to perform a small craniotomy. A 2.5 ÂµL syringe (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV) was used to inject solutions (viruses, RetroBeads, fluorescent dextran, FluoroGold, or WGA) at a rate of 0.25 ÂµL/min using a microsyringe pump (UMP3 UltraMicroPump, Micro4; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). The needle was slowly extracted from the injection site over 10 min, after which the incision was closed with surgical glue.

Mice were sacrificed 30 hr later, a time point that our pilot tests confirmed the transsynaptic transfer to the 1 st order neurons, and not to other neurons down the synaptic chain. To avoid cross-reactivity between the anti-WGA primary antibody and other antibodies, sections were first incubated with anti-WGA and then underwent subsequent biotinylation and streptavidin steps.

Two weeks after surgery, mice underwent 3 days of testing acclimation (3 min of handling and 10 min inside the 16 Ã 10 in test box. On day 4, mice were placed in the test box containing either a littermate sentinel (social condition) or a toy mouse (object condition) and allowed to interact for 10 min before being returned to the home cage. After 1 hr, the same test mouse was placed back in the same box, which now included either a novel sentinel mouse (social condition) or a novel toy mouse (object condition), and allowed to interact for 10 min before being returned to the home cage. Previous reports indicate the vHIP neurons are activated by social encounter regardless of novelty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Okuyama et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore chose to present a strong stimulus to recruit as many vHIP neurons as possible by using sequential interactions with both a littermate and novel mouse. Test mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg, i.p.) 45 min after the last interaction and perfused for subsequent immunostaining. vHIP sections from mice containing RetroBeads were stained for the immediate early gene c-Fos and NeuN. mPFC sections from non-surgical mice were stained for c-Fos. All sections were processed for immunohistochemistry at the same time, and images were taken consecutively using identical imaging settings in a confocal microscope. For quantification of c-Fos fluorescence intensity in RetroBead labeled neurons, the soma of NeuN-positive cells co-labeled with RetroBeads were manually circled using FIJI (ImageJ, NIH). The measurement was then redirected to the c-Fos channel and fluorescence intensity calculated. All RetroBead labeled neurons contained within the ventral subiculum and ventral CA1 of 6 stained sections each from four mice were measured. Sections which had atypically high background fluorescence were excluded; the remaining were normalized to background fluorescence (determined by measuring the intensity of NeuN negative region). Because all RetroBead-labeled neurons were labeled, we did not set a threshold for considering a neuron c-Fos positive and instead report the fluorescence intensity for each individual neuron in a cumulative frequency distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and the intensity average per mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Statistical tests were conducted on averaged data. For c-Fos positive cells in the mPFC, FIJI was used to make images binary and automatically detect particles and measure fluorescence. Identical settings were used during this process. Because this experiment necessitated the use of a threshold for binarization and therefore not all neurons were measured, we used a fluorescence intensity cutoff of 80 arbitrary units to define cells as c-Fos positive. These data were reported statistically tested as number of c-Fos positive neurons per section, averaged by mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-7"><title>Imaging and quantification of presynaptic terminals</title><p>P20 mice received injections of AAV2-Syn-mCherry (UNC Vector Core, Chapel Hill, NC) either in the vHIP (3.8 A/P, 3.3 M/L, 3.5 D/V from the bregma; 500 nL) or in the right mPFC (1.45 A/P, 0.5 M/L, 1.45 D/V from the bregma; 250 nL).

After 2 weeks, mice were sacrificed and individual ex vivo slices were stained with 30 ÂµM of the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye RH414 (Anaspec, Fremont, CA) in aCSF for 1 hr at room temperature, and transferred to an immersion chamber continuously perfused (2 mL/min) with ârecordingâ aCSF saturated with 95%O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub> and kept at 30Â°C. A theta glass electrode filled with ârecordingâ aCSF was positioned within the fluorescently labeled vHIP fiber bundle, and another theta glass electrode was placed in line with the cortical column across from the vHIP fiber electrode. In some experiments, an extracellular electrode filled with ârecordingâ aCSF (1â3 MÎ©) was positioned in layer 2/3 to record fEPSPs with an Axoclamp amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) in current-clamp mode; signals were sampled at 2 kHz, amplified 10 times with a pre-amplifier (Model 210; Brownlee Precision, now NeuroPhase, Palo Alto, CA), digitized at 10 kHz (ITC-18; InstruTech, Longmont, CO), and acquired with custom-written software (TI WorkBench) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Inoue, 2018</xref>) in a MacMini computer (Apple, Cupertino, CA).

Maximum responses were reported as the mean dF/F from a 3 Ã 3 pixel Region Of Interest (ROI) placed within layer 2/3 with the highest response in the 6 ms following stimulation, which corresponds to the peak of the fEPSPs. The spatiotemporal spread was calculated as the area under the curve (AOC) of the spread in the cortical area (% of total) and time (ms). For the correlation between VSD signals and social memory performance, only one slice per mouse was used (the slice with the median response). Statistical tests were performed on slices as the replicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Intracellular whole-cell recordings</title><p>For optogenetic activation of vHIP and contralateral mPFC afferents, a total of 0.5 ÂµL of AAV2-Syn-Chrimson-tdTomato (UNC Vector Core, Chapel Hill, NC) was injected into the left vHIP (250 nL at 3.5 A/P, 3.3 M/L, 3.5 D/V from the bregma and 250 nL at 3.1 A/P, 3.3 M/L, 3.0 D/V from the bregma) and 250 nL of AAV2-Syn-Chronos-GFP (UNC Vector Core, Chapel Hill, NC) into the right mPFC (1.45 A/P, 0.5 M/L, 1.45 D/V from the bregma). After allowing 4 weeks for opsin expression, mPFC ex vivo slices were transferred to an immersion chamber continuously perfused (2 mL/min) with ârecordingâ aCSF (120 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.4 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 21 mM glucose, 0.4 mM Na-ascorbate, and 2 mM Na-pyruvate bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) and kept at 30Â°C. Addition of 1 ÂµM TTX and 100 mM 4-AP, and increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> to 4 mM ensured recordings of monosynaptic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>). Whole-cell recording electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) and filled with 120 mM Cs-gluconate, 17.5 mM CsCl, 10 mM Na-HEPES, 4 mM Mg-ATP, 10 mM NA<sub>2</sub>-creatine phosphate, and 0.2 mM Na-EGTA; this yielded a resistance of 4Â Â±Â 0.5 Mâ¦ in aCSF. Whole-cell currents were recorded in voltage-clamp mode with an Axopatch-200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA), filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz (ITC-18; InstruTech, Longmont, CO), and acquired with TI WorkBench in a G5 PowerMac computer (Apple, Cupertino, CA). Opsins were excited with monochromatic light from a Laser-LED illumination system (Lumen Dynamics, now Excelitas Technologies, Waltham, MA) attached to the epifluorescence port of a DM-LFS fixed-stage upright microscope (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany), and focused onto the slice through a Zeiss 63X (1.0 NA) water immersion lens (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), which was also used for visualized whole-cell recordings under infrared-differential interference contrast. TI WorkBench (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Inoue, 2018</xref>) controlled and synchronized the Laser-LED (Lumen Dynamics, now Excelitas Technologies, Waltham, MA) stimulation with electrophysiological recordings and fluorescence imaging with an electron multiplying charge-coupled device (QuantEM 512SC; Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). Chronos was excited with 430 nm light, and Chrimson was excited with 630 nm light. In control experiments, 630 nm light evoked inward currents in layer five pyramidal neurons in slices expressing only Chrimson in vHIP axons, but not those expressing Chronos in c-mPFC axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1AâB</xref>). Conversely, 430 nm light of an intensity that evoked inward currents in slices expressing only Chronos in c-mPFC axons, did not evoke any responses in slices expressing only Chrimson in vHIP axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Neurons were classified as pyramidal neurons or interneurons based on their morphology, input resistance, and whole-cell capacitance (estimated from the exponential decay of the current response to a test voltage step) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1c-d</xref>). Neurons whose input resistance changed more than 20% during the recordings or had unclamped spikes (i.e., action currents) were excluded. Statistical tests considered neuron the biological replicate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Behavioral assays</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Three-chamber social assay</title><p>Mice were acclimated to being handled during 3 min each for 3 days prior to the testing day at the same time as testing. All handling and testing were done in the dark phase of the 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle, with the experimenter wearing a red headlamp and infrared illumination for digital videography. Mice were placed in the center chamber of a three-chambered box that contained empty inverted pencil cups in the two side chambers, and were allowed to freely explore. After 5 min of acclimation, mice were shepherded back to the center chamber, and blocks were put in place over the side openings. A novel mouse was put under one of the pencil cups on one of the two sides, with the side being interleaved between trials. The blocks were lifted and the test mouse allowed to freely explore the chambers for 10 min. After this time, the test mouse was again shepherded into the middle compartment and blocked there. A second novel mouse was placed under the previously empty pencil cup. The side blocks were removed and the test mouse was allowed to freely explore for another 10 min. After testing each mouse, the apparatus was thoroughly cleaned with isopropanol. Test mice spending more than 75% of the acclimation time in one compartment were removed from the study. The amount of time the test mouse spent actively sniffing each pencil cup (either empty or containing sentinel mice) was quantified and the discrimination index was calculated as [(Time investigating Mouse Cup - Time investigating Empty Cup) / (Time investigating Mouse CupÂ +Â Time investigating Empty Cup) * 100] for the sociability test and [(Time investigating Novel Mouse Cup - Time investigating Familiar Mouse Cup) / (Time investigating Novel Mouse CupÂ +Â Time investigating Familiar Mouse Cup) * 100] for the memory test. Statistical tests were preformed on the discrimination indices per mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Unrestricted social Assay</title><p>One week prior to testing, the back of sentinel mice was dyed with blond hair dye (Born Blonde Maxi, Clairol) with differing patterns for tracking by computer vision. Mice were acclimated to handling and to the testing box containing clean bedding for 3 days prior to the testing day. All acclimation and testing (3 min handling, 10 min in the testing box) were done in the dark phase with experimenter wearing a red headlamp, and video acquisition using infrared illumination. At the beginning of the testing day, sentinel mice from different cages were placed in a neutral cage to acclimate to one another. The test mice were placed in the testing box and were videotaped for 10 min. Then, sentinel mice (one cage-mate of the test mouse and an unknown from a different cage) were placed in the testing box with the test mouse, and allowed to freely interact while being videotaped for 10 min. After this time, the sentinel mice were placed back in the neutral cage and the test mouse returned to the home cage. The test box was cleaned and filled with new bedding between each test mouse. Each sentinel mice interacted with a maximum of 5 test mice, and were discarded if they fought with other sentinels or were excessively grooming. After all mice had been tested, sentinel mice were individually videotaped for 10 min for computer training. Individual and test videos were fed to the <italic>Motr</italic> program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/motr/motr">https://github.com/motr/motr</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ohayon et al., 2013</xref>) to create tracks that were sent to <italic>JAABA</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kristinbranson/JAABA">https://github.com/kristinbranson/JAABA</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kabra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Robie et al., 2017</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Branson, 2019</xref>) for unbiased computer identification of behaviors. <italic>JAABA</italic> classifiers were trained on pilot data sets. Behavioral scores for social memory assessment were taken from the first 4 min of the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and separated based on the mouse target (cage-mate or novel). The rationale of using the first 4 min of the total 10 min of the unrestricted social interaction assay is based on the observation that more than 75% of the social interactions occur during the first 4 min. After that time, there is no longer a difference in time spent following the target mice compared to the time spent exploring the environment, as the test mouse becomes acclimated to their presence. As a result of this, the Discrimination Index after the first 4 min become a less reliable estimate preference in the social interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Behavioral scores for social memory and other behaviors were taken from the entire video, as different behaviors emerged at later times during the trial, and social behavior times pooled between novel and cage-mate mouse. Memory discrepancy scores were calculated as (Time Following Novel - Time Following Familiar) / (Time Following NovelÂ +Â Time Following Familiar) * 100. Mice not interacting with sentinels for more than 3 s (out of 240) were excluded. Preference for the novel was considered a value greater than 0. Statistical tests were performed on the discrimination indices per mouse for memory, or for all behaviors, time per behavior for each mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Novel object recognition</title><p>Mice were acclimated to handling and to the testing box containing clean bedding and two identical objects for 7 days prior to the testing day (handled for 3 min, placed in the testing box for 10 min).

Statistical tests used in each experiment are provided in main text, within associated figure legend, or within the statistical table in supplemental information. Data first underwent a test for normalcy: either DâAgostino and Pearsonâs or, in the case that the number of replicates was not sufficient for this test, Shapiro-Wilk normalcy test. The decision to use either parametric or non-parametric tests were dependent on this outcome. ANOVAs were conducted in tandem with Benjamani and Hochberg Multiple Comparisons, unless otherwise stated. Memory discrepancy indices were first tested using t-tests (two groups) or ANOVAs (more than two groups) to determine differences between groups and secondly tested in a one-sample t-test against chance value (0) to determine if the preference was significant.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal his identity: Jeffrey L Neul (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study uses a large array of techniques to examine the properties of vHIP â mPFC connections in wild type and MeCP2KO animal to establish the role of this circuit in regulation of social behavior. Although a large number of synaptic and cellular deficits have been characterized in RTT models, the circuit deficits associated with this disorder remain poorly understood. Therefore, the reviewers overall agree that the current study is in principle an important addition to existing studies on RTT pathophysiology.

Although a large number of synaptic and cellular deficits have been characterized in RTT models, the circuit deficits associated with this disorder remain poorly understood. Therefore, the current study is in principle a welcome addition to existing canon of studies on RTT pathophysiology. However, the authors need to clarify several aspects of their experiments and provide more technical details to make this rather extensive study more accessible to a wider audience.</p><p>1) Figure 1: cFOS staining should use histograms to better present the distribution of fluorescence intensities? What do these intensities present, cells, clusters? Clarify the relationship between neuronal activity and cFOS staining. Why count neurons, rather than quantify staining intensity per neuron?</p><p>2) Figure 3: The relationship between fEPSPs and voltage sensitive dye signals. EPSP slope is a more reliable reporter for synaptic responses, whereas fEPSP amplitudes are rather non-linear reporters for postsynaptic activity. What do the authors think they are monitoring using voltage sensitive dyes (synaptic responses, firing or a loosely defined measure of &quot;activity&quot;)?</p><p>3) The authors should be commended for the well-controlled DREADD-CNO experiments. That said, the authors primarily perform long term experiments using this system. It is important to validate the DREADD system works as expected under the conditions of long-term (11 days?) exposure to CNO. It is plausible to expect some level of adaptation and plasticity in the system. However, the authors' interpretation of their result does not take this possibility into account.</p><p>4) It is extremely difficult to interpret the experiments presented in Figure 8 in terms of a change in presynaptic efficacy. The authors use an extremely artificial setting (4-AP + TTX+ 4 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>) to evaluate synaptic efficacy via optogenetic stimulation. It is difficult ascertain if the differences seen in these experiments are indeed due to bigger boutons and increased presynaptic release probability.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors demonstrate that the projection from ventral hippocampus to mPFC is hyperactive in symptomatic Rett mice, yet activity driven by intracortical stimulation is decreased. The electrophysiological findings in Figures 3 and Figure 4, and anatomical findings in Figure 6, are convincing and compelling. However, the link to behavior is tenuous, largely because of issues with the statistics. It is difficult to gauge the claims made in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 4, Figure 5. Although this is a potentially very interesting manuscript, the statistical issues make it difficult to assess the impact of the paper, as well as what additional experiments or analyses may be needed.</p><p>Specifically:</p><p>Figure 1 represents an extremely ambitious experiment, as the authors compare c-Fos expression across two experimental conditions, two genotypes, and neurons that project to two regions. I have a number of concerns about the experimental design and analysis. In sum, the data, as presented, do not fully support the claim that mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons are selectively activated during social encounters.</p><p>The rationale for using the behavioral task in Figure 1C is a bit unclear. (If this is a commonly used and well-accepted protocol, please cite its prior use.) On the control arm of the task, the subject gets two novel objects consecutively (two fake mice). On the experimental arm, the subject gets a familiar mouse and then a novel mouse. It is not clear why two steps are needed here. It seems one of the following designs may better assess social encounters:</p><p>a) Two arms being a familiar mouse, then sac, or a novel mouse, then sac.b) Two arms being a novel fake mouse, then sac, or a novel mouse, then sac.</p><p>The methods for quantifying images (as in Figure 1D) are not described.</p><p>The authors report number of cells as &quot;n&quot; in Figure 1E, but in this case it seems as though the correct biological replicate here should be number of animals (and c-Fos expression should be averaged within animal).</p><p>Statistically, the authors report a Kruskal-Wallis test, which is a non-parametric one-way ANOVA. But a one-way ANOVA is not appropriate for such an ambitious experiment, where three conditions are being compared simultaneously (genotype, behavioral condition, and projection). For example, the conclusion that &quot;the differences in c-Fos intensities between the object and social conditions were smaller in Mecp2 KO mice&quot; (subsection âmPFC-projecting vHIP neurons are selectively activated during social encountersâ) appears to be true, but is not supported by a statistically significant interaction between genotype and behavioral condition. Overall, the study is likely under-powered (2-4 animals per group) for a 3x2 design and a three-way ANOVA.</p><p>I have a similar concern for Figure 2. On the whole, the data in Figure 2 seem to suggest impairments in social behavior and social memory in Rett mice, but it is not clear if these findings are supported statistically. The authors conclude that &quot;Mecp2 KO mice spent similar amounts of time in both chambers&quot; (Subsection âAtypical social behavior and impaired social memory in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO miceâ), whereas WT mice spent more time in the chamber with stranger 2.&quot; This result, compared with the left panel of Figure 2C, leads the authors to conclude that Rett mice have normal social preference, but impaired social memory. However, paired t-tests are not sufficient to make across-group comparisons. A two-way RM ANOVA would be needed for both the left and right panels in Figure 2C. A statistically significant interaction in the right panel would provide statistical support to the claim that Rett mice have impaired social memory. The same point also applies to Figure 2G.</p><p>Subsection âAtypical social behavior and impaired social memory in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO miceâ: &quot;During the first four minutes of the assay, WT mice preferentially interacted with the novel mouse across all measured social behaviors, including following, sniffing, and &quot;jumping on&quot;, after which social interaction declined regardless of target (n=6 mice, p&lt;0.05, Student's paired t-test Figure 2F).&quot; Two questions here:</p><p>a) It is not clear what the statistics are referring to here. It could be either the finding that WT mice interacted with the novel mouse preferentially in social behaviors (in which case the callout should be 2G), or it could be the claim that social interaction declined after the first four minutes. If the latter, the summarized data should be plotted in a panel in addition to the example trace in Figure 2F.</p><p>b) Why do the authors extract the first 4 minutes out of 10 for analysis? Has this been done by previous groups, and/or was this cutoff determined a priori? This is an important cutoff to justify, as it is used in multiple analyses throughout the paper.</p><p>Overall, Figure 3 nicely demonstrates that vHIP stimulation drives increased excitability in mPFC slices, but intracortical stimulation suggests that the local network is hypoexcitable in Rett. I have only a few minor questions about Figure 3:</p><p>The authors claim that VSD signals in ex vivo slices are directly proportional to the amplitude of field EPSPs and follow their kinetics (subsection âIncreased influence of vHIP input on the mPFC network in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO miceâ, Figure 3B-C). The only demonstration of this is a single example traces in Figure 3C. This point would be made much more strongly with an example I/O curve.</p><p>How is dF/F calculated for VSD signals in I/O curves (such as Figure 3E)? I apologize if I missed this in the methods. The example in Figure 3D includes both a time dimension and a spatial dimension of the VSD signal. Do the points in Figure 3E represent summated dF/F in the whole window at the peak time? Or the most intense peak in the window at the peak time?</p><p>In Figure 3âfigure supplement 2, the authors demonstrate that Rett slices have impaired LTP. They present normalized data, likely because the Rett slices are hyperactive at baseline (visible in example trace and demonstrated in Figure 3). Is it possible that the lack of LTP might reflect a ceiling effect?</p><p>Figures 4âfigure supplement 1, Figure 4âfigure supplement 2, Figure 4âfigure supplement 3 are mentioned in the text as being related to Figure 4, but they seem more related to Figure 3. These data show that social* and electrophysiological** impairments in Rett mice are not seen at the presymptomatic stage. This is an important point, and could perhaps even be highlighted in its own section in the text.</p><p>Figure 4âfigure supplement 1Figure should use RM two-way ANOVAs. Also related to Figure 4âfigure supplement 1Figure: do presymptomatic mice also show impaired social behavior in the unrestricted social assay?</p><p>Figure 4âfigure supplement 3Figure should use two-way ANOVAs to compare genotype and age. A significant interaction between genotype and age would be needed to make the claim in subsection âSelective chemogenetic manipulation of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons regulates social memoryâ.</p><p>Figure 4C-D presents another ambitious study: bidirectional DREADD manipulation of the vHIP -&gt; mPFC pathway in WT and Rett mice. I have a few questions:</p><p>Were the experimenters blind to genotype for these experiments? If so, why is there an excitatory DREADD group only for the WT condition?</p><p>Student's and nonparametric paired t-tests are not appropriate to compare three conditions: genotype, familiar vs. novel, and DREADD. Therefore it is difficult to assess whether inhibitory DREADDs do indeed improve performance in Rett mice, or whether excitatory DREADDs do indeed mimic altered performance. One idea that perhaps could reduce the number of dimensions from 3 to 2 for this and other studies would be to plot &quot;time following&quot; as a proportion within animal (similar to &quot;memory discrepancy&quot; in Figure 4I). This way, a 2-way ANOVA would work instead of a 3-way ANOVA. Then perhaps a supplement could show the absolute following times in a descriptive way to the familiar and novel animal, because it is nice to see those raw data as well.</p><p>The way the electrophysiological data are presented in Figure 4 appear much cleaner, but again, these experiments were done at the same time. It is not clear how statistics were done here: were two-way ANOVAs done individually on each panel in Figures 4F and 4H? Because each panel contains WT mCherry and KO mCherry, plus a different condition. I like that it is plotted this way to make things easier to understand, but it is not clear whether the statistical analysis is done on the entire dataset (genotype X DREADD X stim. intensity)? Again, perhaps the stim. intensity dimension could be collapsed if need be to a single value if a three-way test is prohibitive.</p><p>Figure 4I is potentially very interesting, showing a within-animal correlation between behavioral performance and long-range electrophysiology, three days later. But this is only shown for the Mecp2 KO + inhibitory DREADD group. Is this correlation seen in other experimental groups?</p><p>In Figure 4K, what is the cutoff to decide if an animal has &quot;improved social memory&quot; or &quot;no memory&quot;?</p><p>The statistical questions presented earlier also apply to Figure 5 and make it difficult to interpret these results.</p><p>In Figure 6, the &quot;n&quot; used is not clear â the authors report an &quot;n&quot; of 9 sections from 3 mice. But the figures show only 3 data points. It seems as though mice would be more appropriate here than sections, and sections can be pooled.</p><p>Similar statistical concerns about the lack of two-way ANOVA for Figure 7, though it is clear there is no difference in Figure 7F. Statistical comparisons in 7G-H also should account for multiple comparisons.</p><p>Figure 8 nicely demonstrates what would be expected based on the results in Figure 3. The electrophysiological results overall are very convincing between these two figures: hyperactive long-range vHIP-&gt;mPFC and hypoactive local or c-mPFC-&gt;mPFC. Figure 8 also extends this result to show that long-range hyperexcitability is seen in excitatory neurons but not inhibitory neurons. However, the sample size is much larger in pyramidal cells (n=15 or n=11, versus n=6 in inhibitory cells in 8D). Increasing the sample size to ~10-15 neurons for Figure 8D-H would be useful in helping to understand if the trend seen in 8D and 8H (p=0.06) would reach statistical significance with equivalent power.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent, and quite thorough, body of work analyzing the role of the ventral hippocampus to medial prefrontal cortex circuit in social behavior, and specifically looking at the role in mice with MECP2 mutations. I think the work stands nicely on its own and provides a clear story. I have no major concerns and do not feel any additional experiments are needed.</p><p>A minor concern is that the statistical testing performed should be consistent. In some of the behavior analysis, non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, etc) are used and in other cases parametric (t-test, anova) are used. This is problematic when there are different tests used for different components of the same overall analysis, for example in Figure 2E for free moving behavior all the comparisons used student t-test except for aggressor which used Kolomogorov-Smirnov testing, which is probably not an appropriate test in this case anyway. It would appear that the test was cherry picked to identify significance, rather than choosing appropriate statistical methods before analysis. A non-parametric rank test like Mann-Whitney is probably appropriate, and ultimately if no significance exists for aggressor it will in no way change the overall manuscript.</p><p>A question is why behavior scores for social memory assessment were only taken for the first 4 minutes. Some rationale, hopefully generated a priori, for restricting the analysis to the first 4 minutes should be provided.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44182.046</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As stated in the individual reviewers' comments below, statistical analysis in each figure should strengthened.

In the original submission, each ânâ in the bar graphs was an individual neuron. The new panel D in Figure 1 shows the cumulative probability distribution of c-Fos intensity per neuron, which presents the same information as a histogram but without relying on the statistical mean. In the new panel E of Figure 1 each ânâ is an individual mouse, which allowed performing a 3-Way ANOVA, as requested by reviewer 2. We now extended the description of this experiment in the Results section and Materials and methods section of the manuscript.</p><p>Our rationale to quantify c-Fos intensity per neuron instead of counting the number of c-Fos-positive neurons is based on the fact that <italic>c-fos</italic> expression is a graded reflection of neuronal activity mediated by different intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (Cohen and Greenberg, 2009). In addition, we consider that choosing an arbitrary c-Fos intensity value as a threshold cut-off is more biased than presenting all c-Fos intensity values displayed by all neurons. Note that every c-Fos-positive cell was confirmed to be a neuron based on its NeuN staining, and that their projection target identified by retread labeling (i.e. three fluorescence channels: dual immunostaining for c-Fos and NeuN, plus retread fluorescence).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 3: The relationship between fEPSPs and voltage sensitive dye signals. EPSP slope is a more reliable reporter for synaptic responses, whereas fEPSP amplitudes are rather non-linear reporters for postsynaptic activity. What do the authors think they are monitoring using voltage sensitive dyes (synaptic responses, firing or a loosely defined measure of &quot;activity&quot;)?</p></disp-quote><p>The VSD signals reported in our manuscript occur during single subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potentials recorded with extracellular electrodes (field EPSPs), not action potential firing, which is evident as faster rising and larger population spikes. We use this VSD imaging approach to estimate the depolarization evoked throughout the network by stimulation of selected afferent fibers. VSD imaging is complementary to electrophysiological recordings because it provides spatial information from sites beyond the recording site (e.g. Chang and Jackson, 2003).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the slope of the field EPSP reflects more accurately the underlying postsynaptic current without confounding dendritic depolarizations. In addition to following their kinetics and being directly proportional to the amplitude of field EPSPs in input-output curves, the âF/F of evoked VSD signals is also directly proportional to the initial slope of field EPSPs.The peak of VSD aptitudes reflects the largest synaptic depolarization throughout the network. The spatial spread of VSD signals reflects the proportion of the network with postsynaptic responses at a set afferent stimulus strength, while the temporal spread combines the proportion of the responding network with the duration of postsynaptic depolarization across the cortical network. We now include the figure below as a supplementary figure to better describe the relationship between VSD signals and postsynaptic responses, and endeavor to make these concepts more clear in the revised manuscript</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should be commended for the well-controlled DREADD-CNO experiments. That said, the authors primarily perform long term experiments using this system. It is important to validate the DREADD system works as expected under the conditions of long-term (11 days?) exposure to CNO. It is plausible to expect some level of adaptation and plasticity in the system. However, the authors' interpretation of their result does not take this possibility into account.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for our lack of clarity describing our rationale for these experiments. Neurons expressing the excitatory DREADD hM3Dq in slices from mice exposed to CNO for 14 days still show an increased firing rate after CNO application (Cheng et al., 2018). We now include this rationale and its justification in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is extremely difficult to interpret the experiments presented in Figure 8 in terms of a change in presynaptic efficacy. The authors use an extremely artificial setting (4-AP + TTX+ 4 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>) to evaluate synaptic efficacy via optogenetic stimulation. It is difficult ascertain if the differences seen in these experiments are indeed due to bigger boutons and increased presynaptic release probability.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the issue of synaptic strength, we did not intend to interpret our results as reflecting a purely presynaptic difference between <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO and wild-type mice.The larger volume of presynaptic boutons of vHIP axons in the mPFC of <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice suggest higher synaptic strength, but not necessarily due solely to a presynaptic mechanism. Larger presynaptic boutons are correlated to larger active zones and thus higher numbers of docked vesicles and higher Pr (e.g. Murthy et al., 2001), but also to larger spine heads with larger postsynaptic densities containing more glutamate receptors (Matsuzaki et al., 2004). The data presented in Figure 8 supports a difference in synaptic strength due to a postsynaptic mechanism:higher AMPA/NMDA ratio at vHIP-evoked optical EPSCs in mPFC layer 5 pyramidal neurons from <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice. The observation of larger presynaptic boutons and higher AMPA/NMDA ratios reflect mechanisms underlying synaptic strength that are not mutually exclusive. In addition, preliminary analyses of optical EPSCs evoked by paired-pulse stimulation in standard recording conditions (i.e. normal extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, no TTX, no 4-AP) suggest a higher Pr at vHIP synapses on mPFC pyramidal neurons in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice, but not on interneurons. The parsimonious interpretation is that vHIP synapses on mPFC pyramidal neurons are stronger in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice due to both higher presynaptic efficacy and higher postsynaptic responsiveness. We consider that the full characterization of presynaptic and postsynaptic function at vHIP-mPFC synapses is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p>We apologize for our lack of clarity describing our rationale for the design of these experiments. The reason to perform optogenetic stimulation in the presence of TTX, 4-AP, and 4mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was to isolate monosynaptic EPSCs for accurate measurements of their amplitude without the confounding contribution of polysynaptic responses (Petreneau et al., 2009).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors demonstrate that the projection from ventral hippocampus to mPFC is hyperactive in symptomatic Rett mice, yet activity driven by intracortical stimulation is decreased. The electrophysiological findings in Figure 3 and Figure 4, and anatomical findings in Figure 6, are convincing and compelling. However, the link to behavior is tenuous, largely because of issues with the statistics. It is difficult to gauge the claims made in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 4, Figure 5. Although this is a potentially very interesting manuscript, the statistical issues make it difficult to assess the impact of the paper, as well as what additional experiments or analyses may be needed.</p><p>Specifically:</p><p>Figure 1 represents an extremely ambitious experiment, as the authors compare c-Fos expression across two experimental conditions, two genotypes, and neurons that project to two regions. I have a number of concerns about the experimental design and analysis. In sum, the data, as presented, do not fully support the claim that mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons are selectively activated during social encounters.</p><p>The rationale for using the behavioral task in Figure 1C is a bit unclear. (If this is a commonly used and well-accepted protocol, please cite its prior use.) On the control arm of the task, the subject gets two novel objects consecutively (two fake mice). On the experimental arm, the subject gets a familiar mouse and then a novel mouse. It is not clear why two steps are needed here. It seems one of the following designs may better assess social encounters:</p><p>a) Two arms being a familiar mouse, then sac, or a novel mouse, then sac.b) Two arms being a novel fake mouse, then sac, or a novel mouse, then sac.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this opportunity to clarify the rationale of the these experiments. The two experimental designs suggested by the reviewer address two different issues: (a) is designed to test the hypothesis that vHIP neurons are activated by social interaction with a novel mouse (as opposed to a familiar one), while (b) tests the hypothesis that vHIP neurons are activated by social interaction with a novel mouse (as opposed to a toy mouse).</p><p>Our experimental design aims to test the second issue: whether mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons are activated by a social encounter, as opposed to exposure to a toy mouse. Okuyama et al., (2016) describe that exposure to mice caused activation of vHIP neurons, regardless of novelty; however, these authors did not differentiate between vHIP neurons that project to different brain areas. Because we were unsure of the sensitivity of the c-Fos intensity assay, we choose to present a strong stimulation to recruit as many mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons as possible to increase the signal-tonoise of the assay. To ensure maximal activation of as many mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons as possible we performed sequential interactions, first with a littermate mouse followed by a non-littermate mouse 1 hour later as the &quot;social conditionâ Please note that this experiment was not performed to identify the vHIP neurons that encode social memory (as in the reviewerâs (a) design), which we think requires the application of a different experimental approach other than just c-Fos labeling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The methods for quantifying images (as in Figure 1D) are not described.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight, we now include all methodological details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors report number of cells as &quot;n&quot; in Figure 1E, but in this case it seems as though the correct biological replicate here should be number of animals (and c-Fos expression should be averaged within animal).</p><p>Statistically, the authors report a Kruskal-Wallis test, which is a non-parametric one-way ANOVA. But a one-way ANOVA is not appropriate for such an ambitious experiment, where three conditions are being compared simultaneously (genotype, behavioral condition, and projection). For example, the conclusion that &quot;the differences in c-Fos intensities between the object and social conditions were smaller in Mecp2 KO mice&quot; (subsection âmPFC-projecting vHIP neurons are selectively activated during social encountersâ) appears to be true, but is not supported by a statistically significant interaction between genotype and behavioral condition. Overall, the study is likely under-powered (2-4 animals per group) for a 3x2 design and a three-way ANOVA.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the suggestion from reviewer 1 and consultation with biostatisticians at UAB (see above), panel D in Figure 1 in the revised manuscript shows the cumulative probability distributions of c-Fos intensities from individual neurons. In addition, panel D in the new Figure 1 shows the same data as bar graphs of c-Fos intensity in each cell averaged per mouse as the sampling number ânâ. We performed a three-way ANOVA using genotype, behavioral condition, and projection as the conditions, which yielded statistically significant differences between the groups as in the original analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have a similar concern for Figure 2. On the whole, the data in Figure 2 seem to suggest impairments in social behavior and social memory in Rett mice, but it is not clear if these findings are supported statistically. The authors conclude that &quot;Mecp2 KO mice spent similar amounts of time in both chambers&quot; (Subsection âAtypical social behavior and impaired social memory in Mecp2 KO miceâ), whereas WT mice spent more time in the chamber with stranger 2.&quot; This result, compared with the left panel of Figure 2C, leads the authors to conclude that Rett mice have normal social preference, but impaired social memory. However, paired t-tests are not sufficient to make across-group comparisons. A two-way RM ANOVA would be needed for both the left and right panels in Figure 2C. A statistically significant interaction in the right panel would provide statistical support to the claim that Rett mice have impaired social memory. The same point also applies to Figure 2G.</p></disp-quote><p>Following reviewer 2âs suggestion in Figure 4 question 2, we have changed all the panels illustrating the social memory results to now show a memory Discrimination Index as the variable for statistical comparisons, which yields a single value per group. The memory Discrimination Index is the difference in the time spent following a novel mouse compared to the time spent following a familiar mouse. For comparisons between 2 groups, we used either a Studentâs t-test for parametric data or a MannWhitney test for non-parametric data (data distribution was tested with the DâAgostino and Pearsonâs test for normalcy). For comparisons between 3 or more groups, we used a two-way ANOVA. In addition, we now report a post-hoc one sample t-test comparing the Discrimination Index values against chance values to determine if each group has a significant preference in following times. In addition, we now include all the raw data of following times in supplemental figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection âAtypical social behavior and impaired social memory in Mecp2 KO miceâ: &quot;During the first four minutes of the assay, WT mice preferentially interacted with the novel mouse across all measured social behaviors, including following, sniffing, and &quot;jumping on&quot;, after which social interaction declined regardless of target (n=6 mice, p&lt;0.05, Student's paired t-test Figure 2F).&quot; Two questions here:</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the typographical mistake: the statistics reported in 2G are about the memory component.</p><p>The rationale of using the first 4 minutes of the total 10 minutes of the unrestricted social interaction assay is based on the observation that more than 75% of the social interactions occur during the first 4 minutes. After that time, there is no longer a difference in time spent interacting with the target the mice compared to the time spent exploring the environment, as the test mouse becomes acclimated to their presence. As a result of this, the Discrimination Index after the first 4 minutes become a less reliable estimate of the social interactions. The entirety of the 10 minute videos are used for quantification of non-target specific behaviors, as different behaviors emerged at later times in the movies. We have plotted the analyses of the entire 10-minute videos and included as Figure 2âfigure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) It is not clear what the statistics are referring to here. It could be either the finding that WT mice interacted with the novel mouse preferentially in social behaviors (in which case the callout should be 2G), or it could be the claim that social interaction declined after the first four minutes. If the latter, the summarized data should be plotted in a panel in addition to the example trace in Figure 2F.</p><p>b) Why do the authors extract the first 4 minutes out of 10 for analysis? Has this been done by previous groups, and/or was this cutoff determined a priori? This is an important cutoff to justify, as it is used in multiple analyses throughout the paper.</p><p>Overall, Figure 3 nicely demonstrates that vHIP stimulation drives increased excitability in mPFC slices, but intracortical stimulation suggests that the local network is hypoexcitable in Rett. I have only a few minor questions about Figure 3:</p></disp-quote><p> <italic>The authors claim that VSD signals in</italic> ex vivo <italic>slices are directly proportional to the amplitude of field EPSPs and follow their kinetics (subsection âIncreased influence of vHIP input on the mPFC network in Mecp2 KO miceâ, Figure 3B-C). The only demonstration of this is a single example traces in Figure 3C. This point would be made much more strongly with an example I/O curve.</italic> </p><p>Please see our answer to question 2 by reviewer 1. Briefly, we now include the input output relationships of VSD signals and the initial slope of field EPSPs in a</p><p>supplementary figure, including representative images of color coded âF/F ratios, and âF/F traces from 4 stimulation intensities. Similar direct proportionality has been consistently reported in papers using organic VSD dyes for imaging subthresold voltage responses in ex vivo brain slices (e.g. Chang and Jackson, 2003; Bandyopadhyay et al., 2005; Calfa et al., 2011).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How is dF/F calculated for VSD signals in I/O curves (such as Figure 3E)? I apologize if I missed this in the methods. The example in Figure 3D includes both a time dimension and a spatial dimension of the VSD signal. Do the points in Figure 3E represent summated dF/F in the whole window at the peak time? Or the most intense peak in the window at the peak time?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of detail in the Materials and methods section, which are now included in the revised manuscript. The maximum VSD signals are the mean âF/F ratios within a 3x3 pixel region of interest (ROI) placed on the location with the highest âF/F ratio at 6 ms after afferent stimulation, which always occurred within layer 2/3 of mPFC slices. We chose 6 ms after stimulation because that coincides with the peak of the extracellularly recorded field EPSP. We now have uploaded our code to the GitHub repository and provide the link in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3âfigure supplement 2, the authors demonstrate that Rett slices have impaired LTP. They present normalized data, likely because the Rett slices are hyperactive at baseline (visible in example trace and demonstrated in Figure 3). Is it possible that the lack of LTP might reflect a ceiling effect?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, we think that the lack of LTP at vHIP-mPFC synapses is due to a âceilingâ effect. We have demonstrated that hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses of <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice are potentiated at baseline due to impaired synaptic AMPAR trafficking, which prevents further LTP (Li et al., 2016); a similar mechanism impairs homeostatic synaptic plasticity in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO hippocampal neurons in culture (Xu and Pozzo-Miller, 2017). We consider that performing the long list of experiments required to demonstrate the same mechanism at vHIP-mPFC synapses is beyond the scope of the present manuscript, and is the focus of our immediate efforts in the lab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4âfigure supplement 1, Figure 4âfigure supplement 2, Figure 4âfigure supplement 3 are mentioned in the text as being related to Figure 4, but they seem more related to Figure 3.

I have a few questions:</p><p>Were the experimenters blind to genotype for these experiments? If so, why is there an excitatory DREADD group only for the WT condition?</p></disp-quote><p>We decided to only test the effects of the excitatory DREADD in WT mice because making the vHIP more hyperactive in <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice will surely affect behavioral responses that are already affected. Since the outcome of these experiments may not reveal novel information about Rett syndrome, we decided not to use more animals than those strictly necessary. The experimenters were not blinded to genotype when injecting mice in order to optimize the number of animals to be used in these experiments. The experimenters were blinded during behavioral testing, though some <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice were profoundly symptomatic and easy to identify. The implementation of computer vision to score all behavioral data, and of Matlab codes to analyze all VSD data are additional steps taken to ensure unbiased acquisition and analyses of data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Student's and nonparametric paired t-tests are not appropriate to compare three conditions: genotype, familiar vs. novel, and DREADD. Therefore it is difficult to assess whether inhibitory DREADDs do indeed improve performance in Rett mice, or whether excitatory DREADDs do indeed mimic altered performance. One idea that perhaps could reduce the number of dimensions from 3 to 2 for this and other studies would be to plot &quot;time following&quot; as a proportion within animal (similar to &quot;memory discrepancy&quot; in Figure 4I). This way, a 2-way ANOVA would work instead of a 3-way ANOVA. Then perhaps a supplement could show the absolute following times in a descriptive way to the familiar and novel animal, because it is nice to see those raw data as well.</p><p>The way the electrophysiological data are presented in Figure 4 appear much cleaner, but again, these experiments were done at the same time.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the changes made to the statistical analyses of behavioral data, please refer to our response to Figure 2 question 1. To briefly restate, following advice from biostatisticians at UAB (see above) and the reviewerâs suggestion, we have consolidated the time spent following familiar and novel mice into a Discrimination Index; the raw data of following times is now presented in supplementary figures. We performed a two-way ANOVA (Group x Discrimination Index) with multiple comparisons and a post-hoc one-sample t-test against chance to determine significant preferences. The outcome of these tests match the results presented in the original manuscript. We could not perform a three-way ANOVA (Genotype x DREADD x Memory) because the 2 genotypes did not receive the same DREADD treatment (as justified above). We have therefore referred to the Genotype x DREADD as âGroupâ, as per the suggestion of biostatisticians at UAB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not clear how statistics were done here: were two-way ANOVAs done individually on each panel in Figures 4F and 4H? Because each panel contains WT mCherry and KO mCherry, plus a different condition. I like that it is plotted this way to make things easier to understand, but it is not clear whether the statistical analysis is done on the entire dataset (genotype X DREADD X stim. intensity)? Again, perhaps the stim. intensity dimension could be collapsed if need be to a single value if a three-way test is prohibitive.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for our lack of clarity.

When these data from all <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice are pooled, there is a statistically significant correlation between social memory and vHIPdriven mPFC activity.

However, the sample size is much larger in pyramidal cells (n=15 or n=11, versus n=6 in inhibitory cells in 8D). Increasing the sample size to ~10-15 neurons for Figure 8D-H would be useful in helping to understand if the trend seen in 8D and 8H (p=0.06) would reach statistical significance with equivalent power.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewerâs suggestion, we have increased the sample size of the wholecell recordings from mPFC interneurons during optical stimulation of either vHIP or contralateral mPFC axons to n=11 from WT mice and n=12 from <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice. Statistical comparisons yielded no significant differences in either vHIP-evoked synaptic currents or mPFC-evoked synaptic currents, as well as in the normalized data.

I have no major concerns and do not feel any additional experiments are needed.</p><p>A minor concern is that the statistical testing performed should be consistent. In some of the behavior analysis, non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, etc) are used and in other cases parametric (t-test, anova) are used. This is problematic when there are different tests used for different components of the same overall analysis, for example in Figure 2E for free moving behavior all the comparisons used student t-test except for aggressor which used Kolomogorov-Smirnov testing, which is probably not an appropriate test in this case anyway. It would appear that the test was cherry picked to identify significance, rather than choosing appropriate statistical methods before analysis. A non-parametric rank test like Mann-Whitney is probably appropriate, and ultimately if no significance exists for aggressor it will in no way change the overall manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for our lack of clarity and for giving the impression that we selected statistical tests to hunt for p value significance (not our practice).
