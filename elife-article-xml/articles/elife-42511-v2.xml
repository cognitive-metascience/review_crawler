Synapsis of homologous chromosomes is initiated at the leptotene stage of the first meiotic prophase by induction of developmentally programmed, SPO11-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keeney et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keeney et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Romanienko and Camerini-Otero, 2000</xref>). After 5’ to 3’ resection of each end of DSB, replication protein A (RPA) binds the 3’ overhang to save it from degradation, later being displaced by RAD51 and DMC1 recombinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inagaki et al., 2010</xref>) but see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2018</xref>). The resulting nucleoprotein filament is engaged in homology search in the process leading to DSBs repair by homologous recombination and to synapsis of homologous chromosomes. The SPO11-induced DSBs are nonrandomly clustered into narrow 1–2 kilobase-pair intervals called recombination hotspots and their localization is predetermined by the PRDM9 binding to specific motifs inside these intervals and PRDM9-driven induced trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 and lysine 36 on adjacent nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baudat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Myers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parvanov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eram et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lange et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Powers et al., 2016</xref>, for recent reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grey et al., 2018</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paigen and Petkov, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Prdm9</italic> gene, besides determining position of the recombination hotspots, acts as the major hybrid sterility gene in certain hybrids between house mouse subspecies of <italic>Mus m. musculus</italic> (mouse strain PWD) and <italic>Mus m. domesticus</italic> (mouse strain C57BL/6, hereafter B6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mihola et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dzur-Gejdosova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forejt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhattacharyya et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhattacharyya et al., 2014</xref>).

This unexpected finding provided direct evidence for the role of PRDM9 ZnF array in the control of hybrid sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davies et al., 2016</xref>). The asynapsis and male sterility were proposed to be mainly a consequence of the evolutionary erosion of PRDM9 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Because the heterozygous allelic sites with lower PRDM9 binding affinity are used preferentially as a template for DSB repair in gene-conversion events, the sites with higher binding affinity mutate much faster than the rest of the genome. As a result, the majority of the PRDM9<sup>PWD</sup>-determined hotspots in PBF1 sterile males are found on B6 homologs and vice versa. Such hotspot asymmetry can result in a delay or inability to repair DSBs using homologous chromosome as a template, thus preventing successful pairing and synapsis of homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davies et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42511.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>DSB asymmetry model based on historical erosion of PRDM9 binding sites.</title><p>A simplified scheme of a pair of homologous chromosomes in PWD (<italic>Mus m. musculus</italic>) and B6 (<italic>Mus m. domesticus</italic>) mice and sterile (PWD x B6) intersubspecific male F1 hybrids. Eroded PRDM9<sup>B6</sup> binding sites are not recognized or hardly recognized by the PRDM9<sup>B6</sup> zinc-finger array in B6 meiosis, but the same sites were saved from erosion during the evolution of the other subspecies. Thus, in (PWD x B6)F1 hybrids PRDM9<sup>B6</sup> often binds to the sites on PWD chromosome that are erased on B6 homolog and, vice versa, PRDM9<sup>PWD</sup> more often binds to the sites on B6 homolog, eroded in PWD. The proportion of such asymmetric sites exceeds 70% of all DSBs in (PWD x B6)F1 hybrid meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davies et al., 2016</xref>) and interferes with chromosome synapsis and meiotic progression. The higher activity of these asymmetric hotspots estimated by DMC1-ChIP-seq is explained by a delay or failure of DSB repair.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-42511-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We recently rescued synapsis of homologous chromosomes in meiosis of PBF1 sterile hybrids by elimination of PRDM9 hotspot asymmetry in random chromosomal intervals (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mo>≥</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>27 Mb), with paternal and maternal copies originating from the same PWD subspecies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gregorova et al., 2018</xref>).

To further test the idea that the failure of proper meiotic synapsis in hybrid males is due to an insufficient number of timely repaired 'symmetric' DSBs and to evaluate the unlikely possibility that the rescue was caused by multiple recessive genetic factors of PWD origin, we increased the number of DSBs per cell by inflicting random exogenous DSBs to meiotic cells. We report that the exogenous DSBs generated by chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu and Krishnamurthy, 2010</xref>) enhanced meiotic synapsis of homologous chromosomes in sterile mouse inter-subspecies hybrids, thus bringing independent evidence on the mechanism of meiotic chromosome asynapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gregorova et al., 2018</xref>) and supporting the 'asymmetry' hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davies et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Cisplatin (cis-platinum diamminedichloride, hereafter cisPt) is known to create DNA inter-strand (ICL) and intra-strand cross-links.

To verify this assumption, we analyzed the asynapsis rate by immunostaining the lateral elements of synaptonemal complexes with antibody against synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SYCP3) and unsynapsed axial cores of homologous chromosomes with antibodies specific for HORMA domain containing two proteins (HORMAD 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kogo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wojtasz et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

The percentage of pachynemas with fully synapsed bivalents dramatically increased from 5.66% in the control male (0 mg/kg of cisPt) to 48.78% and 46.70% in the males on the 7th and 8th day after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).

However, for statistical evaluation the mid and late pachynemas were merged because of the scarcity of the latest stage. While the cisPt treatment caused a nonsignificant increase of fully synapsed early pachynemas, the enhancement of synapsis was dramatic in mid-late pachynemas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). We assume that the efficiency of repair of cisPt-induced DSBs by standard homologous recombination is low in general and/or that a significant fraction of spermatocytes carrying them do not survive until early pachytene stage. Those spermatocytes with multiple asynapsed autosomes that survive to the early pachytene stage are mostly eliminated before reaching the mid-late pachytene stage as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhattacharyya et al., 2013</xref>). This multiple filtering effect thus enhances the apparent efficiency of cisPt monitored as a proportion of fully synapsed pachynemas at the mid-late stage.</p><p>When divided according the cell cycle stage at the time of cisPt injection, the synapsis was marginally significantly more frequent (p=0.0433, GLM model) in EdU-negative than in EdU-positive pachynemas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), on average 1.69 times (1.02; 2.84, 95 % CI; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). The EdU-negative fully synapsed pachynemas could arise from a subset of cells with exogenous DSBs generated at leptotene/early zygotene at the time of cisPt and EdU injection. It is tempting to suggest that also the EdU-positive cells that were at the preleptotene S-phase at the time of injection removed the cisPt induced ICLs at early leptotene stage.</p><p>No sperm was found in the ductus epididymis of the males 30 days after injection. Histological sections showed atrophy of seminiferous tubules caused by the lethal effect of cisPt on proliferating spermatogonia and somatic cells of seminiferous tubules (not shown). Beside the increased frequency of fully synapsed pachynemas, a short-term effect was apparent from the increased relative incidence of late pachynemas. While in untreated control hybrids the late pachynemas represented 2.03% (4/107) of all pachynemas recorded from the meiotic spreads, the frequency increased to 12.12% (28/231) and 13.10% (30/229) after 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg cisPt treatment, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Improved synapsis of meiotic chromosomes by exogenous DNA DSBs points to the insufficient number of properly repaired DSBs as the ultimate cause of meiotic asynapsis and hybrid sterility</title><p>The genetic network controlling incomplete synapsis of homologous chromosomes, early meiotic arrest, and male sterility of mouse inter-subspecific PBF1 hybrids is formed by three components, <italic>Prdm9<sup>PWD/B6</sup></italic> heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mihola et al., 2009</xref>), PWD allele at the <italic>Hstx2</italic> locus on Chromosome X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Storchová et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhattacharyya et al., 2014</xref>﻿ for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forejt et al., 2012</xref>), and autosomal PWD/B6 heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dzur-Gejdosova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gregorova et al., 2018</xref>). While the molecular mechanism of the <italic>Hstx2</italic> action is still unclear, four mutually nonexclusive explanations of PRDM9-controlled meiotic arrest have been proposed. Originally, we hypothesized that a divergence of fast evolving noncoding DNA and/or RNA sequences could interfere with the homology search of single-strand 3’ ends on a heterosubspecific template during the DSB repair, thus interfering with chromosome synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhattacharyya et al., 2014</xref>). However, our hypothesis offered no explanation for the role of <italic>Prdm9</italic> in the presumed impairment of homology search. Later, using our PBF1 hybrid sterility model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davies et al. (2016)</xref> found that ~70% of PRDM9-directed hotspots were enriched on a ‘nonself’ chromosome (e.g. PRDM9<sup>B6</sup> on PWD chromosome and vice versa). DSBs in these hotspots are difficult to repair or they repair too late, perhaps using sister chromatids as a template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Faieta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Chromosomal distribution of asymmetric DSB hotspots correlated well with the asynapsis rate of particular chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gregorova et al., 2018</xref>) and indicated that the insufficient number of DSBs generated at symmetric hotspots may limit their pairing and normal progression of spermatogenesis. The present results show that, indeed, addition of repairable, non-DSBs in the form of exogenous DSBs significantly improved the faulty synapsis of homologous chromosomes.</p><p>Another possible mechanism explaining the role of <italic>Prdm9</italic> in meiotic arrest points to a significant enrichment of the default, PRDM9-independent DSB hotspots in PBF1 spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smagulova et al., 2016</xref>). Such hotspots were observed in <italic>Prdm9</italic><sup>-/-</sup> sterile males and are preferentially located in promoters and other regulatory sequences. This observation could indicate functional deficiency of PRDM9 in hybrid males, such as inefficient PRDM9 multimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altemose et al., 2017</xref>) the improvement of which is difficult to envisage by adding exogenous DSBs. Finally, since a recent report uncovered about 30% of PRDM9-controlled DSBs in repetitive sequences including transposons, their homology at nonallelic sites could destabilize genome integrity and interfere with the DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamada et al., 2017</xref>). Such a mechanism could operate independently of and in parallel with the symmetric DSB-dependent pachytene checkpoint.</p><p>To conclude, our results complement our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gregorova et al., 2018</xref>) bringing new evidence for the deficiency in properly repaired DSBs as one of the major causes of meiotic asynapsis and male sterility of PBF1 inter-subspecific hybrids. Although our results do not exclude the role of PRDM9 default or retroposon-directed hotspots in meiotic failure, they bring a new and independent evidence in favor of DSB hotspot asymmetry caused by PRDM9 hotspot erasure as the main cause of chromosome asynapsis and meiotic arrest in PBF1 intersubspecific hybrid sterility.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent <break/>type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th colspan="2">Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus m. domesticus</italic>)</td><td colspan="2" valign="bottom">C57BL/6J</td><td valign="bottom">The Jackson <break/>Laboratory</td><td valign="bottom">Stock No: 000664 | Black 6</td><td valign="bottom">Laboratory inbred strain, <break/>predominantly of <italic>Mus</italic> <break/><italic>m. domesticus</italic> origin</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus m. musculus</italic>)</td><td colspan="2" valign="bottom">PWD/Ph</td><td valign="bottom">Institute of <break/>Molecular <break/>Genetics, <break/>ASCR, Prague</td><td valign="bottom">N/A</td><td valign="bottom">Wild-derived <break/>inbred strain <break/>of <italic>Mus</italic> <break/> <italic>m. musculus</italic> origin</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td colspan="2" valign="bottom">anti SYCP3 <break/>(mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="bottom">Santa Cruz <break/>Biotechnology</td><td valign="bottom">Santa Cruz: <break/>sc-74569; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2197353">AB_2197353</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom">(1:50)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td colspan="2" valign="bottom">anti HORMAD2 <break/>(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="bottom">gift from Attila Toth</td><td valign="bottom">N/A</td><td valign="bottom">(1:700)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td colspan="2" valign="bottom">anti HORMAD2 <break/>(rabbit polyclonal <break/>, C-18)</td><td valign="bottom">Santa Cruz <break/>Biotechnology</td><td valign="bottom">Santa Cruz:sc-82192; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2121124">AB_2121124</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom">(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td colspan="2" valign="bottom">Anti RPA <break/>(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="bottom">gift from Willy <break/>M.

The images were acquired and examined in a Nikon Eclipse 400 microscope with a motorized stage control using a Plan Fluor objective, 60x (MRH00601; Nikon) and captured using a DS-QiMc monochrome CCD camera (Nikon) and the NIS-Elements program (Nikon). To quantify RPA and DMC1 foci in spread nuclei we used ImageJ (Wayne Rasband, National Institute of Health, USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij</ext-link>). Images were processed using the Adobe Photoshop CS software (Adobe Systems). The estimates of the mean asynapsis rate, their standard errors and 95% confidence intervals were based on the Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) described in the previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gregorova et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Vladana Fotopulosova and Diana Lustyk for the help with meiotic analyses, Petr Jansa and Vaclav Gergelits and Emil Parvanov for helpful comments and help in preparation of the figures.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This &quot;Research Advance&quot; report by Forejt and colleagues provides orthogonal support for the hypothesis that male hybrid sterility with allelic incompatibility between Prdm9 and chromosomal haplotypes is caused by insufficient &quot;asymmetric&quot; DSBs, leading to failed homologous chromosome synapsis that triggers the meiotic checkpoint. This short manuscript is in support of a previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper that had remarkable genetic support for this model.</p><p>The basic idea is that both homologs need to receive about equal numbers of DSBs to promote interhomolog repair. The argument goes that if one homolog gets the majority of DSBs (because the PRDM9 allele's binding sites are underrepresented on one homolog), these will tend to be repaired by intersister recombination, which isn't productive in driving synapsis. It isn't clear to me why this would be, and the paper doesn't really address this potential mechanism. Nevertheless, the authors show that exogenous DSBs induced by cisplatin, presumably which occur randomly across all chromosome homologs and thus are &quot;symmetric,&quot; substantially rescues synapsis and spermatocytes.</p><p>The manuscript itself is nicely done, and the results are convincing that cisplatin-induced DSBs rescue synapsis in a substantial fraction of hybrid spermatocytes. This would be an interesting addition to the meiosis literature, in that it supports the findings of older papers indicating that exogenous DSBs can, to some extent, substitute for SPO11 DSBs. Regarding its contribution to the hybrid sterility literature, these results strongly support the idea that a DSB deficiency underlies the synapsis defect. However, the manuscript does not provide direct evidence for the &quot;asymmetric DSB&quot; hypothesis; this would require a comparison of intersister vs. interhomolog repair of DSBs either genome-wide or in chromosomal intervals that are particularly susceptible to asynapsis in hybrids. This is an important shortfall of the paper with respect to linking to the &quot;parent&quot; paper, but it isn't clear how this can actually be addressed directly.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Add a cogent description (or cartoon figure) of the symmetric DSB model. This concept is confusing and not widely known in the meiosis field. From reading this in isolation, one might erroneously assume that symmetric DSBs are those that occur on both homologs at the same hotspot in the same spermatocyte, whereas asymmetric ones only occur on one homolog. Another interpretation is that symmetric sites are where PRDM9 binds the same locus of both homologs, but only one receives a DSB.</p><p>2) Propose an explanation for why asymmetric DSBs are primarily repaired via sister chromatid recombination…this implies that such DSBs along chromosome intervals somehow communicate with one another, i.e., that if all/most DSBs are on one homolog, then they are repaired via the sisters, but if the DSBs are distributed equally between homologs, then interhomolog repair is favored. Are there hints from other model organisms in which intersister events can be monitored directly?</p><p>3) Address the following concerns related to the data in Figure 4:i) the conclusion that cisplatin improves synapsis at &quot;mid-late&quot; pachynema requires accurate substaging of cells, which is not the case based on Figure 4A. The bottom cell is clearly at late pachynema, as shown by the bulging chromosome ends, behaviour of the XY bivalent, and DAPI-staining. But the top and middle cells are at early pachynema (compare the chromosome morphology and DAPI). The issue is magnified by the apparently very high levels of asynapsis in the untreated mice at mid-late pachynema (Figure 4E). As the authors and others have found, cells with asynapsis are eliminated at mid pachynema, so I'm not sure how these high levels of asynapsis can be possible at late prophase I. A systematic problem in stage-matching should be considered here.</p><p>ii) It isn't clear to me why the authors don't also find improved synapsis at early pachynema. Sure, the frequency of asynapsis will be higher at early than at mid-late pachynema because of the midpachytene checkpoint, but shouldn't a difference be observed between the cisplatin-treated and -untreated mice at early pachynema?</p><p>4) The effect of cisplatin on other aspects of the hybrid sterile phenotype are not presented. The authors state in data not shown that cisplatin causes atrophy due to toxic effect. But couldn't they assay in the short-term whether the number of cells reaching late pachynema after treatment is increased? And how do toxic effects of cisplatin on pachytene substages influence the interpretations in Figure 4?</p><p>5) EdU treatment.</p><p>i) To the non-initiated, the expectations and interpretations of the EdU+ and – cells will not be easy to understand. The authors could do a better job of explaining this.</p><p>ii) Why are DSB counts assayed at zygonema and pachynema but not leptonema? Isn't the latter stage the important one to focus on given the DSB hypothesis?</p><p>6) Clarify the following: Why is there so much asynapsis in the early pachytenes (assuming correct staging), even with CP treatment? Is it possible that the timing was such that this cohort was derived from cells that weren't in S phase? And so many asynapsed &quot;Mid-late&quot; pachytenes doesn't make sense in terms of checkpoint elimination…perhaps H1t staining was needed? These potential issues with stage-matching and the lack of an objective measure (beyond incidence of full synapsis) with which to ascertain that cisplatin rescues F1 hybrid cells are major concerns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42511.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The basic idea is that both homologs need to receive about equal numbers of DSBs to promote interhomolog repair.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry that we have not been clear enough when describing the asymmetric hotspot hypothesis. An unequal mean number of DSBs on homologs is not the explanation of our model of hybrid sterility. The proposed mechanism of asymmetric DSB hotspots (Davies et al., 2016) is based on the subspecies-specific erasure of PRDM9 binding sites, as demonstrated in the scheme newly added in Figure 1. The asymmetry in sterile F1 hybrids results in unrepairable or hardly repairable DSBs trying to use the homologous chromosome as a template. These unrepaired DSBs and the failure of pairing due to the deficiency of non-sister repaired DSBs results in elimination of meiotic cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The argument goes that if one homolog gets the majority of DSBs (because the PRDM9 allele's binding sites are underrepresented on one homolog), these will tend to be repaired by intersister recombination, which isn't productive in driving synapsis.

The asymmetry model is based on the subspecies-specific erosion of PRDM9 binding sites due to the meiotic drive (see the newly added Figure 1). If the majority of DSBs cannot be repaired by recombination (CO or NCO) from the homologous chromosomes and the number of sucessfully repaired DSBs falls below a certain threshold, then the 100% efficiency of homologous chromosome synapsis becomes compromised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript itself is nicely done, and the results are convincing that cisplatin-induced DSBs rescue synapsis in a substantial fraction of hybrid spermatocytes.

The question we asked was whether, as predicted by the asymmetry hypothesis, exogenous DSBs can improve synapsis of homologous chromosomes in sterile interspecies hybrids by increasing the number of presumably repairable DSBs. The apoptosis of primary spermatocytes can be provoked by persisting unrepaired DSBs, or to be a response to the failure of meiotic synapsis. We newly compared the rates of DMC1 and RPA foci at the pachytene stage in the fertile untreated parents, B6 and PWD, with sterile (PWD x B6)F1 hybrids (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1) to emphasize the large numbers of persisting DSBs in pachynemas of sterile F1 hybrids. The results are summarized in the subsection “CisPt induced DSBs in early meiotic prophase of sterile male hybrids”, second and fourth paragraphs. To our best knowledge, no method is available to provide direct evidence for intersister chromatid repair in mouse/mammalian meiosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Add a cogent description (or cartoon figure) of the symmetric DSB model.

We agree that a cogent description of the symmetric DSB model was missing, which might have led to misunderstandings. We added a schematic drawing of a pair of homologous chromosomes with the asymmetric DSBs in the new Figure 1 and supplied the detailed legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Propose an explanation for why asymmetric DSBs are primarily repaired via sister chromatid recombination…this implies that such DSBs along chromosome intervals somehow communicate with one another, i.e., that if all/most DSBs are on one homolog, then they are repaired via the sisters, but if the DSBs are distributed equally between homologs, then interhomolog repair is favored. Are there hints from other model organisms in which intersister events can be monitored directly?</p></disp-quote><p>In the manuscript we do not propose that the asymmetric DSBs are primarily repaired via sister chromatid recombination. Rather, we think that the asymmetric DSBs primarily remain unrepaired, as mentioned above. Our only reference to sister chromatid recombination is: “DSBs in these hotspots are difficult to repair or they repair too late, perhaps using sister chromatids as a template (Faieta et al. 2016; Li et al. 2018).” However, we do present direct cytological evidence for the persisting DSBs at the pachytene stage and for asynapsis, both of them being able to arrest the first meiotic division on its own. Contrary to the clearance of DSBs on unpaired parts of X and Y chromosomes or on certain chromosomal translocations where DMC1/RAD51 foci disappear by late pachytene most likely by inter-sister-chromatid repair, the high numbers of RPA and DMC1 foci persist through the pachytene stage in (PWD x B6)F1 hybrid males. The cells are eliminated before the DSBs could have been repaired by inter-sister recombination (see newly added Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1). It is probable that the sister chromatid recombination also contributes to the reduction of DSB numbers at the pachytene stage (compared with zygonemas), but we do not possess tools to experimentally verify this idea.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Address the following concerns related to the data in Figure 4:i) the conclusion that cisplatin improves synapsis at &quot;mid-late&quot; pachynema requires accurate substaging of cells, which is not the case based on Figure 4A.</p></disp-quote><p>The conclusion is based on the quantitative evaluation of 645 pachynemas classified as early, middle and late pachynemas (See Figure 5—source data 2. Figure 4 became Figure 5 after revision). Figure 5A illustrates the reliability of the method to detect asynapsis but legend does not specify the pachytene stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The bottom cell is clearly at late pachynema, as shown by the bulging chromosome ends, behaviour of the XY bivalent, and DAPI-staining. But the top and middle cells are at early pachynema (compare the chromosome morphology and DAPI).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the cell is a late pachynema and admit the pachytene stages were not specified in the legend to Figure 5A. To avoid misunderstanding, the pachytene substage of all three cells is now added to the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The issue is magnified by the apparently very high levels of asynapsis in the untreated mice at mid-late pachynema (Figure 4E).

It shows that the cells with four or less univalents can reach mid pachytene and a few of them late pachytene. Pachynemas with &gt; 4 univalents were detected at early pachytene but were missing later. In this manuscript, we deliberately classified pachynemas into two groups, fully synapsed and pachynemas with asynapsis, to quantify the overall effect of cisPt on meiotic synapsis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) It isn't clear to me why the authors don't also find improved synapsis at early pachynema.

Indeed, we did not expect such a difference between early and mid-late pachynemas and failed to comment on it in the text. The detailed explanation was added to the second paragraph of the subsection “CisPt treatment enhances meiotic synapsis of homologous chromosomes in sterile hybrids”. See also our response to point 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The effect of cisplatin on other aspects of the hybrid sterile phenotype are not presented.

And how do toxic effects of cisplatin on pachytene substages influence the interpretations in Figure 4?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion to focus on the late pachynemas after treatment. The comparison indeed shows the increase of late pachynemas. The analysis was included as follows “Beside the increased frequency of fully synapsed pachynemas, a short-term effect was apparent from the increased relative incidence of late pachynemas. While in untreated control hybrids the late pachynemas represented 2.03% (4/107) of all pachynemas recorded from the meiotic spreads, the frequency increased to 12.12% (28/231) and 13.10% (30/229) after 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg cisPt treatment, respectively”.For the interpretation of the toxic effect of cisPt in Figure 5, see also our answer to Essential revisions No 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) EdU treatment.</p><p>i) To the non-initiated, the expectations and interpretations of the EdU+ and – cells will not be easy to understand. The authors could do a better job of explaining this.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for comment. The rationale of EdU treatment was explained as follows: “we treated the adult (4-8 weeks) PBF1 hybrid males with cisPt and with 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU), a nucleoside analog of thymidine (Salic and Mitchison, 2008) to distinguish the spermatogenic cells replicating their DNA at the moment of cisPt injection.”</p><p>We also added an additional sentence of explanation to the first paragraph of the subsection “CisPt treatment enhances meiotic synapsis of homologous chromosomes in sterile hybrids”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) Why are DSB counts assayed at zygonema and pachynema but not leptonema? Isn't the latter stage the important one to focus on given the DSB hypothesis?</p></disp-quote><p>We had two reasons for assaying zygonemas. The spread preparations contain very few spermatocytes at the leptotene stage, and DMC1 and RAD51 foci are more numerous at zygotene than in leptotene (see e.g. Cole et al., Nat Cell Biol. 2012 or Kauppi et al., Gen Dev 2013). The most probable reason is that the foci accumulate gradually during the leptotene stage and survive for the major part of the zygotene stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Clarify the following: Why is there so much asynapsis in the early pachytenes (assuming correct staging), even with CP treatment? Is it possible that the timing was such that this cohort was derived from cells that weren't in S phase?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comment. The missing explanation was added on as follows: “We assume that the efficiency of repair of cisPt-induced DSBs by meiotic homologous recombination is low and/or that a significant fraction of spermatocytes carrying them do not survive until early pachytene stage. […] This multiple filtering effect thus enhances the apparent efficiency of cisPt monitored as a proportion of fully synapsed pachynemas at mid-late stage.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And so many asynapsed &quot;Mid-late&quot; pachytenes doesn't make sense in terms of checkpoint elimination…perhaps H1t staining was needed?</p></disp-quote><p>The question was answered above: The ratio of asynaptic cells in PBF1 hybrids is given in Bhattacharyya (Bhattacharyya et al., 2013 Figure 2C). It shows that only cells with four or less univalents can reach mid pachytene and a few of them late pachytene. Pachynemas with &gt; 4 univalents were detected only in the early pachytene stage. In this manuscript, we deliberately classified pachynemas as fully synapsed and pachynemas with asynapsis to verify the overall effect of cisPt on meiotic synapsis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These potential issues with stage-matching and the lack of an objective measure (beyond incidence of full synapsis) with which to ascertain that cisplatin rescues F1 hybrid cells are major concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope the concerns about the stage-matching were dispelled. We checked the effect of exogenous DSBs at the level of synapsis, which was verified. The ratio of the three pachytene substages was added to show the significant increase of late pachynemas after cisPt treatment. See also the answer to point 4.</p></body></sub-article></article>
