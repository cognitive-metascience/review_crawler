essential component of the gas exchange machinery of the lung alveolus. Despite this, the extent and function of lung EC heterogeneity remains incompletely understood. Using single-cell analytics, we identify multiple EC populations in the mouse lung, including macrovascular endothelium (maEC), microvascular endothelium (miECs), and a new population we have termed <italic>Car4</italic>-high ECs. <italic>Car4</italic>-high ECs express a unique gene signature, and ligand-receptor analysis indicates they are primed to receive reparative signals from alveolar type I cells. After acute lung injury, they are preferentially localized in regenerating regions of the alveolus. Influenza infection reveals the emergence of a population of highly proliferative ECs that likely arise from multiple miEC populations and contribute to alveolar revascularization after injury. These studies map EC heterogeneity in the adult lung and characterize the response of novel EC subpopulations required for tissue regeneration after acute lung injury.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animal lungs are filled with tiny air sacks called alveoli, where the gas exchanges that keep organisms alive can take place. Small blood vessels known as capillaries come in close contact with the alveoli, allowing oxygen to be extracted from the air into the blood, and carbon dioxide to be released from the blood into the air. The cells that line the inside of these capillaries (known as pulmonary endothelial cells) are important actors in these exchanges.</p><p>After having been damaged, for example by viruses like influenza, the lungs need to regenerate and create new capillaries. Yet, it was still unclear how pulmonary endothelial cells participate in the healing process, and if capillaries contain several populations of endothelial cells that play different roles.</p><p>To investigate this question, Niethamer et al. used an approach called single-cell analytics to examine individual endothelial cells in the alveoli of mice infected with influenza. This revealed that different subtypes of endothelial cells exist in capillaries, and that some may be able to perform slightly different jobs during lung recovery.</p><p>Niethamer et al. found that all subtypes could quickly multiply after injury to create more endothelial cells and re-establish gas exchanges. However, one newly identified group (called Car4-high ECs) was particularly primed to receive orders from damaged alveoli. These cells were also often found at the sites where the alveoli were most injured.</p><p>Lung injuries are a major cause of death worldwide.

The functional compartment or niche responsible for gas exchange in the lungs is called the alveolus and is comprised of multiple epithelial, endothelial, and mesenchymal cell lineages. The pulmonary vascular plexus interacts intimately with alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells to form a very thin, gas-diffusible interface. The lung alveolus and its gas-exchange function is seriously disrupted upon acute lung injury such as occurs during a viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gregory and Kobzik, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herold et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kash and Taubenberger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pociask et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zacharias et al., 2018</xref>). Despite the functional importance of the lung alveolus, only recently have studies begun to elucidate its overall cellular complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ding et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Montoro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Plasschaert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reyfman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sabbagh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Treutlein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zacharias et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zepp et al., 2017</xref>). An improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of alveolar regeneration is critical for the development of targeted therapies that induce or improve this process to restore functional gas exchange in pulmonary disease or following acute injury to the lung.</p><p>Previous work has demonstrated that acute or serious lung injury can lead to the generation of dense epithelial remodeling resulting in hypoxic vasoconstriction in regions of severe damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xi et al., 2017</xref>). Proper tissue regeneration in the lung requires neovascularization of the alveolar region, and previous work has suggested that certain EC populations may be primed for proliferation when cultured in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taha et al., 2017</xref>). Cell surface markers such as CD34 and CD309 are enriched on mouse ECs that proliferate in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asahara et al., 1997</xref>). Putative EC progenitors can be isolated from the peripheral blood or the liver and transplanted into injured regions to contribute to regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asahara et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wakabayashi et al., 2018</xref>). However, whether such EC subpopulations contribute to in vivo tissue homeostasis and response to injury in the adult lung remains unknown.</p><p>To address these questions and to define pulmonary EC heterogeneity at homeostasis and during regeneration, we utilized single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of the adult mouse lung, both uninjured and after acute influenza-induced viral injury. In addition to identifying microvascular (miEC) and both arterial and venous macrovascular (maEC) populations, we identified a new population we have termed <italic>Car4</italic>-high ECs that possess a unique transcriptome. <italic>Car4</italic>-high ECs express high levels of <italic>Car4</italic> and <italic>Cd34</italic>, are found throughout the lung periphery at homeostasis, and are primed to respond to Vegfa signaling based on their high expression of Vegf receptors, which corresponds to a receptor-ligand interaction analysis between <italic>Car4</italic>-high ECs and AT1 cells, their epithelial co-partners in gas exchange. <italic>Car4</italic>-high ECs are enriched in the regenerating zones surrounding the most damaged regions of the lung following influenza- or bleomycin-induced lung injury during the subsequent tissue regeneration process. Influenza injury revealed the emergence of a unique population of highly proliferative ECs, which are closely related to <italic>Car4</italic>-low miECs in gene expression but likely arise from multiple EC populations to contribute to regeneration of the pulmonary vasculature after injury by replacing lost endothelium. These data provide critical insight into lung EC heterogeneity and the key roles that differing subtypes of pulmonary ECs play in the response to acute lung injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pulmonary endothelial heterogeneity in the adult mouse lung</title><p>To define the heterogeneity of the adult pulmonary endothelium, we employed scRNA-seq analysis.

A comparison of the overlap in Gene Ontology (GO) between clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) reveals similarity in both gene expression and GO between clusters 1 and 3 as well as between 3 and 4. Cluster two has little similarity with most other clusters, suggesting that this is a distinct cell population rather than a subset of a larger population. We also examined the top twenty GO categories across clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Cluster one is uniquely enriched in genes involved in cellular response to interferon-beta, and cluster three is dominated by expression of genes that regulate translation, whereas cluster four exhibits high expression of genes involved in regulation of cell adhesion. Clusters 0 and 2 share enhanced expression of genes related to sprouting angiogenesis and blood vessel development. Cluster two is uniquely enriched in genes that are associated with vasculogenesis. Based on their gene expression signatures, we grouped the ECs into three main categories: 1) maECs (cluster 4), 2) miECs (clusters 0, 1 and 3), and <italic>Car4</italic>-high ECs (cluster 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2CâE</xref>).

We identified endothelial, epithelial, and mesenchymal cell clusters in the adult mouse lung at homeostasis and at 14 dpi, displayed using UMAP dimension reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Becht et al., 2018</xref>).

Of note, the whole-lung scRNA-seq analysis identified additional EC populations in comparison to the CD31<sup>+</sup> sorted cells, likely due to a less biased isolation procedure as well as including the presence of additional non-ECs, which provides greater differences in number and transcriptional variance of cell types analyzed. For instance, the whole-lung scRNA-seq analysis generated separate arterial and venous maEC clusters. Moreover, lymphatic ECs were identified in both control and H1N1 whole-lung datasets. scRNA-seq analysis at 14 dpi also revealed a newly emergent cluster not observed at homeostasis, a population of proliferative ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,F</xref>).

We investigated the extent of EC proliferation after influenza injury by EdU incorporation in ECs from both control and H1N1-injured mice. After intranasal administration of H1N1 or PBS (control), we gave mice EdU in their drinking water either from days 0â7 (H1N1 cohort 1), days 7â14 (H1N1 cohort two and control cohort), or days 14â21 (H1N1 cohort 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To ensure that there were no cytotoxic effects of EdU when administered over the 7 day time course, we compared proliferation by IHC for Ki67 or phospho-histone H3 in EdU-treated and -untreated animals at 14 dpi and observed no difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). At the endpoint of EdU administration for each cohort, we isolated single cells from the mouse lungs and quantified %CD45<sup>+</sup> immune cells, %CD45<sup>-</sup>/CD31<sup>+</sup> ECs, and %EdU<sup>+</sup> ECs using flow cytometry. As expected, H1N1 injury results in a dramatic increase in immune cells at all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,H</xref>). However, the total number of CD31<sup>+</sup> ECs did not significantly differ between control and flu cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,I</xref>), possibly because injury results in decreased ECs at a time point earlier than seven dpi. Between 7 and 14 dpi, a large proportion of ECs from H1N1-treated mice had incorporated EdU (CD45<sup>-</sup>/CD31<sup>+</sup>/EdU<sup>+</sup> cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5BâD</xref>) compared to PBS treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2AâC</xref>).

H1N1-injured mice demonstrated EdU incorporation in both EC subpopulations from 7 to 14 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>), whereas control animals showed very little EdU incorporation in either population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2DâF</xref>).

In combination with transcript and protein localization, our scRNA-seq analysis identified a unique population of microvascular endothelium, the <italic>Car4</italic>-high EC. Through further characterization of these cells, we have determined that they coalesce within sites of moderate-to-severe alveolar damage after influenza infection and possess a transcriptional signature suggesting they are primed to receive signals from other alveolar cell types. Gene ontology analysis also suggests a role for these cells in vasculogenesis and blood vessel development. We additionally demonstrate the emergence of a highly proliferative EC population in the lung following influenza injury. The existence of endothelial subtypes that preferentially contribute to regeneration has been investigated in many organs, but the identity and origin of putative endothelial âprogenitorâ cells remains a topic of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Basile and Yoder, 2014</xref>). In the aorta and the liver, endothelial regeneration has been attributed to small subsets of endogenous ECs with enhanced proliferative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McDonald et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wakabayashi et al., 2018</xref>). Others have suggested that circulating bone marrow-derived ECs can be delivered to regions of injury to regenerate the endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asahara et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asahara et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Asahara et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takahashi et al., 1999</xref>), but this hypothesis has also proven controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Purhonen et al., 2008</xref>). In the lung, it remained unclear whether all ECs, or only a unique subpopulation of progenitors, could contribute to endothelial injury repair. Our scRNA-seq analysis identifies a proliferating EC population that arises after acute lung injury and suggests that these cells are closely related to a subset of endogenous miECs. In addition, EdU incorporation analysis indicates that both <italic>Car4</italic>-high and other ECs proliferate across the 21 day period following injury, demonstrating that regenerative potential is not restricted to a particular subset of the endothelium.</p><p>An increasingly useful mouse model to study alveolar destruction and regeneration has been the administration of a sub-lethal dose of the animalized version of the H1N1 influenza virus (PR8). This injury model has been used recently to show the death and regeneration of the alveolar epithelium, primarily by the expansion of a squamous Krt5<sup>+</sup> epithelial cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vaughan et al., 2015</xref>) and an alveolar epithelial progenitor cell (AEP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zacharias et al., 2018</xref>). This observed epithelial regeneration is necessary to cover the exposed basement membrane and increase the surface area available for gas exchange. To fully understand the regeneration of the alveolar compartment with respect to the recovery of gas exchange, the behavior of the capillary endothelium must be studied in parallel. While the epithelial cells have been observed as the primary infection site of the influenza virus resulting in their death both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Short et al., 2014</xref>), there is evidence that the endothelium can also be infected and killed in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armstrong et al., 2012</xref>). However, the regeneration of the alveolar capillary plexus following influenza injury and the mechanisms by which gas exchange is re-established have remained incompletely understood. Our data sheds crucial light on the potential of the endothelium to proliferate after injury, a cellular behavior that likely serves to regenerate the pulmonary vasculature. High expression of Car4 in the EC population we have identified also suggests that these cells may play a specialized role in gas exchange in the mouse and that their proliferation after injury may contribute meaningfully to restoring the gas exchange interface in the lung: Car4 has been proposed to play a role in carbon dioxide exchange in the rat lung, where it is more broadly expressed in the microvasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fleming et al., 1993</xref>). A better understanding of the processes of endothelial proliferation and repair of the gas exchange interface will be a crucial step in developing therapies to alleviate patients of hypoxemia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that can be developed post-influenza infection.</p><p>An essential role of the endothelium in regeneration is to reestablish oxygenation of the tissue through restoration of blood circulation. The methods the endothelium uses to repopulate areas lacking in vascularity are classically defined as vasculogenesis, or formation of new vascular structures, and angiogenesis, or expansion of the vascular network through generation of new vessels from existing ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Potente and MÃ¤kinen, 2017</xref>). Of the cells that contribute to sprouting angiogenesis, there are two distinct EC phenotypes termed tip cells and stalk cells. Tip cells are leading cells that direct the new vessel growth through sprouting, invasion, and migration; stalk cells follow the tip cells and elongate, proliferate and establish the lumen of the new vessel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Betz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Potente et al., 2011</xref>). Tip cells are distinguished from stalk cells through increased expression of Vegfr2 and Nrp1, which suppresses stalk cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aspalter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simons et al., 2016</xref>), whereas stalk cells are characterized by expression of Notch1 and Vegfr1, a decoy receptor that can sequester Vegf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blanco and Gerhardt, 2013</xref>). However, tip cell and stalk cell fates are dynamic during sprouting angiogenesis, with ECs possessing the ability to respond to different environments by adjusting Vegfr levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jakobsson et al., 2010</xref>). During late lung development and maturation, the lung vasculature is also thought to develop <italic>via</italic> intussusceptive angiogenesis, a poorly understood process of vessel splitting that may also contribute to regeneration in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gianni-Barrera et al., 2011</xref>). Our transcriptomic analysis of the pulmonary endothelium through scRNA-seq shows that key tip cell genes such as <italic>Vegfr2</italic> and <italic>Nrp1</italic> are enriched in the <italic>Car4</italic>-high EC population at homeostasis and after injury; however, the <italic>Car4</italic>-high ECs also express high levels of stalk cell gene <italic>Vegfr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">4</xref>). The <italic>Gpihbp1</italic>-high miEC population shares several reported transcripts that define stalk cells such as <italic>Hes1</italic>, <italic>Hey1</italic> and <italic>Jagged1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moya et al., 2012</xref>). However, following influenza injury, the proliferating pulmonary EC population we have identified is closely transcriptionally associated with the miEC population, and endothelial proliferation is evident both in <italic>Car4</italic>-high and other ECs. This is in line with a recent report indicating that endothelial proliferation and regeneration in large vessels does not require the specification of tip or stalk cells, but is instead initially induced in all cells in close proximity to the site of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McDonald et al., 2018</xref>). However, McDonald and colleagues report a second phase of regeneration in which a smaller subset of proliferating ECs in the aorta continue to generate new cells as wound healing progresses. The gene expression profiles of the cells we have identified and their pseudotime trajectories suggest that a similar phenomenon may occur in the microvasculature of the alveoli during regeneration after influenza injury, with a mechanism that does not require tip or stalk cell specification.</p><p>Recently, the existence of ECs primed for proliferation in different vascular beds has gained appreciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taha et al., 2017</xref>). Evidence for such cells in the lung has been derived from cell cloning assays that isolate a subset of cells that are prone to proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Alvarez and colleagues showed that the clones derived from the microvascular endothelium that were prone to proliferate, termed resident microvascular endothelial progenitors, were enriched in expression of certain progenitor cell antigens (e.g., CD34, CD309) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez et al., 2008</xref>). Studies of these ECs in vitro have benefited from the ability to clonally assess the cellsâ proliferative capacity, but in vitro EC studies are problematic because of the propensity of ECs to de-differentiate once put into culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lacorre et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, studying such cell populations in vivo is essential to eliminate the confounding factors associated with cell culture studies. Evidence of proliferating ECs has been seen in models of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ebina et al., 2004</xref>), partial hepatectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ding et al., 2010</xref>), and left unilateral pneumonectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 2011</xref>). Our studies suggest the presence of a <italic>Car4</italic>-high/<italic>Cd34</italic>-high EC subpopulation in the lung alveolus and the induction of a highly proliferative EC population after injury, but in contrast to previous studies, our data indicate that these two populations are not identical. Future work will further elucidate the relative contributions of <italic>Car4</italic>-high/<italic>Cd34</italic>-high ECs and other ECs to endothelial proliferation, the contributions of the proliferating endothelium to generation of new vasculature in the alveolar space after injury, and the roles of each cell type in re-establishing gas exchange and in other aspects of lung regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All mice were C57BL/6J females age 6â8 weeks old (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine; strain #000664).

If variances were significantly different, a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallace test was used in place of ANOVA to determine if differences between groups were statistically significant, followed by Dunnâs multiple comparison tests. Graphs are displayed as box-and-whisker plots or as bar plots indicating mean and standard deviation. In all cases, each individual data point is displayed on the graph. Values for N as well as p values are indicated in figure legends.</p><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"><break/>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <break/>male, female)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock #000664</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-CD31(rat monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">HistoBioTec</td><td valign="top">DIA-310;

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Defining the role of pulmonary endothelial cell heterogeneity in the response to acute lung injury&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in its present state.</p><p>While the reviewers were enthusiastic about the novelty and importance of your study, they also raised substantial concerns that would require extensive additional experimentation for a responsive revision. We would therefore encourage resubmission of your manuscript following revisions, with a commitment to solicit opinions from the original reviewers in order to expedite the re-review process.</p><p>We see the strength of the paper in the new insights into the heterogeneity of endothelial cells before and after lung injury, obtained by analysis of single cell RNA sequencing data in the murine lung. Three classes of endothelial cells that were identified and termed &quot;macrovascular&quot;, &quot;microvascular&quot; and &quot;regulatory&quot; are of great interest. In particular, the &quot;regulatory&quot; endothelial cells are a novel cell type that is found in alveolar areas, characterized with high expression of CD34 and CAR4, and shown to expand following injury. The reviewers felt that these findings advance current understanding of endothelial cells in the lung, and the dynamic changes during lung injury and repair. The main weaknesses identified by the reviewers include the lack of functional data, and of statistical validation/ analysis (except for the single cell RNA-seq data). Please consult the individual reviews for more detail.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this study, the authors used single-cell RNA-seq and the latest bioinformatic algorithms to dissect the heterogeneity of endothelial cells in the adult lung, both during homeostasis, as well as during flu or bleomycin-induced injury. They identified three major populations, including REC, a subpopulation of the alveolar endothelium that expresses CD34. They found that CD34<sup>+</sup> REC cells expanded following injury. Furthermore, following injury, they identified a new population, PEC, which is highly proliferative. Through pseudo-time analysis, they linked PEC to the miEC population, which is distinct from REC. These findings greatly advance current understanding of endothelial cell composition in lung and offer the first glimpse of the dynamic changes contributing to repair. This study will be of great interest to the general readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. Addressing the following comments will enhance the rigor and impact of the study.</p><p>1) At the start of the paper and in Abstract, endothelial cells were dissected into three major groups, maEC, miEC and REC. In Figure 4, for uninjured, endothelial cells were separated into more clusters (two for maEC, two for miEC). These additional insights into heterogeneity should be highlighted and further explored by key marker identification and spatial localization (see below).</p><p>2) Additional spatial analysis of subpopulations will be very informative. For example, how are the miEC and REC spatially distinct from each other? Where do the <italic>Ifi47</italic>-high vs <italic>Gpihbp1</italic>-high subclusters of miEC localize to? Where are PECs?</p><p>3) Following injury, there is an increase of REC, and an appearance of PEC. Localization of PEC in relationship to REC will allow an estimation of the extent of contribution of each population to injury.</p><p>4) Aside from the focus on PEC and cell cycle markers after injury, how the transcriptome of the other populations change will be informative, especially in the aspect of signaling.</p><p>5) CD34 increase should be quantified by qRT.</p><p>6) Parallel to the expansion of REC, how maEC and miEC subclusters change spatially following injury will be informative.</p><p>7) Figure 6âfigure supplements 1 and 2, provide a better explanation how the different gene plots illustrate the curves.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors present a thorough analysis of scRNA-seq data generated from the endothelial compartment of the lung, before and after injury with influenza and bleomycin. They identify a novel endothelial cell type characterized by high expression of CD34 and of CAR4 that is present in alveolar areas and increases after injury. A role for these cells, called regulatory endothelial cells (RECs), in injury repair is inferred from these findings. The strength of this paper is the thorough mining of the scRNA-seq data. A serious weakness however is that mechanistic and functional conclusions are drawn based on mere inference from the scRNA-seq data, and therefore are speculation at best. Hence, this manuscript is merely descriptive and based on a very limited number of experiments that were maximally mined.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) The scRNA-seq studies used purified cells based on CD31 expression. Given the heterogeneity in endothelial phenotypes, does this strategy capture all endothelial cells? Following influenza infection, scRNA-seq was performed on whole lung. Were exactly the same EC populations identified in the control of that experiment, where CD31 purification was not used?</p><p>2) After injury, CD34-high ECs increase in the alveolar regions adjacent to regions of severe injury (Figure 3). It is inferred that this represents an accumulation REC, but this might as well simply represent upregulation of CD34 on other ECs. Using other markers for RECs, such as Car4, might be useful. Furthermore, increased CD34 expression is only evaluated by qualitative assessment of IF images. Could this be quantified by flow cytometry?

Three classes of EC's are defined under homeostatic conditions including macrovascular EC's, microvascular EC's and a third group that the authors refer to as &quot;regulatory&quot; EC's. Parenchymal injury resulted in the appearance of a fourth cluster referred to as proliferative EC's. These findings are important to the field of lung regeneration and endothelial cell biology, but there are a number of technical and conceptual concerns as outlined below.</p><p>Specific issues/concerns:</p><p>1) Since normal endothelial single cell RNA-Seq data represent aggregated data from multiple individual mice it would be important to show the distinct contributions of these individuals to the entire data set for assessment of batch variability between individuals.</p><p>2) Even though the appearance of proliferative EC's in response to acute lung injury is reasonable and well supported by gene expression data, the use of the term regulatory EC's is speculative and not well justified based upon the data. Additional concerns include: a) One of the top differentially expressed genes appearing in REC's, Car4 or carboxypeptidase 4, has been described as broadly expressed within rat microvasculature EC's (Fleming et al., 1993). As such, it is not clear whether REC's represent a novel endothelial cell type, whether they represent a subset of microvascular ECs and/or whether there are species differences that account for this observation; b) none of the marker genes evaluated (with the exception of CD31) are endothelial cell-specific, which makes interpretation of immunofluorescence data challenging.</p><p>3) It would be helpful if data generated from uninjured adult mice vs either bleo or influenza virus injured lungs could be combined to determine how EC subsets change with injury. EC clusters generated with the combined transcriptomes of all lung cell types are most likely quite different to those generated if only EC's are evaluated in isolation. Furthermore, it is not clear (without lineage tracing and/or data aggregation) that direct relationships exist between cell types observed in the uninjured vs injured lungs.

Candidate receptor-ligand interactions are identified between REC's and ATI cells.

What follows is the authorsâ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:1) At the start of the paper and in Abstract, endothelial cells were dissected into three major groups, maEC, miEC and REC. In Figure 4, for uninjured, endothelial cells were separated into more clusters (two for maEC, two for miEC). These additional insights into heterogeneity should be highlighted and further explored by key marker identification and spatial localization (see below).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to identify key markers and determine the spatial relationships of endothelial cell subsets in the distal lung. We have therefore performed RNAscope analysis using markers of each EC population in the adult lung, both at homeostasis and at 14 days post H1N1 injury. We found that miECs, marked by expression of <italic>Gpihbp1</italic>, <italic>Pecam1</italic>, and <italic>Plvap</italic>, localize to the alveolar capillary endothelium both at homeostasis and after influenza injury, while cells in large vessels do not express <italic>Gpihbp1</italic>. Arterial and venous maECs, marked by <italic>Cxcl12</italic> and <italic>Vegfc</italic>, respectively, localize to large vessels both before and after injury. We have quantified relative numbers of <italic>Car4-high</italic> ECs at homeostasis and after H1N1 injury and determined that while they are localized throughout the capillary space at homeostasis, <italic>Car4-high</italic> ECs are increased in zones of mild to moderate as well as severe injury in H1N1-infected animals. We have added additional supplemental figures containing this analysis (<italic>Figure 3âfigure supplements 2-3</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Additional spatial analysis of subpopulations will be very informative. For example, how are the miEC and REC spatially distinct from each other? Where do the Ifi47-high vs Gpihbp1-high subclusters of miEC localize to? Where are PECs?</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed the localization of miECs, proliferating ECs, and <italic>Car4-high</italic> ECs at homeostasis and after injury using RNAscope. We show that miECs and <italic>Car4-high</italic> ECs are transcriptionally rather than spatially distinct, as both are distributed throughout the alveolar space at homeostasis and during repair. Proliferating ECs are rare at homeostasis but localize both to zones of mild to moderate tissue damage and to zones of more severe tissue damage after injury (<italic>Figure 3âfigure supplements 2-3; Figure 5âfigure supplement 4</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Following injury, there is an increase of REC, and an appearance of PEC.

We discovered that <italic>Car4-high</italic> ECs do not change in expression of key genes that differentiate this population from other EC populations after injury, but we do see statistically significant differences in expression of several signaling genes, genes that regulate the cytoskeleton, and the transcription factor <italic>Hes1</italic>. We have added violin plots to show these gene expression differences in <italic>Car4-high</italic> ECs and gene ontology analysis to describe genes differentially expressed across EC populations from uninjured and injured lungs. We find that after H1N1 injury, ECs upregulate genes related to translation, cell proliferation and survival, as well as cell death. This analysis is shown in two additional supplemental figures (<italic>Figure 4âfigure supplements 5 and 6</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) CD34 increase should be quantified by qRT.</p></disp-quote><p>We have used FACS to isolate <italic>CD34-high</italic> and CD34-low EC populations and have shown that relative <italic>Cd34</italic>, <italic>Car4</italic>, <italic>Ednrb</italic>, and <italic>Kdr</italic> expression is increased in <italic>CD34-high</italic> ECs by qRT-PCR. However, relative expression of other miEC and pan-EC markers such as <italic>Gpihbp1</italic>, <italic>Plvap</italic>, and <italic>Pecam1</italic> is not significantly different between <italic>CD34-high</italic> and CD34-low ECs. We have added an additional supplemental figure containing this data (<italic>Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</italic>). We have also quantified changes in number of <italic>CD34-high</italic> cells between control and H1N1-infected mice using flow cytometry and showed that the proportion of <italic>CD34-high</italic> ECs increases after H1N1 injury.

Given the heterogeneity in endothelial phenotypes, does this strategy capture all endothelial cells? Following influenza infection, scRNA-seq was performed on whole lung. Were exactly the same EC populations identified in the control of that experiment, where CD31 purification was not used?</p></disp-quote><p>As expected, we identified additional endothelial cell populations in the whole lung scRNA-seq experiments. These include separation of venous and arterial macrovascular endothelium and lymphatic endothelium. The additional separation of endothelial cell populations is likely the result of differences in unbiased clustering due to an increased number of cell types and additional variation in gene expression between cell types analyzed in the whole-lung experiments as well as a less biased cell isolation procedure. We have added sentences to the main text to clarify these differences and have better justified our choice of CD31 expression to purify endothelial cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) After injury, CD34-high ECs increase in the alveolar regions adjacent to regions of severe injury (Figure 3). It is inferred that this represents an accumulation REC, but this might as well simply represent upregulation of CD34 on other ECs. Using other markers for RECs, such as Car4, might be useful. Furthermore, increased CD34 expression is only evaluated by qualitative assessment of IF images. Could this be quantified by flow cytometry? Similarly, the increased in the abundance of these cells is shown in one IF image but is never quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified the increase in <italic>CD34-high</italic> ECs after H1N1 infection by flow cytometry and have found that the proportion of <italic>CD34-high</italic> ECs does increase significantly with influenza injury.

In addition, we have quantified numbers of <italic>Car4</italic>-expressing cells in different zones of injury following H1N1 infection by RNAscope and have seen a corresponding increase in these cells in regenerating regions, indicating that our IHC data likely does not represent simply an upregulation of CD34 protein.

We have also added a control experiment to assess the reliability of the EdU water administration and fluorescent labeling strategy we employed. We found that there is a small amount of background fluorescence in single cells of H1N1-infected mice not given EdU water but subjected to the fluorescent labeling assay. This may result in a slightly larger percentage of S-phase ECs quantified at both homeostasis and after injury but is very minor in comparison to the difference we observed in EdU incorporation between control and flu-infected mice (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1). We have also analyzed proliferation in <italic>CD34-high</italic> and CD34-low ECs and found that both populations incorporate EdU over the course of injury repair.

The EC-specific dataset analyzed in Figure 1 is aggregated from three individual mice; in the new Figure 1âfigure supplement 2, we show that all seven clusters 0-6 are identified in the dataset for each individual mouse. The H1N1 whole-lung dataset analyzed in Figure 4 is aggregated from two individual mice; in the new Figure 4âfigure supplement 5, we find that integration of these two datasets with the control whole-lung dataset results in similar clustering and cell populations as does individual analysis.

We have also performed further analysis of gene expression in <italic>Car4-high</italic> ECs by qRT-PCR of FACS-isolated <italic>CD34-high</italic> and CD34-low ECs and have found that <italic>CD34-high</italic> (<italic>Car4-high</italic>) ECs express higher levels of <italic>Cd34</italic>, <italic>Car4</italic>, <italic>Ednrb</italic>, and <italic>Kdr</italic> than CD34-low ECs, but similar levels of <italic>Pecam1</italic>, <italic>Gpihbp1</italic>, <italic>Plvap</italic>, and <italic>Vwf</italic> (<italic>Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</italic>).

These data have led us to conclude that these cells represent a novel miEC population. We agree that high Car4 expression may not define a subpopulation of ECs in all species and have revised the Discussion to include reference to the above article. In our RNAscope analysis (please see response to reviewer 1, comment 1 above), we have used co-labeling with probes that detect pan-endothelial gene expression to provide more rigorous analysis of ECs from each subpopulation in control and H1N1-infected conditions (Figure 3âfigure supplements 2-3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would be helpful if data generated from uninjured adult mice vs either bleo or influenza virus injured lungs could be combined to determine how EC subsets change with injury.

We feel that this analysis addresses the issue of EdU toxicity directly, whereas redoing the entire experiment with a shorter EdU pulse would not completely address this (such studies would not have detected any possible toxicity) and would extend the revisions well past the 2-month time frame. Moreover, our choice of concentration (0.2 g/L) and timeline (7 days) forin vivoEdU administration in drinking water has plenty of precedent in the literature [1-2], and indeed, EdU administration in drinking water has been performed at up to fivefold higher concentration [3] as well as for longer periods up to 90 days with no reported toxicity [4]. Our new results indicate that 1) EdU treatment does not affect proliferation in the lung using the dose/timing in our experiments and 2) Total proliferation, EC proliferation, and proliferation in <italic>Car4-high</italic> ECs are all increased at 14 days post H1N1 infection as measured by IHC for pHH3 in control and injured animals, confirming our previous results. We have added a new figure (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1) and text to the manuscript describing this new data. Of note, to complete this analysis, we have implemented a cell counting pipeline that utilizes the ilastic [5] and CellProfiler [6] programs to accurately and rigorously segment nuclei and assess cell numbers expressing multiple marker genes. Please refer to the Materials and methods section for a more detailed description of this new tool.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please clarify why is such a high fraction of both ECs and epithelial cells cycling in steady-state according to this analysis in Figure 5âfigure supplement 5, and how these data relate to the other inferences from scRNAseq?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 5âfigure supplement 6 (with new numbering resulting from addition of the supplemental figure described in (3) above) contains an informatic derivation of cell cycle state based on expression of genes related to cell cycle progression. This is therefore a predictive analysis rather than a functional one and does not allow us to determine whether a cell is actively cycling. Our subsequent EdU incorporation, RNAscope, and IHC analysis all confirm that the distal lung is quiescent at steady-state, with very little proliferation in endothelial cells or elsewhere. Therefore, although informatic analysis indicates that cells express some genes associated with S and G2/M phases at homeostasis, functional data indicates that most of these cells are not actively cycling. The discrepancy may relate to differences between cells poised to re-enter the cell cycle versus cells actively cycling. We have added text to the manuscript to reflect this. However, if the editors and reviewers feel that these data are confusing, we would be happy to remove them from the manuscript. The data contained in Figure 5 and its other supplements all provide more convincing functional evidence.</p><p>References</p><p>1) Meln et al.,<italic>Molecular Metabolism</italic>(2019) PMC: 6531874</p><p>2) Kryvalap et al.<italic>JBC</italic>(2016) PMC: 4697161</p><p>3) Amano et al.,<italic>Cell Metabolism</italic>(2013) PMC: 3931314</p><p>4) Clarke LE et al.,<italic>J Neurosci</italic>(2012) PMC: 3378033</p><p>5) Berg et al., <italic>Nat Methods</italic> (2019) PMID: 31570887</p><p>6) McQuin et al., <italic>PLoS Biol</italic> (2018) PMC: 6029841</p></body></sub-article></article>
