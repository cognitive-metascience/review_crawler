functions and are known to involve both excitatory and inhibitory cells. However, if and how inhibition regulates these activity transitions is unclear. Using fluorescence-targeted electrophysiological recording and cell-specific optogenetic manipulation in both anesthetized and non-anesthetized mice, we found that two major classes of interneurons, the parvalbumin and the somatostatin positive cells, tightly control both up-to-down and down-to-up state transitions. Inhibitory regulation of state transition was observed under both natural and optogenetically-evoked conditions. Moreover, perturbative optogenetic experiments revealed that the inhibitory control of state transition was interneuron-type specific. Finally, local manipulation of small ensembles of interneurons affected cortical populations millimetres away from the modulated region. Together, these results demonstrate that inhibition potently gates transitions between cortical activity states, and reveal the cellular mechanisms by which local inhibitory microcircuits regulate state transitions at the mesoscale.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26177.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26177.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Neocortex</kwd><kwd>parvalbumin positive interneuron</kwd><kwd>somatostatin positive interneuron</kwd><kwd>up and down states</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NEURO-PATTERNS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fellin</surname><given-names>Tommaso</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1U01NS090576-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fellin</surname><given-names>Tommaso</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DESIRE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fellin</surname><given-names>Tommaso</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MIUR FIRB</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RBAP11X42L</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fellin</surname><given-names>Tommaso</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Flag-Era JTC Human Brain Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SLOW-DYN</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Panzeri</surname><given-names>Stefano</given-names></name><name><surname>Fellin</surname><given-names>Tommaso</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>H2020 MSCA IF 2015: Manuel Molano ETIC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>699829</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Molano-Mazón</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two major subtypes of cortical interneurons, the PV and the SST positive cells, causally contribute to the regulation of large-scale state transitions in the cortex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian brain generates internal activities independent of environmental stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Destexhe, 2011</xref>). For example, during quiet wakefulness or NREM sleep the cortex and other brain regions (e.g., the thalamus) display rhythmic electrical signals characterized by large-amplitude and low frequency (&lt;1 Hz) oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Metherate et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Steriade et al., 1993a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crunelli and Hughes, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Halassa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Slézia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fogerson and Huguenard, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herrera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sellers et al., 2015</xref>). These peculiar activities, named slow oscillations, are dominated by recurring transitions between active (up) and silent (down) periods. In the cortex, up states are associated with sustained membrane potential depolarization in single pyramidal neurons and enhanced firing at the network level, while down states are characterized by membrane hyperpolarization and reduced circuit firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Steriade et al., 1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Contreras and Steriade, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vyazovskiy et al., 2009</xref>). The alternation between these two activity states plays fundamental roles in regulating crucial cortical processes, such as the modulation of sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Petersen et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crochet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haider et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reig and Sanchez-Vives, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reig et al., 2015</xref>), the consolidation and potentiation of memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marshall et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rasch et al., 2007</xref>), the improvement of task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huber et al., 2004</xref>) and the control of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vyazovskiy et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">2008</xref>). Although the cellular mechanisms regulating up and down state transitions have been the focus of intense research, the role of many prominent cortical circuits in these phenomena still remains elusive. One such example is cortical inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crunelli et al., 2015</xref>). Previous studies found that inhibitory cells are active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Steriade et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gentet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tahvildari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neske et al., 2015</xref>) and that there is a tight interplay of excitatory and inhibitory conductances during the up state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haider et al., 2006</xref>). Since neither a gradual buildup nor a sudden increase in inhibition near the termination of the up state was observed, these seminal data were interpreted against an active role of inhibition in the transition from an up to a down state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haider et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Neske, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sanchez-Vives et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, in silico model of cortical dynamics showed that up-to-down transitions can occur in the presence of an activity-dependent K<sup>+</sup> conductance with minor contribution of synaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Compte et al., 2003</xref>), further arguing against a major role of inhibition in shaping network shifts from the up to the down state. However, pharmacological blockade of GABA<sub>A</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sanchez-Vives et al., 2010</xref>) and GABA<sub>B</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mann et al., 2009</xref>) receptors significantly modifies the duration and the frequency of up and down states and other modelling work showed that inhibition may actually contribute to facilitate the up-to-down transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bazhenov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, paired recordings in anesthetized and naturally sleeping cats demonstrated that bursts of inhibitory activity do precede the onset of the down state, suggesting a potential role of inhibition in the control of up-to-down transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lemieux et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we combined two-photon targeted single neuron electrophysiological recordings, phase-locking analysis, and cell-specific optogenetic perturbations in anesthetized and non-anesthetized awake mice to investigate the <italic>causal</italic> contribution of specific inhibitory circuits, including parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) interneurons, in the regulation of cortical state transitions. Our data demonstrate that optogenetic modulation of interneurons precisely regulates network up-to-down state shifts and reveals a previously unacknowledged role of the inhibitory network in the control of down-to-up state transitions. This bidirectional (<italic>up-to-down</italic> and <italic>down-to-up</italic>) inhibitory control of state transition is interneuron-type specific and finely controlled at the microcircuit level, with local ensemble of active interneurons gating state transitions over millimetres of cortical territories.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To determine if and how PV and SST interneurons control state transitions, we first characterized the spiking activities of these two cellular subpopulations during spontaneous up and down states in anesthetized mice.

Importantly, this method optimally combined several variables extracted from the LFP to best estimate the network state (up or down, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A crucial variable in this detection algorithm was the LFP phase in the low frequency band, which could thus be considered a good indicator of network state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saleem et al., 2010</xref>) (see also Materials and methods). Phases between 112 and 264 degrees (the ‘trough’ regions of the LFP slow oscillatory component) mainly corresponded to up states and phases between 322 and 45 degrees (the ‘peak’ LFP regions) mainly corresponded to down states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1h,i</xref>). The LFP-based identification of states performed well on ground truth data, minimizing the percentage of misclassified periods (i.e., false positives) at 6.0 ± 0.2% and 4.0 ± 0.1% for up and down states, respectively (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1j</xref>).</p><p>Both interneuron types preferentially discharged action potentials (APs) during up states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,h</xref>) in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Puig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tahvildari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neske et al., 2015</xref>).

To disambiguate between these two scenarios, we followed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Siapas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eschenko et al., 2012</xref>) to take advantage of the fact that the slow oscillation is not constant in frequency but shows small frequency fluctuations over time. We shifted the LFP backward or forward by an amount τ, and we computed the strength of phase locking of spikes (quantified as one minus the circular variance of the phase of firing distribution) as a function of the time shift τ for each recorded interneuron. We reasoned that if spike times have a causal effect on slow wave dynamics, then the LFP phase dynamics will be better predicted by the structure of past spike times, thereby leading to higher phase locking values for <italic>negative</italic> shifts of the LFP with respect to the firing activity of interneurons. In the absence of such causal effect, that is, slow network oscillations determining when interneurons fire, we expect that LFP phase dynamics better relate to the structure of spike times in the future, thereby leading to higher phase locking values for <italic>positive</italic> shifts of the LFP.</p><p>The dependence of the locking strength on τ is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,j</xref> for one representative PV cell and one SST neuron, respectively. Typically, the locking strength was larger for negative time shifts and it was maximal for negative time shifts τ in 15/16 PV and 13/15 SST neurons. This suggests that the spike-phase relationships reflect that firing of interneurons causes changes in phase dynamics more than they reflect interneuron’s firing being enslaved by the slow oscillatory component of the LFP. We estimated the temporal extent of the putative causation of interneurons on the slow LFP oscillation as the range of negative time shifts for which the time-shifted phase locking was significant (p&lt;0.01, Rayleigh test, Bonferroni corrected) and higher than the maximal value of time shifted locking for τ ≥ 0 (i.e., higher than the maximal value that could be explained by non-causal effects only). The average value of the maximal temporal extent of causation, τ<sub>end</sub> (red asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,j</xref>), was −221 ± 41 ms for PV interneurons and −189 ± 30 ms for SST interneurons. The value of the maximal causation, τ<sub>max</sub> (green asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,j</xref>), was −93 ± 19 ms, significantly lower than zero (p = 1E-4, one-tailed one-sample Student’s t-test, N = 16 from five animals) for PV cells and −81 ± 13 ms (p = 1E-5, one-tailed one-sample Student’s t-test, N = 15 cells from seven animals) for SST neurons.</p><p>To better visualize what these causation time ranges may imply, we computed the preferred phase of firing as the median of the corresponding phase of firing distribution in both PV and SST interneurons for τ = 0, τ = τ<sub>max</sub> and τ = τ<sub>end</sub>. As displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,i</xref>, when τ = 0 both PV and SST interneurons preferentially fire during the first part of the up state. For τ = τ<sub>max</sub> and τ = τ<sub>end</sub>, the preferred phase of firing was shifted for both classes of interneurons towards the second half and the end of the up state (for τ = τ<sub>max</sub>, 192 ± 6 degrees and 190 ± 4 degrees for PV and SST, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e,k</xref>, left panels; for τ = τ<sub>end</sub>, 215 ± 7 degrees and 213 ± 9 degrees for PV and SST respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e,k</xref>, right panels). This analysis suggests that the firing activity of interneurons, which primarily occurred in the first part of the up state, exerts maximal causation in the latter part of the up state, including its end.</p><p>To investigate the nature of such statistical influences of spikes on future changes in slow LFP dynamics and state ends, we further analyzed the changes in LFP phase speed in proximity to the state ends, over the putative causal time range determined above. Given that phase is a good proxy of state dynamics, decreases and increases in phase speed following a spike near the end of a state may be interpreted as the spike delaying or anticipating the state end, respectively. We quantified the mean changes in phase speed triggered to a spike time prior to the end of an up and down state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f,l</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We found that, on average, phase speed significantly increased after a PV spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, top panel) and a SST spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2l</xref>, top panel) near the end of an up state. In contrast, phase speed significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, bottom panel) after a PV spike near the end of a down state, while no significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2l</xref>, bottom panel) was found for SST neurons. This latter result is probably influenced by the paucity of recorded spikes in the considered time range (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> legend). To rule out the possibility that these changes in phase speed are related to stereotyped asymmetries in LFP shapes near the end of a state that have nothing to do with the spiking activity of interneurons, we compared these spike-triggered phase speed results with ‘control’ samples of LFP phase speed near state ends observed in the absence of interneuron spikes (see Materials and methods for details). Importantly, we found that the decreases in speed in down states for PV cells and the increases in speed in up states for PV and SST neurons around the center of the control stretches, computed exactly as with the real data triggered to a spike time, were not significant (for up state stretches, p = 8E-1, one-tailed paired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, N = 8911 stretches from 16 PV cells and p = 9E-1, N = 1346 stretches from 15 SST cells; for down state stretches, p = 1E-1, one-tailed paired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, N = 199 stretches from 11 PV cells and p = 2E-1, N = 12 stretches from 7 SST cells). Thus, we conclude that our results could not be explained purely by stereotyped asymmetries in the LFP wave near state ends that are observed also in the absence of interneuron spikes.</p><p>To investigate whether any of the phase of firing distribution features displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,h</xref> correlated at the single cell level with the phase speed changes observed around interneuronal firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f,l</xref>), we first computed the spike-triggered phase speed change for each individual neuron. In doing so, we focused only on phase speed changes triggered by spikes in the up state, because only in this case enough spikes per neuron for a robust single-cell phase-speed-change analysis were observed. We then analyzed the correlation of the phase speed change of each cell with various different features of the phase of firing distribution in the up state. We found correlation between the single-cell phase speed change and the circular variance of the phase of firing distribution, which quantifies the width of the distribution, for both PV (correlation 0.67, p = 5E-3, N = 16) and SST interneurons (correlation 0.59, p = 3E-2, N = 14). Cells with particularly large distributions (circular variance ≥0.35) tended to show large speed change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4a</xref>). We also found correlation between single-cell phase speed changes and the preferred phase of firing for both PV (circular-linear correlation 0.62, p = 5E-2, N = 16) and SST cells (circular-linear correlation 0.74, p = 2E-2, N = 14). Cells with earlier preferred phase of firing tended to show larger speed change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4b</xref>). Preferred phase of firing and circular variance, however, tended to be correlated across cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4c</xref>), making it difficult to dissociate the independent effect of each of these two variables on phase speed changes.</p><p>Altogether, these findings led us to hypothesize that the firing of both SST and PV interneurons during up states may causally contribute to their ending, whereas the firing of interneurons during down state, at least for PV cells, may delay the transition from the down state to the up state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Optogenetic activation of interneurons triggers up-to-down transitions</title><p>To directly test whether interneurons causally contribute to up-to-down state transitions, we optogenetically activated PV and SST interneurons during spontaneous slow oscillations. Selective expression of ChR2 in PV and SST interneurons was achieved using AAV injections in PV-Cre and SST-Cre mice, respectively. Immunohistochemical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and electrophysiological (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) characterization confirmed the specificity of expression and functionality of the opsin. Using patch-clamp recording from layer II/III principal neurons in injected PV-Cre and SST-Cre mice under anaesthesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we found that a brief (duration: 10 ms) light stimulus applied during an ongoing up state generated a pronounced and long-lasting hyperpolarization which outlasted the light stimulus and resembled a transition to a down state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–c</xref>, left panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f–h</xref>, left panel) but with larger slope compared to spontaneous events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). All recordings were performed in the proximity of the illuminated area (see Materials and methods). When we observed the effect of the optogenetic manipulation at the network level using extracellular LFP and MUA recordings, we found similar results. Photoactivation of PV and SST cells during an ongoing up state resulted in a sudden decrease in the power of high-frequency oscillations in the LFP and in the reduction of the spike frequency in the MUA signal. Both effects outlasted the light stimulus and were compatible with a full transition to a down state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4a–e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5a–e</xref>).

We first controlled that Arch efficiently suppressed APs in PV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a–e</xref>) and SST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1f–j</xref>) interneurons.

Optogenetic inhibition of PV and SST interneurons prolonged the up state for the whole duration of the light stimulation, resulting in membrane potential depolarization in single pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–c</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f–h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b,e</xref>).

However, our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,h</xref>) showed that PV and SST interneurons fire also during down states and the bottom panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref> suggests that the low firing activity of PV cells during the down state may influence down-to-up transition probability. To test this hypothesis we inhibited PV and SST cells during ongoing down states. We found that individual principal cells and the cortical network reliably transitioned to an active state, which resembled an up state, upon photoinhibition of interneurons. Optogenetic inhibition of PV and SST cells during an ongoing down state triggered a membrane depolarization in pyramidal cells in anesthetized and non-anesthetized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d,e,i,j</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2c,f</xref>) which could overlast the light stimulus. When looking at the cortical network activity with extracellular recordings, optogenetic inhibition of interneurons during an ongoing down state increased the power of high frequency oscillations in the LFP (PV inhibition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3f–h</xref>; SST inhibition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4f–h</xref>) and the MUA signal (PV inhibition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3i,j</xref>; SST inhibition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4i,j</xref>), effects which were compatible with a full network transition to an up state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Inhibitory control of state transition is interneuron subtype-specific</title><p>The previous experiments show that optogenetic inhibition of both PV and SST interneurons prolonged the up state and favoured down-to-up transitions. However, important differences between the effects of the manipulations of the two interneuron types were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). First, suppression of PV, but not SST cells, during both up and down states significantly enhanced spiking activity of principal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b,d</xref>). In both anesthetized and non-anesthetized animals, photoinhibition of SST interneurons during up states tended to increase the firing frequency of principal neurons, but the effect did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f,g,i</xref>). Second, photoinhibition of PV cells during spontaneous down states generated up state transitions with shorter latency from the onset of the light stimulus compared to the photoinhibition of SST cells in both anesthetized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c,h</xref>: average latency values: 69 ± 4 ms <italic>vs</italic> 181 ± 15 ms for PV and SST, respectively; p = 6E-5, unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, PV N = 11 cells from four animals and SST N = 9 cells from five animals) and non-anesthetized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e,j</xref>: average latency values: 30 ± 5 ms <italic>vs</italic> 67 ± 11 ms for PV and SST, respectively p = 9E-3 unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic> -test, N = 8 cells from five animals for PV and 8 cells from five animals for SST). Third, inhibiting PV interneurons facilitated down-to-up transitions with less jitter compared to the inhibition of SST cells (in anesthetized mice, 20 ± 3 ms for PV inhibition <italic>vs</italic> 109 ± 17 ms for SST inhibition, p = 6E-4, unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, N = 11 PV cells from four animals and N = 9 SST cells from five animals; in non-anesthetized mice, 16.8 ± 2.9 ms for PV inhibition <italic>vs</italic> 32.7 ± 6.1 ms for SST inhibition, p = 3E-2, unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, N = 8 cells from five animals for PV and SST interneurons). Fourth, photoinhibition of PV cells triggered down-to-up transitions with larger slope compared to spontaneous transitions observed in the same recorded cell. In contrast, photosuppression of SST cells triggered down-to-up transitions with slopes that were indistinguishable from those of spontaneous down-to-up transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26177.039</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Interneuron type-specific effect of optogenetic inhibitory manipulations.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of the experimental configuration where PV cells were photoinhibited.

Given that up and down state transitions are known to occur over large cortical areas, we asked whether local optogenetic perturbation of interneurons could also affect cortical regions far from the illuminated site. To address this question, we first simultaneously recorded the MUA in two cortical regions that were approximately 2 mm apart in anesthetized mice. The two electrodes (Ch1 and Ch2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) were lowered to the same cortical depth (~350 µm from the pial surface), and light was delivered to the more rostral recording site (Ch1) using a fiber optic positioned normal to the brain surface. In mice expressing ChR2 in PV cells, a short (duration: 10 ms) light stimulus significantly reduced the MUA signal at both channels (Ch1 and Ch2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a–e</xref>). Similar results were observed in mice expressing ChR2 in SST interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1f–j</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the effect on the MUA signal recorded in Ch2 (i.e., the electrode placed in the most caudal area) was due to direct illumination from the optical fiber placed near the rostral electrode (Ch1), we repeated these experiments using a patterned illumination system using a digital micromirror device (DMD) to precisely control the size of the illumination area. Consistent to what was previously observed, we found that the activation of PV or SST in a confined area (area diameter, 200 µm) projected close to Ch1 similarly affected network activities in both recording sites, resulting in a significant reduction of spike frequency in the MUA signal recorded at Ch1 and Ch2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We then tested the effect of local interneurons modulation on the membrane potential of cortical neurons located far from the modulated region. To this aim, we performed dual patch-clamp recordings from superficial pyramidal neurons in anesthetized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) mice. We found that light stimulation induced significant membrane potential hyperpolarization in both recorded neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–c,g–i</xref>), efficiently driving cells from the up to the down state in both PV and SST mice expressing ChR2 (PV: response delay between Ch2 and Ch1, 3.2 ± 0.6 ms; SST: response delay between Ch2 and Ch1, 3.5 ± 1.1 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3a–b</xref>). Similar results were obtained in awake animals when recording from single pyramidal neurons located ~2 mm apart from the stimulated area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4a–c,g–i</xref>). Finally, we extended this experimental design to mice expressing Arch in PV or SST interneurons. Photoinhibition of PV or SST interneurons in anesthetized animals enhanced network activity and significantly increased the MUA signal during light stimulation at both recording sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). Moreover, in paired recording experiments in anesthetized mice we found that photoinhibition of PV or SST significantly facilitated down-to-up transitions in both recorded neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d–f,j–l</xref>) with variable response delays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3c–d</xref>). This was confirmed in awake non-anesthetized animals, where we observed a significant membrane potential depolarization during light stimulation in single recorded neurons located far (~2 mm) from the illuminated area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4d–f,j–l</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26177.043</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Local modulation of cortical interneurons causes large-scale state transitions.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of the experimental configuration.

Given the relevance of up and down states in the control of cortical function, understanding the cellular mechanisms underlying the generation and modulation of these fundamental network dynamics is of crucial importance. Since the initial characterization of the up and down states of the slow oscillation using intracellular recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Steriade et al., 1993b</xref>), a role of interneurons in mediating the hyperpolarizing component of the up-to-down transitions was proposed. However, subsequent work has provided contradictory evidence. Electrophysiological recordings from individual interneurons showed that these cells fire during cortical up states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Steriade et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Puig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fanselow and Connors, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tahvildari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neske et al., 2015</xref>) and perturbation of their activity during the up state modifies cellular dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Neske and Connors, 2016</xref>), showing that interneurons are actively engaged during the up state. The timing of interneuronal spikes during the up state was shown to be variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Puig et al., 2008</xref>) and dependent on the specific subtype of interneuron that was considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neske et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, intracellular recordings in vitro and in vivo from principal cortical neurons showed paralleled changes in excitatory and inhibitory conductance during up state progression. Since no net increase nor gradual build-up of inhibitory conductance with respect to excitatory ones at the end of the up state was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tahvildari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neske et al., 2015</xref>), these data were taken against a role of interneurons in up state termination. Computational work also suggested that slow oscillatory activity and up state termination can occur in neural networks relying largely on adaptation currents in principal cells with a minor role of inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Compte et al., 2003</xref>). However, pharmacological blockade of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors decreases the up state duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sanchez-Vives et al., 2010</xref>) and selectively antagonism of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors increases up state duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mann et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, recent results pointed to a role of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor in the synchronous termination of the up state across different cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lemieux et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that interneurons may contribute to terminate up states as also supported by other in silico work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bazhenov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Interneurons control the up-to-down transition</title><p>In the present study we demonstrate that activity of the two major subtypes of cortical interneurons, the PV and the SST positive cells, causally contribute to terminate cortical up states. Their causal involvement was supported by two independent experimental approaches: (i) in non-perturbative experiments in which we measured the spike activity of identified interneuronal subtypes using two-photon guided juxtasomal electrophysiological recordings while measuring network dynamics with the LFP; (ii) using bidirectional optogenetic perturbations of GABAergic cells to modulate their firing activity while recording network and single cell activity with electrophysiology. In the first approach, we found that interneuronal spikes are more strongly locked to future than to past variations in the LFP phase, and that interneuronal spiking during up states was associated with subsequent acceleration of the LFP phase speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In the second approach, we found that brief optogenetic activation of either PV or SST interneurons resulted in the reduction of network activities in extracellular LFP and MUA recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplements 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). Moreover, in intracellular patch-clamp experiments from principal neurons we observed membrane hyperpolarization resembling a full transition to the down state following PV or SST optogenetic activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Optogenetic inhibition of PV and SST interneurons during an ongoing up state prolonged the up state for the entire duration of the light stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), further supporting that interneuronal firing contributes to up state termination. Our conclusions were strengthened by finding compatible results for the causal role of these interneurons in slow oscillation dynamics both with statistical analysis of fully unperturbed endogenous neural activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and with optogenetic manipulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). These results demonstrate the value of optimally combining optogenetics with statistical analysis of neural activity recorded under unperturbed natural conditions to dissect the causal role of specific circuit elements in network dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Panzeri et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>These results do not contrast with previous studies reporting similar dynamics of inhibitory conductances with respect to excitatory ones at the end of the up state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haider et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neske et al., 2015</xref>). First, the lack of a net increase of inhibition with respect to excitation at the end of the up state does not necessarily exclude a causal role of interneurons in promoting up-to-down transition. Second, conductance measurements that are typically averaged across oscillation cycles may have hindered variable features of inhibitory networks associated to the stochastic nature of cortical dynamics, as for example transient changes in interneuronal synchrony. It may end up that up-to-down state transitions are associated with lower but more synchronous firing activity in subsets of interneurons innervating specific compartments of principal neurons. To test this hypothesis further experiments encompassing simultaneous LFP recordings and two-photon calcium imaging from different subtypes of interneurons or multiple juxtasomal recordings from identified GABAergic cells will be needed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Interneurons control the down-to-up transition</title><p>Remarkably, our data also demonstrate a previously unrecognized role of interneurons in the control of down state duration. Photo-inhibition of PV or SST interneurons during ongoing down states triggered reliable transitions to active cortical states. These transitions resembled spontaneous up states as they were characterized by membrane depolarization in intracellular recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), an increase in gamma frequencies in the LFP and an augmentation of MUA signals at the network level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">4</xref>). These results were surprising given that interneurons were commonly believed to be largely inactive during cortical down states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Timofeev et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tahvildari et al., 2012</xref>) (but see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fanselow and Connors, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neske et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ushimaru and Kawaguchi, 2015</xref>]). However, our juxtasomal electrophysiological recordings in vivo showed that a small but significant fraction of interneuronal spikes also occurs in down states. Based on these results, we propose that the weak firing activity of interneurons during cortical down state is fundamental to maintain the cortical circuitry in the silent state, preventing it from escaping into the up state. Chloride imaging across different compartments of pyramidal neurons during up and down state transitions might be used as an alternative experimental approach to further investigate this issue.</p><p>In this context it is interesting to evaluate how many spikes interneurons need to discharge to maintain a cortical down state and how many spikes the optogenetic manipulations used in this study are interfering with. To address these questions, we first estimated the number of illuminated cells that we efficiently silenced during optogenetic inhibitory experiments by calculating the volume of the illuminated brain region in which interneurons were reliably modulated by light and the density of opsin positive cells under our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6d–m</xref>, see Materials and methods for details). Based on our calculations, we estimated that ~100 PV cells and ~650 SST neurons were efficiently modulated during our optogenetic manipulations. From the data about spike activity of interneurons during down states reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we then calculated that the optogenetic inhibitory manipulations displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> interfered with ~40 APs in PV cells and about ~20 APs in SST interneurons during down states. These results suggest that the GABAergic control of cortical state transition is surprisingly sensitive, with only a few tens of APs fired by interneurons efficiently controlling down-to-up state transition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Inhibitory modulation of cortical state transition is interneuron-subtype specific</title><p>The network effects of optogenetic manipulation of PV and SST interneurons were interneuronal type specific. PV cells exerted a stronger effect on state transitions compared with SST interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), but manipulation of SST cells triggered state transitions that more closely resembled spontaneous transitions compared to manipulation of PV interneurons. During both up and down states, photo-inhibition of PV, but not SST interneurons, significantly increased the spiking activity of pyramidal neurons. Moreover, PV photo-inhibition during down states increased the probability of generating down-to-up transitions with shorter latencies and smaller temporal variance compared to photo-inhibition of SST cells. Finally, optogenetic inhibition of SST, but not PV interneurons, triggered down-to-up state transitions with slope similar to spontaneous transitions. These differences in modulating the activity of pyramidal neurons can be explained based on at least three different properties of PV and SST cells: (i) the average firing rate; (ii) the location of synaptic contacts onto principal cells; (iii) the strength of the synaptic connections. For example, the stronger effect of PV photo-inhibition on network activities might be related to the higher firing activity of PV cells compared to SST interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gentet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gentet, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Stasi et al., 2016</xref>). In line with this interpretation, the higher firing rate of SST cells in awake compared to anesthetized animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vyazovskiy et al., 2008</xref>) may also explain the stronger effect of SST inhibition observed in awake compared to the anesthetized condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Although the phase locking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,h</xref>) and phase speed analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f,l</xref>) on simultaneous LFP and juxtasomal recordings do not show major differences between PV and SST cells, optogenetic inhibitory manipulation of SST interneurons triggered cortical state transitions that better resembled spontaneous transition compared to the same manipulation performed on PV cells. These latter results could point to a more prominent role of SST cells in regulating cortical state dynamics under physiological conditions. This would be in line with recent findings demonstrating that SST firing activity is extremely sensitive to cortical states and strongly affected by cholinergic inputs from subcortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gentet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Muñoz et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>It is worth noting that the lack of significant difference between the effect on up-to-down state transition of optogenetic activation of PV and SST interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) might be due to the oversynchronous activity induced in interneurons by the brief light pulse that we used in the current study. A ramp-like light stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adesnik and Scanziani, 2010</xref>) or stabilized step function opsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berndt et al., 2009</xref>) coupled with minimal light intensity stimulation could be used to elevate interneuronal excitability without explicitly controlling spike timing across the population. With this approach, it might be easier to unmask differences between the various interneuron subtypes because any sort of synchronous spiking would emerge from the natural statistics of the spike trains of the population under study rather than be imposed by the optogenetic manipulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Potential mechanisms driving interneuronal firing during down states</title><p>Local excitatory connectivity between principal cells and interneurons contribute to drive the activity of cortical inhibitory cells during the ongoing network dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dantzker and Callaway, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Staiger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apicella et al., 2012</xref>). An unanswered question is then what drives interneurons to fire during cortical down states, when excitatory cells have been reported to be largely silent. One possibility is that GABAergic cells undergo intrinsic oscillatory activity as for example reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Le Bon-Jego and Yuste, 2007</xref>) or that neuromodulators may regulate the excitability of interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Alternatively, small subpopulations of excitatory neurons were reported to fire during cortical down states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neske et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ushimaru and Kawaguchi, 2015</xref>) and this mechanism may drive certain interneurons to fire. A third possibility is that long-range excitatory fibers from other brain regions may input onto local cortical interneurons. In this regard, it is interesting to note that spiking activity of thalamic nuclei have been reported to occur during cortical down states ahead of up state initiation and it has been proposed that the early activation of thalamic nuclei contributes to the generation of up states by early activation of fast spiking (FS) cells followed stimulation of pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ushimaru and Kawaguchi, 2015</xref>). Our data are compatible with these experimental findings, but suggest that early activation of FS interneurons may actually prevent, rather than favour, the up state initiation. While it is clear that <italic>strong</italic> thalamic activation by means of electrical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">MacLean et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reig and Sanchez-Vives, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reig et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Watson et al., 2008</xref>) or sensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Petersen et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hasenstaub et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Civillico and Contreras, 2012</xref>) stimulation is a trigger for down-to-up state transitions in cortex, our data are compatible with the scenario in which <italic>weak</italic> thalamic activation during cortical down states preferentially induces suprathreshold activity in cortical FS interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu and Agmon, 2016</xref>) leading to a prolongation of the silent cortical state. In this framework, the observation that SST interneurons are also active during cortical down states suggests that these interneuronal cells may be similarly controlled by thalamic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tan et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Local modulation of inhibition controls network states over large cortical territories</title><p>Using simultaneous recordings of network and single cell activity in two brain regions located ~2 mm apart, we demonstrated that local activation of interneurons in one of the two regions during an up state causes a transition to the down state that occurs near synchronously in both recorded areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results were not due to unwanted direct illumination of both recorded cortical areas because we replicated these findings both with local illumination through a fiber optic and with patterned illumination that precisely delivered light to one restricted region of interest in the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Previous reports showed that up-to-down transitions occur with short (i.e. few milliseconds) delay among cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Volgushev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2012</xref>), but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not understood. Our data show that photoactivation of interneurons in one cortical region promoted up-to-down transitions over large territories (up to 2 mm apart from the illuminated site) with latencies as short (~3 ms) as the ones characterizing spontaneous up-to-down transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Volgushev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests that a sudden withdrawal of activity in a confined cortical area can trigger synchronous mesoscale network transitions towards silent states. Moreover, our data also show that photo-inhibition of interneurons during an ongoing up state significantly affects network activity at distal cortical locations. When interneurons were locally inhibited in one region during a down state a transition to the up state was reliably observed in two recorded areas located &gt;2 mm apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e,f,k,l</xref>), directly demonstrating a role of local inhibition in the control of down state synchrony across cortical areas. This observation is also of crucial importance for the correct interpretation of past works, where local optogenetic perturbation of interneurons was used to silence activity and this manipulation was assumed to have an effect mostly in the proximity of the illuminated area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adesnik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gentet, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sachidhanandam et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our data provide important, new and quantitative insights in the role of distinct inhibitory sub-networks in the control of cortical spontaneous dynamics. We show that the discharge of a small number (few tens) of APs in specific classes of local interneurons controls mesoscale state transitions in cortex. Because network state is known to powerfully and dynamically modulate several cortical functions, including sensory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Petersen et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haider et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reig and Sanchez-Vives, 2007</xref>), our findings might have important implications for the understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying the dynamics of flexible computational processes in the cortex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Experimental procedures involving animals have been approved by the IIT Animal Welfare Body and by the Italian Ministry of Health (authorization # 34/2015-PR and 125/2012-B), in accordance with the National legislation (D.Lgs. 26/2014) and the European legislation (European Directive 2010/63/EU).

Moreover, to assess the possible effect of the method used to extract the instantaneous LFP phase, we computed the phase either as the angle of the Hilbert transform or by using linear interpolation between peaks/troughs and zero-crossing points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eschenko et al., 2012</xref>). We found that the phase computed by Hilbert transform gave better state detection performance, thus we reported only results referring to states detected using Hilbert phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g</xref>).</p><p>The output of the Saleem method is a decision (or evidence) variable <italic>S<sub>delta</sub>(t)</italic>, computed by combining the differential likelihood of observing an up or down state from the chosen bands, which varies between 0 and 1 and can be used to determine the instantaneous state. To also take advantage of the information about the state given by higher frequencies, following (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mukovski et al., 2007</xref>) we combined <italic>S<sub>delta</sub>(t)</italic> with another decision variable extracted from the LFP in the 10–40 Hz range including the beta and gamma bands (<italic>S<sub>beta−gamma</sub>(t)</italic>). We chose to use such band because we noticed that in this frequency interval there are the highest differences between power spectra as computed during either up or down states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). To calculate <italic>S<sub>beta−gamma</sub>(t)</italic>, we first processed the filtered signal to accentuate the difference between the periods of high-amplitude fluctuations and those of low amplitudes in the [10, 40] Hz band. To do that, we calculated the standard deviation (corresponding to the root mean square) of the filtered signal in a running frame of 5 ms. Then, we smoothed the obtained trace with a 50 ms running frame linear filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mukovski et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, the resulting signal has been normalized between 0 and 1, in order to be averaged with <italic>S<sub>delta</sub>(t)</italic> and obtain <italic>S<sub>comb</sub>(t)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). We show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref> that the performances obtained by the algorithm when considering <italic>S<sub>comb</sub>(t)</italic> are slightly higher than when using <italic>S<sub>delta</sub>(t)</italic> alone; hence, we decided to use <italic>S<sub>comb</sub>(t)</italic> instead of <italic>S<sub>delta</sub>(t)</italic> to estimate the state at each time instant.</p><p>To determine the thresholds for the detection of up/down states, the distribution of <italic>S<sub>comb</sub>(t)</italic> was fitted by a mixture of three Gaussians using an expectation maximization algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saleem et al., 2010</xref>). Each Gaussian represents a different cortical state, that is, up (highest values of <italic>S<sub>comb</sub></italic>), down (lowest), and indeterminate (intermediate). Time samples corresponding to <italic>S<sub>comb</sub>(t) &gt; μ<sub>UP</sub> − 2σ<sub>UP</sub></italic> were assigned to up states, and samples corresponding to <italic>S<sub>comb</sub>(t) &gt; μ<sub>DOWN</sub> + 2σ<sub>DOWN</sub></italic> to down states (where means and variances of the Gaussians are represented as <italic>μ<sub>UP</sub>, μ<sub>DOWN</sub></italic>, and <italic>σ<sub>UP</sub>, σ<sub>DOWN</sub></italic> for the up and down cortical states, respectively). The remaining samples were considered as indeterminate state. As done for the membrane potential, we set the minimum state duration equal to 100 ms and the minimum inter-state interval equal to 50 ms. To assess the performance of the algorithm, we computed Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>) curves for both up and down state detection: for up states, true positives are those time instants defined as ‘up’ on the basis of both membrane potential and LFP, whereas false positives are time instants defined as ‘down’ in the membrane potential, but classified as ‘up’ from the LFP signal. The analogous definitions were applied for down state detection.</p><p>To evaluate whether the number of spikes fired from interneurons during down states was significantly higher than what could be predicted if all spikes came from misclassified time bins (i.e. in which down states were falsely detected from the LFP), we implemented the following test. We computed empirically from the ground truth data the probability that a time bin (20 ms resolution) is wrongly classified as down state for each given value of <italic>S<sub>comb</sub></italic>. For each interneuron, the overall probability that all its putative down-state spikes were fired in misclassified bins was calculated taking the product over all spikes of down-state misclassification probability given the corresponding <italic>S<sub>comb</sub></italic> value. Due to the rarity of down-state spikes, we assumed that the probability of misclassifying a bin containing a spike is roughly independent of that of other bins. This allowed us to compute the overall probability that all spikes come from misclassified bins as the product over all bins containing spikes of single-bin misclassification. This number thus quantifies the probability of the null hypothesis to be true (i.e. all interneurons’ spikes are fired in misclassified bins, hence interneurons never fire during down state), and was considered as p-value for each single interneuron.</p><p>All the analyses were performed by using custom-made software implemented in MATLAB (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link>, The Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Phase locking and causal analysis between PV/SST interneurons and LFP</title><p>To investigate the temporal relationship between PV/SST interneurons’ spiking activity and up/down state occurrence during spontaneous activity, we asked whether the LFP slow oscillation phase (which in turn reflects cortical state) is related to the occurrence of spikes in PV/SST interneurons by quantifying the phase locking of spikes. To do that, we applied the method detailed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eschenko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Siapas et al., 2005</xref>). Briefly, we computed the instantaneous low-frequency phase of the LFP as the angle of the Hilbert transform of the LFP trace filtered in the [0.1, 4] Hz band. The phase of firing distribution quantifies, for each cell, the phase values at which each spike was fired. Non-uniform phase of firing distributions mean that neurons fire preferentially at certain phases. Hence, phase locking can be detected by assessing departure from uniformity in the distribution of rescaled phases observed at spike times. To correct for the effect of possible non-uniformities in the phase distributions due to asymmetries in the LFP wave shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Siapas et al., 2005</xref>), we made the overall distribution of phase across all time points uniform by rescaling it by its cumulative distribution. The significance of phase locking was computed as departure from uniformity of the phase of firing distribution, using the Rayleigh’s test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Siapas et al., 2005</xref>). To infer possible causal dependencies between spikes and phase time series, we also computed how the phase locking between spike train and LFP (p&lt;0.01, Bonferroni corrected) varies when the two signals are shifted in time with respect to the other. We computed the phase of firing distribution for each shift value τ of the LFP trace with respect to the spike train between −0.5 s and 0.5 s. For each of these distributions, we measured the strength of locking as one minus the circular variance, to quantify the concentration of the distribution of angles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eschenko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Montemurro et al., 2008</xref>). To reliably estimate phase of firing distributions, we restricted the analysis to those cells firing at least 100 spikes in the whole recording (16/16 for PV cells, 15/19 for SST cells).</p><p>To estimate the temporal extent of the putative causation of interneurons on slow wave dynamics, we considered the range of negative time shifts τ for which the time-shifted phase locking was both statistically significant and, more conservatively, higher than the maximal value of time shifted locking over τ ≥ 0: indeed, no locking value at τ ≥ 0, by definition, can capture any causal relationships of spikes on slow waves (instead, locking values at τ ≥ 0 can be significant due to e.g. the autocorrelation of the phase time series and the entrainment of spike to slow oscillations). These putative causation time ranges have naturally the form τ<sub>end</sub> ≤ τ &lt; 0 (for two PV cells where τ<sub>end</sub> was less than −0.5 s we conservatively set τ<sub>end</sub> = −0.5 s). For each cell, we further determined the time shift corresponding to the maximum strength of locking (τ<sub><italic>max</italic></sub>).</p><p>We also determined the preferred phase of firing at τ = 0, τ = τ<sub><italic>max</italic></sub> and τ = τ<sub>end</sub>, by calculating the circular median of the phase of firing distribution. Moreover, for each cell we computed the width of the phase of firing as its interquartile range. To estimate phase values associated to the start and the end of up/down states we considered the statistical distributions of instantaneous phase at state onset/offset detected from the LFP as reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1h,i</xref>. We determined the start or the end of the state as the phase value associated to the peak of the distribution and we considered these values to determine the boundaries of up and down state displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,e,i,k</xref>. To better investigate the nature of the phase of firing distributions, we computed the phase of firing histograms for each neuron in that state, and separately for up, down and transition (down-to-up and up-to-down) states, in two different ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). The first quantification (phase of firing strength), that identifies the phase bins in which more spikes are fired, computed in each phase bin the number of spikes per phase bin averaged across all occurrences of a state. The second quantification (phase of firing reliability), that identifies the phase bins in which spikes are discharged more reliably across the occurrences of a state, computed in each phase bin the fraction of occurrences of a state in which we observed at least one spike. The two quantifications, for each phase bin, coincide if a neuron fires one spike in that phase bin. The two quantifications differ if a neuron fires sometimes more than one spike per phase bin and this number varies across different occurrences of a state. The similarity between phase of firing strength and phase of firing reliability (pooling up, down and transition states together) was evaluated, separately for each neuron, as the Pearson correlation coefficient across phase bins of the histograms of these two quantities. The population averaged Pearson correlation was: 0.986 ± 0.004 for N = 16 PV cells, and 0.996 ± 0.001 for N = 15 SST cells, p&lt;0.05 for all correlations calculated in individual cells.</p><p>Finally, to assess the nature of the changes in the spike-triggered LFP over the putative causal time range, we looked for statistically detectable differences in the LFP phase speed (i.e. the rate of change of the LFP phase) across the spike times, over timescales of the order of τ<sub>end</sub>. More specifically, we considered, separately for up and down states and for PV and SST interneuron firing activity, all of the spikes occurring in a window between – X and – 200 ms before the end of state (where X was varied parametrically between – 400 and – 300 ms). We included only data up to – 200 ms before end of state because this was the range of causation exerted by the interneuron’s firing on phase dynamics that we found in real data (see Results). To test whether there was a difference between phase speed pre- and post-spike we computed, separately for each population of interneurons and for up and down states, the time-average of the phase speed over a time window T around the spike time (T varied between 50 and 200 ms). We then compared the pre- and post-spike results with a t test. We checked that the results of these comparisons were consistent across the different choices of the parameters X and T. Results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> were computed for X = - 400 ms and T = 200 ms. To check that the results of the statistical tests are not due to intrinsic asymmetries of the LFP dynamics close to state end, we repeated the same comparisons with control data. For each data stretch of phase speed around a spike time included in the analysis above, we selected a ‘control stretch’ of LFP phase speed as follows: we first computed the time average of the data stretch over the whole 400 ms interval centered on the corresponding interneuron spike time, then we randomly chose an equally long control stretch recorded when the interneuron was silent, whose distance from the respective state end was equal to the distance of the data stretch from its state end, and whose time average over the respective whole 400 ms interval differed from the data stretch time-average by less than 50 deg/s. We then triggered the phase speed change analysis to the centers of the control stretches rather than to the timings of a spike, which are the centers of the data stretches.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Analysis of in vivo intracellular recordings</title><p>Recordings were inspected <italic>a posteriori</italic> to determine whether the optogenetic stimulus was delivered during an up or during a down state. A stimulus was delivered during an up state if the membrane potential of cell was stably depolarized (&gt;10 mV) over the resting potential of that cell in a time window of 100 ms before the light stimulus. A stimulus was delivered during a down state if the membrane potential of cell was stably within ±3 mV from the resting potential of that cell in a time window of 100 ms before the light stimulus. Trials which did not satisfy either criterion were not considered for analysis. For photostimulation experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>, the change in membrane voltage (ΔmV) was calculated in a time window before (Pre, duration, 100 ms and 50 ms for experiments in anesthetized or non-anesthetized animals, respectively) and after (Post, duration, 100 ms) light stimulation in 10 representative stimulation trials per cell. In photoinhibition experiments in which the membrane potential was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>), three time windows were considered: Pre (duration, 100 ms and 50 ms for anesthetized or non-anesthetized experiments, respectively), Light (duration, 500 ms), and Post (duration, 100 ms). In photoinhibition experiments in which the spike frequency was evaluated, longer time windows were considered: Pre (duration, 1 s), Light (duration, 500 ms), and Post (duration, 1 s). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, only the recordings in which stimulation occurred during a down state were considered. The onset of the optogenetically triggered up state was determined as the time at which the cell membrane potential crossed a threshold set at two times the standard deviation of the average down state membrane voltage value which was calculated in the Pre time window. The standard deviation associated to the onset was evaluated for each single neuron and its average across cells was used to estimate the temporal variation (jitter) for the triggered up state. To evaluate the membrane potential speed in pyramidal neurons during up-to-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) and down-to-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) state transitions, we performed a linear regression of the membrane potential as a function of time during the transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sanchez-Vives et al., 2010</xref>) and we considered its angular coefficient (i.e., the slope). To compare optogenetically-evoked transitions with spontaneously occurring transitions, for each recorded cell we manually selected ten evoked and ten spontaneous transitions and we evaluated the average slope of selected transitions across cells. To estimate the time lag between the up-to-down or the down-to-up transition in the experiments reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), we calculated the onset of each transition as the time at which the cell membrane potential crossed a threshold set at two times the standard deviation of the average down, or up state membrane voltage value calculated in the Pre time window. The difference between the onset of transition from the cell recorded in channel two and the transition onset from the cell in channel one was considered as the transition time lag (Ch2-Ch1 delay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Analysis of in vivo extracellular recordings</title><p>LFP and MUA signals were analysed with custom made software programmed in MATLAB. Extracellular signals were inspected <italic>a posteriori</italic> to determine whether the optogenetic stimulus was delivered during an up or during a down state, similarly to what done for intracellular recordings. Up and down states were identified based on the presence of high frequency oscillations in the LFP or the appearance of extracellular spikes in the MUA. LFP traces were downsampled by a factor of 50 (from 50 kHz to 1 kHz) and low-pass filtered using a Chebyshev Type I filter (corner frequency, 100 Hz). The frequency content of the LFP was evaluated with spectrograms computed using 100 ms Hamming windows shifted every 1 ms. The one-sided modified periodogram estimate of the power spectral density (PSD) was computed (FFT length: 500 points) for each window and plotted as a function of time and frequency (0–100 Hz) in a logarithmic scale. A blanking window of 10 ms at the beginning of the Pre and Post windows was used to exclude stimulation artefacts. The relative power in the low gamma (30–60 Hz) and high gamma (60–90 Hz) range was computed by integrating the PSD function over the two frequency ranges and normalizing the integral over the total signal power in the pre-stimulus window. The PSD is estimated by means of the Welch’s averaged modified periodogram spectral estimation method (segment length: half of the considered window; overlap: 50%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Welch, 1967</xref>).</p><p>The MUA signal was isolated by high-pass filtering (corner frequency, 300 Hz). Spikes were identified based on a threshold set at five times the standard deviation of the noise. 100 ms time binning (10 ms for the dual MUA recordings) was used to compute spike count histograms. Spike frequency was obtained as the total number of identified spikes in the different windows (Pre, Light, and Post) over the temporal duration of the window.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael M Halassa (Reviewer #1); Antoine Adamantidis (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study provides important data and quantitative analysis of the roles of parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) inhibitory interneurons in controlling sleep-related cortical up-to-down and down-to-up state transitions using in vivo patch-clamp recording/imaging and optogenetics approaches in both anesthetized and non-anesthetized mice. Both PV and SOM cells were found to be active during the UP states and phase locked to the local field potential slow wave oscillation and are causally involved in the termination of the up state. This was shown using electrophysiological recording during both spontaneous bistable state transitions and with optogenetic activation of PV/SST neurons during up states.</p><p>Silencing of these cells during up states prolonged up states, but Interestingly their silencing during down states revealed different dynamics. Silencing of PV cells led to a faster and higher pyramidal cell firing during up states than silencing of SST cells, suggesting alternative mechanisms.</p><p>The results are clearly discussed in light of recent studies, in particular regarding the role of thalamus versus cortical circuits in up/down state transitions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please provide additional analyses to address the following reviewers' concerns:</p><p>Analysis:</p><p>1) There is great appeal in the fact that this is not an optogenetic-based study, and that the authors spent considerable effort characterizing the basic relationship between PV/SST spike times and LFP phase. However, there could be some more things to interrogate in this dataset that would enhance overall clarity:a) The individual phase histograms of each neuron within the PV and SST datasets could use a little more characterization. How much variability is associated with each bin? That helps clarify how consistent a neuron fires with respect to a specific slow oscillation phase. This would be a starting point to figuring out whether there are phases of consistent spiking (don't have to be the dominant ones) associated with UP to Down state transitions in some neurons; imagine that a subset of PV and/or SST neurons shows consistent spiking at a specific phase close to the UP to Down state transition. Taking a median statistic for each distribution will miss that, and would miss important potential differences between PV and SST neurons. Plus, simply counting spikes per bin would not get at that because a bin containing 10 spikes could have gotten those in one slow oscillation cycle or consistently on each of the 10 slow oscillation cycles that were recorded. These two scenarios would have very different interpretations. It may ultimately end up being the case that only a subset of these broad interneuronal types are engaged in regulating this transition, so the overall theoretical framework guiding these experiments (a discussion point) would benefit from approaching the data analysis that way. In relation to this point, and along the lines of examining whether certain neurons preferentially participate in the aforementioned transitions, the authors could look to see whether any of the phase distribution histogram features correlates with speed of transition on a neuron-by-neuron basis.b) Regardless of the point above, the phase speed analysis is quite informative, and it would be highly desirable to see comparable analysis done on the optogenetic manipulation experiments too. It's sort of clear, by eye, that the dV/dt in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is larger for SST than PV manipulation. Doing this analysis may help to clarify which of those two cell types (broadly defined) contain populations that are more likely to be the natural source for UP to Down state transition. That will make the point substantially stronger.c) The same is true for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; the slope of the Up to Down State transition appear to be different under the two Arch manipulations. The associated analysis misses this point a little, but compare the membrane potential changes with and without light when it's clear that disinhibition will cause some level of depolarization. The important point to clarify here is whether the transition slopes change in a systematic way which can be compared to the baseline phenomena in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>2) The authors state that locally controlled up/down states in the cortex rapidly spread over mesoscale cortical areas, leading to a &quot;near synchronicity&quot; of up/down state during both optogenetic activation and silencing of (LII/III) PV and SST cells.

The comparison was done for each cell and separately for up states, down states, state onsets and state offsets. The phase of firing strength was computed as the average number of spikes per phase bin in a single occurrence of a state. The phase of firing reliability instead computed in each phase bin the fraction of states in which at least one spike was observed. For each phase bin, the two quantities coincide if a neuron always fires a single spike in that phase bin across occurrences of state. In contrast, the two quantities differ if a neuron fires unreliably in that phase bin across trials. We found that the histograms of the phase of firing strength and of the phase of firing reliability were highly correlated for all recorded cells (average Pearson correlation: 0.986 ± 0.004 for N = 16 PV cells, and 0.996 ± 0.001 for N = 15 SST cells, p &lt; 0.05 for all correlations calculated in individual cells). This was due to the fact that the vast majority (96.1 ± 0.8% for N = 16 PV interneurons, 99.5 ± 0.4% for N = 15 SST cells) of phase bins (bin width: 10 ms) contained only either zero or one spike. Overall, this additional analysis indicates that the phase bins characterized by stronger firing are also those in which individual neurons fire more reliably.</p><p> <italic>In relation to this point, and along the lines of examining whether certain neurons preferentially participate in the aforementioned transitions, the authors could look to see whether any of the phase distribution histogram features correlates with speed of transition on a neuron-by-neuron basis.</italic> </p><p>To address the referee’s request, we first computed the spike-triggered phase speed change for each individual neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> displays the phase speed changes pooled across all neurons of each class). In doing so, we focused only on phase speed changes triggered by spikes in the up state, because only in this case enough spikes per neuron for a robust single-cell phase-speed-change analysis were observed. We then analyzed the correlation of the phase speed change of each cell with several different features of the phase of firing distribution.</p><p>We found significant correlation between the single-cell phase speed change and the circular variance of the phase of firing distribution, which quantifies the width of the distribution, for both PV (correlation 0.67, p = 0.005, N = 16) and SST interneurons (correlation 0.58, p = 0.03, N = 14). Cells with particularly large distributions (circular variance ≥ 0.35) tended to show large speed change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4a</xref>), suggesting that cells whose firing covers larger portions of the up state may have a larger causal effect.</p><p>We also found correlation between single-cell phase speed changes and the preferred phase of firing for both PV (circular-linear correlation 0.60, p = 0.05, N = 16) and SST (circular-linear correlation 0.74, p = 0.02, N = 14). Cells with earlier preferred phase of firing tended to show large speed change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4b</xref>). Preferred phase of firing and circular variance however tended to be correlated across cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4c</xref>), making it difficult to dissociate the independent effect of each of these two variables on phase speed changes. These data suggest that specific features of the phase of firing distribution may be used as indicators of the causal role of interneurons in the slow wave cycle, and we plan to investigate closely this matter in future dedicated experiments.</p><p> <italic>b) Regardless of the point above, the phase speed analysis is quite informative, and it would be highly desirable to see comparable analysis done on the optogenetic manipulation experiments too. It's sort of clear, by eye, that the dV/dt in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is larger for SST than PV manipulation. Doing this analysis may help to clarify which of those two cell types (broadly defined) contain populations that are more likely to be the natural source for UP to Down state transition. That will make the point substantially stronger.</italic> </p><p>As requested by the referee, we quantified the slope of the up-to-down state transitions in individual cells for the experiments displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. We found that optogenetic activation of PV and SST interneurons during ongoing up states triggered up-to-down state transitions with larger slope compared to spontaneous up-to-down transitions observed at the level of the membrane potential in the same intracellularly recorded cells. The slope of up-to-down transition was not significantly different for optogenetic stimulation of PV and for optogenetic stimulation of SST interneurons. These data are now reported in subsection <italic>“</italic>Optogenetic activation of interneurons triggers up-to-down transitions” and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>. As a consequence of these new results, we also modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to show more representative traces that display similar transition slope following stimulation of PV and SST interneurons.</p><p> <italic>c) The same is true for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; the slope of the Up to Down State transition appear to be different under the two Arch manipulations. The associated analysis misses this point a little, but compare the membrane potential changes with and without light when it's clear that disinhibition will cause some level of depolarization. The important point to clarify here is whether the transition slopes change in a systematic way which can be compared to the baseline phenomena in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We performed the additional analysis requested by the reviewer and quantified the slope of the optogenetically-induced transitions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. We found that optical inhibition of PV cells triggered down-to-up state transitions with larger slope compared to spontaneous events. In contrast, optical suppression of SST interneurons elicited down-to-up transitions with slope values that were undistinguishable from those of spontaneous down-to-up transitions. To compare between optogenetically-induced and spontaneous transitions we used an internal control, i.e. spontaneous down-to-up transitions measured at the level of the membrane potential in the same cells in which the optogenetically-induced transitions were recorded. We believe this is the appropriate control as it compares the slope of state transitions (either spontaneous or optogenetically-induced) measured with the same technique (intracellular recordings) and in the same set of cells, rather than comparing with data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> where state transitions were measured in a different set of experiments with the LFP. This additional analysis is now reported in subsection “Inhibitory control of state transition is interneuron subtype-specific” and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p> <italic>2) The authors state that locally controlled up/down states in the cortex rapidly spread over mesoscale cortical areas, leading to a &quot;near synchronicity&quot; of up/down state during both optogenetic activation and silencing of (LII/III) PV and SST cells. While this is very interesting, the manuscript would greatly benefit from some additional analysis of this synchronicity.
