primates and the relative magnitude of volumetric increases. Using Bayesian phylogenetic comparative methods and data for both extant and fossil species, we identified that a distinct shift in brain-body scaling occurred as hominins diverged from other primates, and again as humans and Neanderthals diverged from other hominins. Within hominins, we detected a pattern of directional and accelerating evolution towards larger brains, consistent with a positive feedback process in the evolution of the human brain. Contrary to widespread assumptions, we found that the human neocortex is not exceptionally large relative to other brain structures. Instead, our analyses revealed a single increase in relative neocortex volume at the origin of haplorrhines, and an increase in relative cerebellar volume in apes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41250.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Humans have much larger brains than other primates, but it is not clear exactly when and how this difference emerged during evolution. Some scientists believe that the expansion of a part of the brain called the neocortex – which handles sight, hearing, conscious decision-making and language – drove the increase in the size of the human brain. Newer studies have challenged that idea.</p><p>One way to learn more about how humans evolved bigger brains is to compare the size of the brain, and specific parts of the brain, between humans and our closest relatives: non-human primates. To make accurate comparisons, scientists must account for many factors. Closely related primates may have more similar traits because they more recently shared a common ancestor. This means the evolutionary relationships between species need to be considered. Larger animals also tend to have larger brains so it is important to consider body size, too.</p><p>Now, Miller at al. show that the human brain is much larger than expected even after accounting for these factors, and that increases in brain size accelerated over the course of early human evolution. In the analyses, the brain and skull sizes of different living primate species, like chimpanzees and gorillas, and fossils of extinct primates, including Neanderthals, were compared using mathematical models.</p><p>These findings suggest that larger brains provided fitness advantages that led to large brain sizes in modern humans and Neanderthals. These increases in brain size were not driven by disproportionate growth in the neocortex alone, but rather by increases in the size of many parts of the brain. Increases in the relative size of the cerebellum, which is essential for balance and movement, were also important.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>brain evolution</kwd><kwd>phylogenetic comparative methods</kwd><kwd>human evolution</kwd><kwd>primate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BCS-1355902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nunn</surname><given-names>Charles L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The exceptionally large size of the human brain is the result of accelerating evolution towards larger brains in hominins, but is not the product of neocortical expansion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Primates vary almost a thousand-fold in endocranial volume – a measure which closely approximates brain size – ranging from 1.63 mL in mouse lemurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Isler et al., 2008</xref>) to 1478 mL in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Robson and Wood, 2008</xref>). Body size is perhaps the most important statistical predictor of brain size across primates, with larger bodied species having larger brains, but substantial variation remains after accounting for the effects of body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Isler et al., 2008</xref>). While numerous comparative studies have sought to identify ecological, behavioral, and cognitive correlates of this variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">MacLean et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeCasien et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Powell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Noonan et al., 2018</xref>), much less is known about the evolutionary patterns and processes that generated extant variation in brain size within the primate clade, how these differ for different components of the brain, or the degree to which the brain phenotypes of particular species, such as humans, are the result of exceptional patterns of evolutionary change.</p><p>A common approach to investigating human uniqueness is to test whether humans fall ‘significantly’ far from a regression line, for example by regressing brain size on body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azevedo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Sousa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herculano-Houzel and Kaas, 2011</xref>). One surprising recent result reported from such an analysis is that the mass of the human brain is only 10% greater than expected for a primate of human body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azevedo et al., 2009</xref>). However, such non-phylogenetic methods may give misleading results because they fail to incorporate trait co-variation among species that results from shared evolutionary history. Valid analysis requires methods that account for phylogeny both when estimating scaling parameters and when evaluating deviations from scaling patterns exhibited by individual species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garland and Ives, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ross et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Organ et al., 2011</xref>). An additional source of error arises if the species being investigated is included in the regression model (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azevedo et al., 2009</xref>), particularly when, as for humans, the phenotypic trait lies at the extreme of the distribution for the other species in the analysis. This procedure would reduce the magnitude of deviations from expected trait values for lineages that have undergone exceptional change, and in the case of humans, would bias the results toward failing to detect uniqueness.</p><p>Comparative methods make it possible to incorporate phylogeny into analyses and to model phenotypic evolution in ways that uncover hitherto hidden patterns. Such methods are now being applied to a wide variety of traits (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vining and Nunn, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pagel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Orme, 2013</xref>), including brain size. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pagel (2002)</xref> estimated phylogenetic scaling parameters to characterize the evolutionary trajectory of endocranial volume (ECV) in fossil hominins. His analyses revealed that ECV evolution accelerated towards the present. As this analysis did not account for body size, it is not clear to what extent this pattern reflects changes in brain size independent of body size. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Montgomery et al. (2010)</xref> used ancestral state reconstruction with fossil data to demonstrate a directional trend in primate brain size evolution and to identify branches in the primate phylogeny along which exceptional evolutionary change occurred. They found that while the absolute change in the mass of the human brain was exceptional, the rate of change relative to body size was not. Phylogenetic methods have also been used to examine how specific brain components evolved and the extent to which the branch leading to humans exhibited unusual amounts or rates of change in the size of these components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Barton and Venditti, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Barton and Venditti, 2014</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lewitus (2018)</xref> suggested that comparative analyses of neuroanatomical data can be improved by incorporating and comparing results from different evolutionary models.</p><p>Here, we use phylogenetic methods to model the evolution of brain size and to identify exceptional evolutionary change along phylogenetic branches. We employ three methods: The first method models trait evolution both as a multi-optima Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process (which incorporates stabilizing selection and drift) and as a Brownian motion process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Felsenstein, 1985</xref>), and then compares the fit of the two models. In cases where the OU model is favored, exceptional patterns of trait evolution are indicated by recent shifts in adaptive optima in humans’ (or other species’) evolutionary lineage. In cases where the Brownian model is favored, we apply our second method, which is a phylogenetic outlier test that uses phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) to predict a phenotype for a species and then compares observed and predicted values. With this method, we can assess whether humans are a phylogenetic ‘outlier’ relative to expectations based on their phylogenetic position and trait covariation in other primate species. Our last method tests for directional and accelerating evolution by fitting phylogenetic scaling parameters to data on deviation from trait expectations and evolutionary time, building on previous efforts with these approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pagel, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Using the first two methods, we investigate the evolution of absolute brain size and brain size relative to body mass within primates. Absolute brain volume has been shown to predict cognitive ability in primates better than other metrics that account for body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">MacLean et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deaner et al., 2007</xref>). However, brain size is highly correlated with body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Isler et al., 2008</xref>), and as such it is difficult to interpret the significance of brain size alone. Additionally, accounting for body mass gives more insights into the significance of brain size in life history processes, as relative brain size better approximates relative investment in cognitive ability. Accounting for body mass is also important as the relationship between this trait and brain size is associated with scaling effects that reflect conservation of neural function, such as preservation of somatosensory acuity across large surface areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">St Wecker and Farel, 1994</xref>) and compensation for increased neural conduction distances in larger animals through (i) larger neuron and axon sizes, increased myelination, and increased white matter volume, all of which result in reduced neuron density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barton, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collins et al., 2013</xref>) and (ii) increased neural resources devoted to prediction-based sensorimotor control that result from escalating neural conduction delays as body size increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">More et al., 2010</xref>). Other measures of relative brain size such as encephalization quotients, ratios, and residuals have been used in the past, but all make theoretical assumptions about the underlying relationship between brain and body size evolution that may not hold. Using relative measures can bias parameter estimates and is not recommended as a good statistical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Freckleton, 2002</xref>). Instead, an empirical approach is preferred in which the covariation of brain size with body size is accounted for within a statistical model that also accounts for phylogenetic history (such as PGLS).</p><p>We also apply the first two phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate the evolution of major brain structures involving the neocortex, cerebellum, and medulla. It is widely assumed that the neocortex expanded disproportionately relative to other brain structures during the evolution of anthropoid primates and most particularly in human evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kriegstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Geschwind and Rakic, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref>). Surprisingly however, direct tests of this hypothesis are lacking, despite the focus of much evolutionary and developmental neuroscience on the neocortex as the site of interest for understanding human uniqueness and its developmental mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mitchell and Silver, 2017</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that the cerebellum may have contributed more to human brain evolution than previously appreciated: it underwent rapid evolutionary expansion in the great ape clade including hominins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Barton and Venditti, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Smaers et al., 2018</xref>) and has been implicated in shape changes of the brain in hominin fossil endocasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kochiyama et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Neubauer et al., 2018</xref>). Molecular evidence now corroborates the proposal that selection on cerebellar function was an important feature of hominoid and hominin brain evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sousa et al., 2017</xref>), with changes in protein-coding genes implicated in cerebellar development more likely to have evolved adaptively in apes than those implicated in neocortical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Harrison and Montgomery, 2017</xref>). It therefore appears that the neocortex and cerebellum have had different evolutionary trajectories in primate evolutionary history. More research is needed to document and understand these patterns.</p><p>We examined volumetric change in the neocortex and cerebellum relative to both body mass and the volume of the rest of the brain. As a check to establish whether changes in evolutionary patterns for relative neocortex and cerebellum size are primarily attributable to changes in those structures or to changes in the rest of the brain, we investigated the evolution of the rest of the brain relative to body mass. We also conducted analyses of the volume of the medulla relative to body mass and the volume of the rest of the brain. The relative volume of the medulla does not vary significantly across clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barton, 2000</xref>) and as such it has not been attributed a major role in brain expansion. For the analyses of fossil species, brain component volumes are not available; thus, analyses of these lineages are restricted to overall brain size (ECV).</p><p>Although our main focus is on broad patterns across primate phylogeny and on the extent to which human brain evolution fits or departs from these patterns, we also examined brain evolution in other species that are considered to be unusually large-brained, such as the aye-aye (<italic>Daubentonia</italic>) and capuchins (<italic>Cebinae</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Isler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pagel and Harvey, 1989</xref>). Our analyses also help to identify other primate species that have experienced exceptional expansion or reduction of the brain or its components, generating new questions for future research on exceptional brain evolution in primates.</p><p>We used our third method to characterize patterns of brain evolution in humans and extinct hominins. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pagel (2002)</xref> conducted similar analyses of raw ECV. Our analyses advance his findings in two ways. First, we incorporate body mass as a predictor. Second, we focus on the deviation from brain size expectations, based on the PGLS methods used to assess outlier status. Our findings therefore provide insights to the evolutionary trajectory of exceptional hominin ECV relative to primate-wide brain-body mass scaling relationships.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Comparative data</title><p>We compiled ECV and female body mass data on non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Isler et al., 2008</xref>) as well as humans and fossil hominins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Robson and Wood, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref>). Given that sex specific body mass estimates are available for ancient humans and extinct hominins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Robson and Wood, 2008</xref>), we used female values for body mass because female values are more tightly linked to ecological and life-history factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gordon, 2006</xref>) and sexual selection can drive increases in male body mass unlinked to ecology, obscuring brain-body scaling relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fitzpatrick et al., 2012</xref>). We also compiled data on neocortex, cerebellum, and medulla volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Barton and Venditti, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stephan et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bush and Allman, 2004</xref>).

This was accomplished using BayesModelS, an R script that generates distributions of predicted trait values for a species or several species based on phylogenetically controlled analyses of trait covariation with predictor variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nunn and Zhu, 2014</xref>). BayesModelS uses a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to fit parameters of a PGLS model and assumes a Brownian motion model of evolutionary change. The PGLS models are used to generate trait value predictions for the species of interest. Uncertainty in phylogenetic structure can be accounted for by sampling from a set of trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pagel, 2002</xref>).</p><p>BayesModelS accounts for phylogenetic non-independence of residual trait values by incorporating branch scaling factors when fitting PGLS models. The MCMC samples between two branch length scaling factors, λ and κ, to improve the fit of the models. The parameter λ scales the internal branches of the phylogeny and measures phylogenetic signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nunn, 2011</xref>). Values for λ were constrained to be in the interval [0, 1]. In the κ model phylogenetic tree branch lengths are raised to the power κ. The value of κ has previously been used to assess support for a ‘speciational’ mode of evolution (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pagel, 2002</xref>).</p><p>When predicting the value of a trait for a species (or a group of species), its data were excluded from the BayesModelS analysis to avoid biasing the predictions. BayesModelS was then used to generate a posterior probability distribution of predicted values for that species, based on the predictor variable, estimated phylogenetic signal, and estimated trait co-variation with the other species in the analysis. Species were identified as outliers when their trait value was more extreme than 97.5% of the predicted trait values (i.e. when trait values fell outside 95% credible interval). A species was identified as a positive outlier when its true value fell above the majority of predictions, and a negative outlier when the opposite was true.</p><p>The analyses conducted using BayesModelS proceeded as follows. First, we investigated whether hominins follow primate brain size to body mass scaling rules by using BayesModelS to predict ECV based on body mass and phylogeny. We tested each hominin species for outlier status while excluding data on all hominins when generating predictions. When computing mean estimates for hominin ECV, we corrected for back transformation bias using the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator method described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smith (1993)</xref>. We used the hominin phylogeny or the alternate hominin phylogeny in these analysis, and the data spanned 225 extant primate species (including humans) and 10 extinct hominin species.</p><p>Next, we identified individual primate species that are evolutionary outliers for ECV and other brain structures (neocortex, cerebellum, medulla, rest-of-brain). In these analyses, we accounted for phylogenetic uncertainty by using the block of 100 trees, which included <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>H. neanderthalensis</italic> but no other hominins. We iteratively tested each species in the data set for outlier status. Our analysis for ECV included data from 145 species, and our analyses for other brain structures structures included data from between 39 and 53 species.</p><p>MCMC chains were run for 1,000,000 time steps, and the first 200,000 time steps were discarded as burn in. Flat priors were used for all variables being predicted. To assess whether the post-burn in results were drawn from a stable distribution, we used the ‘heidel.diag’ function in the R package coda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Plummer et al., 2006</xref>). When post-burn-in results were not drawn from a stable distribution, we discarded an additional portion of the chain (as indicated by ‘heidel-diag’) so that only results drawn from a stable distribution remained. We ensured that the effective sample sizes for the PGLS model parameters (slope, intercept, most frequently selected phylogenetic scaling parameter) were greater than 1000 using the ‘effectiveSize’ function in coda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Plummer et al., 2006</xref>). Details of the MCMC diagnostics are given in supplementary materials S6, along with detailed results concerning the posterior predicted distribution and phylogenetic scaling parameters for each species in each analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Characterizing the tempo of ECV evolution in hominins</title><p>We investigated the evolutionary trajectory of brain-body scaling in hominins relative to other primates. We calculated the difference between observed ECV and the mean BayesModelS prediction for brain size (generated in the first described BayesModelS analysis in which data for all hominin species was excluded while generating predictions) for each of the hominin species. This difference, which we call ‘brain size deviation’ represents the magnitude and direction of the deviation in brain size from what would be expected under primate brain-body scaling rules. We fit four PGLS model to hominin brain size deviation to examine how brain size deviation covaried with the phylogenetic distance from the hominin-<italic>Pan</italic> split: First, we fit a ‘Brownian’ model of brain size deviation with no predictor. We fixed λ at one in this and all subsequent models. Next, we fit a ‘directional’ model of brain size deviation predicted by phylogenetic distance from the hominin-<italic>Pan</italic> split, expecting to find a positive relationship between these variables if brain volume relative to body size has increased since the split of hominins and <italic>Pan</italic>. To determine whether evolutionary rates in brain size deviation have accelerated over time, we fit an ‘acceleration’ model that included the phylogenetic scaling parameter δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pagel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pagel, 1999</xref>). Values of δ greater than one are consistent with accelerating evolution, but not necessarily directional evolution. Finally, we fit a ‘directional acceleration’ model in which we fit the parameter δ and used phylogenetic distance from the hominin-<italic>Pan</italic> split as a predictor of brain size deviation. In this model, a positive relationship between brain size deviation and phylogenetic distance, along with a value of δ greater than 1, would indicate that brain volume relative to body size has increased at an accelerating rate since the divergence of hominins from <italic>Pan.</italic> We compared these models using AICc.

However, both chains inferred a similar set of shifts, indicating that this is likely an issue related to parameter identifiability rather than to shift identifiability. In this model, progressive shifts towards larger ECV relative to body mass were detected within the hominin clade along the human lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

The exceptional size of the human brain was achieved through progressive scaling shifts towards larger size over several million years of hominin evolution, and the evolution towards increased brain size relative to expectations based on primate scaling patterns accelerated over time. These findings add an important dimension to previous observations of gradual phyletic increases in hominin brain size. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Du et al. (2018)</xref> fit six evolutionary models to within- and between-lineage change in hominin brain sizes (random walk, gradualism, stasis, punctuated equilibrium, stasis-random walk and stasis-gradualism), obtaining the best fit for a gradualism model. However, their non-phylogenetic analysis did not test explicitly for accelerating directional increase. Our findings extend the results obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pagel (2002)</xref> on absolute cranial volume, as the pattern of accelerating evolution is found even after accounting for body size. The pattern of accelerating brain size increase documented here is consistent with hypotheses that postulate a co-evolutionary positive feedback process driving human brain evolution, such as feedback between brain size and culture or language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wills, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deacon, 1998</xref>) or between the brain sizes of conspecifics engaged in a socio-cognitive evolutionary arms race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dunbar, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miller, 2011</xref>).</p><p>While humans clearly have the largest relative brain size among extant primates, anatomically modern humans were closely matched by <italic>H. neanderthalensis</italic>. However, even when accounting for the close phylogenetic relationship between humans and <italic>H. neanderthalensis</italic> and the exceptionally large brain of the latter, the human brain is still much larger than expected: humans were identified as strongly supported outliers when their ECV (relative to body mass) was predicted by phenotypic data from all primates, including <italic>H. neanderthalensis</italic>. This pattern was not reciprocal, however; <italic>H. neanderthalensis</italic> was not significantly different from other primates when <italic>H. sapiens</italic> was included in the model.</p><p>Significant variation exists between estimates of ECV and body mass made from different fossil specimens of the same hominin species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Robson and Wood, 2008</xref>). Thus, using single specimens to represent a species would not be a good statistical practice. We used a dataset in which almost all mean species values were calculated from multiple fossil specimens (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Unfortunately, we could not explicitly account for intraspecific variation in our analyses, as the multi-optima OU model fitting approach and the outlier test are unable to account for variation in both a trait and predictor variable. It would therefore be worthwhile to revisit our analyses as new phylogenetic comparative methods that can account for intraspecific variation become available. Additionally, data quality will likely improve over time. More hominin fossils will be discovered, increasing sample sizes for estimated ECV and body mass.</p><p>The hominin phylogeny will also likely become better resolved and more complete. We accounted for some phylogenetic uncertainty by repeating our analyses with an alternate phylogeny. The use of different phylogenies influenced outcomes of some statistical tests, as the Brownian model favored when we used the hominin phylogeny and OU model was favored when we used the alternate hominin phylogeny. However, we found that all of the OU models we fit inferred the same pattern of evolution towards larger ECV along the human lineage. The results of our outlier tests and PGLS model fitting – which assume a Brownian mode of evolution – also detected this pattern on different phylogenies. Collectively, these results indicate that our findings are likely to be robust to variations in assumed evolutionary relationships, and potentially to assumptions about the mode of evolution.</p><p>It is widely assumed that primate brain size evolution in general, and the large size of the human brain in particular, reflects expansion of the neocortex relative to other brain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kriegstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rakic, 2009</xref>). Our results contradict this assumption: human neocortical volume was exceptionally large relative to body mass, but not exceptional relative the volume of the rest of the brain. We documented only one shift in neocortex size relative to the rest of the brain during primate evolution: an increase at the origin of all haplorrhines. This shift may be related to the visual specializations of haplorrhines for high-acuity photic vision, mediated by extensive cortical visual areas that make up over 50% of the cortex in these species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Drury et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barton, 2007</xref>). On branches postdating the split between haplorrhines and strepsirrhines, neocortex size is largely predictable from its scaling relationship to the rest of the brain, in line with the proposed importance of cortical-subcortical connectivity in primate brain evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Whiting and Barton, 2003</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, we found that the cerebellum increased in size relative to the rest of the brain on the branch leading to apes. This finding is consistent with the results of recent studies implicating the cerebellum, and especially the lateral cerebellum, in brain expansion in apes and some other mammalian lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Barton and Venditti, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Smaers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">MacLeod et al., 2003</xref>). Our findings also reinforce the argument that subcortical structures should be given greater consideration in studies of mammalian brain evolution and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barton, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miller and Clark, 2018</xref>). Cerebellar specialization in apes may have been initiated by the demands on motor control and route-planning imposed by arboreal below-branch locomotion and/or by complex extractive foraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Barton and Venditti, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barton, 2012</xref>). The fact that shifts in the relative size of neocortex and cerebellum occurred on different parts of the tree supports the theory of mosaic brain evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barton and Harvey, 2000</xref>) and suggests that no single adaptive hypothesis is likely to be capable of accounting for primate brain evolution; rather, different selection pressures, on different information-processing capacities, likely operated at different times on different lineages.</p><p>Consistent with previous studies, we found that the medulla expanded in humans (positive outlier status for medulla volume relative to body mass), but to a lesser degree than other structures (negative outlier status for medulla volume relative to the rest of the brain). Relative to body mass, medulla volume has been shown to be much less variable across taxa than other brain structures, particularly compared to the neocortex and cerebellum. For example, unlike neocortex and cerebellum, medulla volume does not differ significantly between insectivores, strepsirrhines and haplorrhines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barton, 2000</xref>). Accordingly, we found that after controlling for either body mass or brain size, the evolution of the medulla was not modulated by selection towards a stationary optimum in the primate clade. These results further support mosaic brain evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barton and Harvey, 2000</xref>), and also suggest that scaling constraints related to connectivity with other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Montgomery et al., 2016</xref>) was less critical for the medulla than for the neocortex and cerebellum.</p><p>Several non-human primate species exhibited exceptional brain evolution in one trait or another, but only humans showed exceptional brain evolution for multiple brain components. As predicted, we detected shifts towards larger brain size on the terminal branches leading to <italic>D. madagascariensis,</italic> and on the branch leading to the <italic>Cebinae</italic> clade. Large brain size in <italic>Daubentonia</italic> and <italic>Cebinae</italic> has been attributed to extractive foraging and tool use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kaufman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Melin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Parker, 2015</xref>). Although not one of our <italic>a priori</italic> expectations, we also documented shifts towards smaller brain size on branches leading to several clades, including <italic>Alouatta.</italic> We also found that two <italic>Gorilla</italic> species exhibit a smaller brain or neocortex size relative to body mass than expected. Given the extremely large body mass of <italic>Gorilla</italic> species, these unique traits may be the byproduct of a body mass increase rather than a reduction in brain size. Also unexpectedly, two <italic>Pan troglodytes</italic> sub-species were found to have exceptionally large and small ECV relative to body mass respectively. However, because more closely related species are weighed more heavily when BayesModelS generates distributions of predicted trait values, sister taxa deviating from expectations in opposite directions could result in both taxa being identified as outliers, even if they both conform to patterns of brain-body scaling for other primates. If the trait distributions for each species overlap significantly, then accounting for intraspecific variation in future analyses could remedy this problem.</p><p>The unexpected patterns that we observed amongst non-human primates raise several questions for further research. Given the well-established positive correlation between overall brain size and extended life history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Isler and van Schaik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sol, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">González-Lagos et al., 2010</xref>), what are the life history implications of mosaic shifts in the sizes of different structures, and do these support any specific interpretations of the correlation between brain size and life histories? One hypothesis, the developmental costs hypothesis, is that large brains simply take longer to grow and mature, leading to extended periods of maternal investment and slower maturation, with other life history correlates of brain size being byproducts of developmental prolongation. Support for this hypothesis is provided by the finding that, amongst mammals, the durations of gestation and lactation have independent effects on pre- and postnatal brain growth, and once these effects are accounted for, other life history correlates are non-significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barton and Capellini, 2011</xref>). Despite their generally correlated evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">MacLeod et al., 2003</xref>), we found shifts in the relative size of neocortex and cerebellum on different parts of the phylogenetic tree. Because these two structures have different developmental trajectories, the developmental costs hypothesis predicts different life history correlates; this prediction has now received support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Powell et al., 2019</xref>). Further work is needed to establish exactly what developmental changes allowed for the neocortex and cerebellum to rest-of-brain scaling rules to change at the origin of haplorrhines and hominoids, respectively.</p><p>Another area of interest concerns the cases we found of brain or brain component size reduction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Montgomery et al. (2010)</xref> found that brain size reductions were rare during primate evolution, and that there was a general trend for brain size to increase across multiple branches of the phylogeny. This raises questions for future work concerning the causes, developmental mechanisms and functional implications of specific types of size reduction, such as those that we uncovered in brain size relative to body size in <italic>Alouatta</italic> and other clades, and in neocortex size relative to the rest of the brain in <italic>N. larvatus</italic>.</p><p>Finally, a key question that has attracted considerable attention concerns the ecological and social drivers of brain size and structure across large-scale evolutionary radiations. It has become increasingly apparent that correlations between overall brain size and behavioral ecology needed to be treated with caution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Powell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Healy and Rowe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wartel et al., 2018</xref>). However, as suggested by the hypothesis of mosaic brain evolution, correlations between ecology and individual, less functionally heterogenous brain components may be more reliable and robust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Barton and Venditti, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barton, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Whiting and Barton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Montgomery et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barton et al., 1995</xref>). Our analyses focused on gross subdivisions within the brain, and we suggest that further insights could be obtained by applying the phylogenetic methods used in this paper to more fine-grained neuro-anatomical data, using this approach to tease apart the contributions of correlated and mosaic change among brain components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Melin et al., 2014</xref>) and by incorporating ecological, behavioral, and developmental predictor variables that may account for additional variation in the traits of interest.</p><p>In conclusion, we provided robust evidence for directional and accelerating selection towards larger brain size over the course of human evolution, resulting in the human brain being exceptionally large for a primate of similar body mass. We also found that the sizes of human brain components – including the neocortex, cerebellum, and the rest of the brain – are not larger or smaller than expected relative to the size of the rest of the brain, but all are larger than expected for a primate of similar body mass. These results suggest that relative neocortical expansion is not a hallmark of our species. The diversity of evolutionary patterns for various brain components that we observed within primates suggests that no single factor fully explains primate brain evolution; instead, comparative research should investigate how different selection pressures influenced the evolution of different neuroanatomical components at different times on different parts of the phylogenetic tree.

We constructed a ‘hominin phylogeny’ (‘hominin.phylogeny.txt’) that included humans, extinct hominins, and extant primates for use in the analyses of hominin ECV (including the analyses of directional and accelerating evolution); this phylogeny was produced by grafting the ‘combined dataset consensus time tree’ of hominin evolution from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Organ et al.

We grafted the clade (including the root branch) containing <italic>Pan</italic> and all fossil hominins onto the node at which <italic>Gorilla</italic> diverged from the <italic>Pan</italic> lineage, and then re-scaled this pasted clade so that the human tip lined up with those of extant primates. We also constructed an ‘alternative hominin phylogeny’ (‘alt.hominin.phylogney.txt’ using the ‘morphology and molecular graft time tree’ from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Organ et al.

To construct this tree, we again grafted the clade (including the root branch) containing <italic>Pan</italic> and all fossil hominins onto the node at which <italic>Gorilla</italic> diverged from the <italic>Pan</italic> lineage, and then shortened the root branch so that the human tip lined up with those of extant primates. We were not able to use this method for constructing the hominin phylogeny because it would have resulted in the branch leading to the clade containing <italic>Pan</italic> and hominins having a negative length. Both hominin phylogenies we constructed include humans, 300 other extant primates, and 13 extinct hominin species.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Thompson as the Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Christopher Heesy (Reviewer #2); Theodore Stankowich (Reviewer #3); Dietrich Stout (Reviewer #4).</p><p>These reviewers were all in general agreement that this is an important topic and the manuscript should be published after some revisions. To add strength to this, all came from different perspectives (paleoanthropology, neuroanatomy, phylogenetics), and all were careful not to overstep the boundaries of their individual knowledge. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a well-written manuscript that addresses an important issue in hominin evolutionary studies. The authors provide an excellent and up-to-date summary of current research, and identify clear gaps in information that need to be addressed through future research. Their results are novel, interesting, and will certainly stimulate much discussion. The authors apply a newer Bayesian modeling approach to the pattern of primate brain volume evolution for the purpose of evaluating brain volume evolution in living and fossil humans. Their analyses that demonstrate differential rates and directions of brain volume evolution among primates and within certain clades are novel because they are shown within a single analysis, and not piecemeal across various studies. The comparisons between varying assumption sets and data sets are carefully handled and provide illuminating results.</p><p>This is clearly an important contribution to an important topic, and the impact statement conveys this. The topic of human brain expansion has been of enduring interest for a long time, and the particular contribution is very timely in light of recent papers (cited by the authors) that are either contradicted or meaningfully extended by the work presented.</p><p>The essential revisions are consolidated below. In general, these coalesce into the following recommendation: the authors should de-emphasize some of the implications of their results, publish a more comprehensive description of their sample set, and re-run some analyses with different sample subsets in order to explore some of the patterns that seem to have manifested in the first round of analysis. There should also be some minor expansion of discussion of some key points that were uncovered through their analysis, and give a bit more time to discussion of the literature and issues detailed in the comments below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Analytical Revisions:</p><p>1) What was not addressed by the current study was the relevance to the Herculano-Houzel lab's analyses. The authors bring up objections to the methods (and, obliquely, the conclusions) of studies on scaling of neuronal and non-neuronal cells numbers in primate CNS, but do not conduct comparable analyses. The authors use volumetric data, but the relationship between CNS volume and cell number, composition, size, variability, and density are not directly comparable. I see two solutions. The authors could just tone down or eliminate their discussion of the cell number and density studies or, and this would be my preference, they could also re-analyze the neuronal + non-neuronal cell data using modern phylogenetic approaches. Whichever the authors decide, I still believe that this paper should be published.</p><p>2) Subsection “Endocranial volume (ECV)”: If the exceptionally strong effects of H. sapiens &quot;washed out&quot; any potential effect on H. neanderthalensis and probably many other species, why not rerun these tests excluding H. sapiens when testing H. neanderthalensis and both of these species when testing the other primates? It may allow detection of more subtle changes in brain evolution that are smaller in effect, but equally interesting, and greater patterns may emerge.</p><p>Dataset revisions:</p><p>1) It is good to hold sex constant, but of course sex cannot be known for most extinct hominins. Therefore, it seems that averages of both males and females (brain and body sizes) would be more appropriate comparisons in analyses where fossil hominins are included. If the authors choose not to do this, they should justify it.</p><p>2) Although there is some clarity about the phylogenetic relationships of extant primates, there is less consensus about the relationships of fossil hominins. The authors use a consensus tree of their own making, but it is not clear how the analysis would change if small details of this tree were shifted around. It would be extremely helpful if at least one alternative phylogeny was demonstrated to have little impact on the results. Otherwise, a minor shift in the phylogenetic status of a fossil taxon could invalidate the big take-home from this study.</p><p>3) It would be very useful to include in the supplementary information a list of which specimens (museum numbers) of which fossil hominins went into the figure in each of the datasets. Sample sizes are so small for many of these, that a single cranium can make a big difference in this computation. The use and quality of different data sets has been a huge issue for this field, which has been bedeviled by small sample sizes, difficulties in dealing with intraspecific variation, and the use of estimated metrics (ECV, body mass) that may be derived in different ways esp. across fossil and extant species. Both ECV and body mass estimates are notoriously variable in hominin paleontology even for individual fossils, let alone in terms of a &quot;species norm&quot;. This is a general issue that really needs to be discussed for the whole data set, but I would point to one particular point of concern, which would be the source of the Homo sapiens data. From which population or populations, fossil or modern, does this derive? Implications esp. for body size could potentially be a factor in the different modeling results for H.s. vs. Neanderthals, just as the authors point out that unique traits of Gorilla may be a &quot;byproduct&quot; of body size change rather than brain change.</p><p>4) It is not clear why only a single non-African species – H. neanderthalensis – was included in this analysis, when there are many examples of ECV for H. erectus and H. heidelbergensis. If it is to restrict the analysis to evolutionary trajectories that could feasibly have led to modern humans, that is acceptable – but the authors should explicitly explain these decisions.</p><p>5) Similarly, I do not understand why African H. heidelbergensis was not included in this analysis. Is this because its phylogenetic position is poorly-understood, and the authors were restricting themselves to African specimens where there is still debate over the number of Middle Pleistocene species of Homo? At the very least, this omission should be justified. It is a critical link between H. ergaster and H. sapiens.</p><p>Discussion Revisions:</p><p>1) The current level of discussion of the results on medulla size evolution should be more explicit about their medulla analyses or just consider de-emphasizing these results. This is because predictions about why medulla volume might vary among primates is elusive. Either the authors should be more explicit about their medulla analyses or just consider de-emphasizing these results.</p><p>2) Subsection “Endocranial volume (ECV)”: If the weak OU model provides a better fit and suggests that all primates experienced similar evolutionary trajectories, how does that mesh with the previous result that they show variation among taxa in evolutionary rate? More explanation and interpretation of this result seems warranted.</p><p>3) Results of the non-human primates should be more thorough. Given the volume of interesting results, particularly in Table 2, spending more time probing and hypothesizing about individual changes is warranted. Analysis without interpretation and suggestion for future work leaves this section flat. There is some discussion of this here but given the support in the dataset, outlining some potential new specific hypotheses for how primate life history influences brain evolution would make this a much more powerful paper.</p><p>4) There are of course many different ways to characterize the &quot;size&quot; of the human brain: absolute, relative to body, relative to other brain part, relative to range size, relative to phylogeny, etc. As it stands the discussion seems to imply that our task is simply to select and apply the one correct way, but I suspect/hope the authors would agree that the most appropriate method depends on the question being asked. For example, many studies of comparative cognition suggest we should actually focus on absolute rather than relative brain size whereas the choice to control for body size or phylogeny is also related to certain assumptions and interests. These authors would be very well suited to provide a definitive discussion of this issue that would be a useful touchstone for the field, and would also more clearly articulate the specifically evolutionary (e.g. as opposed to functional) questions their method is optimized to address. Some of this is indirectly reflected in the discussion of the unexpected results for the chimpanzee sub-species and it would be nice to see a more comprehensive treatment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41250.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Analytical Revisions:</p><p>1) What was not addressed by the current study was the relevance to the Herculano-Houzel lab's analyses.

We constructed an alternative “hominin phylogeny” (new terminology for “grafted phylogeny”) from a different consensus tree given in Organ et al., (2011). We describe this in the subsection “Comparative data”:</p><p>“To ensure that our results in this set of analyses were not dependent upon the topology of the hominin phylogeny, we repeated them using an “alternate hominin phylogeny,” constructed in a similar manner using another hominin tree from [13].”</p><p>We give additional details of how the hominin and alternate hominin phylogenies were constructed in subsection “S1: Data compilation”.</p><p>We re-ran the bayou analyses of ECV relative to body mass and of raw ECV with this phylogeny (and updated hominin data including <italic>H. erectus</italic>, see below). In addition to generating these new results, we also recognized and corrected a problem that was likely the source of some confusing results in the prior manuscript version. Previously, we found that the two MCMC chains that we ran for unweighted predictor OU model in the analysis ECV with no predictor identified very different patterns of evolution and differed significantly in likelihood. We determined that the chain with the very high likelihood was inferring an unrealistic pattern of evolution with a stationary variance approaching zero and many shifts with low support. We found that several of the new chains that we generated also suffered from this problem. To remedy this, we ran up to 6 chains for each model in each analysis of ECV, discarded the chains displaying this pattern of inference, and then selected the two chains with the highest mean likelihood to analyze further. We added text to the subsection “S3: Problems with MCMC convergence in bayou” to describe this issue and our solution.</p><p>When we analyzed ECV relative to body mass, we found that the pattern of shifts towards larger ECV was evident in every OU model we fit, regardless of the phylogeny we used. However, we found that the Brownian model was favored when we used the hominin phylogeny and an OU model was favored when we used the alternate hominin phylogeny. However, regardless of which mode of evolution is assumed to provide the best model fit, our results support patterns of accelerating evolution, as this result was found in the bayou results, BayesModelS results, and when fitting PGLS models of brain size deviation. We added text to the Discussion section to clarify this:</p><p>“We accounted for some phylogenetic uncertainty by repeating our analyses with an alternate phylogeny. The use of different phylogenies influenced outcomes of some statistical tests, as the Brownian model favored when we used the hominin phylogeny and OU model was favored when we used the alternate hominin phylogeny. However, we found that all of the OU models we fit inferred the same pattern of evolution towards larger ECV along the human lineage. The results of our outlier tests and PGLS model fitting – which assume a Brownian mode of evolution – also detected this pattern on different phylogenies. Collectively, these results indicate that our findings are likely to be robust to variations in assumed evolutionary relationships, and potentially to assumptions about the mode of evolution.”</p><p>When we analyzed ECV with no predictor variable, we found that Brownian models were favored over the OU models for both the hominin and alternate hominin phylogenies. Previously, OU models were favored. However, this was likely due to the high likelihood of one of the chains run for the unweighted predictor OU mode that inferred an unrealistic pattern of evolution. Because the Brownian model was favored, we added a new BayesModels analyses of ECV (using the tree block and data for humans and neanderthals); this new analysis did not identify humans as positive outliers for ECV. We interpret this result as “indicating that without correcting for body mass, the variance in ECV across primates is great enough to prevent humans’ brains from being detected as exceptionally large” (Results section).</p><p>We re-ran the BayesModels analyses of ECV relative to body mass while excluding all hominin data with this alternative phylogeny. We found that our results did not change qualitatively, and that changes in our numerical results were very minor. We summarize these findings in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and Supplementary file 2.</p><p>Our results were also very similar when we fit PGLS models of brain size deviation (calculated in the new analysis) and divergence time, as we found evidence for directional and accelerating evolution towards larger brains since the <italic>Pan-</italic>hominin split. We summarize these results in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A. During our revisions, we determined that our description of these analyses could be improved, and that adding an additional PGLS model would make it easier for readers to interpret our results. We therefore added text in the Materials and methods section to provide a better description of the models we fit, and updated our findings, which were not qualitatively changed, in the Results section. We also decided that it is better to present the data alone in the figure. The model fits are very hard to interpret visually, as the scaling parameter δ changes the expected trait covariance among species in a way that is dependent upon the topology of the phylogeny. As an alternate means of displaying the accelerating trend identified by the model, we present Figure 3B showing the hominin tree would be transformed according to the best model, i.e. with longer branches indicating more change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would be very useful to include in the supplementary information a list of which specimens (museum numbers) of which fossil hominins went into the figure in each of the datasets. Sample sizes are so small for many of these, that a single cranium can make a big difference in this computation. The use and quality of different data sets has been a huge issue for this field, which has been bedeviled by small sample sizes, difficulties in dealing with intraspecific variation, and the use of estimated metrics (ECV, body mass) that may be derived in different ways esp. across fossil and extant species. Both ECV and body mass estimates are notoriously variable in hominin paleontology even for individual fossils, let alone in terms of a &quot;species norm&quot;. This is a general issue that really needs to be discussed for the whole data set, but I would point to one particular point of concern which would be the source of the Homo sapiens data. From which population or populations, fossil or modern, does this derive? Implications esp. for body size could potentially be a factor in the different modeling results for H.s. vs. Neanderthals, just as the authors point out that unique traits of Gorilla may be a &quot;byproduct&quot; of body size change rather than brain change.</p></disp-quote><p>We added two new tables. The first (Supplementary file 2) lists the values for hominin ECV and the sample size associated with each value. The second (Supplementary file 3) lists the value and source of each human whole-brain trait (ECV, brain volume). We also include a description of each value, and clarify that our value for human ECV (from Robson and Wood, 2008) comes from 66 fossil specimens collected across a wide geographic area, and our values for human brain volume come from measurements of modern human brains.</p><p>We describe in subsection “S1: Data Compilation” that museum numbers for the hominin fossils are given in Robson and Wood, (2008). Given that the sample sizes are quite large, we believe it is most appropriate to refer readers to the original publication rather than re-list the &gt;100 museum numbers in a table.</p><p>We also made added clarifications about our data and their sources in subsection “S1: Data Compilation”.</p><p>In the Discussion section, we added text discussing how data quality and intraspecific variation could affect our results. By using a data set of average hominin ECV/body mass, we avoid some of the statistical problems introduced by representing a species with a single fossil specimen. We also discuss how using an alternate phylogeny did not qualitatively change our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is not clear why only a single non-African species – H. neanderthalensis – was included in this analysis, when there are many examples of ECV for H. erectus and H. heidelbergensis. If it is to restrict the analysis to evolutionary trajectories that could feasibly have led to modern humans, that is acceptable – but the authors should explicitly explain these decisions.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not include <italic>H. heidelbergensis</italic> in our analyses because its phylogenetic position is unresolved. We added a description of this (including a citation to a relevant study) in subsection “S1: Data Compilation”:</p><p>We agree that we should account for <italic>H. erectus</italic> in our analyses. The hominin phylogenies from Organ et al., (2011) treat <italic>H. erectus</italic> and <italic>H. ergaster</italic> as the same species. Therefore, we decided to redo our analyses after replacing data for <italic>H. eragaster</italic> with data for <italic>H. erectus sensu lato,</italic> which was calculated from fossils attributed to both <italic>H. erectus</italic> and <italic>H. ergaster</italic>. We describe this in subsection “S1: Data Compilation”.</p><p>We also update our findings (Results section and Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3), which did not qualitatively change, for analyses of ECV.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Similarly, I do not understand why African H. heidelbergensis was not included in this analysis. Is this because its phylogenetic position is poorly-understood, and the authors were restricting themselves to African specimens where there is still debate over the number of Middle Pleistocene species of Homo? At the very least, this omission should be justified. It is a critical link between H. ergaster and H. sapiens.</p></disp-quote><p>As we state above, we did not include <italic>H. heidelbergensis</italic> because its phylogenetic position is not resolved, and was not included as a separate species by Organ et al., (2011, the source of our phylogeny).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion Revisions:</p><p>1) The current level of discussion of the results on medulla size evolution should be more explicit about their medulla analyses or just consider de-emphasizing these results. This is because predictions about why medulla volume might vary among primates is elusive. Either the authors should be more explicit about their medulla analyses or just consider de-emphasizing these results.</p></disp-quote><p>We added text in the Discussion section restating that previous analyses have found that medulla volume varies less between clades than the neocortical or cerebellar volume, and that our results were in line with these expectations.</p><p>We also clarified our expectations for medulla evolution in the Introduction.</p><p>We do believe that mentioning the medulla results is important because it further illustrates that brain components do not necessarily evolve in a linked manner, consistent with the mosaic theory of brain evolution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Endocranial volume (ECV)”: If the weak OU model provides a better fit and suggests that all primates experienced similar evolutionary trajectories, how does that mesh with the previous result that they show variation among taxa in evolutionary rate? More explanation and interpretation of this result seems warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>This discrepancy was due to the problems with the convergence of bayou models described above. After correcting this problem, we found that the Brownian motion provided a better fit, and the mismatch between results no longer exists.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Results of the non-human primates should be more thorough. Given the volume of interesting results, particularly in Table 2, spending more time probing and hypothesizing about individual changes is warranted. Analysis without interpretation and suggestion for future work leaves this section flat. There is some discussion of this here but given the support in the dataset, outlining some potential new specific hypotheses for how primate life history influences brain evolution would make this a much more powerful paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We agree that more discussion of the life history implications of our findings and future directions for testing specific hypotheses is warranted. Thus, we made extensive additions (Supplementary Materials) to discuss how our results for non-human primates broadly relate to primate life history. We also added some description of our finding that several non-human primates exhibit a reduction in the size of a brain component. We discuss this result in the context of previous research and make suggestions for future work. Finally, we elaborated on how future research could test more specific ecological hypotheses.</p><p>Although further analyses are needed to determine the causes and consequences of the changes we observed, these analyses are outside the scope of this paper. We hope these additions – including new citations – will help to motivate future research along these lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are of course many different ways to characterize the &quot;size&quot; of the human brain: absolute, relative to body, relative to other brain part, relative to range size, relative to phylogeny, etc. As it stands the discussion seems to imply that our task is simply to select and apply the one correct way, but I suspect/hope the authors would agree that the most appropriate method depends on the question being asked. For example, many studies of comparative cognition suggest we should actually focus on absolute rather than relative brain size whereas the choice to control for body size or phylogeny is also related to certain assumptions and interests. These authors would be very well suited to provide a definitive discussion of this issue that would be a useful touchstone for the field, and would also more clearly articulate the specifically evolutionary (e.g. as opposed to functional) questions their method is optimized to address. Some of this is indirectly reflected in the discussion of the unexpected results for the chimpanzee sub-species and it would be nice to see a more comprehensive treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a discussion of the interpretation of absolute brain volume vs. brain volume relative to body mass in the Introduction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
