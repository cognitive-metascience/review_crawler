Consequently, organisms have evolved mechanisms that allow them to measure time over 24 hours and prepare for the periodic changes between light and dark. These mechanisms, known as circadian clocks, alter the activity of some of the organism’s genes in a rhythmic way across the course of a day. This in turn causes certain behaviors and biological activities of the organism to follow a daily cycle.</p><p>The bacterium <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> needs to be able to track the daily cycle of light and dark because it performs photosynthesis and depends on sunlight to form sugars, which can later be broken down to release energy. The time information encoded in the circadian clock of <italic>S. elongatus</italic> is transmitted to the protein RpaA, which drives the regular circadian changes in gene activity in the cell. If RpaA is removed from the cell or prevented from working, <italic>S. elongatus</italic> can no longer control rhythmic gene activity and is unable to survive the night.</p><p>To better understand how the circadian system schedules biological tasks to help an organism to survive, Puszynska and O'Shea studied <italic>S. elongatus</italic> cells. This revealed that the bacteria normally prepare for darkness by storing sugars during the day and activating several genes at dusk to make enzymes that are required to break down stored sugars. This provides the cells with energy that they need to survive the night. But mutant cells that lack the gene that produces RpaA do not prepare for darkness; they do not accumulate a store of sugars during the day or activate the vital genes at dusk. They have low internal energy levels in the dark and they cannot survive long periods of darkness.</p><p>Providing the mutant cells with sugar and restoring the activity of the genes responsible for breaking down sugar enabled the cells to maintain energy in darkness and survive the night. It therefore appears that one role of the circadian system of <italic>S. elongatus</italic> is to coordinate building up sugar reserves during the day with breaking down sugar stores to generate energy during the night.</p><p>Puszynska and O'Shea also found many other genes that are not activated at dusk in the mutant cells. It will therefore be important to study whether other pathways that help cells to survive and grow are defective in these mutant cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23210.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23210.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC7942</kwd><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>fitness</kwd><kwd>cyanobacteria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Shea</surname><given-names>Erin K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The circadian clock of <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC7942 schedules the activity of the transcription factor RpaA, which controls key events in carbon metabolism that contribute to cell fitness in conditions mimicking the natural environment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Organisms across kingdoms of life have evolved circadian clocks to temporally align biological activities with the diurnal changes in the environment. In the cyanobacterium <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC7942, the core circadian oscillator is comprised of the KaiA, KaiB and KaiC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nishiwaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rust et al., 2007</xref>) that generate oscillations in the phosphorylation state of KaiC. Time information encoded in the phosphorylation state of KaiC is transmitted to the transcription factor RpaA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Taniguchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Markson et al., 2013</xref>) to generate circadian changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Markson et al., 2013</xref>). In continuous light, the expression of more than 60% of protein-coding genes in <italic>S. elongatus</italic> is regulated in a circadian manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vijayan et al., 2009</xref>) with two main phases of gene expression: genes peaking at subjective dawn or subjective dusk, where the term ‘subjective’ refers to an internal estimate of time in the absence of external cues. Deletion of <italic>rpaA</italic> disrupts these rhythms in mRNA abundance and arrests cells in a subjective dawn-like transcriptional state, rendering them unable to switch to a subjective dusk-like expression program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Markson et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>While it is clear that the circadian transcriptional program schedules timing of gene expression when the clock is free-running in the absence of changes in external light, it is unclear how circadian control of gene expression is used under more physiologically relevant conditions when light and dark periods alternate. Exposure to darkness restricts energy availability, creating unique metabolic demands in cyanobacteria which depend on sunlight for energy production through photosynthesis. Strikingly, the <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup></italic> strain exhibits defects in cell growth and viability in cyclic, but not in constant light environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takai et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting an important role for circadian regulation of gene expression in alternating light/dark cycles.</p><p>We find that both accumulation and utilization of the carbon reserves required for energy production during periods of darkness are defective in the <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup></italic> strain, and that correction of these defects restores viability. Our results provide insight into the role of the circadian output pathway in enhancing fitness of cyanobacteria through coordination of central carbon metabolism with the metabolic demands imposed by periodic changes in the external environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takai et al., 2006</xref>), in constant light wild type and the <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup></italic> cells grow at the same rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top panel); however, the <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup></italic> strain is not viable when cultured in alternating light/dark conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup></italic> strain rapidly loses viability when incubated in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that the defect is induced by darkness and not by repeated light-to-dark and dark-to-light transitions.

We examined the viability of the OX-D53E and OX-D53A strains, which lack both <italic>kaiBC</italic> and <italic>rpaA</italic> and contain a phosphomimetic form of RpaA expressed from an IPTG-inducible P<italic>trc</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Markson et al., 2013</xref>). In these strains RpaA phosphorylation is not controlled by either the clock activity or by any other potential input factor, isolating RpaA activity from its regulators. We observed that expression of the RpaA D53E phosphomimetic restores viability in light/dark conditions, while expression of the RpaA D53A variant does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We also compared growth of the <sub>c</sub>RpaA strain (subscript ‘c’ denotes constitutive, RpaA-independent expression; see Materials and methods) with the <sub>c</sub>RpaA D53A strain, each made using the ‘clock rescue’ background, in light/dark cycles. We found that while the control <sub>c</sub>RpaA strain grows under these conditions despite lower levels of RpaA driven by the constitutive promoter, the <sub>c</sub>RpaA D53A strain is inviable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). We conclude that the active DNA-binding form of RpaA is necessary and sufficient for cell viability during exposure to light/dark conditions.</p><p>We next analyzed the role of the core KaiABC clock in sustaining viability of cyanobacterial cells in light/dark conditions. Deletion of the <italic>kaiBC</italic> operon leads to only a minor viability defect in light/dark conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boyd et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and substantial RpaA phosphorylation levels were observed in the <italic>kaiBC<sup>-</sup></italic> strain at the subjective dawn (CT = 2 hr) and afternoon (CT = 9 hr) in constant light conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boyd et al., 2013</xref>). Since RpaA phosphorylation levels are regulated by the antagonistic activities of two clock-controlled histidine kinases, SasA and CikA, and complexes of KaiB and KaiC proteins activate the phosphatase activity of CikA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gutu and O'Shea, 2013</xref>), we hypothesized that RpaA would remain highly phosphorylated throughout the light/dark cycle in the <italic>kaiBC<sup>-</sup></italic> strain. In agreement with this prediction, when we analyzed RpaA phosphorylation in the <italic>kaiBC<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant we detected high levels of RpaA phosphorylation both in light and in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, the ability of the <italic>kaiBC<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant to survive alternating periods of light and dark likely stems from the high levels of phosphorylated RpaA in this strain. While the <italic>kaiBC</italic> operon is not essential for cell viability in light/dark cycles, specific KaiC phosphoforms, whose relative abundances vary during the circadian cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rust et al., 2007</xref>), may have different effects on RpaA phosphorylation and, consequently, affect the ability of cells to survive light/dark cycling conditions. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing cell viability and RpaA phosphorylation in strains expressing KaiC point mutants: KaiC-AA (KaiC S431A T432A), representing the unphosphorylated phosphoform of KaiC, and KaiC-EE (KaiC S431E T432E), representing the hyperphosphorylated KaiC variant. We used the P<italic>0050</italic> promoter, which releases KaiC and RpaA expression from circadian feedback, to ensure equal expression of KaiC variants as well as of RpaA between the phosphomimetic strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We observed that while the <sub>c</sub>KaiC-AA mutant is viable in light/dark conditions, the <sub>c</sub>KaiC-EE strain is not able to grow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Strikingly, the <sub>c</sub>KaiC-AA strain maintains high RpaA phosphorylation levels during the diurnal cycle, while RpaA is phosphorylated in the <sub>c</sub>KaiC-EE strain only at a low level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This ability to control RpaA phosphorylation and cell viability through perturbations in KaiC phosphorylation status underscores the primacy of this regulatory axis in the diurnal control of RpaA phosphorylation, and suggests that any hypothetical clock-independent environmental factors play a lesser role in regulating RpaA phosphorylation under the conditions we tested.</p><p>Circadian clocks and their output synchronize the metabolic activity of cells with diurnal fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tu and McKnight, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Green et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graf et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dodd et al., 2015</xref>). To understand if the observed viability defect stems from an inability of the <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup></italic> strain (which is arrested in a ‘dawn-like’ transcriptional state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Markson et al., 2013</xref>]) to meet the metabolic requirements of darkness, we assessed cellular energy charge in wild type and the <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup></italic> strain over time in constant light conditions and in light/dark cycles. Energy charge describes the relative levels of ATP, ADP and AMP in the intracellular adenine nucleotide pool, and is a tightly controlled parameter that reflects the global metabolic energy status of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkinson, 1968</xref>). In constant light, there was no difference in energy charge between wild type and the <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup></italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, top panel). Wild type cells subjected to darkness experience only a slight reduction in energy charge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, bottom panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

To maximize fitness, photosynthetic organisms need to accurately allocate resources by carrying out carbon assimilation during the day and utilizing stored carbohydrate reserves at night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Smith, 1983</xref>). Here we show that the phosphorylated form of the transcription factor RpaA, regulated by the circadian clock, is critical for the coordination of carbon anabolism and catabolism and thus cell viability in light/dark cycles. Deletion of <italic>rpaA</italic> prevents glycogen accumulation in light and renders cells unable to utilize existing glycogen at dusk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) – this leads to alterations in cellular energy charge and, as previously observed, to a severe reduction in fitness. It is yet to be determined whether RpaA is rewiring carbon metabolism solely through transcriptional control or through other mechanisms.</p><p>The mechanism underlying perturbed carbon accumulation in the <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup></italic> strain is unclear. The activities of glycogen synthesizing enzymes in the <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup></italic> strain are high in vitro, however they could be affected in vivo by the redox state of the cell or by metabolite levels. It is also possible that an RpaA-dependent transcript expressed in the afternoon is required to funnel assimilated carbon into glycogen synthesis. Alternatively, additional metabolic flux changes may occur in the <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup></italic> strain that prevent formation of glycogen stores. Finally, it is formally possible that the <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup></italic> cells perform a futile cycle, simultaneously synthesizing and breaking glycogen down. However, since the activity of the glycogen phosphorylase involved in glycogen degradation is low in the <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup></italic> strain, we find this scenario less likely.</p><p>Our data support a model in which anticipation of periodic dark-induced resource limitation is one essential role of the cyanobacterial circadian system. The output of the core oscillator, through regulation of RpaA activity, temporally coordinates metabolism to prepare cells for the metabolic demands of periods of darkness. Correct scheduling of central carbon metabolic activities allows cells to survive the night. Recently, Lambert et al. observed that the circadian clock orchestrates a trade-off between rapid cell growth in the morning and robustness to starvation in the afternoon, suggesting preparation for the night as a plausible role for the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lambert et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings are consistent with this model and provide novel mechanistic insight into circadian regulation of cyanobacterial energy metabolism. It remains to be investigated whether the circadian-driven preparation for darkness is a shared strategy employed by other photosynthetic organisms.</p><p>Further, our results suggest a molecular explanation for the observed selective advantage of circadian resonance. When the periods of the endogenous circadian system and periods of the environmental fluctuations are equal, organisms show a fitness advantage and outcompete mutants whose clocks have an altered periodicity in the same environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ouyang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Woelfle et al., 2004</xref>). The mechanistic basis for this observation has been lacking. Based on our findings, we expect that the fitness defects in the strains with core oscillator periods unequal to the period of environmental variation result from mistiming of RpaA activation. The resultant mistiming of accumulation and mobilization of glycogen stores with the onset of the nightfall would lead to a carbon deficit at night, and impact growth as in the <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant during dark periods. One role of the KaiABC clock in our model, therefore, is to correctly phase the activity of RpaA and downstream carbon metabolism with the external environment, maximizing fitness and growth.</p><p>Though we show that RpaA activity is crucial for regulation of key aspects of carbohydrate metabolism, we identify ~90 genes whose expression is abrogated at dusk and throughout darkness in the <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup></italic> strain and it is possible that additional physiological processes are defective in the absence of <italic>rpaA</italic>. Moreover, although our results indicate that the KaiABC clock is the main regulator of diurnal RpaA phosphorylation, other factors may influence the activity of RpaA or its regulon under fluctuating environmental conditions. RpaA is known to cooperate with RpaB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Espinosa et al., 2015</xref>), a transcription factor crucial for responses to high light conditions. CikA, the clock-controlled regulator of RpaA phosphorylation, has been proposed to directly sense redox state of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ivleva et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, additional RpaA regulators, LabA and CikB, have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Taniguchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyd et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, it is possible that in a rapidly changing environment RpaA integrates circadian cues with environmental inputs important for viability. It will be interesting to analyze how deletion of <italic>rpaA</italic> affects the ability of cells to respond to other environmental challenges that cyanobacteria routinely face.</p><p>Finally, our data together with a recent study by Diamond and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diamond et al., 2015</xref>) emphasize the role of the circadian output pathway in driving oscillations in metabolism. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that metabolic processes provide feedback to the circadian clock by regulating its resetting, indicating an important role of the fluctuating metabolic status of a cell in driving circadian oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rust et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pattanayak et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2015</xref>). Together, a complex bidirectional relationship between the circadian program and metabolism emerges in which the circadian system both controls and is controlled by the metabolic rhythms to set and tune cell physiology with the environmental cycles. This tight coupling between circadian machinery and metabolism is coming to light as a universal feature across kingdoms of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Green et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dodd et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cyanobacterial strains</title><p>Wild type <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC7942 was acquired from ATCC (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001672">SCR_001672</ext-link>) catalog no. 33912.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Naama Barkai (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Michael Laub, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.

Of the many genes and pathways that are circadian regulated, it has been unclear which are required for viability in conditions of cycling light and dark. These authors have now nicely pinpointed glycogen storage and carbon metabolism as a critical target. The reviewers and editor discussed the manuscript and have only a few issues that should be addressed in a revised version of the manuscript, summarized below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The presentation in the title and abstract focuses largely on clock regulation of metabolism and a general audience that skims the paper might come away with the impression that the study shows an essential function for the clock in LD cycles. The authors show that the transcription factor RpaA is essential in light-dark cycles and have carried out a thorough analysis of its essential role. But it is important to logically separate the essential need for phosphorylated RpaA from the clock control of RpaA phosphorylation.</p><p>There may well be other, clock-independent factors that influence RpaA activity or the RpaA regulon (e.g. direct redox sensing, a role for RpaB, the histidine kinase CikB recently described by the Golden lab), and it may be that the loss of these other inputs is more important for viability than the circadian clock per se. It is worth noting along these lines that <italic>kai</italic> gene mutants typically have much less severe phenotypes than <italic>rpaA</italic>-null.

It is worth noting along these lines that kai gene mutants typically have much less severe phenotypes than rpaA-null. Also, the original screen by Ashby &amp; Mullineaux identified rpaA (regulator of phycobilisome association) not through a defect in cycling conditions, but as a mutant with constitutively abnormal photosynthetic properties.

Based on the results of our new experiments, we propose that the phosphorylated species of RpaA is crucial for surviving light/dark cycles, and that main regulation of the phosphorylation state of RpaA in light/dark cycling conditions is clock-phosphorylation dependent. We conclude that any additional non-circadian pathways that may modulate RpaA activity (and, by extension, cell viability) do not play a significant role under these conditions. We first investigated which phosphorylated form of RpaA was important for surviving light/dark conditions and find that RpaA D53E, mimicking the phosphorylated state, is sufficient to rescue growth, whereas RpaA D53A that mimics the unphosphorylated state, is not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). While this result confirms the key role of RpaA phosphorylation for cell viability under light/dark conditions, it does not dissect the contributions of the core clock and the potential non-circadian factors to regulation of RpaA activity. To address this issue, we analyzed RpaA phosphorylation and cell viability in mutants expressing phosphomimetic variants of KaiC, KaiC-AA (KaiC S431A T432A) and KaiC-EE (KaiC S431E T432E), corresponding to the unphosphorylated and the hyperphosphorylated states of KaiC, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). We hypothesized that these KaiC variants would have different effects on the activity of the downstream histidine kinases, CikA and SasA and, hence, on RpaA phosphorylation. To ensure unperturbed expression of KaiC phosphomimetics, we replaced the <italic>kaiBC</italic> promoter with an RpaA-independent promoter. We observed that the <sub>c</sub>KaiC-AA strain (subscript “c” denoting constitutive, RpaA-independent expression), which exhibits an elevated RpaA phosphorylation level, is able to grow in light/dark conditions whereas the <sub>c</sub>KaiC-EE strain, in which RpaA phosphorylation is low, is inviable in these conditions. Assuming that the alternative factors influencing RpaA activity (direct redox sensing, RpaB, CikB) act independently of the clock and that their function is unaffected by point mutations in KaiC, this result suggests that regulation of RpaA phosphorylation state in diurnal conditions is dependent on the clock phosphorylation state.</p><p>While we propose that circadian control of RpaA activity fully accounts for the loss of fitness of the <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup></italic>strain in the light/dark conditions we studied, it is possible that alternative regulators of RpaA (direct redox sensing, RpaB, CikB) play a significant role in preserving cell viability under other conditions. For example, it is possible that in an environment in which light intensity fluctuates during the day, the hypothetical ability of RpaA to integrate environmental signals through the action of additional factors is key for cell fitness. We have added this point to our Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) Does the rpaA-dependent induction of key metabolic genes such as glgP and gap1 in the hours immediately following lights-off still occur in a clock-null strain? That is, is a signal from the clock needed to express metabolic genes at dusk?</italic> </p><p>We measured expression of the key metabolic genes in the <italic>kaiBC<sup>-</sup></italic>strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and we observe that they are expressed at a similar level in wild type cells and in the <italic>kaiBC<sup>-</sup></italic>strain. In the <italic>kaiBC<sup>-</sup></italic>strain, RpaA phosphorylation is maintained at a high level throughout the light/dark cycle allowing for expression of dusk-specific genes in this strain.</p><p>Interestingly, Hosokawa et al. demonstrated that expression profiles of a small subset of dark-induced genes are changed in the <italic>kaiBC<sup>-</sup></italic>strain compared to wild type during darkness (Hosokawa et al., 2011). These changes may be due to the fact that in the <italic>kaiBC<sup>-</sup></italic>strain RpaA phosphorylation state is kept at a constant level lacking diurnal dynamics, and is also somewhat lower than the maximum level of RpaA phosphorylation observed in wild type.</p><p><italic>3) Determine whether the phosphorylation status of RpaA changes during light-dark cycles in a kai-null mutant.</italic> </p><p>Complexes of KaiB and KaiC are required in vitro to stimulate the phosphatase activity of CikA (Gutu and O’Shea, 2013). Therefore, we expected that the <italic>kaiBC<sup>-</sup></italic>strain grown in light/dark conditions would maintain RpaA phosphorylation at an elevated level due to the loss of stimulation of CikA activity by KaiB-KaiC complexes. We performed Phos-tag westerns in the <italic>kaiBC<sup>-</sup></italic>strain and we indeed observed that RpaA phosphorylation remains high and constant throughout the light/dark cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The presence of high levels of phosphorylated RpaA in the <italic>kaiBC<sup>-</sup></italic> strain provides an explanation for this strain’s lack of a significant growth defect in light/dark conditions. This result and our observation that the phosphomimetic version of RpaA (RpaA D53E) can complement the viability defect of the <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup></italic>strain are consistent with the model that phosphorylated RpaA is the species of RpaA required to survive light/dark cycles.</p><p><italic>The mechanism by which RpaA regulates glycogen metabolism remains mysterious, because 1) levels and activities of glycogen-synthetic enzymes in rpaA- strains were commensurate to those in wild type cyanobacteria, and 2) in rpaA- strains with IPTG-inducible enzymes and the ability to import exogenous glucose, glycogen stores remained low even with high cellular energy charge. Perhaps rpaA<sup>-</sup> cells breakdown glycogen too rapidly? Ideally the authors would experimentally address this possibility and other alternatives that would provide a mechanistic understanding of the observations reported. At a minimum, the authors should discuss these alternatives in the paper.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and we have included it in our Discussion. While we agree that it is formally possible that the <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup></italic>cells perform a futile cycle synthesizing and degrading glycogen simultaneously, we think that this scenario is not likely given that the expression level and activity of glycogen phosphorylase required for glycogen breakdown are very low in the <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup></italic>strain. Additionally, we analyzed the expression of glycogen debranching enzymes present in <italic>S. elongatus (synpcc7942_0086</italic> and <italic>synpcc7942_1575</italic>) using our RNA-seq expression data, and we found that expression of each of them is lower in the <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup> </italic>‘clock rescue’ strain than in the control (data not shown). We propose that the ability to degrade glycogen is defective in the <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup></italic>strain.</p><p>Since glucose supplementation does not increase glycogen stores in wild type cells expressing GalP (we added the data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), we did not expect glucose treatment to increase glycogen synthesis in the <italic>rpaA<sup>-</sup></italic>strains with IPTG-inducible enzymes and the ability to import exogenous glucose. Instead, we believe that supplementation with glucose provides an external carbon source supplanting the need for formation of internal carbon stores in the form of glycogen.</p></body></sub-article></article>
