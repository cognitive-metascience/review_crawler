Inward movement is driven by the matrix-localized, Hsp70-based motor. The scaffold Tim44, interacting with the matrix face of the translocon, recruits other motor subunits and binds incoming presequence. The basis of these interactions and their functional relationships remains unclear. Using site-specific in vivo crosslinking and genetic approaches in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, we found that both domains of Tim44 interact with the major matrix-exposed loop of Tim23, with the C-terminal domain (CTD) binding Tim17 as well. Results of in vitro experiments showed that the N-terminal domain (NTD) is intrinsically disordered and binds presequence near a region important for interaction with Hsp70 and Tim23. Our data suggest a model in which the CTD serves primarily to anchor Tim44 to the translocon, whereas the NTD is a dynamic arm, interacting with multiple components to drive efficient translocation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23609.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23609.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>protein translocation</kwd><kwd>Hsp70</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM27870</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ting</surname><given-names>See-Yeun</given-names></name><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Nicholas L</given-names></name><name><surname>Schilke</surname><given-names>Brenda A</given-names></name><name><surname>Craig</surname><given-names>Elizabeth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Steenbock Predoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ting</surname><given-names>See-Yeun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The motor that drives preproteins into the mitochondrial matrix is coupled to the translocase by Tim44, a two-domain scaffold protein with an intrinsically disordered &quot;dynamic arm&quot; and a structurally stable anchoring domain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria are essential organelles necessary for a variety of critical metabolic functions. Since the vast majority of proteins in the mitochondria are encoded by nuclear DNA, efficient translocation of proteins from the cytoplasm is required for robust mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sickmann et al., 2003</xref>). Proteins destined for the matrix initially enter mitochondria via the TOM complex of the outer membrane, and are then translocated across the inner membrane into the matrix through the Tim17/23 translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Endo and Yamano, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>). Most matrix-bound proteins are synthesized as preproteins with a positively charged amino-terminal targeting sequence (presequence), which interacts sequentially with ‘receptor’ proteins in transit from the cytosol to the inner membrane translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bajaj et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lytovchenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marom et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shiota et al., 2011</xref>). Upon insertion of the presequence into the translocon, it is driven into the matrix by the membrane potential across the inner membrane. Translocation of the remainder of the preprotein requires action of the mitochondrial import motor, which resides on the matrix side of the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chacinska et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marom et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neupert, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schulz et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The Tim17/23 translocon is composed of two essential and related integral membrane proteins. Both Tim17 and Tim23 have four membrane-spanning helices and two hydrophilic loops facing the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 1996</xref>). In addition, Tim23 has an N-terminal domain in the intermembrane space (IMS) that interacts with presequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de la Cruz et al., 2010</xref>). The translocon maintains the potential across the inner membrane. Tim23 forms the protein-conducting pore itself, whereas Tim17 contributes to the structure and gating of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martinez-Caballero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ryan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Truscott et al., 2001</xref>). Upon interaction with a presequence, the channel opens to allow passage of the incoming polypeptide, driven by the membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Truscott et al., 2001</xref>). The driving force of the motor for translocation of the remainder of the protein is provided by the ATP-hydrolyzing 70 kDa heat shock protein (mtHsp70) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gambill et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kang et al., 1990</xref>). Like all Hsp70s, mtHsp70’s innate ATPase activity is weak and stimulated by a J-protein co-chaperone. This hydrolysis drives conformational changes in mtHsp70, serving to stabilize interaction with the translocating polypeptide. Pam18 (Tim14) is the J-protein co-chaperone that serves this function for the import motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">D'Silva et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Truscott et al., 2003</xref>). It is a transmembrane protein that interacts with Tim17 in the IMS and with Pam16 (Tim16) in the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chacinska et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schilke et al., 2012</xref>). Neither mtHsp70, Pam18 nor Pam16 directly interact with the translocon in the matrix. Rather, the essential peripheral inner membrane protein, Tim44, serves as a scaffold, bridging the translocon and other motor components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schiller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ting et al., 2014</xref>). The motor also contains the nonessential, transmembrane protein, Pam17, thought to be involved in early steps of the translocation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hutu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schiller, 2009</xref>). Pam17 does not interact with Tim44, but directly with matrix-exposed loop 1 of Tim17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ting et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Tim44 is a two-domain protein, consisting of the N-terminal (residues 43 to 209) and C- terminal (residues 210 to 431) domains, referred to as NTD and CTD, respectively, with the first 42 residues being the cleavable presequence. Structural information about the NTD is lacking. However, evidence indicates that it interacts with Tim23, mtHsp70 and Pam16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schilke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schiller et al., 2008</xref>). The function of the CTD is less clear. However, structural information is available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Handa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Josyula et al., 2006</xref>). The CTD is composed of both α-helices and β-strands, with the core forming an α+β barrel. Two N-terminal α-helices, suggested to be involved in membrane binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marom et al., 2009</xref>), protrude from the core. Although much progress has been made in understanding Tim44 function, large gaps remain. For example, although recent data indicates that the CTD interacts with Tim17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2015</xref>), the basis of the interaction and importance is unknown. Likewise, precursor proteins have been crosslinked to Tim44 <italic>in organellar</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blom et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gruhler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kanamori et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scherer et al., 1992</xref>) and presequence peptides to purified Tim44 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marom et al., 2011b</xref>), raising the possibility that Tim44 plays a regulatory role in transferring translocating polypeptides to mtHsp70, activating the motor. However, no information is available regarding where on Tim44 the presequence interaction occurs. Lack of such information impedes our understanding of the mechanism of this critical molecular machine. With a goal of overcoming these deficits, we utilized a variety of experimental approaches. We report three key findings regarding Tim44 function: the CTD specifically crosslinks to both Tim23 and Tim17; both the NTD and the CTD crosslink to the matrix exposed loop 1 of Tim23 in vivo; the NTD, which we found to be intrinsically disordered, but not the CTD, interacts with presequence. These new data allow presentation of a more comprehensive model of how the action of the translocon and import motor are coupled to drive import of proteins into the mitochondrial matrix.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23609.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Residue D345 in the CTD of Tim44 is important for cell viability and association of the import motor with the translocon.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of the CTD of Tim44; PDB entry 2FXT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Josyula et al., 2006</xref>). α-helices and β-strands are labeled.

Screening an error-prone PCR library of <italic>TIM44</italic>, we identified an aspartic acid to glycine alteration at position 345 that met these criteria. <italic>tim44<sub>D345G</sub></italic> grows poorly at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). D345 is surface exposed, located in the linker region between the first long β-strand (β1a) of the CTD’s antiparallel β-sheet and the adjacent, shorter β-strand (β1b). Alignment of Tim44 sequences from a wide range of eukaryotes revealed that the aspartic acid is conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>We further tested the functional importance of residue 345 by substituting alanine or lysine for aspartate. <italic>tim44<sub>D345A</sub></italic> had no obvious growth phenotype at 37°C. <italic>tim44<sub>D345K</sub></italic> had a significant growth defect even at 30°C, and did not form colonies at 37°C. All three Tim44 variants were expressed at a level similar to that of wild type (wt) protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To assess whether substitutions at position 345 caused a defect in mitochondrial protein import, accumulation of the precursor form of the mitochondrial matrix protein Hsp60 after transferring of cells to 37°C was monitored using immunoblotting analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Hsp60 precursor accumulation was observed in <italic>tim44<sub>D345G</sub></italic> and <italic>tim44<sub>D345K</sub></italic>, consistent with the observed growth defects. Import of precursor proteins into mitochondria isolated from wt and <italic>tim44<sub>D345K</sub></italic> cells was also tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Two radiolabeled precursors were used: cytochrome b<sub>2</sub>-(167)<sub>∆19</sub>-DHFR, a precursor protein composed of mouse DHFR fused to the N-terminal 167 amino acids of cytochrome b<sub>2</sub> with a deletion of 19 amino acids within the inner membrane sorting signal to ensure sorting to the matrix rather than the inner membrane and cytochrome c<sub>1</sub> which is sorted to the inner membrane through the Tim23 translocon in a motor-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hutu et al., 2008</xref>). While the accumulation of cleaved, protease-resistant cytochrome c<sub>1</sub> were very similar in the two types of mitochondria, <italic>tim44<sub>D345K</sub></italic> was severely defective in import of cytochrome b<sub>2</sub>-(167)<sub>∆19</sub>-DHFR compared to wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>To test whether alteration of D345 affected interaction of Tim44 and other components of the motor with the Tim17/23 translocon, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments using mitochondrial lysates and affinity-purified Tim23-specific antibody. As expected, the motor components, Tim44, Pam16 and Pam18, co-precipitated with Tim23 from wt lysates. However, these motor components, particularly Tim44, were reduced in co-precipitates from mitochondrial lysates of <italic>tim44<sub>D345G</sub></italic> and <italic>tim44<sub>D345K</sub></italic>, even though the amounts of Tim23 precipitated from the two extracts were similar.

Previous results demonstrated that the NTD is also important for association of Tim44 with the translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schiller et al., 2008</xref>) and can be crosslinked to Tim23 using the site-specific Bpa technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ting et al., 2014</xref>). The crosslinking of both the NTD and CTD of Tim44 to Tim23 raises the question as to the sites of interaction. Tim23 has two matrix-exposed loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), 24-residue loop 1 (residues 122 to 145) which can be crosslinked to Tim44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ting et al., 2014</xref>) and 7-residue loop 3 (residues 191 to 197). There are two obvious possibilities: (1) One Tim44 domain interacts with Tim23’s loop 1, the second with loop 3; (2) both domains interact with loop 1. We were not able to directly test whether loop 3 of Tim23 can crosslink to Tim44, because translation terminated at engineered stop codons in that loop, even when Bpa was present. As an alternative, we took advantage of the previous finding that cells expressing a C-terminal Tim23 truncation lacking TM3, loop 3, and TM4 segments (<italic>tim23<sub>Δ176-222</sub></italic>) are viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pareek et al., 2013</xref>). We reasoned that if both domains of Tim44 interact with loop 1 of Tim23, Bpa variants in either domain would likely crosslink to Tim23 in cells expressing only <italic>tim23<sub>Δ176-222</sub></italic>. However, if one domain interacted with loop 3, then no crosslink with that domain would occur. To carry out this test, we constructed strains expressing <italic>tim23<sub>Δ176-222</sub></italic> and a variant Tim44 containing Bpa in either the NTD (Tim44<sub>D165Bpa</sub>), which was previously found to crosslink to wt Tim23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ting et al., 2014</xref>), or CTD (Tim44<sub>A391Bpa</sub>).

Since lack of structural information hampers understanding of the NTD, we attempted to obtain crystals of Tim44<sub>43-209</sub> for X-ray analysis. We were unsuccessful. We considered whether the NTD might be disordered, as it was well known to be very susceptible to proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weiss et al., 1999</xref>).

The very limited chemical shift dispersion observed in the HSQC <sup>1</sup>H dimension indicated that the segment is primarily disordered.

That the CD spectrum showed a minimum signal close to 200 nm, yet some signal at 222 nm, also suggests that the NTD is disordered and that it has some fractional transient helical propensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23609.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Evidence that the NTD of Tim44 is intrinsically disordered.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Prediction of disorder by indicated disorder predictors.

The phenotypes of mutants encoding alterations on this face suggest that both interactions play a role in stabilizing overall interaction of Tim44 with the translocon. Such mutations resulted not only in accumulation of precursors, but also the destabilization of the interaction with the translocon. The more dramatic effect of mutations changing residues in the Tim23-interaction region suggests that this interaction may be more functionally important. Recently, interaction of the CTD of Tim44 with Tim17 was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2015</xref>). However, interaction with Tim23 was not observed. Perhaps, the Tim44 CTD-Tim23 interaction has a more stringent conformational requirement than the Tim44 CTD-Tim17 interaction, as assays were performed in lysates of mitochondria disrupted by detergent. The crosslinking approach used here was performed using intact cells, and thus allows assessment of protein-protein interactions under native conditions. While this manuscript was under review, a report was published indicating the interaction of Tim44 with Tim17 occurs via loop 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demishtein-Zohary et al., 2017</xref>), the smaller of the two matrix-exposed loops.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Complexity of Tim23-Tim44 interactions</title><p>The complexity of the interaction of Tim44 with Tim23 is evident from the results presented here. Not only do both domains crosslink to Tim23, our data strongly indicates that both interact with loop 1; a C-terminal truncation variant of Tim23 lacking transmembrane domains 3 and 4, and thus loop 3, crosslinked to Tim44 whether Tim44 had Bpa in the NTD or in the CTD. That alteration of residues at or near positions that crosslinked to Tim23 affects the stability of Tim44’s interaction with the translocon, suggests that both interaction sites are functionally important. This idea is also supported by the ability of the G173V alteration in the NTD to suppress the deleterious effects of a mutation altering the Tim23 interaction site in the CTD. However, the exact interplay amongst these interactions remains elusive. In part, this lack of clarity is due to the fact that the overall architecture of the translocon is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schulz et al., 2015</xref>) - neither the copy number of individual subunits, nor the exact positioning of their transmembrane domains relative to one another. There is consensus, however, that a translocon contains at least two molecules of Tim23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marom et al., 2011a</xref>). Thus, one Tim44 molecule could interact with loop 1 of two different Tim23 molecules simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Alternatively, both the NTD and CTD of a Tim44 molecule could interact with a single Tim23 molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). If so, the interactions would likely occur sequentially, as the 24-residue size of loop 1 makes simultaneous interaction unlikely due to steric constraints.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The multifunctional NTD of Tim44</title><p>Data presented here cements the idea that the NTD of Tim44 is a platform for protein-protein interactions, and further points to the region between residues 160 and 180 as a critical portion of the NTD. This segment was previously shown to be important for association of Tim44 with the translocon, and for recruiting mtHsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schiller et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, the apparent increase of interaction of the NTD with Tim23 in the suppressor strain having a substitution at position G173 underscores this idea. Here, we provide evidence that it also includes the presequence binding site, suggesting that this segment not only has tethering functions, but also serves as a regulatory center for import motor function. It should also be noted that Pam16, which forms a heterodimer with the J-protein cochaperone of mtHsp70, binds Tim44 at the extreme N-terminus of the NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schilke et al., 2012</xref>). That Tim44’s NTD is likely intrinsically disordered is also in line with the idea that this domain plays important regulatory functions. Intrinsic disorder is a common feature of hub proteins that serve as regulatory scaffolds. Often domains of such proteins not only gain structure when interacting with partners, but also undergo conformational changes upon interacting with different binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dyson and Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oldfield and Dunker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wright and Dyson, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Model of Tim44 action</title><p>How might the two domains of Tim44 work to coordinate activity of the import motor? We propose that Tim44 acts as a two-arm machine. One arm, the CTD, plays the major role in anchoring Tim44 to the translocase through interactions with both Tim17 and Tim23. The other, the NTD, is a dynamic arm. Although it also interacts with Tim23, this interaction plays a more regulatory role, with the NTD also interacting with Hsp70 and with Pam16, and thus indirectly with the J-protein co-chaperone Pam18, as well as presequence. Together the two domains control the inactive:active transition of the import motor. Key features of this working model include (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>): (1) In the absence of a translocating polypeptide, the conformation of the Tim44 NTD maintains the import motor in an inactive state. Upon entering the matrix, presequence binds the Tim44 NTD in a region also important for interaction of the NTD with both Tim23 and Hsp70. (2) Presequence association initiates a conformational change in the Tim44 NTD reorienting Pam18 relative to Hsp70 such that it can perform its co-chaperone function of stimulating Hsp70’s ATPase activity. (3) Hydrophobic residues of the presequence or adjacent regions of the preprotein interact, as a substrate, with Hsp70’s peptide binding cleft. This interaction, coupled with that of Pam18, synergistically stimulates hydrolysis of ATP bound to Hsp70, stabilizing its interaction with the translocating polypeptide. (4) The resulting conformational change of Hsp70 (i.e. from the ATP- to the ADP-state) also results in release from Tim44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2003</xref>). This release of Hsp70 from Tim44 permits binding of another ATP-bound Hsp70 molecule primed to interact with the incoming polypeptide chain, and thus further translocation into the matrix.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23609.017</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of Tim44 action during protein translocation.</title><p>As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, one Tim44 is drawn as interacting with one Tim23 molecule.

For example, as mentioned above, whether the NTD and CTD of a Tim44 molecule interact with one or two Tim23 molecules is not clear. Interaction with two Tim23 molecules is the ‘simplest’ scenario; however, the alternative, that is toggling back and forth of the NTD and CTD between loop 1 of a single Tim23 molecule is appealing. Such toggling could provide an additional point of regulation or allow a major conformational change in the NTD. Apropos of this, it was recently reported that the Tim44 CTD could be crosslinked to a protein trapped in the translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2015</xref>). The nature of such an interaction is not clear, as a nonspecific crosslinker was used and a substantial segment of the trapped polypeptide was present in the matrix. Nevertheless, such an interaction may help in maintaining the import motor in an active state during the entire translocation process. Also, it is possible that such toggling might control interactions of motor components, such as the proposed ‘refreshing’ of Pam18, at the translocon during the import process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schulz and Rehling, 2014</xref>). Indeed, many aspects of the complex import system have dual and overlapping mechanisms that ensure the efficiency and robustness of the critical biological process of protein import into the mitochondrial matrix.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, plasmids, and genetic techniques</title><p>All in vivo experiments were carried out in the W303 genetic background with derivatives of PJ53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">James et al., 1997</xref>). <italic>tim44-∆</italic>, <italic>tim23-∆</italic>, and <italic>tim17-∆</italic> haploids were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schilke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schiller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ting et al., 2014</xref>).

Spectra were corrected by subtraction of a buffer baseline and converted into molar ellipticity using a mean residue weight of 118 (degree.cm<sup>2</sup>/dmol of residues). Smoothing spline model was used to fit the raw CD data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wood and Jennings, 1979</xref>). Similar spectra were obtained from two independent protein preparations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Miscellaneous</title><p>All chemicals, unless noted otherwise, came from Sigma.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Agnieszka Chacinska (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The import of presequence-carrying proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix is a process essential for eukaryotic life that is mediated by the TIM23 complex and its associated import motor. The study focuses on dissection of the mitochondrial protein translocase TIM23 architecture and dynamics. The conserved Tim44 protein is known as a central adapter component required for the cooperation between the transmembrane channel formed by Tim23 and the driving-force-generating matrix Hsp70 of the motor. In this work, Ting et al. present a detailed analysis of the interaction surfaces between Tim44 and the membrane-embedded core of the translocase using site-specific cross-linkers incorporated into Tim23, Tim17 or Tim44 in vivo. This detailed surface mapping together with the identification of the proposed presequence binding site in Tim44 considerably improves our understanding of preprotein import into mitochondria. The most important observations are: i) the Tim44 C-terminal domain binds both core components of the translocase, Tim17 and Tim23, and ii) binding to Tim23 is also mediated by the N-terminal domain of Tim44, which is intrinsically disordered.</p><p>The reviewers perceived the study as well presented and elegant. Furthermore, they appreciated its importance to progress the field. However, they agreed that several questions remain open. Addressing experimentally the points below is necessary to further advance the understanding of the mechanisms of the Tim44-mediated precursor translocation.</p><p>1) The authors should provide data allowing conclusions concerning translocase dynamics upon substrate binding. Do the interactions/crosslinking of Tim44 with Tim23 or Tim17 change by the presence of presequence peptides? And/or does the interaction mapping of Tim44 change during the mtHsp70 reaction cycle? These questions can be addressed in the assay with chemically synthesized peptides or under different nucleotide triphosphate conditions. An additional experimental set-up to consider: in vitro import of large amount of precursors into BPA containing mitochondria and crosslinking.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; The purified recombinant NTD did not show any indication of folded structures in its NMR or CD spectra. However, this does not mean that NTD is unfolded in intact mitochondria. There are lots of examples that recombinant proteins expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells cannot take correctly folded structures. Therefore the interpretation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, &quot; the Tim44 NTD is intrinsically disordered&quot;, should be more softened or substantiated by additional evidence. The model presented in this manuscript implies that Tim44 NTD undergoes substantial conformational rearrangements upon presequence binding. The authors should take the opportunity to test this idea in their established assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) using the pHsp60 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) to experimentally support their model.</p><p>3) Earlier studies have shown that alterations of Tim44 can influence the overall conformation of the TIM23 complex (for example recently in Banerjee et al. 2015, <italic>eLife</italic>). The Tim23 and Tim44 steady state protein levels and pHsp60 accumulation experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> are very general indicators. It is important to analyse critical mutants via in vitro import experiments, if the observed defects are caused by motor coupling to TIM23 or by a general defect of the import channel. This can be done by comparing the import behavior of well-established motor-dependent and -independent preproteins in vitro. Alternatively, the authors could confirm that the TIM23 core complex is not altered in the above mentioned mutants. The sentence in the Discussion tells that the interaction with Tim23 is functionally more important than Tim17, but it is unclear what is the data source for this statement. More thorough characteristic of the selected mutants in terms of import and translocase integrity should provide the answer.</p><p>4) The suppression of Tim44-C Tim23 binding by the mutation in the N-terminal domain should be further developed by demonstrating this phenomenon at the level of translocase integrity and in vitro import experiments. How does the suppressor mutation really work: by strengthening the binding of Tim44 to Tim23, or maybe to Tim17? Addressing this point would add to Tim44 dynamics and its possible mechanistic implications. Interestingly the suppressor mutation exactly maps to the region of presequence binding. The suppression may therefore also be caused by altered (enhanced?) presequence interaction of Tim44. It would be very interesting to also consider this possibility.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23609.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] The reviewers perceived the study as well presented and elegant.

We did not see dramatic effects. This could be for several reasons. Of course, our working model that a conformational change of Tim44 and/or its interacting partners occurs upon presequence binding could be wrong. But there are other possibilities, as well, for why we did not see changes. For example, in the case of the import assays, a low efficiency of translocon loading would make changes difficult to detect; and although we think we had substantial loading, accurate calculation of this is difficult. We think that this question requires a more systematic comprehensive approach, using many more Bpa variants than we have in hand at this point. It would be also important to test positions that show very little crosslinking (or even negative) in in vivo crosslinking assays, as well as those that are positive. This is a long-term project.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; The purified recombinant NTD did not show any indication of folded structures in its NMR or CD spectra.

We have added a phrase to the Discussion to try to better emphasize this point. In addition, we have changed the Abstract to clearly indicate that both the presequence binding and characterization of the NTD are the results of experiments done in vitro. Also, the title of the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, which contains the NMR and CD analysis, has been changed from “The Tim44 NTD is intrinsically disordered…” to “Evidence that Tim44 NTD is intrinsically disordered…”, which matches the title of that section in the Results.</p><p>A couple of years ago we did obtain spectra of the NTD after addition of presequence peptide. We didn’t see a dramatic change. We actually weren’t surprised, as other interacting partners (i.e. Pam16, Hsp70 and Tim23) were not present. We did not continue this direction because of the difficulty in obtaining all the purified components, particularly in the large amounts needed for NMR experiments.</p><p><italic>3) Earlier studies have shown that alterations of Tim44 can influence the overall conformation of the TIM23 complex (for example recently in Banerjee et al. 2015, eLife).

[2008] MBoC 19:2642): cytb<sub>2</sub>-(167)<sub>∆19</sub>-DHFR and cytochrome c<sub>1</sub>, destined for the matrix and inner membrane, respectively. Both mutants were very defective in import of cyb<sub>2</sub>-(167)<sub>∆19</sub>-DHFR, but not cytochrome c<sub>1.</sub> This data has been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>.</p><p>The sentence in the Discussion “The more dramatic effect of mutations changing residues in the Tim23-interaction region suggests that this interaction may be more functionally important” was based on the comparative growth defects of the double alanine substitutions, that is D345A in combination with each of the other 5 conserved charged residues, individually, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Of these, the D345A/E303A double mutant was by far the most compromised, barely forming colonies at 23 °C. D345A/E295A and D345A/E350A were compromised at 37 °C, but not 30 °C. Residue E303 is in close proximity to the Tim23 crosslinking patch shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. In the case of the weaker genetic interactions – residues E350 and E295 are in close proximity to the Tim17 patch. We have also constructed charge reversal mutations for each of the 5 conserved charge residues. Only the E303K change showed a phenotype. It grew as poorly as D345K. This result was not shown in the original submission. We have now included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) The suppression of Tim44-C Tim23 binding by the mutation in the N-terminal domain should be further developed by demonstrating this phenomenon at the level of translocase integrity and</italic> in vitro <italic>import experiments.

The suppression may therefore also be caused by altered (enhanced?) presequence interaction of Tim44. It would be very interesting to also consider this possibility.</italic></p><p>We have extended the analysis of the G173V suppressor in two ways. First we tested the effect of the suppressor on import of cyb<sub>2</sub>-(167)<sub>∆19</sub>-DHFR into mitochondria from cells having the double G173V/D345K substitution in Tim44 (D345K on its own causes a severe defect; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). As is the case of the severe growth defect at 30 °C, the G173V substitution overcomes the severe <italic>in organellar</italic> import defect. This result is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>.</p><p>We also carried out an additional experiment using Bpa crosslinking to see if we could detect a difference in crosslinking upon suppression. To do this we combined two CTD substitutions (D345A/E350A) that result in a 37 °C ts phenotype that is suppressed by G173V. We then created amber stop codons to allow Bpa incorporation at 3 sites (D165, crosslink site of Tim44 NTD with Tim23; A391, crosslink site of Tim44 CTD with Tim23; S271, crosslink site of Tim44 CTD with Tim17). We found that the Tim44 NTD-Tim23 crosslinking was higher in the presence of G173V, while the Tim44 CTD (i.e. Tim23 and Tim17) crosslinks were not significantly changed. This result is consistent with the suppressor mutation resulting in increased interaction with the Tim44 NTD. Although, much additional work will be required to firmly establish the mode of action of the suppressor. These results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, F</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
