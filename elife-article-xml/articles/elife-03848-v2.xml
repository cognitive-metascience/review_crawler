Understanding where these cells come from and how these different cells develop from a single cell in an embryo could help to guide regenerative therapies, where tissues grown in the laboratory are used to repair damage that the body cannot repair itself.</p><p>The existence of a single heart progenitor cell that can produce all of the heart's structures has long been predicted, but has so far escaped discovery. Currently, it is known that two distinct sets of heart precursor cells exist in mammals, which each produce cells for different parts of the heart. Work performed in mouse embryos has hinted that both sets of cells develop from cells that produce a protein called Mesp1. This protein controls when many genes—including those involved in heart development—are activated.</p><p>Devine et al. marked a small number of Mesp1-producing cells and followed the fate of these cells through development to see where their descendants would end up within the embryo—and specifically within the mature heart. Labeling occurred at a very early stage of development, called gastrulation, when the embryonic cells first begin to organize themselves into three tissue layers that will go on to form all the different parts of the organism. Devine et al. found that shortly after gastrulation begins, heart precursor cells are present and are already assigned to particular regions of the heart. This means that if there is a single pool of heart precursor cells, it specializes into different populations very early in the development of an embryo.</p><p>Devine et al. show that during gastrulation, heart precursor cells are already split into two distinct populations: one containing the cells that go on to form the atria and left ventricle of the heart; the other consisting of the cells that will make up the right ventricle and the ‘outflow tract’ that will eventually form the great vessels leading into and out of the heart. These two populations are separated by a boundary, which Devine et al. suggest is established very early on, and will go on to form the septum that separates the left and right ventricles in the developed heart. As defects in the septum are the source of many congenital heart defects, a better understanding of the heart cell precursor populations and how they interact could help develop treatments for these conditions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03848.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03848.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>heart</kwd><kwd>embryo</kwd><kwd>mesoderm</kwd><kwd>lineage</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL114948</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bruneau</surname><given-names>Benoit G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Bench to Bassinet Program U01HL098179</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bruneau</surname><given-names>Benoit G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Established Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bruneau</surname><given-names>Benoit G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Clinical Scholar TG2-01160</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Devine</surname><given-names>W Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scientist Development Grant 12SDG12060353</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wythe</surname><given-names>Joshua D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000097</institution-id><institution>National Center for Research Resources</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C06 RR018928, to the J.

Understanding the identity and regulation of these progenitors is critical to understanding the origins of congenital heart defects and may lead to novel cell-based regenerative therapies for heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruneau, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xin et al., 2013</xref>). The existence of an early and specific multipotent progenitor for all anatomic and cellular components of the heart has been predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parameswaran and Tam 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tam et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meilhac et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kinder et al., 2001</xref>), but the identity of this progenitor and when it arises in embryonic development has remained undefined. At least two sets of molecularly and morphologically distinct cardiac precursors have been identified in the mammalian embryo, referred to as the first and second heart fields; these populations contribute to distinct anatomical structures within the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckingham et al., 2005</xref>). Separation of the left and right ventricles is dependent on a single structure, the interventricular septum (IVS) and it has been postulated that the IVS myocardium has a dual contribution from these two heart fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruneau et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Takeuchi et al., 2003</xref>). The existence of these two cardiac progenitor ‘fields’ raises the question of when cardiac precursors are allocated to these populations and their contributions to mature structures in the heart, such as the IVS.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that a population of early mesoderm expressing the transcription factor Mesp1 precedes the establishment of the anatomically and molecularly distinct ‘heart fields’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saga et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bondue et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lindsley et al., 2008</xref>) that ultimately will differentially populate the great vessels, RV and atria or the LV and atria. However it is clear that <italic>Mesp1</italic>+ cells can also contribute to a broad range of mesodermal derivatives that include, but are not restricted to, the developing heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoshida et al., 2008</xref>). A population of mesoderm labeled by <italic>Eomesodermin</italic> has also been shown to contribute to the developing heart, but again these cells have broad contributions in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold and Robertson, 2009</xref>). Retrospective lineage analysis supports the distinct origins of segments of the heart from individual precursor pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meilhac et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckingham et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meilhac et al., 2004b</xref>), but several questions remain regarding the timing and molecular progression of cardiac specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meilhac et al., 2004b</xref>). For example, do early mesodermal cells become ‘locked into’ a cardiac fate early on and when do they become ‘assigned’ to an anatomical location? Is there a multipotent, specified cardiac progenitor that anticipates the currently understood heart fields?</p><p>Here we show that early cardiac progenitors are assigned to a specific developmental path prior to or shortly after the initiation of gastrulation. We identify a population of specified cardiac precursors arising from these mesodermal progenitors that express the chromatin remodeling factor <italic>Smarcd3</italic> prior to the onset of expression of known cardiac progenitor markers (<italic>Nkx2-5</italic>, <italic>Isl1</italic>, and <italic>Tbx5)</italic>. Clonal labeling of early cardiac precursors highlights the heterogeneity among Mesp1+ progenitors, including the existence of precursors that are restricted in their anatomical contribution, especially to distinct ventricular chambers. Finally, inducible genetic marking of early <italic>Tbx5</italic>+ and <italic>Mef2c</italic>-<italic>AHF</italic> + populations highlights this early segregation of cardiac progenitors and suggests that the compartment boundary that exists between the right and left ventricles arises from an early clonal boundary, prior to the onset of septum morphogenesis. Overall our findings delineate the progression and molecular identity of cardiac precursors in the early mouse embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In reassessing the in vivo differentiation potential of Mesp1+ cells, we find that this population contributes broadly to several mesodermal derivatives, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), consistent with other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoshida et al., 2008</xref>). We reasoned that among this diverse mesodermal population, a more specific population destined for the cardiac lineage exists. To test this model, we performed in vivo clonal analysis by generating mosaic mice in which very few <italic>Mesp1</italic>+ cells were labeled at isolated clonal density via the mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hippenmeyer et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). This approach is particularly advantageous because labeling events are rare, labeling is permanent, and one can identify labeled daughter cells (twin spots) based on color (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We analyzed in fetuses (E12.5-E14.5) the anatomic distribution and cellular constituents of clones induced by <italic>Mesp1</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup> (which is active in mesoderm from ∼E6.0 to E7.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saga et al., 1999</xref>). While we did not use a conditional Cre allele to control the timing of Cre activity, we confirmed the timing of <italic>Cre</italic> expression by in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). By the late head fold stage (LHF), we see a downregulation of <italic>Cre</italic> mRNA and localization to the base of the allantois. We see no expression in the area of forming cardiogenic mesoderm. In addition, we counted the number of labeling events in embryos at E8.5 and E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–E</xref> and Statistical Analysis) and saw no change in the distribution of labeled clusters, suggesting that no additional recombination events have occurred over this time interval. Finally, a complementary lineage labeling approach using a <italic>Mesp1-rtTA</italic> transgenic allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lescroart et al., 2014</xref>) defines a functional window of Mesp1 activity based on the timing of doxycycline administration between E6.25-E7.5, again supporting the narrow timing of <italic>Mesp1</italic> activity.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03848.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The first and second heart fields diverge early in gastrulating mesoderm.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genetic lineage tracing of <italic>Mesp1</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup>;ROSA<sup>R26R</sup> mice reveals widespread labeling of mesodermal derivatives at E10.5, including forelimb (dotted outline).

In contrast to previous retrospective clonal analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meilhac et al., 2004b</xref>), we did not observe twin spots that populated anatomic structures classically thought to derive from first and second heart field progenitors, for example spanning the left and right ventricles, or contributing to the left ventricle and outflow tract. Rather, we saw twin spots that populated discreet anatomic locations including the left ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>), right ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>), outflow tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N–O</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E–F</xref>), atria-left ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L–M</xref>), and interventricular septum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Notably absent from our clonal analysis were twin spots that spanned the right and left ventricles. Based on the total number of clonal observations made (n = 96), the probability that a common progenitor for the left and right ventricles does not exist, assuming a binomial distribution (success, or 1, = the progenitor is observed; failure, or 0 = the progenitor is not observed), can be calculated using Jeffreys interval. The upper and lower limits of a 95% confidence interval was calculated such that the upper limit is 0.019 (See Statistical Methods). Thus, we can be quite confident given the number of observations made that such a common progenitor does not exist within the <italic>Mesp1</italic>+ population. An explanation for the discrepancy between our <italic>Mesp1</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup>-MADM clonal analysis and prior retrospective clonal analyses lies with the timing of the labeling events. <italic>Mesp1</italic> is transiently expressed ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saga et al., 1999</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), thus all of our clones are induced over a narrow window of time during gastrulation. The retrospective clonal analysis employed a cardiomyocyte-specific promoter, so an early labeling event (in the epiblast for example) that would contribute broadly throughout the embryo would only be visualized in the heart, giving the impression of a specific common progenitor cell. Indeed, when we perform MADM clonal analysis using the epiblast-specific Cre line <italic>Sox2::Cre</italic>, we see many clones in the embryos, including large, dispersed clones throughout the looping heart tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) that could be interpreted as a labeling event in a single, common cardiac progenitor. We cannot definitively conclude, however, that these labeled cells within the heart are all clonally related because of the large number of labeling events outside of the heart. In summary, our results suggest that soon after a heart field progenitor is specified, shortly after the initiation of gastrulation, the anatomic destiny of daughter cells quickly diverge, especially those destined to occupy /contribute to the left or right ventricle, and these fates remain fixed.</p><p>In analyzing the cellular composition of <italic>Mesp1</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup>-MADM clones, we noticed that while most twin spots give rise to homogenous cellular progeny (cardiomyocytes or endothelial cells), individual cardiac progenitors (&lt;5%, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) can contribute to multiple cell types, for example myocardium and endocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3J–L</xref>), or endothelium and smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>). While a multipotent progenitor had been predicted from in vitro ES cell-based differentiation models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moretti et al., 2006</xref>) this is the first evidence of the existence of such a multipotent progenitor in vivo.</p><p>The existence of a dedicated population of cardiac progenitors within gastrulating mesoderm suggests that these cells may have a unique molecular signature. To define the order and timing of early cardiac gene expression in vivo, we examined by in situ hybridization and by <italic>ß-galactosidase</italic> reporter activity early markers of cardiac differentiation (<italic>Mef2c, Tbx5, Isl1, Mesp1, and Smarcd3</italic>) at the late streak (LS) and early head fold (EHF) stages. We find that <italic>Smarcd3</italic> expression precedes <italic>Isl1</italic> and <italic>Tbx5</italic> in a domain that lies at the anterior-proximal region of the embryo and extends into the extraembryonic tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D–E</xref>). This expression domain appears coincident temporally but non-overlapping with <italic>Mesp1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), but is within the <italic>Mesp1</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup><italic>-</italic>derived lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O–P</xref>). Activity of the <italic>Mef2cAHF</italic> enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Verzi et al., 2005</xref>) is also detected at the LS stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) prior to the expression of <italic>Tbx5</italic> and <italic>Isl1</italic>. Previous studies have shown that activity of this enhancer is dependent on <italic>Isl1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dodou et al., 2004</xref>). In order to confirm an absence of <italic>Isl1</italic> expression at the LS stage, we used a reporter allele where a nuclear lacZ (<italic>Isl1</italic><sup><italic>nLacZ</italic></sup>) has replaced a short segment of the coding sequence, including the endogenous start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2007</xref>). While there was robust <italic>ß-galactosidase</italic> reporter activity at the cardiac crescent stage, no detectable staining was seen in LS stage embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>), suggesting that initiation of <italic>Mef2cAHF</italic> enhancer expression precedes <italic>Isl1</italic> expression and its initiation may be independent of <italic>Isl1</italic>. Several hours later (EHF stage), weak <italic>Isl1</italic> and <italic>Tbx5</italic> expression is detectable, <italic>Mef2cAHF</italic> activity remains, and <italic>Smarcd3</italic> expression restricts to the embryo proper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–J</xref>). The VEGF-A receptor Flk1 labels multipotent progenitors that can differentiate into hematopoietic, endothelial, smooth muscle and cardiac lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishitobi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kattman et al., 2006</xref>), thus we looked at co-localization of <italic>Mesp1</italic>, Flk1, and <italic>Smarcd3</italic> in late streak embryos.

Lineage labeling of <italic>Smarcd3-</italic>F1CreERT2; <italic>Rosa</italic><sup><italic>R26R</italic></sup> at E5.5 and observation at E10.5 marked cells that contribute predominantly to the heart and anterior forelimb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>), with scattered cells in the trunk and cranial mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and data not shown); observation at earlier time points revealed significant labeling in extraembryonic tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Within the heart, labeled cells contribute to cardiomyocyte, endocardial, and pericardial layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Labeling one day earlier (E4.5) marks a similar distribution of cells but with reduced labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>). Earlier induction (E3.5) and non-injected animals have minimal to no detectable labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2G–K</xref> and data not shown). Given the restricted expression pattern of the <italic>Smarcd-</italic>F6 enhancer, we hypothesized that marking these cells early on would label a more restricted population of cells later in the embryo. Indeed, lineage tracing with <italic>Smarcd3-</italic>F6CreERT2 labeled a much smaller number of more spatially defined cells, including the heart and a small group of cells in the anterior forelimb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>).

The shape and distribution of the labeled patches is reminiscent of previous work describing the oriented clonal cell growth throughout the myocardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meilhac et al., 2004a</xref>). In order to confirm the clonal nature of these patches induced with our <italic>Smarcd3</italic>-F1CreERT2 allele, we attempted to perform MADM analysis with this particular allele. Unfortunately, the recombination frequency was too low to identify any clones in several litters of embryos and we proceeded with using the <italic>Rosa</italic><sup><italic>Confetti</italic></sup> multicolor reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Snippert et al., 2010</xref>).

As a result, <italic>Mesp1</italic> and <italic>Smarcd3</italic> mRNA are largely non-overlapping, temporally. We isolated total RNA from three biological replicates of sorted cells shortly after the initiation of reporter activity at the mesoderm stage (D4.75) and compared the gene expression profiles of GFP + to GFP- cells by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). GFP + cells expressed genes associated with early cardiovascular progenitors (e.g. <italic>Hand2, Gata4, and Meis1</italic>), while GFP- cells expressed genes associated with hematopoietic and other lineages. Among the GFP + population, we attempted to identify markers that were unique to either cardiomyocyte or endocardial progenitors. While cell type-specific markers for differentiated cells are well documented (eg. contractile proteins for cardiomyocytes vs <italic>Nfatc1</italic> for endocardial cells) such markers are less well defined at the early stages when we are isolating mRNA. In addition, our differentiation protocol pushes cells towards a cardiomyocyte fate, thus we may not expect to see any endocardial cell markers.

To determine if and when this boundary between the right ventricle and left ventricle is established, we performed temporally regulated genetic fate-mapping to mark early cardiac progenitors and followed their contribution later in the mature IVS. In order to mark cells that would contribute to the right ventricle, we used the <italic>Mef2c-AHF</italic> enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Verzi et al., 2005</xref>) to drive expression of a fusion of the Dre recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anastassiadis et al., 2009</xref>) to the tamoxifen inducible ERT2 protein (<italic>Mef2cAHF</italic><sup><italic>DreERT2</italic></sup>).

Retrospective lineage tracing using a cardiac marker suggested the existence of a precursor that could contribute to all chambers of the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meilhac et al., 2004b</xref>). Our results, and those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lescroart et al. (2014)</xref>, suggest that such a precursor could only exist prior to gastrulation, likely in the epiblast or shortly thereafter, and that early mesoderm is rapidly patterned such that specific cells are shunted towards a unique path that assigns them to a specific cardiac compartment. Whether these mesodermal cells retain plasticity and could adopt different fates if transplanted elsewhere in the embryo is not clear. We also cannot at this point distinguish between a scenario where <italic>Mesp1</italic>+ cells are pre-patterned or the gradual restriction of <italic>Mesp1</italic>+ cells to different lineage fates during gastrulation in response to signaling cues. Understanding which molecular cues induce the emergence and patterning of this population of early cardiac precursors will be of considerable interest, particularly in the context of regenerative cell therapy, and especially given the apparent heterogeneity of early cardiac progenitors.</p><p>The <italic>Smarcd3</italic>-expressing cardiac precursor population is already specified into separate populations that will contribute to the left ventricle and atria, as marked by <italic>Tbx5</italic>, and the right ventricle and outflow tract, as labeled by the <italic>Mef2cAHF</italic> enhancer. These results are consistent with genetic tracing of cardiac precursors expressing <italic>Hcn4</italic>, which contribute to the left ventricle and conduction system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Später et al., 2013</xref>), and we additionally show, at both a population and single cell level, that both left and right ventricular progenitors are independently established early in development and are separated by a compartment boundary. This compartment boundary is derived from a unique population of early progenitors that express <italic>Tbx5</italic> as well as a subpopulation of cells co-expressing the <italic>Mef2cAHF</italic> enhancer, suggesting that a relatively small number of cells may be important in establishing and/or maintaining this border between the left and right ventricles. Understanding the molecular and cellular basis of this compartment boundary, and its importance in ventricular septation, will be of great relevance to congenital heart defects. This knowledge will also be relevant for disease modeling from stem cells, or for regenerative strategies, since knowing whether a progenitor cell is committed to become a right ventricular cardiomyocyte vs an atrial cardiomyocyte, for example, could be critical depending upon the anatomic or cellular defect one is attempting to correct.</p><p>In organisms with a simpler heart, such as zebrafish or <italic>Ciona</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stolfi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tolkin and Christiaen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stainier et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keegan et al., 2004</xref>), there is also a very early specification of cardiac precursors. Indeed, fate mapping in the chick embryo suggests distinct origins of the outflow tract vs the remainder of the heart, but does not indicate a compartmentalization of left and right ventricular progenitors, nor what molecular identity early cardiac precursors adopt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Camp et al., 2012</xref>). Our data suggest that the mouse embryo, despite the complexity of its developing heart, has a very early patterning and allocation of mesodermal cells to specific cardiac fates and anatomical derivatives. In addition, it has been hypothesized that simpler organisms have integrated cardiac and pharyngeal mesoderm into a single lineage, the so-called cardiopharyngeal mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stolfi et al., 2010</xref>). Retrospective clonal analysis in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lescroart et al., 2010</xref>) suggests a conservation of shared cardiac and pharyngeal lineages; caveats applicable to chamber-specific lineage allocation, including the timing of clone induction and the promoter used to visualize clones, remain. Lescroart and colleagues more recently reported rare instances of <italic>Mesp1</italic>+ clones co-labeling head muscles and the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lescroart et al., 2014</xref>). In our lineage labeling experiments, using the MADM system, we do not see convincing evidence for a common heart and head muscle progenitor. Additionally, <italic>Smarcd3</italic>+ precursors contribute to heart but not facial muscle. While our collective data do not support a common precursor for heart and facial muscle, we cannot definitively rule out a rare population of common progenitors.</p><p>Having a well-defined understanding of the developmental origins of patterned organs is critical for the development of regenerative strategies, and for our understanding of the basis of congenital malformations. For the future development of cellular therapies, the knowledge that molecularly distinct populations of progenitors contribute to distinct anatomic regions of the heart will guide the selection of the most appropriate cellular and molecular signature. More broadly, our results suggest a rapid and precise patterning of progenitor populations during gastrulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>The <italic>Mesp1</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup> knock-in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saga et al., 1999</xref>) were obtained from Yumiko Saga. <italic>Mef2cAHF</italic>-lacZ mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dodou et al., 2004</xref>) were obtained from Brian Black. <italic>Isl1</italic><sup><italic>nLacZ</italic></sup> knock-in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2007</xref>) were obtained from Sylvia Evans.

Three biological replicates for each population (GFP+ and GFP-) were obtained and analyzed by RNA-sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Bioinformatics analysis</title><p>Sequence reads were aligned to the mm9 (mouse) assembly with Tophat 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim and Salzberg, 2011</xref>), using Ensembl version 67 exon annotation.

Immunostaining of MADM samples for GFP and Myc was as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zong et al., 2005</xref>). Antibodies used on cryosections include: Rabbit anti-GFP (Invitrogen, 1:1000), Goat anti-Myc (Novus, 1:200), Rat anti-CD31 (BD Pharmingen, 1:100), Mouse anti-tropomyosin (DSHB clone CH-1, 1:50). Whole-mount lacZ and indirect immunofluorescent images were obtained using a Leica dissecting microscope and camera with the Leica LAS Montage extended focus function. Confocal images were obtained on a Nikon ECLIPSE Ti 2000 confocal microscope with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk and Hamamatsu ImagEM CCD camera. Images were processed using Volocity software (Perkin Elmer). All images, including immunofluorescent, in situ hybridization, and LacZ images are representative images. At least 5 embryos (in situ hybridization and LacZ) or 3 independent sections (immunofluorescence) were examined for each experiment. Images shown represent average or representative expression levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Mouse experiments</title><p>All mouse protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at UCSF.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>In the <italic>Mesp1</italic><sup>Cre</sup>-MADM mice, heart labeling results from a Cre-mediated chromosomal translocation that occurs within a narrow developmental time window of Cre expression, between the initiation of gastrulation and shortly there after (E6.0 and E7.0). Importantly, this translocation event does not happen in the absence of Cre-recombinase (our observations and previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tasic et al., 2012</xref>)) and there is no visible labeling prior to translocation. We have empirically defined the frequency of this event by measuring two different variables: (1) the total number of cells that can undergo this translocation and (2) the observed frequency of labeled clones. The total number of cells that could undergo translocation was determined by counting the number of cells that had recombined a Cre-dependent reporter (<italic>Rosa</italic><sup><italic>td-Tomato</italic></sup>) at the end of gastrulation (E7.5). FACS analysis determined that this number was ∼850 cells (∼1/3 of the total number of cells in the embryo at this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>)).</p><p>Given the fact that we observed a total of 96 clones across 38 embryos, our clonal sampling represents 11% (or 96 clones / 850 Mesp1+ cells) of the total <italic>Mesp1</italic>+ population (assuming a random sampling). Thus a rare subpopulation, such as a common progenitor for both the right and left ventricles, would be missed only if it represented less than 10% of the total Mesp1 population.</p><p>We also measured the observed frequency of labeled clones at two different time points (E8.5 and E14.5) to determine if the frequency of labeled clones changed over time (either increased or decreased) as might happen with additional recombination outside of our time window (E6.0–E7.0) or with selective loss of a twin spot via apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). Although the number of samples we have analyzed at E8.5 is small, we detected no significant change in the observed frequency of labeled clones at the two time points analyzed and thus conclude that recombination frequency is stable over developmental time and there is no gain or loss of clones outside our narrow labeling time window.</p><p>Based on the number of observations made (n = 96) and the fact that we did not observe a common progenitor (number of successes = 0), we calculated the upper and lower bounds of a 95% and 99% confidence interval (CI) that a common progenitor does not exist using a binomial probability (Jeffreys interval) appropriate for instances when the number of successes is either very close to 0 or very close to 1.<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo> </mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo> </mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo> </mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo> </mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>x = number of successes, n = sample size, c = confidence interval <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the inverse regularized beta function.</p><p>We used the R Package ‘binom’, version 1.1-1 for calculating these values. The calculated values for a 95% CI were: 0 (lower) and 0.01975768 (upper) and the calculated values for a 99% CI were: 0 (lower) and 0.03387941 (upper). Thus, given the number of observations we made, we can be quite confident that a common progenitor does not exist.</p><p>An additional level of confidence regarding the lineage relationship of clones in different anatomical regions of the heart can be gained by comparing the color combinations observed. For example, clone MM2 could be interpreted as one recombination event that gave rise to two clusters: one in the right ventricle and one in the left ventricle. However the color combinations seen (red/green twin spots in right ventricle and yellow/blank twin spots in left ventricle) exclude the possibility that these two clusters are derived from the same event. Likewise, for clone MM26, only two labeled patches are seen in the entire embryo (red twin spot in left ventricle and green twin spot in right atrium). Assuming there is no selective loss of twin spots (as we have determined above by measuring the clonal frequency at two different time points) we can conclude that these two clusters are derived from a single event.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dario Miguel-Perez and Claire Cutting for assistance with mouse husbandry and dissections, Kiyonori Togi for expanding and breeding chimeric mice, Robert Chadwick (Gladstone Genomics Core) for RNAseq library preparation, Alexander Williams (Gladstone Bioinformatics Core) for RNAseq data analysis, Sylvia Evans for transgenic mice, Brian Black for transgenic mice, constructs and helpful discussions, and Alisha Holloway and Katherine Pollard for statistical discussions.

Utilizing the mesodermal germ layer marking Mesp1 in conjunction with transcriptional elements from Smarcd3, which is expressed within the Mesp1 cell population, the authors make a compelling case that specification of cardiac progenitors occurs early, that this specification is concurrent for each heart field, and that there is not a common progenitor for primary and secondary heart fields. This is an important topic, as these stages are difficult to access technically and there are outstanding questions about the heterogeneity of cardiac progenitors. The number and variety of mouse strains employed for lineage tracing, some of which are generated for this manuscript, and the number of experiments performed, are impressive. The results suggest that the mammalian heart is compartmentalized at early life stages. Overall, this is an interesting and well executed study; however, a few of the conclusions need further support or clarification.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) The authors state that the Mesp-Cre is active in mesoderm from E6.0 to E7.0, but it is unclear how this is determined? The reference Saga 1999 does not seem to show this, as it is likely Cre Protein persists longer than the Mesp mRNA and the authors should mention this. Without a conditional Cre, the authors should explain more clearly how they know that new clones are not induced throughout development. Are E14.5 embryos optically clear enough (as compared to E8.5 embryos) to count total fluorescent clones and be certain that new cell labeling events do not continue? More explanation in the main text is requested.</p><p>2) The authors make a novelty claim that they have shown that individual cardiac progenitor cells give rise to multiple cardiac cell types. This is not shown conclusively, as they do not use adequate costaining to identify cells in their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> tissue sections. They should use antibodies against a myocyte marker and an endothelial marker in a 4-color stain of clonal progeny to show this.</p><p>3) In the text and staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. What is the evidence that Mesp1 and Smarcd3 mRNAs do not overlap? When possible, which it should be for reporters like GFP and lacZ, the authors should use fluorescence detection to colocalize markers in tissue sections. Then, arrows could be used to pinpoint cells in sections with different signatures to better make the authors' points.</p><p>4) The authors use a confetti approach with a Smarcd3 enhancer driving an inducible Cre. This is a useful way to confirm the MADM results, although there may be pitfalls with tamoxifen persistence, etc. The authors mention the results briefly that labeled cells within clones are contained in single chambers, but it is better to show the full dataset here to have an idea of how they made their conclusion.</p><p>5) The authors mention that early Tbx5+ cell labeling marks progeny corresponding to epicardial progenitors. However, they do not show cell type-specific markers to validate this colocalization. They need to do the costains or remove the statement.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Early Patterning and Specification of Cardiac Progenitors in Gastrulating Mesoderm” for further consideration at <italic>eLife.</italic> Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor) and a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors.

Are E14.5 embryos optically clear enough (as compared to E8.5 embryos) to count total fluorescent clones and be certain that new cell labeling events do not continue? More explanation in the main text is requested</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers raise an important point with respect to the timing of clone induction. While we have not used a conditional Cre allele to control the timing of Cre activity, we believe there are several lines of evidence that support the conclusion that <italic>Mesp1</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup> is active (and thus clones are induced) over a very narrow temporal window (from ∼E6.0-E7.5). First, we have performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization for <italic>Cre</italic> mRNA in <italic>Mesp1</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup> embryos at multiple stages and find that by the late head fold stage (LHF) expression of Cre mRNA is largely restricted to the allantoic base and allantoic membrane with minimal expression in area of the forming cardiogenic mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1B</xref>), supporting the idea that <italic>Cre</italic> mRNA and thus Cre activity is extinguished after E7.5.</p><p>While staining for Cre protein would be the preferred method for determining protein perdurance, we have been unable to identify a suitable antibody for Cre immunostaining despite attempts with several different antibodies on both whole-mount embryos and tissue sections. Second, in the original reference describing the expression and requirement of <italic>Mesp1</italic> in early gastrulating mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saga et al. 1999</xref>) they look both at <italic>Mesp1</italic> mRNA (their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G-3L</xref>) as well as <italic>beta</italic>-galactosidase activity in a knock-in allele (their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-3F</xref>). Even with the perdurance of <italic>beta</italic>-galactosidase enzyme activity, the authors see minimal X-gal staining after E7.75. If we assume that <italic>beta</italic>-galactosidase activity likely persists as long or longer than Cre protein activity, it is unlikely that clones are induced after ∼E7.5. Third, we have counted the number of clones in embryos at E8.5 and at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1C-D</xref> and Statistical Analysis) and we see a similar distribution, suggesting that no additional clones are induced over this time window. Finally, a recent paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lescroart et al. 2014</xref>) describes a complementary lineage labeling approach using a <italic>Mesp1</italic>-rtTA transgenic allele. Based on the timing of doxycycline administration, they define a functional window of Mesp1 activity between E6.25-E7.5, consistent with what we and others have shown.</p><p>We regret omitting a full description of our clonal analysis protocol and this is now included both in the main text as well as the Materials and Methods. In order to ensure an accurate description of clone locations, a thorough external examination was performed of each embryo. Following this, hearts were dissected and, in many instances, immunostained for labeled twin spots (GFP and Myc). Whole-mount hearts were photographed and subsequently embedded and sectioned for additional immunostaining (PECAM and tropomyosin). The use of optical clearing solutions, such as S<italic>cale</italic> or Clear<sup>T</sup>, was not necessary and thus not used.</p><p><italic>2) The authors make a novelty claim that they have shown that individual cardiac progenitor cells give rise to multiple cardiac cell types. This is not shown conclusively, as they do not use adequate costaining to identify cells in their</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>tissue sections. They should use antibodies against a myocyte marker and an endothelial marker in a 4-color stain of clonal progeny to show this</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are correct to point out that for technical reasons we did not initially stain for all cell-lineage markers at the same time in our tissue sections. We relied on cell morphology and staining or absence of staining for a single lineage marker (PECAM). We now have stained an additional clone example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3L</xref>) that clearly shows a twin spot (Green) that gives rise to both endocardium (PECAM positive) and cardiomyocytes (Tropomyosin positive), thus providing additional confirmation that individual cardiac progenitor cells can give rise to multiple cardiac cell types.</p><p><italic>3) In the text and staining in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>. What is the evidence that Mesp1 and Smarcd3 mRNAs do not overlap? When possible, which it should be for reporters like GFP and lacZ, the authors should use fluorescence detection to colocalize markers in tissue sections. Then, arrows could be used to pinpoint cells in sections with different signatures to better make the authors' points</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers suggest that whenever possible we should look at co-localization of <italic>Mesp1</italic> and <italic>Smarcd3</italic> in the same tissue section or embryo rather than comparing between embryos stained for each respective marker (example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). We have now included additional images that document the non-overlapping expression of <italic>Mesp1</italic> mRNA and <italic>Smarcd3</italic>-F1 lacZ activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). While immunostaining for Mesp1 and Smarcd3-F1 LacZ/GFP would be the preferred method to document at the cellular level the different signatures of cells, we have not been able to identify a suitable antibody for Mesp1 immunostaining. As a result, we must rely on <italic>Mesp1</italic> mRNA in situ hybridization combined with immunostaining or X-gal staining for Smarcd-F1. In addition, we would like to point out that in our <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 B&amp;C</xref>) we see a temporal distinction between the peaks of Mesp1 and Smarcd3 expression; <italic>Mesp1</italic> mRNA expression is mostly gone at day 4.5, the same time that <italic>Smarcd3</italic> mRNA expression begins to increase. These data also support the idea that at the temporal level, <italic>Mesp1</italic> and <italic>Smarcd3</italic> are non-overlapping differentiation markers.</p><p><italic>4) The authors use a confetti approach with a Smarcd3 enhancer driving an inducible Cre. This is a useful way to confirm the MADM results, although there may be pitfalls with tamoxifen persistence, etc. The authors mention the results briefly that labeled cells within clones are contained in single chambers, but it is better to show the full dataset here to have an idea of how they made their conclusion</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers point out that we used a complementary approach (Confetti mice) to confirm the major conclusions from our MADM clonal analysis. We did not perform an exhaustive analysis with the Confetti mice because we felt the results from our MADM analysis were compelling and statistically significant. We focused our efforts on the MADM approach because of the advantages that we felt this system offered (rare labeling, ability to distinguish twin spots, permanent daughter cell labeling). While we attempted to perform MADM analysis with our <italic>Smarcd3</italic>-F1<sup>CreERT2</sup> allele, the recombination frequency was too low to identify any clones in several litters of embryos. In addition, as the reviewers point out, there are pitfalls associated with tamoxifen persistence that might confound our results. Nonetheless, we crossed our <italic>Smarcd3</italic>-F1<sup>CreERT2</sup> allele with the <italic>ROSA</italic><sup><italic>Confetti</italic></sup> allele and induced recombination early (E6.5) and identified 6 embryos from several litters that contained rare or infrequent labeling events and none of these examples showed a labeling pattern that would support a common progenitor contributing to both right and left ventricles. Instead, we saw clonal labeling of a single chamber. While the number of embryos we looked at is not statistically significant, we believe performing a full analysis using the <italic>Smarcd3</italic>-F1<sup>CreERT2</sup>; Confetti system in addition to the <italic>Mesp1</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup>-MADM system is beyond the scope of this paper, but that the current data are highly supportive of our conclusions with the MADM system.</p><p><italic>5) The authors mention that early Tbx5+ cell labeling marks progeny corresponding to epicardial progenitors. However, they do not show cell type-specific markers to validate this colocalization. They need to do the costains or remove the statement</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are correct to point out that we describe an early Tbx5+ population that contributes to epicardial progenitors based on anatomic location without formally showing co-localization with an epicardial marker. We have now stained tissue sections from an early tamoxifen pulse (E6.5) harvested at E14.5 with anti-Tbx18, a marker of epicardial (and interventricular septum) cells (Zeng et al. 2011). We see rare GFP-positive/Tbx5-lineage derived cells on the epicardial surface of the heart that are also positive for Tbx18 immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1O</xref>), thus confirming that an early population of Tbx5 derived cells also labels epicardial progenitors.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below</italic>.<italic>]</italic></p><p><italic>Original Comment #4: The authors use a confetti approach with a Smarcd3 enhancer driving an inducible Cre. This is a useful way to confirm the MADM results, although there may be pitfalls with tamoxifen persistence, etc. The authors mention the results briefly that labeled cells within clones are contained in single chambers, but it is better to show the full dataset here to have an idea of how they made their conclusion</italic>.</p><p><italic>Also, authors should indicate this small number of confetti animals examined in the text of their manuscript, and any limitation of their analysis, for the benefit of anyone who will attempt to repeat this work</italic>.</p><p>We have added text to add the numbers of embryos studied, and emphasize the technical limitations of the use of the confetti mice. We also indicated that the MADM system has a recombination frequency too low for use with CreERT2 transgenes.</p><p><italic>Original Comment #5: The authors mention that early Tbx5+ cell labeling marks progeny corresponding to epicardial progenitors. However, they do not show cell type-specific markers to validate this colocalization. They need to do the costains or remove the statement</italic>.</p><p><italic>Further comment in response to authors' rebuttal: Disagree. Based on the image provided, the authors should remove the statement on contribution to epicardial progenitors. The red Tbx18 signal is equivalent to background</italic> – <italic>the signal and claim of costain is unlikely to convince the reader</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the data is not as convincing as it could be, and have removed the panel from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>, as well as text referring to epicardial labeling.</p></body></sub-article></article>
