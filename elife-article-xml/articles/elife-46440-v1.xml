We have investigated whether natural selection increases this variation by testing whether host populations show more genetic variation in susceptibility to pathogens that they naturally encounter than novel pathogens. In a large cross-infection experiment involving four species of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and four host-specific viruses, we always found greater genetic variation in susceptibility to viruses that had coevolved with their host. We went on to examine the genetic architecture of resistance in one host species, finding that there are more major-effect genetic variants in coevolved host-pathogen interactions. We conclude that selection by pathogens has increased genetic variation in host susceptibility, and much of this effect is caused by the occurrence of major-effect resistance polymorphisms within populations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>viruses</kwd><kwd>sigma virus</kwd><kwd>coevolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008668</institution-id><institution>NERC Environmental Bioinformatics Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NE/L004232/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duxbury</surname><given-names>Elizabeth ML</given-names></name><name><surname>Day</surname><given-names>Jonathan P</given-names></name><name><surname>Jiggins</surname><given-names>Francis M</given-names></name><name><surname>Longdon</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sir Henry Dale Fellowship (Grant Number 109356/Z/15/Z)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Longdon</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>281668</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duxbury</surname><given-names>Elizabeth ML</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sir Henry Dale Fellowship (Grant Number 109356/Z/15/Z)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Longdon</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A history of coevolution increases genetic variation in the susceptibility of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to viruses, largely by introducing major-effect resistance polymorphisms into populations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>From bacteria to plants and insects to humans, it is common to find considerable genetic variation in susceptibility to infection in natural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chapman and Hill, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bangham et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hammond-Kosack and Jones, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lazzaro et al., 2004</xref>). This variation in susceptibility can determine the impact of disease on health and economic output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cooke and Hill, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">King and Lively, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso-Blanco and Méndez-Vigo, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burgner et al., 2006</xref>). In nature and breeding programs, it determines the ability of populations to evolve resistance to infection. Insect populations, like those of other organisms, typically contain considerable genetic variation in susceptibility to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bangham et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lazzaro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tinsley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Obbard and Dudas, 2014</xref>), and provide a convenient laboratory model in which to investigate basic questions about how this variation is maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Magwire et al., 2012</xref>). Within vector species like mosquitoes, resistant genotypes are less likely to transmit pathogens, and this has the potential to reduce disease in vertebrate populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beerntsen et al., 2000</xref>). Where pathogens are contributing the decline of beneficial species like pollinators, high levels of genetic variation may allow populations to recover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Maori et al., 2007</xref>). Understanding the origins of genetic variation in susceptibility is therefore a fundamental question in infectious disease biology.</p><p>As pathogens are harmful, natural selection is expected to favour resistant host genotypes. Directional selection on standing genetic variation will drive alleles to fixation, removing variants from the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Falconer, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Falconer and Mackay, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blows and Hoffmann, 2005</xref>). However, as directional selection also increases the frequency of new mutations that change the trait in the direction of selection, at equilibrium it is expected to have no effect on levels of standing genetic variation (relative to mutation-drift balance; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hill, 1982</xref>). However, selection mediated by pathogens may be different. Coevolution with pathogens can result in the maintenance of both resistant and susceptible alleles by negative frequency dependent selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Woolhouse et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haldane, 1949</xref>). Similarly, when infection prevalence exhibits geographical or temporal variation, selection can maintain genetic variation, especially if pleiotropic costs to resistance provide an advantage to susceptible individuals when infection is rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nuismer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Thompson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koskella, 2018</xref>). Even when there is simple directional selection on alleles that increase resistance, the direction of selection by pathogens may frequently change so populations may not be at equilibrium. If selection favours rare alleles – such as new mutations – directional selection can transiently increase genetic variation during their spread through the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barton and Turelli, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bangham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Magwire et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>As part of a whole genome association study, we have previously estimated levels of genetic variation in the susceptibility of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> to four different viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Magwire et al., 2012</xref>). We found that there was more genetic variation in susceptibility to the two viruses that were isolated from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> than the two viruses from other insect species. Furthermore, in each of these naturally coevolved host-pathogen associations we detected a single major-effect polymorphism affecting resistance. This led us to propose that coevolution had increased genetic variation in susceptibility due to the presence of major-effect resistance polymorphisms. However, this conclusion remains anecdotal. First, aside from two sigma viruses, the viruses we used were mostly very distantly related, so their biology may differ for many reasons. Second, our association study had low statistical power, so conclusions about the genetics were based on just two genes. Finally, and most importantly, the link between coevolutionary history and genetic variation is based on a single host and four viruses, and so could arise by chance. For this reason, here we return to this question and formally test whether a history of coevolution alters the amount and nature of genetic variation.</p><p>To examine how selection by a pathogen affects levels of genetic variation we used a natural host-virus system; <italic>Drosophila</italic> and sigma viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Longdon and Jiggins, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Longdon et al., 2012</xref>). Sigma viruses are a clade of insect RNA viruses with negative-sense genomes in the family Rhabdoviridae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Longdon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Longdon et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Longdon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Longdon et al., 2011a</xref>). They are vertically transmitted through eggs and sperm, and each sigma virus infects a single host species, simplifying studies of coevolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Longdon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Longdon et al., 2011a</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, despite the virus causing little adult mortality, infection reduces host fitness by approximately 25% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wilfert and Jiggins, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yampolsky et al., 1999</xref>). As prevalence in wild populations is typically around 10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wilfert and Jiggins, 2013</xref>), there is the necessary selective pressure for resistance to evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Magwire et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cao et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, three major-effect resistance alleles have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bangham et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Magwire et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bangham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Magwire et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bangham et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wayne et al., 1996</xref>). There has been a recent sweep of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> sigma virus (DMelSV) genotypes that are able to overcome one of these host resistance genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fleuriet, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilfert and Jiggins, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wilfert and Jiggins, 2014</xref>). Given the power of <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics, this system is an excellent model of a coevolutionary arms race between hosts and pathogens.</p><p>Sigma viruses offer a novel way to test how coevolution with a pathogen alters the amount of genetic variation in host susceptibility. As sigma viruses are vertically transmitted, we can be certain of which hosts and viruses are naturally coevolving and which are not. In this study we have used four species of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<italic>D. affinis, D. immigrans, D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. obscura</italic>) that shared a common ancestor approximately 40 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Obbard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tamura et al., 2004</xref>), and their natural sigma viruses (DAffSV, DImmSV, DMelSV and DObsSV, which have amino acid identities of &lt;55% in the most conserved gene) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Longdon et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Longdon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Longdon et al., 2011b</xref>). Despite their vertical mode of transmission, the phylogenies of the viruses and their hosts are incongruent, suggesting they have jumped between host species during their evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Longdon et al., 2011b</xref>). To test whether selection by viruses increases the amount of genetic variation in host susceptibility we have compared the viral load of endemic viruses that naturally infect each of the four host species to non-endemic viruses. We then examined how selection by these viruses has altered the genetic architecture of resistance by mapping loci that confer resistance to endemic and non-endemic viruses in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genetic variation in susceptibility to infection is greatest in coevolved host-virus associations</title><p>To test whether selection by viruses has increased genetic variation in susceptibility to infection, we compared endemic host-virus associations with novel associations that have no history of coevolution. We used four different species of <italic>Drosophila,</italic> each of which is naturally host to a different sigma virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Longdon and Jiggins, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Longdon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Longdon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Longdon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Longdon et al., 2011a</xref>). We collected four species from the wild and created genetically diverse populations in the laboratory. Using flies from these populations we crossed single males to single females to create full-sib families. The progeny of these crosses were then injected with either the virus isolated from that species, or a virus isolated from one of the other species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Studies on DMelSV have shown that loci that reduce loads when the virus is injected also reduce infection rates in both the lab and field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bangham et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Longdon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bregliano, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brun and Plus, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ohanessian-Guillemain, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilfert and Jiggins, 2010b</xref>). As infection is costly, this is expected to increase host fitness. Fifteen days post infection we extracted RNA from the flies and measured viral load by quantitative RT-PCR.

This effect was largely caused by a modest number of major-effect genes that explain over half of the genetic variance in resistance.</p><p>As the genetic variants in the genes <italic>p62 (ref(2)P)</italic> and <italic>CHKov1</italic> that confer resistance to DMelSV have been identified, this has previously allowed us to use patterns of DNA sequence variation to infer how selection has acted on resistance in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. In both these genes the resistant alleles have arisen relatively recently by mutation and natural selection has pushed them rapidly up in frequency, leaving a characteristic signature of elevated linkage disequilibrium and low genetic diversity around the variant causing resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bangham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Magwire et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wayne et al., 1996</xref>). There is no indication of negative frequency dependent selection, and these polymorphisms appear to have arisen from partial selective sweeps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bangham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Magwire et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The most parsimonious explanation of these observations is that there has been directional selection favouring resistance alleles (although this type of data cannot rule out negative frequency dependent selection as is predicted by models of coevolution). At equilibrium, directional selection on a trait is not expected to affect its genetic variance (relative to a population under mutation-drift balance; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hill, 1982</xref>). However, the genetic variance will transiently increase if the variants under selection are initially at low frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barton and Turelli, 1987</xref>), as was the case for both <italic>p62</italic> and <italic>CHKov1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bangham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Magwire et al., 2011</xref>). A particular feature of pathogens is that the direction of selection is likely to continually change as new pathogens appear in populations or existing pathogens evolve to overcome host defences. For example, in France and Germany in the 1980s, DMelSV evolved to largely overcome the effects of the resistant allele of <italic>p62</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fleuriet and Periquet, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fleuriet and Sperlich, 1992</xref>). Similarly, DImmSV has swept through European populations of <italic>D. immigrans</italic> in the last ~16 years and DObsSV through UK populations of <italic>D. obscura</italic> in the last ~11 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Longdon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Longdon et al., 2011a</xref>). If selection by pathogens continually changes and resistance evolves from new mutations, then this may cause a sustained increase in genetic variance in susceptibility to infection.</p><p>A key question is whether the increased genetic variation that we see in coevolved <italic>Drosophila</italic>–sigma virus interactions will hold for coevolved pathogens more generally. Theory suggests that a critical factor determining levels of genetic variation is whether resistance is costly to evolve, as this can result in the maintenance of variation by negative frequency dependent selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonovics and Thrall, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boots et al., 2014</xref>). In humans this has been proposed as an explanation of why there is less genetic variation in susceptibility to pathogens that are effectively controlled by the adaptive immune response, as these resistance mechanisms may be less costly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker and Antonovics, 2012</xref>). However, it seems unlikely that virus resistance in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is costly, as experiments have failed to detect costs of DCV resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Faria et al., 2015</xref>) despite costs of parasitoid and bacterial resistance being repeatedly detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McGonigle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McKean et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ye et al., 2009</xref>). Sigma viruses are also extreme host specialists, so evolutionary changes in resistance will tend to alter pathogen prevalence and so the strength of selection. These epidemiological feedbacks are predicted to frequently increase genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boots et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Best et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boots and Haraguchi, 1999</xref>). However, in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> we see large amounts of genetic variation in susceptibility to viruses that have a broader host range than sigma viruses (DCV and Kallithea virus that infect <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> in the wild) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Magwire et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Palmer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Christian, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Webster et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, it seems unlikely that our conclusions will be a quirk of the sigma virus system. In an analogous study of rust resistance in wild flax plants, sympatric (putatively coevolved) populations had fewer partial resistances than allopatric populations, suggesting more major gene effects, even though overall there was somewhat less genetic variation in susceptibility to sympatric fungal pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonovics et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Quantitative traits are typically controlled by a very large number of genetic variants, each of which tends to have a very small effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). However, susceptibility to sigma viruses has a simpler genetic basis, with seven polymorphisms explaining over half the genetic variance. This confirms our previous work in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> showing a simple genetic basis of virus resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Magwire et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cogni et al., 2016</xref>). As these genetic variants mostly only affect the naturally occurring pathogen of <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> our results suggest that not only is selection by pathogens increasing the genetic variance but it is also altering the genetic architecture of resistance by introducing major-effect variants into the population. One explanation for this observation is that most quantitative traits are under stabilising selection, so major effect variants will tend to be deleterious and removed by selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gibson, 2018</xref>). In contrast, selection by pathogens likely changes through time and populations may be far from their optimal level of resistance. If this is the case, Fisher’s geometric model predicts that major effect variants will be favoured by directional selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fisher, 1930</xref>). Alternatively, the coevolution of hosts and parasites can favour discrete susceptible and resistant hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boots et al., 2014</xref>), and at the genetic level this may result in major-effect variants (although this theory does not explicitly address the underlying genetics). The simple genetics may also be driven by mutation—for many traits major-effect mutations that increase fitness may be extremely rare, but this may not be the case for virus resistance. For example a single (loss of function) mutation may prevent a virus binding to a host receptor or utilising other parts of the host cellular machinery, and so confer strong resistance.</p><p>Regardless of its causes, it may be common that susceptibility to infectious disease has a simple genetic basis. In humans, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hill (2012)</xref> advocated the view that susceptibility to infectious disease is qualitatively different from other traits and has a much simpler genetic basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hill, 2012</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> resistance to DCV and parasitoid wasps both have a simple genetic basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Magwire et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Orr and Irving, 1997</xref>). In plants, major-effect polymorphisms in R genes are commonplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hammond-Kosack and Jones, 1997</xref>) and in a plant-fungi system genotype-by-genotype interactions explain a larger proportion of the total variance in sympatric (more coevolved) associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonovics et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, studies of bacterial resistance in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have typically used pathogens that are unlikely to have any history of coevolution, and have found a polygenic basis to resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bou Sleiman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hotson and Schneider, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Howick and Lazzaro, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2017</xref>).

Our results suggest that when a pathogen infects a novel host species, there may be far less genetic variation in susceptibility among individuals than is normally the case. This may create a ‘monoculture effect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">King and Lively, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lively, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ostfeld and Keesing, 2012</xref>), which could leave populations vulnerable to epidemics of pathogens that have previously circulated in other host species. Longer term, low levels of pre-standing genetic variation may slow down the rate at which the new host can evolve resistance to a new pathogen.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that selection by pathogens has increased the amount of genetic variation in host susceptibility.

For the random effects <bold>V</bold> is a 3 × 3 covariance matrix describing the variances for each virus and the covariances between them. The off-diagonal elements of <bold>V</bold> for the residual were set to zero because the covariances between traits at these levels are not estimable by design.</p><p>Diffuse independent normal priors were placed on the fixed effects (means of zero and variances of 10<sup>8</sup>). Parameter expanded priors were placed on the covariance matrices resulting in scaled multivariate <italic>F</italic> distributions which have the property that the marginal distributions for the variances are scaled (by 1000) <italic>F</italic><sub>1, 1</sub>. The exceptions were the residual variances for which an inverse-gamma prior was used with shape and scale equal to 0.001.

To identify QTL affecting viral load we first calculated the mean viral load (ΔCt) across the biological replicates of each RIL. We then regressed the mean viral load against the eight genotype probabilities and calculated logarithm of odds (LOD) scores using the DSPRqtl package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">King et al., 2012</xref>). These LOD scores were calculated separately for DSPR Panel A and Panel B, and then summed at each genomic location. To obtain a significance threshold, we permuted our mean viral load estimates across the RILs within each panel, repeated the analysis above and recorded the highest LOD score across the entire genome. This process was repeated 1000 times to obtain a null distribution of the maximum LOD score.</p><p>To estimate the effect of each QTL we assumed that there was a single genetic variant affecting viral load, so the founder alleles could be assigned to two functionally distinct allelic classes. First, we regressed the mean viral load against the genotype probabilities (as described above), resulting in estimates of the mean viral load of each founder allele in the dataset. The two DSPR panels had one founder line (line 8) in common. For QTL where the line eight allele was present in both panels, this analysis included data from both panels, and ‘panel’ was included as a fixed effect in the analysis. When this was not the case, we analysed only data from the panel where the QTL was most significant. We then ranked the founder alleles by viral load estimate, and split this ranked list into all possible groups of two alleles. For each split, the genotype probabilities in the first group of founder alleles were summed. We then regressed mean viral load against each of these combined genotype probabilities. The regression model with the highest likelihood was taken as the most likely classification into allelic classes. The effect size of the QTL was then estimated from this model.</p><p>To estimate the genetic variance in viral load within the DSPR panels we modified the model described in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> as follows. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is the log<sub>2 </sub>viral load of the <italic>i<sup>th</sup></italic> biological replicate of each RIL <italic>f</italic> infected with virus <italic>v.</italic> There was a single fixed effect, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, of the panel the line is from. <italic>u</italic> is the random effect for each RIL (<italic>f</italic>). The day of injection (<italic>d</italic>) was omitted.

This assumes all the genetic variation is additive.</p><p>To estimate the proportion of the genetic variance that is explained by the QTL we identified, we repeated this analysis but included the 7 QTL we identified as fixed effects in the model. Each QTL was included by estimating the probability that each line carried the resistant allele of the QTL and adding this as a fixed effect to the model. The between-RIL variance then allowed us to estimate the genetic variance in viral load after removing the effects of the QTL.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Additional methods</title><p>All lines were screened for their retrospective sigma virus over two generations by RT-PCR, and infected isofemale lines discarded prior to the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic></title><p>We created an outcrossed population by combining 150 isofemale lines of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (collected in Accra, Ghana (5.593,–0.188) in 2014) in a population cage.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Host-pathogen coevolution increases genetic variation in susceptibility to infection&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Brian P Lazzaro (Reviewer #1); Janis Antonovics (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you will note, reviewer's comments were generally positive about your manuscript. Nevertheless, in the course of the discussion between reviewers, two issues arise that justify the decision:</p><p>1) The present paper was judged too similar to a previous study of the authors (see reviewer 2). It was felt that the authors have already shown this result with <italic>melanogaster</italic> and that the present study is expanding on that previous observation using more host species. Thus the novelty was questioned.</p><p>2) The generality of the result might be overstated. Reviewers felt that the authors over-claim the implication for general host-parasite evolution, and that the pattern they described might only apply to infections for which resistance has a simple genetic architecture and the pathogen is rapidly evolving, although that may capture most specialist viruses.</p><p>Based on these concerns, it was decided to reject the manuscript but allow re-submission. At this stage, you are allowed to re-submit a revised manuscript that will be treated as a new submission and try to convince the reviewers of the importance of your manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Duxbury, Day and colleagues present a clever test of whether specialist coevolution between a virus and its host increases the genetic variance for resistance in the host population. The paper is conceptually and methodologically sound. It is interesting and well written and could be published without modification. I offer only a few suggestions for improvement, and these are largely discretionary.</p><p>I have one major point of interpretation that may be worth adding to the paper. The authors imply that the results from this study will be generally applicable (e.g., last paragraph of the Introduction), but I suspect they will be most applicable to systems where genetic architecture of resistance is similar to what is seen in this system: variation in resistance explained by few genes of large effect. I am less confident that systems where variation in resistance is determined by a large set of genes with individually small effects will fit the evolutionary model presented here. The authors interchangeably using the words pathogen and parasite to describe the infection, but viruses are a specialized class. This may collapse to being a model for rapidly evolving specialists with less application to generalists or more slowly evolving pathogens and parasites. The authors themselves emphasize the nearly Mendelian architecture of resistance (paragraph one) and the specialist nature of the coevolutionary interaction (paragraph four) in Discussion and at multiple places in Results. In the final paragraph of the Discussion, they conclude that selection by viruses increases genetic diversity and causes a simple genetic architecture of resistance, but I suspect the causality is the other way around: a simple architecture of resistance and rapid evolution of the pathogen facilitates the evolved increase in diversity.</p><p>Upon reading Figure 2, I wondered if there are some host families that are universally susceptible and others that are universally resistant to the non-coevolved viruses. This would be evident in the correlation among families in viral load of the two non-coevolved viruses for each species. Those correlations are given in Supplementary file 3 but they are never discussed in the main text. I would add a few sentences describing these correlations and their implication, perhaps in subsection “Major-effect genetic variants that are known to provide resistance to DMelSV do not protect against other viruses” where the correlation in resistance between coevolved and non-coevolved viruses is presented. This could also be evaluated by looking at the correlation in resistance to DAffSV and DObsSV across the DSPR, which is not presented. In Supplementary file 3, the correlation in resistance to non-coevolved viruses is stronger in <italic>D. immigrans</italic> and <italic>D. subobscura</italic> and is also fairly strong in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. This would appear to support variation for generalized resistance in the absence of specific coevolution.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The major result of this study is that organisms harbor more genetic variation to deal with their native pathogens than with foreign ones. This is interesting and important because it tells us about the nature of genetic variation for pathogen resistance. It is also informative with respect to predicting how hosts might respond when infected with novel pathogens. The paper is very nicely written, interesting and easy to follow, and the authors have done a very thorough job and used a number of interesting approaches. They start by infecting four species of <italic>Drosophila</italic> with native and foreign Sigma viruses. All four show the same pattern – significantly more genetic variation in the titer of native virus. The rest of the paper focuses on <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. The authors show that variation in two genes previously shown to confer resistance to native Sigma virus don't have a major effect on foreign Sigma viruses. They also perform an additional QTL analysis of resistance, identifying 7 QTL (only one of these had been previously shown to be imprortant in virus resistance, so these new QTLs will be interesting to follow up on). Most of the QTLs did not affect titers of the foreign viruses.</p><p>My main concern is that I am not sure that this study is so different from previous work. The authors performed a similar study, with a similar conclusion, published in PLoS Genetics (Magwire et al., 2012). In that study they assessed genetic variation in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> resistance to 2 native and 2 foreign viruses (including two viruses used here – DMelSV and DAffSV). It would be useful for the authors to discuss this paper and how it compares with the present one more explicitly. The authors have also done extensive work identifying genetic variants that contribute to resistance to Sigma virus (and other viruses) in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.</p><p>It would also be useful for the authors to include some more information and details about Sigma virus. How does Sigma virus affect host fitness (the authors don't say much about this except that there was no mortality after 15 days)? It is also a bit hard to tell how successful novel infections are. What percent of individuals/families are not infected at all? (It looks like the infection rate of DAffSV in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is quite low in the Magwire et al. paper.) What is known about genetic variation in tolerance to Sigma viruses?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is a very nice paper showing that pathogens select for not just resistance per se but specifically that they can select for increased genetic variation in resistance in host populations. Moreover, they can select for genes/gene-action of major effect. The analysis is carried out using large cross inoculations studies, inoculations on lineages with known resistance genes in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, and by a QTL study of a composite inbred population…and the results are congruent among all approaches.</p><p>My only (somewhat apologetic) gripe is that one of our papers which showed essentially the same results (selection for genes of large effect, increased variance, and increased pathogen infectivity) based on a reanalysis of a large cross-inoculation experiment in the Linum-Melampsora system, is not cited (Antonovics et al., 2011). However, what we bemoaned in that paper (lack of knowledge of the genes involved) is very much made up for in this paper.</p><p>I also think it would be useful to have clear discussion of the previous theoretical work by the Boots group showing that there are conditions under which co-evolution would indeed result in increased variance in resistance, yet that there are equally other conditions under which the opposite result of reduced variance is expected. An application of this theory to levels of genetic variation in susceptibility to different human diseases is in Baker and Antonovics, 2012. Basically, it would be nice to strengthen the Discussion, paragraph two, and get a better sense of whether the authors think that the inference that changing selection pressures, paragraph four, result in increased variance is sound and parsimonious – or if it is just guessing.</p><p>The paper is focused on viral loads, but what the effect is of these loads on fitness is never clear, and some mention of this should be included in the discussion if not before.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46440.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As you will note, reviewer's comments were generally positive about your manuscript.

This was the inspiration for this study, but here we have rigorously tested what were anecdotal conclusions in that study. The number of host-virus associations in the Magwire paper was simply too few to draw robust associations between coevolution and levels of genetic variation. We now have a paragraph in the Introduction discussing the results of Magwire, 2012 and explaining how our new data advances on this. We argue that the Magwire paper dataset generated the hypothesis we are testing, and the ability to build on previous work underpins rigorous and reproducible science.</p><p>The second reason for rejection was that our conclusions might not be applicable to other classes of parasites. Rereading the manuscript it was clear our choice of words overstated the generality of our results, and we are now much more careful with our prose. We also discuss the extent to which our conclusions may be extrapolated to other viruses and pathogens by a more detailed review of the literature. All work on model organisms aims to shed light on biology more broadly, but whether it succeeds ultimately awaits research on other species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] I have one major point of interpretation that may be worth adding to the paper.

Throughout the manuscript we have altered our language to make it clear our results relate to a group of <italic>Drosophila</italic> viruses, and have added three new paragraphs to the Discussion relating our results to the literature. These changes include:</p><p>1) We have changed the text throughout, including the Abstract, last paragraph of the Introduction, and first paragraph of the Discussion to refer to viruses/sigma viruses and avoid the impression our results necessarily apply to all parasites.</p><p>2) We have changed all instances of parasite to pathogen, virus or sigma virus.</p><p>3) We have added these paragraphs to the Discussion:</p><p>“A key question is whether the increased genetic variation that we see in coevolved <italic>Drosophila</italic>–sigma virus interactions will hold for coevolved pathogens more generally. […] Nonetheless, in an analogous study of wild flax plants, there was less genetic variation in susceptibility to sympatric (coevolved) fungal pathogens [Antonovics et al., 2011].”</p><p>“Regardless of its causes, it may be common that susceptibility to infectious disease has a simple genetic basis. […] In these studies the polymorphism with the largest effect was found against the only natural <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> pathogen tested (a polymorphism in Diptericin detected using Providencia rettgeri infection), anecdotally supporting the patterns seen here [Unckless, Rottschaefer and Lazzaro, 2015].”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Upon reading Figure 2, I wondered if there are some host families that are universally susceptible and others that are universally resistant to the non-coevolved viruses.

Unfortunately, it was frequently not possible to inject the same family with multiple viruses, so the correlations mostly have broad confidence intervals (Supplementary file 3). Especially now the DSPR results are added; this means we cannot reach any robust conclusion as to whether genes that confer resistance to the non-coevolved viruses tend to be less specific in their action. For this reason we restricted our results to highlighting the one very clear result – different genes control resistance to different viruses.

However, what we bemoaned in that paper (lack of knowledge of the genes involved) is very much made up for in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry we missed this; we now discuss this at two places in the Discussion (paragraphs three - five).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also think it would be useful to have clear discussion of the previous theoretical work by the Boots group showing that there are conditions under which co-evolution would indeed result in increased variance in resistance, yet that there are equally other conditions under which the opposite result of reduced variance is expected. An application of this theory to levels of genetic variation in susceptibility to different human diseases is in Baker and Antonovics, 2012. Basically, it would be nice to strengthen the Discussion, paragraph two, and get a better sense of whether the authors think that the inference that changing selection pressures, paragraph four, result in increased variance is sound and parsimonious – or if it is just guessing.</p></disp-quote><p>The sigma virus system is unusual for an animal pathogen in that we have a strong literature on its genetics and how selection has acted. We have therefore tried to keep our discussion strongly rooted in this. In particular there is a recurrent pattern if selective sweeps, and we have highlighted population genetics theory about how this can affect genetic variation (note that the adaptive dynamics models of Boots are not appropriate to model these processes). Alongside this we have now considerably increased our discussion of the coevolution literature, including the Boots models. The changes are in the two paragraphs quoted at the start of our response to Reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper is focused on viral loads, but what the effect is of these loads on fitness is never clear, and some mention of this should be included in the discussion if not before.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, it was not feasible to measure the fitness of &gt;50,000 flies.
