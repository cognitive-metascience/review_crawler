However, how many of these pathways exist in cells and how these pathways are selectively activated remain unclear. Here, we describe two major fork restart pathways, and demonstrate that their selection is governed by 53BP1 and BRCA1, which are known to control the pathway choice to repair double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). Specifically, 53BP1 promotes a fork cleavage-free pathway, whereas BRCA1 facilitates a break-induced replication (BIR) pathway coupled with SLX-MUS complex-mediated fork cleavage. The defect in the first pathway, but not DSB repair, in a 53BP1 mutant is largely corrected by disrupting BRCA1, and vice versa. Moreover, PLK1 temporally regulates the switch of these two pathways through enhancing the assembly of the SLX-MUS complex. Our results reveal two distinct fork restart pathways, which are antagonistically controlled by 53BP1 and BRCA1 in a DSB repair-independent manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>BRCA1</kwd><kwd>53BP1</kwd><kwd>RIF1</kwd><kwd>replication stress</kwd><kwd>stalled replication fork restart</kwd><kwd>MUS81</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Basic Research Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013CB911002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Dongyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81672773</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Dongyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31661143040</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Dongyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31370836</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Rong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>53BP1 and BRCA1 antagonistically control a temporal choice of two distinct pathways to restart stalled replication forks in a DNA double stand repair-independent manner.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Damaged (stalled or collapsed) forks are a major cause of genome instability in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burrow et al., 2009</xref>). Cells possess robust pathways to restart damaged forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franchitto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neelsen and Lopes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petermann and Helleday, 2010</xref>). Broadly, these pathways can be divided into two main pathways based on their distinct mechanisms. In the first pathway, the stalled forks are stable, and no breakage is generated during the restart process. The structures of these forks might undergo remodeling, which may include re-annealing of excess single-strand DNA (ssDNA) and/or regression to form a Holliday junction-like intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neelsen and Lopes, 2015</xref>). In contrast, the second pathway is fork cleavage-coupled BIR. BIR has been studied extensively in budding yeast as a homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair pathway for broken forks after collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malkova and Ira, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mayle et al., 2015</xref>). However, several lines of evidences have shown that the breakage of stalled forks is not the consequence of unprogrammed collapse but an active process mediated by the MUS81 endonuclease, which promotes fork restart, particularly after prolonged replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pepe and West, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shimura et al., 2008</xref>). These findings imply that BIR may not only passively repair broken forks, but also actively restart stalled forks by coupling with MUS81-mediated cleavage. Recently, the scope of MUS81-coupled BIR was expanded to DNA replication repair in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhowmick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Minocherhomji et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sotiriou et al., 2016</xref>). However, the importance of the MUS81-mediated pathway has been questioned by studies using human cancer cell lines, as several independent studies have shown that DSBs formed in response to replication stress play no roles in fork restart in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franchitto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petermann and Helleday, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Petermann et al., 2010</xref>). It remains unclear how these mutually exclusive pathways are regulated in cells and how a stalled fork makes its choice of which pathway to activate.</p><p>53BP1-RIF1 and BRCA1-CtIP antagonistically control the pathway choice between non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and HR for DSB repair by determining resection of broken ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bunting et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Escribano-Díaz et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we find that 53BP1 and BRCA1 have similar antagonistic interactions in governing the fork restart pathways. In this case, the choice of which fork restart pathway to activate is determined by the cleavage of the stalled forks. BRCA1 promotes programmed cleavage and thus supports the cleavage-coupled BIR pathway, whereas 53BP1 antagonizes BRCA1-dependent cleavage and thus supports the cleavage-free pathway. Our data indicate that 53BP1 and BRCA1 antagonize each other not only to control DSB repair pathways, but also to restart stalled forks using a novel mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>53BP1 and RIF1 have a NHEJ-independent function in response to replication stress</title><p>Our previous study showed that RIF1 promotes stalled replication restart and <italic>RIF1</italic>-deficient DT40 cells are hypersensitive to the replication inhibitors hydroxyurea (HU) and aphidicolin (APH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2010</xref>).

In the NHEJ pathway, Ku70 is a core factor and is more essential than 53BP1 and RIF1, which are regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Escribano-Díaz et al., 2013</xref>).

Thus, the functions of 53BP1 and RIF1 in response to replication stress are independent of their roles in NHEJ.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The absence of BRCA1 suppresses the hypersensitivity of 53BP1-deficient cells to replication stress</title><p><italic>BRCA1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> DT40 cells were not only sensitive to PARP inhibitor (Olaparib) and topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (CPT), but also sensitive to HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These sensitivities were rescued by re-introducing wild-type human BRCA1 or I26A mutant, which loses ubiquitin ligase activity, but not C61G mutant, which loses both ubiquitin ligase activity and its interaction with BARD1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ruffner et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

This genetic interaction suggests that 53BP1 and BRCA1 are in the same pathway and counteract each other in response to replication stress.

However, the replication stress-sensitivity of <italic>RIF1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells was not as well rescued as that of <italic>53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells when BRCA1 was disrupted. Similar phenomenon has been observed for repair of DSBs, in which the absence of 53BP1 rescued HR in only BRCA1-deficient cells, but not CtIP or XRCC2–mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bunting et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Escribano-Díaz et al., 2013</xref>).

These findings prompted us to examine whether BRCA1 and 53BP1 have functions in the cleavage and/or stabilization of stalled forks. We measured the DSB accumulation using a neutral comet assay.

DSB accumulation may result from increased fork cleavage or impaired DSB repair after fork broken. To distinct these two reasons, we examined DSB accumulation after Olaparib or CPT treatment. Different from HU, these two drugs induce accumulation of broken single-strand DNA, which are then directly converted to broken forks and one-end DSBs during replication without cleavage step. <italic>53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells showed similar level of DSBs as that of wild-type cells after Olaparib or CPT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), demonstrating that 53BP1 is dispensable for DSB repair of broken forks.

A striking question is how cells temporally regulate the switch between these two pathways. PLK1 promotes stalled fork breakage in the presence of an ATR inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ragland et al., 2013</xref>), inhibit 53BP1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Orthwein et al., 2014</xref>) and stimulate the assembly and activity of the SLX-MUS complex during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wyatt et al., 2013</xref>). The expression level of PLK1 is regulated during the cell cycle and peaks at the M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barr et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly, our ongoing interactome analysis of DNA repair proteins revealed that PLK1 interacts with BRCA1, SLX4 and 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B,C and</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>). We therefore speculated that increased PLK1 activity might control the conversion of these two restart pathways when replication stress is prolonged. We first examined the PLK1 levels after replication inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). The cells were arrested in G1/S phase using double-thymidine block and were then treated with HU after release into S phase for 2 hr.

We also examined PLK1 levels in unperturbed cells using a QIBC assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The cells were pulse-labeled with EdU 30 min before HU treatment and then pre-extracted before fixing and staining. The PLK1 levels were highest in the G2/M phase without HU treatment. After 8–12 hr of HU treatment, the G2/M phase cells were shifted to the G1 and/or G1/S phases, whereas the S phase cells were blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

This pathway has slow-kinetics and predominantly acts after long periods of replication inhibition, especially during mitosis. MiDAS is possibly a special situation of replication restart, in which forks were persistently stalled until detected during chromosome condensation in mitosis and repaired specifically by the cleavage-coupled BIR pathway.</p><p>There are two types of fork protections: one is to protect the stalled forks from cleavage by SLX-MUS to generate one-end DSB, as discussed here; and the other is to protect stalled forks from resection by MRE11 to degrade nascent DNA as described by Schlacher, K. <italic>et.al</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schlacher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schlacher et al., 2012</xref>). BRCA1 has opposite activities in these two processes: it promotes fork breakage by SLX-MUS, but inhibits fork degradation by MRE11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schlacher et al., 2012</xref>). These two functions of BRCA1 likely have no directly causality because of two reasons: first, the defect of nascent DNA protection in the BRCA1 mutant cannot be rescued by disrupting 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ray Chaudhuri et al., 2016</xref>), which is different from their antagonistic functions in fork restart described here; second, BRCA2, which plays an essential role in the nascent DNA protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schlacher et al., 2011</xref>), is dispensable for BIR and MiDAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhowmick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feng and Jasin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sotiriou et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that these functions are two independent events. In fact, BRCA2 has opposite function from BRCA1 to protect stalled forks from breakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lomonosov et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, BRCA2-defective cells display delayed restart of stalled forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ray Chaudhuri et al., 2016</xref>) and this delayed restart is dependent on MUS81 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lemaçon et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that BRCA2 may work in a MUS81-independent pathway to restart stalled forks. Thus, it will be interesting to study whether BRCA2 functions in the cleavage-free replication restart pathway together with 53BP1 in future.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>53BP1 and BRCA1 counteract each other to control the time-dependent switch of the fork restart pathways</title><p>In the early stage of replication stress, stalled forks were restarted efficiently and quickly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that most stalled forks kept activation at an early stage. The stalled forks were not more restarted by the fast pathway when stress was prolonged, even without BRCA1-dependent cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <italic>BRCA1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells showed a similar restart rate as the wild-type cells after 24 hr of inhibition followed by a 20 min recovery), suggesting that these forks might become inactivated or collapsed, such as via replisome-dissociation or over-regression into an aberrant Holiday junction. In contrast, stalled forks in 53BP1-deficient cells were broken by BRCA1-dependent cleavage in the early stress stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>) and then were restarted by a slow pathway, BIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and E</xref>). When BRCA1 was disrupted, this cleavage in 53BP1-deficient cells was suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>) and the stalled forks could still be recovered by the fast restart pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <italic>BRCA1<sup>-/-</sup>53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells showed a higher fork restart rate than <italic>53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells), suggesting that the stalled forks were not inactivated/collapsed before cleavage in the early stage. Thus, the BIR pathway not only repairs broken/collapsed forks, but also restarts stalled forks by coupling BRCA1 and MUS-SLX complex-mediated cleavage. Moreover, fork cleavage and the cleavage-coupled BIR pathway in BRCA1-deficient cells were suppressed by 53BP1 in the late stage or during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D,E and</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5I,J</xref>; <italic>BRCA1<sup>-/-</sup>53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells showed a higher fork cleavage efficiency and fork restart rate than <italic>BRCA1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells), suggesting that 53BP1 can also protect inactivated/collapsed forks. Together, 53BP1 and BRCA1 counteract each other to protect/cleave damaged (stalled and collapsed) forks and promote replication restart through two distinct pathways.</p><p>There is a balance between these two mutually exclusive fork restart pathways. In the early stage of replication stress, the balance favors to 53BP1-dependent pathway, although the BRCA1-dependent pathway is also operative. When replication stress is prolonged, the balance tilts toward the BRCA1-dependent pathway. The switch from 53BP1-mediated pathway to BRCA1-mediated pathway is likely achieved by the cell-cycle-dependent regulation of PLK1 activity, which is high in mitotic cells or in S-phase cells upon prolonged HU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). PLK1 promotes the cleavage pathway by enhancing the interactions within the SLX-MUS complex. Moreover, PLK1 can also inactivate 53BP1, at least during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Orthwein et al., 2014</xref>), but it is unclear whether this inactivation occurs in the S phase when replication stress is prolonged. These findings indicate that fork-breakage/cleavage is not the passive consequence of collapse but a programmed process, combining the temporal regulations of the assembly of the MUS-SLX complex, the increase in PLK1 activity, and the de-repression of 53BP1-RIF1 by BRCA1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The antagonistic interactions between 53BP1 and BRCA1 in replication restart are independent of their roles in DSB repair</title><p>Our data showed that the functions of 53BP1-RIF1 and BRCA1 in replication restart are clearly different from their roles in DSB repair. First, only the defect in fork restart but not DSB repair of the <italic>53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells was rescued by the disruption of BRCA1. Second, more importantly, we found function-separated mutant of BRCA1. Consistent with this finding, an ubiquitin ligase-inactive mutant of BARD1, the partner of BRCA1, also showed separated functions: it couldn’t repair DSBs, but retains its role in response to replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Densham et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, the antagonistic functions of 53BP1 and BRCA1 in replication restart also mimic their counteracting functions in DSB repair in some ways. In both processes, 53BP1 and BRCA1 mutually counteracts at initiation steps. The decision step of DSB repair pathway choice is the end resection, which is initiated by the CtIP-MRN endonuclease complex. Similarly, the decision step of fork restart pathway conversion is the fork cleavage, which is performed by the MUS-SLX endonuclease complex. It is possible that 53BP1 and RIF1 might have a common mechanism in both blocking DSB resection and preventing fork cleavage, such as forming a higher-order chromatin structure through their oligomerization domains to suppress the access of BRCA1-recruited nucleases as speculated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Panier and Boulton, 2014</xref>). This chromatin access-limiting function is not mutually exclusive with their potential ability to recruit the downstream proteins, such as BLM. Conversely, BRCA1-recuited nucleases might generate products unsuitable for 53BP1 and RIF1-binding. Moreover, BRCA1 might destabilize the chromatin structures that are necessary for 53BP1 and RIF1 accumulation. In support of this notion, BRCA1 has been shown to have a chromatin-decondensation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ye et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Oncogene activation-induced replication stress is common in cancer cells, and stalled replication forks are a major cause of genome instability in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hills and Diffley, 2014</xref>). Moreover, DNA replication is one of the most common drug targets for cancer therapy. Insights into the pathways selected by cells to counteract replication stress may provide new drug targets and could also be exploited to modulate therapeutic responses in a clinically relevant manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(Homo sapiens)</td><td>MUS81(shRNA)</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA)</td><td>TRCN0000049726, <break/>TRCN0000049727</td><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(Homo sapiens)</td><td>SLX4(shRNA)</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA)</td><td>TRCN0000143727, <break/>TRCN0000142519</td><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(Homo sapiens)</td><td>POLD3(shRNA)</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA)</td><td>TRCN0000052990</td><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(Homo sapiens)</td><td>BRCA1(siRNA)</td><td>PMID:16109739</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(Homo sapiens)</td><td>RIF1(siRNA)</td><td>PMID:20711169</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(Homo sapiens)</td><td>CtIP(siRNA)</td><td>PMID:23333306</td><td valign="bottom"/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(Homo sapiens)</td><td>PTIP(siRNA)</td><td>PMID:15456759</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(Homo sapiens)</td><td>REV7(siRNA)</td><td>PMID:23287467</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>cell line <break/>(Homo sapiens)</td><td>HCT116</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CCL-247</td><td/></tr><tr><td>cell line <break/>(Homo sapiens)</td><td>Hela</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CCL-2</td><td/></tr><tr><td>cell line <break/>(Homo sapiens)</td><td>293T</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CRL-3216</td><td/></tr><tr><td>cell line <break/>(Homo sapiens)</td><td>HEK293 Suspension</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CRL-1573.3</td><td/></tr><tr><td>cell line <break/>(Gallus gallus)</td><td>DT40</td><td>other</td><td/><td>A gift from <break/>Dr. Minoru Takata’s lab</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td valign="bottom">anti-BrdU(BU1/75)(mouse monoclonal)</td><td>BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA)</td><td>347580</td><td>IF: 1:250</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>anti-BrdU(B44)(rat monoclonal)</td><td>Abcam <break/>(Cambridge, UK)</td><td>ab6326</td><td>IF:1:50</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>Flag(mouse monoclonal)</td><td>MBL (Japan)</td><td>M185-3L</td><td>WB:1:2000</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>γH2AX(mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Millipore <break/>(St. Louis, MO, USA)</td><td>05–636</td><td>IF:1:5000</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>RPA2 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="bottom">Bethyl (Montgomery, <break/>TX, USA)</td><td valign="bottom">A300-244A</td><td valign="bottom">WB:1:1000;

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Xu et al. uncovered a new role for 53BP1 and BRCA1 DSB repair factors, genetically distinct from their classical DSB-repair role, in modulating fork progression, processing and restart upon transient or prolonged fork stalling. The data show that 53BP1 deficiency hampers the response to replication stress in vertebrates (both chicken and human cells), effects that are counteracted by BRCA1 deficiency. Thus, the authors show a role for BRCA1 in promoting active fork breakage and restart upon prolonged fork stalling, requiring PLK1 activation and SLX4-MUS81 mediated cleavage. The manuscript suggests a novel function of these factors in which the antagonistic relationship is conserved. Mechanistically, 53BP1 promotes a fast response to replication stress, and BRCA1 a slower response that requires fork cleavage by the SLX-MUS complex. In addition the authors propose a role for 53BP1 and RIF1 – but not Ku70, their functional partner in NHEJ – in promoting sustained fork progression and efficient restart early after fork stalling. The novelty of the study lies mostly in uncovering a direct role of BRCA1 in replication fork processing and replication restart, while the role of the alternative 53BP1/RIF1-dependent pathway is far less developed and understood. In general, the data provide novel insights into the pathways of choice for the restart of stalled replication forks. However, several concerns need to be addressed, as indicated below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the authors provide mechanistic investigations on the role of BRCA1 in fork restart upon prolonged stalling (SLX4-MUS81 binding, PLK1 involvement, role in MiDAS, epistasis with BIR factors), the mechanistic insight on the role of 53BP1/RIF1 in the early response to replication stress is limited to the analysis of a mutation which – among other possible effects – reduces 53BP1 interaction with BLM (it would be important to determine the genetic interaction between BLM and 53BP1 after HU treatment). However, there is no data assessing the relevance of this interaction in fork restart and also no direct assessment available from the literature confirming in vivo a role for BLM in replication fork remodeling (if anything, negative data from indirect experiments in Berti et al., NSMB 2013). Yet the authors propose in Results (subsection “The absence of BRCA1 rescues the replication stress-resistance of 53BP1-deficient cells”, third paragraph), Discussion (subsection “53BP1-RIF1 and BRCA1 have new functions in the restart of stalled replication forks”, first paragraph) and even in their graphical model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), that this early role of 53BP1/RIF1 relates to promotion of fork remodeling. This interpretation is not supported by the data and could even be misleading in the field. In fact, the current data on BLM are inconclusive and should be removed from the manuscript. Considering the mechanistic insight provided on the other pathway studied here, it would be preferable to admit that the 53BP1/RIF1 early response to fork stalling is at this stage elusive and deserves further mechanistic investigation, rather than providing statements and models which could be easily proved wrong by further investigations in the field.</p><p>2) It is quite unclear throughout the manuscript what the authors mean for early stage vs. late stage of replication stress. Yet, this is a key distinction the authors make while designing and interpreting all experiments. While the PLK1 part of the work strongly suggests that direct fork processing and BIR-dependent restart require prolonged stalling and a sort of pre-mitotic stage, other data strongly argue that the BRCA1-dependent pathway must be operative also early upon fork arrest, namely 1) BRCA1 defects suppress 53BP1 defects upon short HU pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), thus the BRCA1-dependent pathway competes with the 53BP1 mechanism early on; 2) relatively high – albeit not maximal – levels of PLK1 are detected already upon S phase entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Although this important point may just need rephrasing throughout the manuscript, it is crucial that the authors build a coherent model around early and late events, consistent with the full set of their results.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. The authors should conduct survival assays in HCT116 cells at multiple HU doses, as done for DT40 cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>. These experiments would better define the genetic interaction between BRCA1 and 53BP1 upon HU treatment in HCT116 cells, which are the cells primarily utilized in the manuscript.</p><p>4) While the effect of BRCA1 inactivation promoting the 53BP1-dependent pathway is quite clear, the opposite effect (53BP1 defect promoting slow fork restart, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-D</xref>) is far less convincing. In general, it would be beneficial for the authors to measure the efficiency of fork restart not only by the percentage of restarting forks, but also by the length of the restarted tracks (n.b.: this doesn't require new experimentation, but rather new careful assessment of their data set the authors should measure the length of the IdU tracts of the restarted forks in BRCA1- and 53BP1-deficient cells.). Activation of the BRCA1-dependent fork restart pathway should be visualized not only (or not necessarily) as delayed recovery of efficient fork restart, but also as shorter tracts at restarting forks, thus reflecting a delayed mechanism of fork restart (a key prediction of their model). Interestingly, this type of defect (delayed stalled fork restart) was recently reported for BRCA2-defective cells (Chaudhuri et al., Nature 2016) and very recent evidence has shown that delayed fork restart and successful S phase completion in these conditions does require fork processing by MUS81 (Lai et al., Nature Comms 2017).

The authors should determine whether the decrease in DSBs in BRCA1-/- cells after HU treatment results in reduced HU-induced chromosomal aberrations in HCT116 cells.

In these conditions the 53BP1 dependent restart mechanism should already be fully active and thus required to prevent fork breakage, maximizing a possible difference between 53BP1 wild type and mutant cells.

However, there is no data assessing the relevance of this interaction in fork restart and also no direct assessment available from the literature confirming in vivo a role for BLM in replication fork remodeling (if anything, negative data from indirect experiments in Berti et al., NSMB 2013). Yet the authors propose in Results (subsection “The absence of BRCA1 rescues the replication stress-resistance of 53BP1-deficient cells”, third paragraph), Discussion (subsection “53BP1-RIF1 and BRCA1 have new functions in the restart of stalled replication forks”, first paragraph) and even in their graphical model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), that this early role of 53BP1/RIF1 relates to promotion of fork remodeling. This interpretation is not supported by the data and could even be misleading in the field. In fact, the current data on BLM are inconclusive and should be removed from the manuscript. Considering the mechanistic insight provided on the other pathway studied here, it would be preferable to admit that the 53BP1/RIF1 early response to fork stalling is at this stage elusive and deserves further mechanistic investigation, rather than providing statements and models which could be easily proved wrong by further investigations in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this insightful suggestion. We agree that the current data on BLM are not strong enough. Thus, we removed these data from the manuscript as suggested. We will continue to study the mechanism of 53BP1/RIF1 on fork restart as an independent project in future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is quite unclear throughout the manuscript what the authors mean for early stage vs. late stage of replication stress. Yet, this is a key distinction the authors make while designing and interpreting all experiments. While the PLK1 part of the work strongly suggests that direct fork processing and BIR-dependent restart require prolonged stalling and a sort of pre-mitotic stage, other data strongly argue that the BRCA1-dependent pathway must be operative also early upon fork arrest, namely 1) BRCA1 defects suppress 53BP1 defects upon short HU pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), thus the BRCA1-dependent pathway competes with the 53BP1 mechanism early on; 2) relatively high – albeit not maximal – levels of PLK1 are detected already upon S phase entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Although this important point may just need rephrasing throughout the manuscript, it is crucial that the authors build a coherent model around early and late events, consistent with the full set of their results.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that we didn’t explain this model well. We fully agree that the BRCA1-dependent pathway is also operative early upon fork arrest. There is a balance between these two mutually exclusive pathways – the BRCA1-dependent pathway and the 53BP1-dependent pathway. In the early stage, the balance prefers to the 53BP1-dependent pathway, although the BRCA1-dependent pathway is also operative. In the late stage of replication stress, the increased PLK1 enhances the fork-cleavage activity of SLX-MUS complex, and the balance therefore tilts to the BRCA1-dependent pathway. Now we rephrased the manuscript and pointed out that the BRCA1-dependent pathway is enhanced/promoted, but not activated, when stress prolongs stalling or cells enter into pre-mitotic stage. We replaced the sentence “The 53BP1- and BRCA1-dependent pathways were activated in early and late stages of replication inhibition, respectively” as “The 53BP1- and BRCA1-dependent pathways mainly works in early and late stages of replication inhibition, respectively”, and the sentence “this BRCA1-dependent pathway is mainly activated in the late stage of replication stress” as “this BRCA1-dependent pathway mainly works in the late stage of replication stress”. We also added this point in the Discussion as “There is a balance between these two mutually exclusive fork restart pathways. In the early stage of replication stress, the balance favors to 53BP1-dependent pathway, although the BRCA1-dependent pathway is also operative. When replication stress is prolonged, the balance tilts toward the BRCA1-dependent pathway.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. The authors should conduct survival assays in HCT116 cells at multiple HU doses, as done for DT40 cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>. These experiments would better define the genetic interaction between BRCA1 and 53BP1 upon HU treatment in HCT116 cells, which are the cells primarily utilized in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this reviewer’s suggestion. Now, we replaced it with new experiment as suggested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) While the effect of BRCA1 inactivation promoting the 53BP1-dependent pathway is quite clear, the opposite effect (53BP1 defect promoting slow fork restart, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-D</xref>) is far less convincing. In general, it would be beneficial for the authors to measure the efficiency of fork restart not only by the percentage of restarting forks, but also by the length of the restarted tracks (n.b.: this doesn't require new experimentation, but rather new careful assessment of their data set the authors should measure the length of the IdU tracts of the restarted forks in BRCA1- and 53BP1-deficient cells.). Activation of the BRCA1-dependent fork restart pathway should be visualized not only (or not necessarily) as delayed recovery of efficient fork restart, but also as shorter tracts at restarting forks, thus reflecting a delayed mechanism of fork restart (a key prediction of their model). Interestingly, this type of defect (delayed stalled fork restart) was recently reported for BRCA2-defective cells (Chaudhuri et al., Nature 2016) and very recent evidence has shown that delayed fork restart and successful S phase completion in these conditions does require fork processing by MUS81 (Lai et al., Nature Comms 2017).

We measured the length of the restarted tracks as suggested. Consistent with our model, although the percentage of restarting forks of the <italic>53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells is recovered to a level similar as that of wild-type cells when recover time is prolonged to 40 min, the length of the restarted tracks is significantly shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that the activated BRCA1-dependent pathway in the <italic>53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells is a delayed mechanism of fork restart. Now these data were included and discussed in the revised manuscript (subsection “53BP1 and BRCA1 promote the fast and slow kinetics restart pathways, respectively”, last paragraph). We also cited the two references and discussed their relevance in the context of our data (subsection “53BP1-RIF1 and BRCA1 have new functions in the restart of stalled replication forks”, last paragraph). In fact, we speculate that BRCA2 might play a role in the cleavage-free replication restart pathway together with 53BP1 (See discussion below about BRCA2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows a reduction of DSBs in BRCA1-/- cells that seems counterintuitive based on the previous literature showing an increase in chromosomal aberrations in BRCA1-deficient cells after HU treatment (Chaudhuri et al., Nature, 2016).

Our model predicts that HU-induced DSBs are intermediates of the cleavage-coupled BIR pathway (the BRCA1 and MUS81-dependent fork restart pathway), and they should not directly lead to chromosomal aberrations. In other words, the production of these DSBs should lead to resolving and restart of the stalled replication forks. Conversely, disruption of this pathway is expected to cause reduced HU-induced DSBs, increased levels of stalled replication forks and chromosomal aberrations. Consistent with this model, it has been reported that MUS81 deficient mouse ES cells or human HeLa cells showed a reduction of DSBs and an increase in chromosomal aberrations after HU treatment (Hanada K et al., Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2007, PMID: 17934473; Pepe A and West SC, Cell Rep. 2014, PMID: 24813886). Thus, there is no direct correlation between HU-induced DSBs and chromosomal aberrations. Our data have showed that MUS81 and BRCA1 are in the same restart pathway to promote the cleavage of the stalled forks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G, H</xref>). Thus, our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> that the <italic>BRCA1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells showed a reduction of DSBs are not contradictory with the previous literature showing an increase in chromosomal aberrations in BRCA1-deficient cells after HU treatment (Chaudhuri et al., Nature, 2016).</p><p>We measured chromosomal aberrations in the <italic>BRCA1<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>HCT116 cells as suggested by the reviewers. Consistent with the previous literature (Chaudhuri et al., Nature, 2016), the <italic>BRCA1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCT116 cells also show an increase of HU-induced chromosomal aberrations (See below). These phenomena in the <italic>BRCA1<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>HCT116 cells are similar to those of the MUS81 deficient cells described previously (Hanada K et al., Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2007, PMID: 17934473; Pepe A and West SC, Cell Rep. 2014, PMID: 24813886). They are also consistent with the notion that MUS81 and BRCA1 act in the same fork restart pathway. <italic>53BP1<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>cells did not show an obviously increase of chromosomal aberration after short HU treatment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), although they did show an increase of DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G, H</xref>). It is possible that HU-induced DSBs in the <italic>53BP1<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>cells were efficiently repaired by the BIR pathway before entering into M phase. Because these data are not important for the topic of our story, we didn’t include them in the revised manuscript. But if the editor and reviewers request us to include the data, we will be glad to add them.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>BRCA1 suppresses chromosomal aberration upon replication stress.</title><p>Sketch above the graphs delineates experimental design.

We have tried iPOND very hard, but were unable to overcome the technical difficulties to detect SLX4 and MUS81. We have sought the advice from Dr. David Cortez, who developed the iPOND technology. According to him, iPOND-immuno-blot is limited to detect small proteins that have very good antibodies available, such as RPA, Histone H3 and PCNA. For large proteins, the antigen epitopes may be damaged by formaldehyde crosslinking, so that they will be difficult to detect by immunoblotting. He said “I don’t think western blots after iPOND for BRCA1, 53BP1, SLX4, and Mus81 will be useful or practical. Doubtful that anyone could do them successfully. A better approach might by immunofluorescence imaging.” Thus, we followed his advice and used immunofluorescence imaging.</p><p>We used FANCD2 as marker of stalled forks and examined the recruitment of the SLX-MUS complex to stalled forks during MiDAS after mild replication stress (0.2 μM aphidicolin) treatment.
