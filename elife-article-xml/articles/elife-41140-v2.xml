protein ensembles that travel ahead of the advancing replisome, dissolving duplex DNA into templates for DNA synthesis. Melting of the duplex arises from ATP dependent translocation of the helicase along single stranded (ss) DNA, paired with inclusion/exclusion of DNA strands from an internal chamber. In bacteria, replicative helicases are closed protein rings, and the mechanisms associated with their loading onto chromosomal DNA, which is effectively an infinitely long polymer with no free termini, remain to be clarified. To assemble such entities on DNA, bacteria use specialized loading factors that mediate opening of the protein ring, guiding of ssDNA into the exposed chamber, and, finally, sealing of the helicase with ssDNA trapped inside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Soultanas, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bell and Kaguni, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">O'Donnell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">O'Shea and Berger, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chodavarapu and Kaguni, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hauk and Berger, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bleichert et al., 2017</xref>).

However, relatively little is known about Stages II and III, as well as the transitions that link each stage, where the DnaB-helicase is opened and closed with ssDNA sequestered in its internal chamber. Although low-resolution structural and biochemical analyses provided insights into the DnaBâ¢DnaC complex (BC) (Appendix), the Stage II complex from bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arias-Palomo et al., 2013</xref>), important questions remain to be addressed. For example, (1) how does the helicase loader open the closed ring DnaB-helicase?, (2) how is helicase activity suppressed by the loader to prevent unwinding of DNA prior to firing of the origin?, and, (3) how does the helicase close once ssDNA has been admitted into the inner chamber, with concomitant relief of inhibition of helicase activity?</p><p>Below, we address molecular mechanisms that accompany capture of the helicase by the loader in Stage II, and the transitions that link this stage to prior and ensuing events of the loading pathway. We report on the structure of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DnaB-helicaseâ¢bacteriophage Î»P helicase loader complex (henceforth: BP) by single particle cryoEM at 4.1 Ã resolution. In the identified complex, we observe five Î»P loader molecules bound to the helicase at five consecutive DnaB subunit interfaces; the sixth DnaB interface has been breached, thus precluding a sixth Î»P from binding. We confirm the unanticipated B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>5</sub> stoichiometry by native mass spectrometry. The Î»P loader restructures layers in the DnaB helicase comprised of carboxy-terminal (CTD) and amino-terminal (NTD) domains into novel right-handed open spiral configurations. Restructuring breaks one of the six helicase subunit interfaces to produceÂ ~15 Ã andÂ ~20 Ã openings in the CTD and NTD layers, respectively; these openings are of sufficient size to enable access by ssDNA to the internal chamber of the DnaB-helicase. Furthermore, reconfiguration forces the CTD layer of the helicase into a restrained inactive conformation wherein the ATP hydrolytic and DNA-binding properties are diminished, if not abolished. The restrained configuration of the CTD tier is poised to relax into the active conformation on expulsion of the loader from the complex. The NTD layer is also an important locus of conformational changes, which both contributes to closing of the helicase and prepares the helicase to interact with components of the replisome. Our findings reveal insights into mechanisms of opening and closing of the helicase, and provide a coherent structural view of helicase loading at the origin of DNA replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Architecture and stoichiometry of the DnaB helicase â¢ Î»P helicase loader complex</title><p>The structure of the BP complex was determined using cryo electron microscopy (EM)Â and tomography to a resolution of 4.1 Ã (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplements 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, and Appendix).

Furthermore, we find that the CTDs exhibit an average helical twist ofÂ ~56.4Â° along the pseudo-helical axis.

Thus, the CTD tier in the BP complex adopts the constricted configuration.</p><p>The Î»P helicase loader reconfigures the CTD layer in the BP complex into a conformation that differs substantially from previously described DnaB structures. Reconfiguration arises from three broad types of changes: (1) displacements of the CTDs along the pseudo-helical axis to form the open right-handed configuration; the average pitch of the resulting entity isÂ ~40% shorter than the ensemble in the ssDNA bound complex, (2) changes to the helical twist of individual CTDs along the helical axis; the CTDs in the BP complex are underwound byÂ ~3.6Â° with respect to those in the closed planar ring and closed spiral forms, and (3) inclination of the CTDs toward the helical axis; this change yields nucleotide-binding sites with configurations that are nearly optimal for catalysis (below). Collectively, these changes cause the rupture of one of the six CTD interfaces, between subunits A and B, and produce aÂ ~Â 15 Ã gap between the two CTDs that span the breached interface; this gap is large enough to permit entry of ssDNA into the central chamber of the helicase.

However, the Î»P-binding site is more than 10 Ã from both the ATP and DNA-binding sites. Suppression of DNA binding and ATP hydrolytic activities must, therefore, arise indirectly, as a consequence of the structural changes described above. We find that alterations in the helical pitch, twist, and inclination of the CTD pseudo-helix in the BP complex combine to critically distort positions of six DNA-binding loops and the disposition of the subunits that form the composite ATP-binding sites.

Moreover, alterations to the relative orientations of the CTDs in the BP complex have remodeled the five filled sites into a configuration that is likely not optimal for catalysis.

Observation of a distorted ssDNA-binding site implies that the DnaB-helicase, while complexed to Î»P, may not bind ssDNA as in the Stage IV translocating complex. This result is consistent with suppression of a crosslink between DnaB and ssDNA derived from the OriÎ» replication origin when the Î»P loader is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Learn et al., 1997</xref>).

Comparison of the helical parameters of the NTD tier from the BP complex (Materials and methods) to those of the constricted closed ring form revealed an average helical rise per subunit ofÂ ~2.6 Ã, a helical pitch ofÂ ~7 Ã, and helical twist values per subunit that ranged fromÂ ~40Â° toÂ ~70Â° along the pseudo-helical axis.

By contrast, the CTD and NTD layers of DnaB in the BP complex make an angle ofÂ ~15Â°; the corresponding value for the Stage IV form isÂ ~7Â°.

These schemes depend on how subunits in the DnaB spirals seen in Stages II/III and IV are mapped onto each other; two mapping schemes are described in the discussion and below. To visualize the two closing models, the subunits that comprise the two DnaB spirals are laid out in linear space. The CTD and NTD of DnaB and their relationships in the hexamer are depicted with simple shapes. The âbottomâ and âtopâ of each spiral is indicated. Labels also indicate a chain identifier for each subunit, the nucleotide bound at subunit interfaces, and the type of DnaB isomer. <italic>Cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> isomers of DnaB are colored in blue and light yellow, respectively. For clarity, the Î»P helicase loader is not shown. (A)In closing scheme I, the CTDs of each subunit are mapped such that the positions of the âtopâ and âbottomâ of each spiral correspond. The CTDs are mapped as follows: BP: chain A (cis) â ssDNA complex: chain A (trans); BP: chain B (trans)â ssDNA complex: chain B (cis); BP: chain C (cis) â ssDNA complex: chain C (trans); BP: chain D (trans) â ssDNA complex: chain D (cis); BP: chain E (cis) â ssDNA complex: chain E (trans); BP: chain F (trans)â ssDNA complex: chain F (cis). Since the pattern of DnaB isomers differs in the two spirals, the mapping associated with closing scheme I implies that transition from the BP (Stage II/III) to the ssDNA complex (Stage IV) will be accompanied by a cis-to-trans isomerization of DnaB subunits. Isomerization involves disruption of the dimers in the NTD tier, rotation of the dissociated NTD, followed by reformation of the dimers, but with a distinct DnaB subunit. For example, in the Stage II complex, the NTD of subunit A is bound to subunit F. However, transition to Stage IV requires swapping of dimer partners such that chain A pairs with chain B, etc. (B)Closing scheme II involves an alternate mapping of CTDs in the two DnaB spirals as follows: BP: chain A (cis) â ssDNA complex: chain B (cis); BP: chain B (trans) â ssDNA complex: chain C (trans); BP: chain C (cis) â ssDNA complex: chain D (cis); BP: chain D (trans) â ssDNA complex: chain E (trans); BP: chain E (cis) â ssDNA complex: chain F (cis); BP: chain F (trans) â ssDNA complex: chain A (trans). In this alternate mapping, closing of the DnaB helicase involves dissociation of the CTD from chain A, followed by translocation from its original position in the BP complex at the âbottomâ of the spiral to its new position at the âtopâ of the spiral as indicated. Closing of the NTD tier, then, involves rotations of component NTD dimers <italic>en masse</italic>. The match between the pattern of DnaB isomers in the BP complex after translocation of the chain A CTD with that seen in the ssDNA complex implies that disruption and reformation of NTD dimers is not required. (We note that only the pattern of isomers has been matched, not the chain identifiers.) The pattern of nucleotide occupancy shown here is speculative as little is known about the nature of exchange and filling of sites during closing of the helicase. It is also clear that the same match of DnaB isomers during the transition from Stage II/III to IV could be achieved by allowing translocation of a CTD from the âtopâ to the âbottomâ of the spiral; we consider this scheme to be a variant of closing scheme II.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41140-fig8-figsupp2-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mechanism of opening the DnaB-helicase</title><p>The isolated <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaB helicase (Stage I) is known to be in equilibrium between two forms: dilated and constricted, with the dilated form representing the ground state; notably, nucleotide shifts the equilibrium towards the constricted state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Strycharska et al., 2013</xref>). However, binding of the Î»P helicase loader is not compatible with the dilated form; indeed, the NTD and CTD tiers of the BP complex, by virtue of arrangement and size of internal chamber, are found in the constricted form. As such, we envision that, during transition to Stage II of the assembly pathway, the ring-breaking Î»P helicase loader opens the closed DnaB-helicase by binding to the constricted form and forcing the CTD layer into an open right-handed pseudo-helical configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). Opening is accompanied by changes in the inclination and twist of individual CTDs with respect to the pseudo-helical axis. As well, reconfiguration leads to breach of one DnaB interface and aÂ ~Â 15 Ã opening in the CTD layer. Changes to the CTD layer alter the relative disposition of the NTD and CTD layers, and specify remodeling of the NTD layer into an open spiral. As with the CTD layer, one interface in the NTD tier is ruptured to produce aÂ ~Â 20 Ã opening in this layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>). Thus, binding of the Î»P helicase loader produces openings in the DnaB-helicase that are of sufficient size to permit access of ssDNA to the inner chamber.</p><p>It is, however, striking that the helicase is not just opened by the Î»P loader. Rather, it is forced into a configuration that represents an intermediate between the closed planar ring of the isolated helicase and the closed spiral of the ssDNA complex, albeit much closer to the latter than the former. We speculate that the loader forces the helicase into a tense or high-energy configuration, akin to a spring-loaded mouse-trap. This state prepares the helicase to accept ssDNA into its inner chamber, but prevents productive ATP hydrolysis or translocation on ssDNA via the mispositioning of critical amino acids, as suggested by biochemical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mallory et al., 1990</xref>). Thus, the loader may impede translocation by handcuffing the DnaB CTDs and the CTD-NTD linkers to prevent essential conformational changes expected of the âhand over handâ mechanism of the translocating species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Itsathitphaisarn et al., 2012</xref>). Configurational proximity of DnaB in the BP complex to the active conformation poises this state for translocation, requiring only the activating signal. The precise role for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis in the BP complex requires further clarification since the EM maps show presence of 5 ADP molecules (the site that spans the breach is empty), however, no nucleotide is seen in the native MS mass measurements.</p><p>An overall consequence of the formation of the BP complex is a change in the ssDNA-binding profile from non-specific in the isolated DnaB helicase to a preference for a sequence from the melted OriÎ» origin in the BP complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2,Â andÂ Appendix</xref>). This finding sheds new light on Stages II and III of the assembly pathway. We suggest that the ssDNA-binding site onÂ DnaB in the BP complex is severely compromised, if not completely disrupted, and unable to form the non-specific contacts to the phosphate backbone seen in the translocating form. Furthermore, the specific ssDNA-binding activity that we observe in the BP complex is likely distinct from that in the translocating form, and, we suggest, emerges from contacts made by the Î»P loader and not DnaB; these findings were anticipated by prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Learn et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shao, 2006</xref>). During Stages II/III, the specific contacts to origin ssDNA may not only act as a hand-brake to oppose motion of the helicase, but alsoÂ hint at a previously undescribed activity by Î»P as an origin specificity factor, which mediates delivery of DnaB to a specific sequence at the origin.</p><p>We observe that opening the DnaB-helicase requires five Î»P helicase loaders, which bind to consecutive interfaces; the ruptured sixth interface is not able to bind a sixth loader. The peculiar arrangement of isomers of DnaB protomers in the closed ring form suggests that the closed ring form of DnaB harbors two types of NTD interfaces (the CTD interfaces are equivalent), one of which (tail-to-tail) will likely require more energy to open than the second (head-to-tail) ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Strycharska et al., 2013</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and Appendix). Indeed, the interface that is breached in the BP complex is the weaker head-to-tail interface.</p><p>The distance between Î»P protomers does not suggest an extensive interface. Thus, we speculate that binding of individual loaders to DnaB could take place stochastically, with each binding event remodeling an interface until five have bound. In the case where the sixth interface is of the weaker head-to-tail type, the helicase ring would be opened as in the present structure. We note that nothing prevents assembly of an alternate B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>5</sub> complex in which the NTD tier interface to be disrupted would be of the tail-to-tail type; we speculate that such a complex may not open, and, thus, be non-productive for loading onto DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mechanism of closing of the DnaB-helicase</title><p>Activation of the DnaB-helicase for translocation on ssDNA requires eviction of the ring-breaking helicase loader and concomitant sealing of the breaches in the NTD and CTD layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). An extensive body of insightful work has documented engagement of the bacterial DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone apparatus at the lambda origin to partially dissolve the Î»P helicase loader from the BP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">LeBowitz et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mensa-Wilmot et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Wyman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Polissi et al., 1995</xref>). Comparisons to the ssDNA-DnaB complex (Stage IV) allow us to infer closing mechanisms that will accompany eviction of the Î»P loader during transition of the helicase to the active entity. In the first instance, eviction of the loader from DnaB allows the helical CTD tier to relax into the configuration of the ssDNA complex by deploying to its full helical pitch (~27 Ã). Second, departure of the loader permits the CTDs to adopt a relaxedÂ ~60Â° helical twist relationship around the pseudo-helical axis. Third, the DNA binding and the ATPase sites, freed of constraints enforced by Î»P, assume productive conformations. Origin-derived ssDNA enters the inner chamber with expulsion of the loader. One might speculate that ssDNA in the inner chamber could drive closure of the CTD layer forward in the assembly pathway to the spiral form of the ssDNA complex, rather than backwards to the planar form. Such a mechanism could also ensure quality control in that non-productive BP complexes without ssDNA do not mature into the active DnaB conformation. We speculate that expulsion of Î»P enables exchange of ADP in the BP complex for ATP, which must take place for DnaB to assume the translocation competent form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2</xref>). As well, the unfilled nucleotide site at the breached interface will bind ATP, and this will also further promote closing of the CTD tier. Lastly, the CTD tier, freed of restraining interactions imposed by the Î»P loader, can undergo conformational changes expected during translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Itsathitphaisarn et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Relaxation of the CTD tier owing to eviction of the helicase loader provides a reconfigured surface against which the NTD layer is remodeled. However, in contrast to the CTD layer, inferences about mechanisms of closing of the NTD layer depend on precise mapping of DnaB subunits in the spirals seen in Stages II/III and IV of the helicase loading pathway. In both entities, the spiral staircase-like configuration of the DnaB helicase can be considered to have distinct subunits populating its âtopâ (Chain B) and âbottomâ (Chain A) (âtopâ and âbottomâ of both spirals are separately defined based on positions of the CTD domains in the BP and ssDNA complexes). In addition, for our purposes here, âtopâ and âbottomâ are inverted from that in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Itsathitphaisarn et al., 2012</xref>). We note that there are two major ways to map subunits between DnaB spirals in Stages II/III and in Stage IV; these mappings imply radically different mechanisms of helicase closing, especially with respect to the NTD tier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In closing Scheme I, the âtopâ and âbottomâ subunits of each DnaB spiral are mapped as follows: BP: chain A â ssDNA: complex chain A, BP: chain B â ssDNA complex: chain B, etc. (We note that mapping in this context does not imply a structural alignment, but rather a point of spatial orientation). Notably, this arrangement maps the breached CTD interfaces, and concomitantly, the unfilled nucleotide-binding site, from both forms of DnaB onto one another. Also, all hexameric DnaB structures feature an arrangement of alternately configured monomers in which the orientation of the NTD is the locus of the differing conformations ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bailey et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Itsathitphaisarn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Stelter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Strycharska et al., 2013</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Termed <italic>cis</italic> (inner) and <italic>trans</italic> (outer), these conformations describe distinct configurations of DnaB monomers. In the <italic>cis</italic> monomer, a helical hairpin substructure in the NTD points toward the CTD of the same chain, while in the <italic>trans</italic> monomer, this hairpin points away from the parent CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> DnaB monomers alternate around the hexameric ring. Indeed, this feature gives rise to the unusual six-fold/three-fold arrangement of sub-domains in the complete hexamer. Notably, in the DnaB configuration found in the BP complex, we find the following pattern of isomers in the protomers of DnaB from the bottom of the spiral to the top: chain A (<italic>cis</italic>), chain B (<italic>trans</italic>), chain C (<italic>cis</italic>), chain D (<italic>trans</italic>), chain E (<italic>cis</italic>), chain F (<italic>trans</italic>). However, in the ssDNA complex, we observe that the pattern of isomers differs: chain A (<italic>trans</italic>), chain B (<italic>cis</italic>), chain C (<italic>trans</italic>), chain D (<italic>cis</italic>), chain E (<italic>trans</italic>), chain F (<italic>cis</italic>). Thus, the mapping of CTDs between the two spiral forms of DnaB in closing Scheme I implies that a substantial rearrangement of the NTD tier must occur on helicase closing; this change consists of a <italic>cis</italic> to <italic>trans</italic> isomerization of DnaB subunits. In this scheme, closing is accompanied by disruption of each dimer interface in the NTD tier, a rotation of each isolated NTD, followed by re-establishment of the dimer, but with an adjacent, and distinct, DnaB subunit. However, the extensive interface found in the NTD tail to tail dimer (BSA =~1800 Ã<sup>2</sup> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arias-Palomo et al., 2013</xref>)) is expected to specify a stable interaction, and, thus, pose energetic challenges to closing Scheme I.</p><p>A second closing scheme can be envisioned through an alternate mapping of DnaB spirals as follows: BP: chain A â ssDNA complex: chain B, BP: chain B â ssDNA complex: chain C, etc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2</xref>). By this scheme, closing of the helicase involves dissociation of the CTD from the chain A of the BP complex, followed by translocation from the âbottomâ of the spiral to its new position at the âtopâ of the spiral; presence of ADP in BP chain A could facilitate dissociation. Moreover, binding of ATP by the unfilled site (BP chain B) could stabilize the newly formed interaction with chain A after it has translocated. Also, owing to its presence at the breached interface, the CTD, and its associated linker helix, at the âbottomâ of the spiral makes the fewest contacts to neighboring subunits; these features could also enable dissociation and translocation to the âtopâ of the spiral. Following translocation of the chain A CTD, the pattern of DnaB isomers in the BP complex matches that in the ssDNA complex. Several features of this scheme are attractive: first, the CTD motion required to translocate from the âbottomâ of the spiral to the âtopâ is consistent with that in the âhand-over-handâ mechanism for translocation in the 5â to 3â direction along ssDNA proposed for DnaB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Itsathitphaisarn et al., 2012</xref>). Second, sealing of the breach in the NTD layer is achieved without the <italic>cis</italic>-to-<italic>trans</italic> isomerization of DnaB monomers, and concomitantly the energetically costly disruption of NTD dimers, required of scheme I. A similar scheme to closing scheme II has been proposed for closing the helicase in the <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaB-DnaC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arias-Palomo et al., 2013</xref>). A more precise description of the mechanism of closing of the DnaB helicase awaits results of additional experiments.</p><p>As well as sealing the breaches in DnaB, the NTD layer undergoes an additional change: expansion of the central chamber from the constricted to the dilated state. Both the NTD and CTD layer in the BP complex populate the constricted state, however, in the ssDNA complex, DnaB is found in a hybrid state, with the CTD layerÂ in the constricted state and the NTD layerÂ in the dilated state. In this context, we note that the dilated, but not the constricted form, of DnaB is competent to interact with DNA primase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bailey et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Strycharska et al., 2013</xref>). Transition from Stages II/III to Stage IV poises the DnaB helicase to interact with DNA primase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bailey et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Strycharska et al., 2013</xref>), a critical step prior to assembly of the replisome. In this context, the constricted state of the NTD layer of DnaB in Stages II/III may serve to ensure that downstream events associated with replisome assembly, which begins with recruitment of DNA primase to a dilated NTD, do not take place until helicase loading at origin DNA has completed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

In addition, the map enabled us to model five of six NTD-CTD linker segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2âfigure supplement 6C,D</xref>). As a result, we could unambiguously connect each NTD to its cognate CTD in the complete model of DnaB in the BP complex. Understanding relationships between each NTD and CTD enabled informative comparisons to be made with the closed planar (PDBÂ =Â 4NMN) and closed spiral forms (PDBÂ =Â 4ESV) of DnaB. Clear density was observed for five ADP molecules at the expected sites on DnaB; the nucleotide site formed by the CTDs that line the ruptured interface is vacant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2âfigure supplement 6B</xref>).

As noted main text, âtopâ and âbottomâ of the DnaB spiral are separately defined in the BP and ssDNA complexes by consideration of the position of the CTDs alone. Also, the terms âtopâ and âbottomâ, as we use them here, are inverted from that in reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Itsathitphaisarn et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>No atomic level information for the Î»P loader has been previously described. As such, an atomic model (~122/233 CÎ±) for the five Î»P protomers was constructed manually. The current resolution of our EM map did not allow the chain direction of Î»P to be determined, nor could amino acid side chains to be assigned to the structure. To address this limitation, we used CX-MS and protein-binding studies to determine that our EM maps included the carboxy-terminal domain of Î»P (Appendix and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Included in this segment is a rod-like density, which contacts theÂ CTD of DnaB (chain B) and lines the breached interface; this segment could not be accounted by the known structure of DnaB (Appendix).

Data collection and refinement statistics can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

The angle between the resulting planes from the NTD and CTD layers of DnaB was calculated as the arc-cosine of the quotient of the dot product and the cross product of the normal vectors of these planes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Native mass spectrometry</title><p>Native mass spectrometry (MS) of all samples (apo-BP, ssDNA-BP, <italic>A. aeolicus</italic> DnaB-DnaC) was carried out at a protein concentration of 5 ÂµM. ssDNA (Genewiz, LLC) in our experiments were of two types: (1) a 43-mer sequence (5â TGACGAATAATCTTTTCTTTTTTCTTTTGTAATAGTGTCTTTT 3â) derived from DNA unwinding element (DUE) of OriÎ» (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Learn et al., 1997</xref>) and (2) a series of thymidylate homopolymers of varying nucleotide length (TÂ 25Â nt, TÂ 35Â nt or TÂ 45Â nt). Protein samples were buffer-exchanged into native MS solution using Zeba microspin desalting columns (Thermo Scientific) with a 40 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO). The MS buffer contained 450 mM ammonium acetate, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM magnesium acetate, 0.01% Tween-20, and was selected to mimic the ionic strength of that in the cryo-EM samples. For samples containing ssDNA, the buffer-exchanged BP complex was incubated with nucleic acid at a molar ratio of 1:1.2 for 30 min on ice prior to native MS experiments. A 2â3 ÂµL aliquot of the buffer-exchanged sample was loaded into an in house fabricated gold-coated quartz capillary. The sample was then sprayed into an Exactive Plus EMR instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a static nanospray source. The MS parameters used are spray voltage, 1.0â1.4 kV; capillary temperature, 100Â°C; in-source dissociation, 10 V; S-lens RF level, 200; resolving power, 8750 at <italic>m/z</italic> of 200; AGC target, 0.5â3 Ã 10<sup>6</sup>; number of microscans, 5; maximum injection time, 200 ms; injection flatapole, 8 V; interflatapole, 4 V; bent flatapole, 4 V; high energy collision dissociation (HCD), 200 V; ultrahigh vacuum pressure, 8â9Â ÃÂ 10<sup>â10</sup> mbar; total number of scans, 100. The EMR instrument was mass calibrated using cesium iodide. The native MS spectra were visualized using the Thermo Xcalibur Qual Browser (version 3.0.63). Deconvolution was performed manually. For samples buffer-exchanged into native MS solution containing magnesium acetate, the deviations from expected mass ranged from 0.04% to 0.09% due to peak broadening from nonspecific magnesium adduction (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> for comparisons with mass measurements taken with protein samples without magnesium acetate). All mass spectrometric data were measured in the laboratory of Professor Brian Chait of The Rockefeller University.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Crosslinking mass spectrometry</title><p><italic>Ec</italic>DnaB-Î»P-OriÎ» derived ssDNA (0.2 mg ml<sup>â1</sup>, with a protein to DNA ratio of 1:1.2) was cross-linked with 2 mM disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) overnight at 4Â°C; the crosslinking reaction was quenched with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Isolated Î»P was not analyzed since it could not be produced in soluble form. We observed that crosslinking was more efficient when ssDNA was included in the crosslinking reaction. This factor, in combination with the finding that preparations of the BPâ¢ssDNA complex contained a single entity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), led us to analyze the ssDNA containing crosslinked sample; we reasoned that resulting MS data would arise from a more homogeneous preparation. Cross-linked samples were reduced with 25 mM DTT for 10 min at 70Â°C, alkylated with 100 mM 2-chloroacetamide at room temperature in the dark for 30 min, then separated by SDS-PAGE with a 3â8% Tris-Acetate gel (NuPAGE, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and stained with Coomassie-blue for visualization. The region containing proteins between 170 kDa and 460 kDa was excised, crushed, treated with trypsin overnight to generate cross-linked peptides as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Shi et al., 2015</xref>). Peptides were desalted and concentrated on C18 solid phase extraction material (Empore), loaded onto an EASY-Spray column (Thermo Fisher Scientific ES800: 15 cmÂ Ã75 Î¼m ID, PepMap C18, 3 Î¼m) via an EASY-nLC 1200 and gradient-eluted for online ESIâMS and MS/MS analyses with a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS/MS analyses of the top eight precursors in each full scan used the following parameters: resolution: 17,500 (at 200 Th); AGC target: 2Â ÃÂ 10<sup>5</sup>; maximum injection time: 800 ms; isolation width: 1.4 m/z; normalized collision energy: 24%; charge: 3â7; intensity threshold: 2.5Â ÃÂ 10<sup>3</sup>; peptide match: off; dynamic exclusion tolerance: 1500 mmu. Cross-linked peptides were identified from mass spectra by pLink, and peptide-spectrum matches were manually verified as previously established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Shi et al., 2015</xref>). The crosslinked lysine pairs provided by the above procedure were used to evaluate the BP model as described in the Appendix.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Roger McMacken for sharing unpublished data, to Mike OâDonnell for sharing expression plasmids, to the staff of the New York Structural Biology Center, including Bridget Carragher, Clint Potter and to the staff of the CUNY Advanced Science and Research Center (ASRC), including Tong Wang.

We thus turned to cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to obtain a reliable and unbiased initial model, as the advent of motion correction and gold grids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Russo and Passmore, 2014</xref>) made sub-tomogram averaging of small complexes possible. (A detailed description of the cryoET methods that we used appears here: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Noble et al., 2018</xref>)). Analysis of five tomograms (~1000 particles) resulted in three low resolutionÂ ~40 Ã initial models each of which resembled an oblong, cracked particle. Such an outcome would not have been suspected from the apparently symmetrical 2D averages obtained initially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In an attempt to improve the precision of particle picking and potentially detect lower contrast poses of the complex, we used the cryoET initial model for template-based particle picking. 2D projections of the initial model using EMAN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ludtke, 2016</xref>) enabled template-based identification of a larger set of 267,000 particles. With the subsequent 2D classification of a random subset of this dataset, it became immediately apparent that many new poses of the complex, which had not been previously identified within the cryo-EM dataset using Gaussian-based picking methods, most likely due to their lower contrast, were now present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Template-based particle selection using the cryoET model 2D projections was performed with Gautomatch. Three-dimensional (3D) classification of this larger set of particles (nÂ =Â 267,000, KÂ =Â 8) using the tomography-derived initial model served to identify intact BP particles. Of these classes, four contained deformed particles and were discarded, the remaining four were pushed forward to auto-refinement. Only one of the four auto-refined classes, which contained 91,632 particles, produced a high-resolution map. This particle stack was subjected to 2D classification in order to remove any particles that contained DnaB alone; the result was a clean stack of 90,833 BP complex particles. Post-processing produced a map with an overall resolution of 4.1 Ã (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref> ). Local resolution estimates indicate higher local resolution for map regions attributed to DnaB (accounting for roughlyÂ ~80% of map), whereas regions interpreted as Î»P exhibited comparatively lower local resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3C,D</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of our 4.1 Ã EM density map was aided by prior studies, which established the two-domain architecture of a DnaB protomer and described how its amino- (NTD) and carboxy-terminal domains (CTD) assemble into a two layer structure in the complete hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bailey et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bailey et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Strycharska et al., 2013</xref>). As no atomic model of the <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaB ortholog was available, we built separate homology models for the NTD (residues 1â173) and CTD (residues 203â441) segments of DnaB using the highest resolution coordinates available (NTD: PDB 2R5U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Biswas and Tsodikov, 2008</xref>), CTD: PDB 3BH0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wang et al., 2008</xref>)). Six copies each of the resulting models of the NTD and CTD were unambiguously placed in our EM density map. The six protomers were named A, B, C, D, E, and F in keeping with the nomenclature of PDB entryÂ =Â 4ESV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Itsathitphaisarn et al., 2012</xref>). Although individual NTD and CTD domains fit well into our map, their arrangement in the BP complex differs significantly from previously described DnaB structures. We could also build five of the six NTD-CTD linkers (residues 174â203, chains B, C, D, E, F). This feature of our model established anÂ unambiguous connection between each NTD and its cognate CTD in the model.</p><p>Our EM density map also showed clear density for 5 copies of the Î»P protein. In our maps, the structure of Î»P comprises a compact helical domain and an extended region terminated by an alpha helix. Since Î»P has no sequence homologs, nor is an atomic model available, this part of the density was built by hand. Notably, our model encompassesÂ <underline>&gt;</underline>50% (122/233 for Î»P1, 123/233 for Î»P2, 120/233 for Î»P3 and 124/233 for Î»P4 and Î»P5) of the expected number of alpha carbons for Î»P. We have termed the five Î»P protomers: Î»P1 (chain Z), Î»P2 (chain Y), Î»P3 (chain X), Î»P4 (chain W) and Î»P5 (chain V) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). At present, the resolution of our map in the Î»P region does not permit unambiguous mapping of the amino acid sequence to the structure, nor does the map allow for chain polarity to be established. As we discuss below, we used two orthogonal approaches: (1) binding studies with truncationsÂ of Î»P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>), and (2) cross-linking mass spectrometry (CX-MS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>) to tentatively conclude that the segment of Î»P visible in our maps represents the carboxy-terminal segment.</p><p>Although the model for the BP complex revealed by EM was consistent with the predominant form (B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>5</sub>) observed in our native MS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), we wondered whether other conformers or stoichiometric states were present. We, therefore, re-analyzed our EM data sets to address these questions. Template-based particle picking, as previously described, yielded 267,000 particles. 3D classification (KÂ =Â 8) in Relion produced only one class that refined to high resolution (Class 2 with 91,728 particles). We therefore set out to determine: (1) Is class 2 is a mixture of BP entities with stoichiometries other than B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>5</sub> (as implied by our native MS experiments)?; or (2) Can alternate sorting procedures reveal presence of other conformers of the B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>5</sub> species in our sample?</p><p>To this end, we subjected the 91,728 particles in class 2 (the stack generated before 2D classification was used to remove any non-BP particles) to heterogeneous refinement, homogenous refinement, and 2D classification in Cryosparc. Refinement encompassed a KÂ =Â 6 so that the six possible stoichiometric states of the BP complex, including B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>3</sub>, B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>4</sub>, B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>5</sub>, and B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>6</sub> could potentially be isolated. Heterogenous refinement refers to a procedure in which six individual initial models were used to initialize refinement of each of the six classes into which particles were sorted. By contrast, homogenous refinement refers to a procedure in which a single initial model was used to initialize refinement with six classes. This procedure produced distorted 3D volumes with the exception of classes that corresponded to the B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>5</sub> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5</xref>). Particles that were not distributed into the main class produced volumes lacking density for Î»P entirely; interestingly, these volumes resembled deformed non-planar DnaB particles. Furthermore, 2D classification in Cryosparc of class 2 confirmed that the particles in this class were of high quality. We did note presence of a small number (<underline>&lt;</underline>1.4%) of particles that appeared to correspond to the closed planar ring form of DnaB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5</xref>). However, elimination of these particles did not produce a higher resolution map, nor a map that was substantially different than the original.</p><p>We next interrogated our entire particle set (267,000 particles) for other conformers or stoichiometric states of the BP complex via 3D classification (KÂ =Â 6, using our 4.1 Ã BP map filtered to 40 Ã as a single initial model) and subsequent refinement of each resulting class in Cryosparc. This analysis produced two additional density maps which showed density for Î»P, however, no additional conformers or stoichiometric states of the BP complex were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5</xref>). We note a slightly different positioning for density corresponding to the NTD of DnaB chain A between these two additional maps;Â this may indicate that this region of the molecule is flexible.</p><p>The above analyses led us to conclude that the B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>5</sub> species reported by our EM density maps represents the only conformer and stoichiometric state in our sample. This view is supported by native MS experiments of both isolated BP and the BPâ¢ssDNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). The finding that two orthogonal techniques converged on the same value points to a physiological stoichiometry of B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>5</sub>. We also conclude that the B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>4</sub> and B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>6</sub> entities observed as minor components by the native MS are either (1) artifacts of the co-expression procedure used to the prepare the BP complex, or (2) unstable intermediates that do not survive our grid preparation procedure.</p></sec><sec id="s8" sec-type="appendix"><title>Establishment of the chain direction of Î»P in the BP complex</title><p>Efforts to build a complete atomic model of the Î»P helicase loader in the BP complex were stymied by the low resolution of portions of our density maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3E,F</xref>), and the lack of relatives for Î»P in the structural database. Nevertheless, we were able to reliably buildÂ ~122 alpha carbons, which representsÂ ~50% the complete sequence, and, less reliably, an additional 75 alpha carbons of one protomer (Î»P1, chain Z). However, neither the amino acid sequence nor the amino to carboxy (N to C) chain direction could be assigned with confidence from the density map alone.</p><p>To establish polarity of the Î»P chains in our model, we employed two orthogonal approaches: 1) a binding study with histidine tagged truncations of Î»P and 2) cross-linking mass spectrometry (CX-MS). Binding studies indicate that a carboxy-terminal construction of Î»P (residues 103â233) retains a robust interaction with DnaB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Pull-down experiments with the N-terminus of Î»P (residues 1â110) were stymied by the fact that this construct alone or when co-transformed with DnaB did not express under conditions attempted.Â The finding that the carboxy terminal segment of Î»P retained an interaction with DnaB, in combination with the observation of unresolved density adjacent to Î»P protomer Î»P1 (chain Z), which we attribute above to the amino-terminal domain of Î»P, led us to make the conservative assumption that the carboxy-terminal segment of Î»P is represented in the high contours of our EM map. As such, we fixed the direction of the protein chains corresponding to Î»P in the BP complex such that the last segment of visible density represents the carboxy-terminus; this segment is adjacent to the NTD-CTD linker helix. We have also tentatively assumed that the portion of Î»P built into the last segment of visible density represents the extremity of the amino acid sequence. Even though our model for Î»P contains no side chains, the assumptions made above imply an assignment of sequence to structure; this assignment should be considered tentative.</p><p>To verify assignment of the chain direction of Î»P in our model, we performed a cross-linking mass spectrometric (CX-MS) analysis using the disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) cross-linking agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Shi et al., 2015</xref>). DSS has a maximum length of 11.4 Ã, reacts with primary amines (eg. lysine side chains and the amino terminus) on proteins, and features a maximum reach threshold ofÂ ~30 Ã (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Merkley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Shi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p><italic>E. coli</italic> DnaB and the Î»P loader harbor 18 and 10 lysine residues, respectively, which allows for three types of crosslinks to be potentially observed: 1) intermolecular between DnaB and Î»P, 2) intra/intermolecular to DnaB, and 3) intra/intermolecular to Î»P. The CX-MS procedure provided a total 20 crosslinked peptides. 8 of these were in DnaB, eight between DnaB and Î»P, and four in Î»P. Notably, CX-MS is silent on whether the crosslinks in DnaB or Î»P arise from intramolecular or intermolecular interactions.</p><p>Evaluating our BP structural model against the CX-MS data is complicated by presence of six copies of DnaB and five copies of Î»P in the complex. Thus, a particular crosslinked peptide may arise from multiple instances of nominally equivalent, but distinct, lysine pairs; moreover, these pairs could arise from within or between subunits. Given these complications, we examined alpha carbon distances of all instances of pairs of lysine residues reported to be crosslinked by the CX-MS procedure; a crosslinked peptide was considered to be consistent with our model if the minimum distance between equivalent pairs of the underlying lysine residues was less than 30 Ã. By this criterion, 16 of 20 CX-MS derived peptides were found to be consistent with the BP model. Notably, residues in Î»P associated with the six crosslinked peptides explained by the BP model mapped to the carboxy terminalÂ ~60 residues of Î»P. Furthermore, the CX-MS data pointed to proximity of 3 positions on Î»P (K177, K200, and K229) to the CTD of DnaB.Â One crosslink (DnaB 373 â Î»P 200) was not explained by our model as the distance (~43 Ã) between the underlying pair of lysine residues exceeded the 30 Ã reach threshold of the DSS agent. In addition, three other crosslinks (DnaB 2 â Î»P 229; DnaB 2 â DnaB 373; Î»P 2 and Î»30) could not be evaluated as they involved residues that were not visible in our EM maps, and, thus, do not appear in our BP model. The CX-MS data support the chain polarity as featured in our model and precludes the possibility of the alternative polarity of Î»P (data not shown). A list of the CX-MS derived peptides and their relationship to our model appears in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>.Â The excellent agreement between theÂ CX-MS reported crosslinks and our BP structural model confirms the finding of the binding study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and validates our choice of chain direction of the Î»P loader in the complex.</p><p>Collectively, orthogonal data (binding study, CX-MS) establish that the carboxy-terminal segment of Î»P is visualized in our EM map and establish the N to C direction of Î»P in the model. We note that, as part of the analysis, our BP model includes an implied assignment of the Î»P sequence to the structure; this assignment should be considered tentative.</p></sec><sec id="s9" sec-type="appendix"><title>EM density corresponding to the amino terminal domain of Î»P</title><p>Inspection of our EM map at lower contours (four sigma in PyMol) reveals an additional region of EM density adjacent to the Î»P1 protomer (chain Z); this density likely represents this protomerâs missing amino terminal domain. The quality of the density is comparatively lower than other parts of the map, nevertheless, we were able to position several alpha helical segments along with some intervening connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3E,F</xref>). The finding that only a single Î»P protomer features extra density not only points to an unappreciated asymmetry in the BP complex, but also indicates presence of flexibility in the other Î»P NTD domains relative to their CTD domains in the BP complex.</p><p>We note that one of these helical segments appears to contact the CTD of subunit B, the subunit that lines the âtopâ of the DnaB spiral, and lines the cracked interface of the helicase. This rod-like density could not be accounted by the known structure of DnaB, and distance measurements allow us to rule out that this density corresponds to the linker helix of chain A of DnaB. First, this segment of density does not pack against DnaB as expected for the linker helix; Second, for this segment to be the DnaB linker helix from chain A, it would have to be close enough to link to the cognate NTD. Our distance measurements to do not allow for this possibility. For example, linking the density in question to the appropriate segments would require linker spans ofÂ ~39 Ã (before the linker helix) andÂ ~66 Ã (after the linker helix). However, these values exceed the maximum extent of the number of alpha carbons that could span this distance. For reference, the average distance for all DnaB protomers isÂ ~23 Ã andÂ ~13 Ã ahead of and behind the linker helix, respectively. In view of the above, we conclude that the linker helix and the accompanying linker segments of chain A are not visible on our maps. As such, we have modeled an alpha helix into the unaccounted density, and we tentatively conclude that this segment derivesÂ fromÂ the NTD of the P1 Î»P protomer in our model. In view of uncertainties associated with this segment, it does not appear in our PDB entry, but is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3F</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s10" sec-type="appendix"><title>Native mass spectrometry of the BP complex</title><p>The finding that five copies of the Î»P protein are bound to the DnaB-helicase was unanticipated and is at odds with prior measurements. Previous work implied a stoichiometry of B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mallory et al., 1990</xref>), while more recent measurements suggest B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fok, 2002</xref>). Moreover, efforts with the analogous DnaBâ¢DnaC complex also resulted in disparate stoichiometry estimates, with values ranging from B<sub>6</sub>C<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Makowska-Grzyska and Kaguni, 2010</xref>) to B<sub>6</sub>C<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kobori and Kornberg, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Galletto et al., 2003</xref>). A 25 Ã map of the DnaBâ¢DnaC complex obtained from a negative stain EM analysis shows density for six DnaC monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arias-Palomo et al., 2013</xref>). However, Kaguni et al. imply that the stoichiometry is B<sub>6</sub>C<sub>3</sub> when DnaB is a part of the DnaA-DnaB-DnaC pre-priming origin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Makowska-Grzyska and Kaguni, 2010</xref>).</p><p>To better understand the stoichiometry of the BP complex, we used native mass spectrometry (MS) to obtain accurate mass estimates. Our measurements indicate that the predominant species in our BP sample preparation exhibits a mass of 446.5 kDa (B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>5</sub>); additional species with masses of 473.1 kDa (B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>6</sub>) and 419.9 kDa kDa (B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>4</sub>) were also observed, though at lower intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). In comparison to the stoichiometric heterogeneity seen with our preparations of the BP complex, addition of a 13.1 kDa 43-mer ssDNA derived from the OriÎ» phage replication origin revealed a single entity with a mass of 459.5 kDa; this mass corresponds to the B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>5</sub> helicase loader complex bound to ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Moreover, elimination of stoichiometric heterogeneity in BP complexes is specific to the DNA sequence employed. For example, inclusion of thymidine homopolymers of varying nucleotide length (eg. T<sub>25</sub>, T<sub>35</sub>, and T<sub>45</sub>) showed no evidence of a protein-DNA complex, nor was the heterogeneity in subunit stoichiometry eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Two aspects of this finding are remarkable. First, isolated DnaB-helicase is not known to show preference for particular DNA sequences, and second, isolated DnaB-helicase is known to bind thymidine homopolymers, amongst other ssDNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bujalowski and Jezewska, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jezewska and Bujalowski, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jezewska et al., 1996</xref>). Thus, the nature of the contacts to ssDNA have radically changed: from non-specific in the isolated helicase to exhibiting a specificity in the loader complex for sequences derived from the replication origin. These preliminary data hint that DnaB, while complexed to the loader, may make few, if any, contacts to ssDNA. Second, our findings point to the possibility that contacts to origin-derived ssDNA might be predominantly, or even exclusively, made by the Î»P loader.</p><p>Both the BP and the BP-ssDNA complex samples were prepared in the presence of an excess of nucleotide. However, the procedure for preparing samples for native MS includes a step that removes nucleotides; this is done to reduce the extent of non-specific adduction of nucleotide to the entities of interest. In this context, we note that the measured masses for both the BP and the BP-ssDNA complex indicates that no nucleotide is bound to either complex. We infer from this observation that nucleotide is not necessary for stability of the BP complex. A parallel native MS analysis of the <italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic> DnaBâ¢DnaC complex reveals the presence of five ATP molecules, though not whether theyÂ are bound by DnaB or DnaC or some combination thereof (below); the differing results are likely due to a varying affinity for nucleotides by the associated complexes.</p><p>The observation that ssDNA derived from the oriÎ» replication origin eliminates subunit heterogeneity and stabilizes the B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>5</sub> entity leads us to conclude that the B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>6</sub> and B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>4</sub> species present in our preparations are likely unstable intermediates or artifacts of the recombinant method used to prepare the complex. Taken together, our structural and biophysical analyses firmly establish that the stoichiometry of the opened BP complex required for initiation of replication is DnaB: 6 and Î»P: 5. Notably, our stoichiometry estimate is entirely consonant with disposition of the CTDs in the BP complex. Of the six possible CTD interfaces that could provide binding sites for Î»P, only five are intact; the sixth interface has been ruptured owing to the open spiral configuration of the CTDs in the complex, and, thus, cannot productively bind a sixth Î»P.</p></sec><sec id="s11" sec-type="appendix"><title>Analysis of the structure of the Î» P helicase loader</title><p>Comparative structural analysis of the carboxy-terminal domain of the Î»P helicase loader against the PDB structure database using the Dali (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Holm and RosenstrÃ¶m, 2010</xref>), PDBefold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Krissinel and Henrick, 2004</xref>), and Phyre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kelley et al., 2015</xref>) tools revealed no close structural relatives.

To analyze these configurations, we employed the language of helical parameters commonly used to describe protein and DNA helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lu and Olson, 2003</xref>). Specifically, our analysis encompasses three parameters: (1) helical pitch, which refers to the length of one complete helical turn along the helix axis, (2) helical twist, which refers to the angle made by successive helical subunits parallel to the helix axis, and (3) helical inclination, which refers to rotation of the helical subunit along an axis perpendicular to the helical axis. The above parameters provide convenient handles for comparing the DnaB pseudo-helix in the BP complex to other pseudo-helical DnaB configurations.</p><p>To enable calculation of the above helical parameters, both the principal components of the closed planar forms were aligned to the Cartesian X, Y, and Z axes using the âorientâ command in PyMol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schrodinger LLC, 2017</xref>). The efficacy of this operation was verified by inspecting the Z coordinate of the center of mass of each domain (CTD, NTD). If aligned, the Z coordinates should lie on a plane perpendicular to the Z- axis; this is indeed the case. Subsequent superpositions aligns the pseudo-helical axes of the comparison DnaB tiers to the Z axis.</p><p>The right-handed pseudo-helical parameters of the CTD sub-structures of the DnaB helicase were determined by first aligning the appropriate portion of the three principal inertial axes of the closedÂ planarÂ constricted hexameric form of DnaB (PDBÂ =Â 4NMN)Â to the Cartesian X, Y, and Z axes (PyMolÂ orÂ MOLEMAN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kleywegt and Jones, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kleywegt, 2007</xref>)). In a second step, the DnaB components of the ssDNA complex (PDBÂ =Â 4ESV) and the BP complex were aligned to one subunit of the planar closed constricted DnaB hexamer (PDBÂ =Â 4NMN). The rise per DnaB subunit was calculated by subtracting the Z coordinate from the center of masses of the spiral and planar forms (eg. 4ESVChainAâ¢CTD â 4NMNChainAâ¢CTD, BPChainAâ¢CTD â 4NMNChainAâ¢CTD, etc); this procedure was repeated for each subunit.

The average helical twist value excluded DnaB subunit B, which is located adjacent to the ruptured interface at the top of the helical spiral; this subunit displays a twist ofÂ ~78Â° and represents an outlier.

Moreover, both proteins inhibit the ATPase and, concomitantly, the helicase activity of DnaB; both deliver the helicase to cognate origins; both bind to ssDNA and influence binding of DNA by DnaB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wahle et al., 1989a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wahle et al., 1989b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mallory et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Learn et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davey et al., 2002</xref>); both require eviction of the loader for activation of the helicase. However, DnaC and Î»P are completely unrelated in amino acid sequence and structure, and their eviction from the origin complex proceeds via distinct mechanisms. For DnaC, ATP dynamics in its AAAÂ +ATPase domainÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wahle et al., 1989a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mott et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bell and Kaguni, 2013</xref>), along with other protein binding events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Makowska-Grzyska and Kaguni, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chodavarapu et al., 2015</xref>) are significant features in its eviction from the origin complex. By contrast, Î»P neither binds nor hydrolyzes ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Biswas and Biswas, 1987</xref>); rather, eviction, and concomitant helicase activation, require engagement of the host DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone machinery to partially unfold the Î»P protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">LeBowitz et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mensa-Wilmot et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Wyman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Polissi et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>The diversity in biochemical mechanisms is also reflected in the structures of the various complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). The low-resolution structure of the <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaBâ¢DnaC (BC) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arias-Palomo et al., 2013</xref>) shows an arrangement of NTD and CTD layers that resemble those seen in the BP complex (a high resolution comparison must await availability of an atomic model of the BC complex). Although there is overlap in the binding sites on the helicase for the two loaders, the stoichiometry and disposition of the helicase loader proteins differ substantially between the two complexes. First, the BP complex harbors five copies of the loader whereas six copies of DnaC reside in the BC complex. To provide further context for the unanticipated stoichiometry differences between the two loader complexes, we extended our native MS experiments to the <italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic> DnaBâ¢DnaC (BC) ensemble. These experiments revealed a single entity of massÂ =Â 485.3 kDa; this mass corresponds to a stoichiometry of B<sub>6</sub>C<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and includes 5 ATP molecules. The measured stoichiometry is in agreement with prior structural and biochemical analysesÂ ofÂ theÂ <italic>E.Â coli</italic>Â entity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kobori and Kornberg, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Galletto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arias-Palomo et al., 2013</xref>). Second, each Î»P loader binds at a DnaB subunit interface, and, consequently, contacts two subunits. By contrast, in the BC complex, each DnaC molecule appears to contact a single DnaB chain in the hexamer, although hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometryÂ (HDX-MS) experiments point to additional contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chodavarapu et al., 2015</xref>), including the possibility of contacts to an adjacent subunit. Furthermore, each loader employs a distinct segment to complete an extended binding site on DnaB. In addition to the compact helical domain, Î»P sends out its carboxy terminal segment to complete its extended binding site. By contrast, DnaC, in addition to contacts mediated by the AAA+Â domain, deploys its amino terminal 75 residues to complete the binding site with DnaB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arias-Palomo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chodavarapu et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, theÂ HDX-MS analysis of this interaction predicts that DnaC will contact two regions of DnaB (295â304 and 431â435) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chodavarapu et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, both predicted areas lie within the interface between DnaB and Î»P. Not only does this result provide support for a shared binding site between the two ring breakers DnaC and Î»P, but also highlights how bacteria and bacteriophage Î» converged on similar helicase opening mechanisms, but which are implemented distinctly by proteins entirely unrelated in sequence or structure.</p></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="SA1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41140.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Botchan</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of California, Berkeley</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses.

The contribution is captured by the following summary.</p><p>The loading of replicative helicases onto DNA, often assisted by dedicated loader proteins, is an essential step during the initiation of DNA replication. In the manuscript &quot;Mechanisms of Opening and Closing of the Bacterial Replicative Helicase&quot;, Chase et al., determine a cryo-EM structure of the <italic>E. coli</italic> replicative helicase, DnaB, in complex with the helicase loader protein from bacteriophage Î» at an average resolution of ~4.1 A. Surprisingly, the structure shows that the DnaB hexamer binds 5 copies of the phage loader protein at its C-terminal side, with each Î» P associating with two adjacent DnaB protomers. This unusual stoichiometry is supported by native mass spectrometry. In the BP complex structure, the DnaB hexamer adopts a constricted and spiral conformation that leads to a break in both the NTD and CTD tiers of the DnaB ring. This gap is wide enough to allow ssDNA to enter the central cavity and therefore supports a ring-breaking mechanism for loading of the <italic>E. coli</italic> replicative helicase. The authors further note that the DnaB ATPase ring is held in a restrained configuration that prevents the DNA binding loops and ATPase centers to adopt a conformation competent for ssDNA binding and ATP hydrolysis, respectively. However, this conformation likely is in some equilibrium with other states (see below for an issue that should be addressed in revisions). Overall these observations lead the authors to propose detailed models for both ring opening and closing of DnaB during replication initiation.</p><p>Several crystal structures of DnaB have been determined previously, either in isolation or in complex with ssDNA, but structural information of DnaB-loading intermediates has been limited to a 25 A structure of DnaB in complex with its cognate <italic>E. coli</italic> loader protein, DnaC. The structure of the BP complex determined by Chase et al. thus represents the first near-atomic resolution structure of a DnaB-loader complex in the pre-loading state. Although the conformation of DnaB in the BP complex structure is very reminiscent of its configuration in the DnaBC complex, the new structure allows the authors to refine existing models for DnaB ring opening and closing and illustrates how two distinct loader proteins can remodel DnaB in a similar manner.</p><p>Suggested revisions:</p><p>1) The authors find that the inclusion of ssDNA improves the homogeneity of the complex when analyzed by native mass spectrometry and that it eliminates low abundant B6-P4 and B6-P6 assemblies. Moreover, it seems logical to assume that the use of a non-hydrolyzable nucleotide instead of ATP (which is hydrolyzed to ADP in the map) might stabilize the complex further. It is unclear why the authors did not attempt either approach, which may provide a higher resolution structure and would allow for more confident modeling of the Î» P protein. Further explanation of the authors' reasoning would be appreciated.</p><p>2) The conformation of DnaB in the BP complex seems very similar to its conformation in the <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaB-DnaC complex. Although the authors acknowledge this in the main text, it would be useful to include this comparison in figure form as well, both for the ATPase domains and the NTDs.</p><p>3) In Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D, the authors show co-purification of untagged DnaB with the His-tagged C-terminal domain of Î» P (aa 103-233) to support that the C-terminal region of Î» P binds DnaB. However, this biochemical experiment lacks important controls, including a) a pull-down performed in the absence of His-tagged Î» P protein to control for unspecific association of DnaB with beads and b) a pull-down using a tagged N-terminal fragment of Î» P, which should not associate with DnaB according to the authors' interpretation. Moreover, the full-length Î» P protein and the C-terminal fragment 103-233 both migrate around 20kDa in the gel despite their significantly different molecular weights. It would be helpful if the authors commented on this discrepancy.</p><p>4) It is very difficult to identify individual particles in Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D. The authors should consider showing a micrograph with better signal to noise and only highlight a few picked particles by circles. In addition, the 8 volumes that resulted from the 3D classification should be shown. There is also a discrepancy in the reported resolution of the cryoET reconstruction (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B) in the legend and text (40 vs 25 A), which should be clarified.</p><p>5) To demonstrate agreement of the built model with the EM map, the authors should provide the FSC comparing model with EM map.</p><p>6) Figure 2âfigure supplement 5: It is unclear what the authors mean by &quot;heterogeneous&quot; and &quot;homogenous&quot; refinement and, therefore, these approaches should be explained.</p><p>7) Figure 6B: The authors' conclusion that the ATPase sites in the BP complex are misaligned is only weakly supported by the data shown. The authors report movements with distances much lower than the resolution of the structure. Although the authors acknowledge that the reported distances are only tentative, this practice is problematic, and we recommend that the authors should remove these distance measurements. In addition, it would be important to show densities for the side chains in the BP complex at the ATPase sites to demonstrate that the positioning of these side chains in the BP model is reliably supported by density in the map. Likewise, the authors should show densities for the bound nucleotide to support their conclusion that five ATPase sites are occupied by ADP instead of ATP.</p><p>8) A reviewer was confused about the exact state of the Stage II complex. Because Stage III is the loader-origin-helicase complex, so, Stage II as described in this manuscript should be competent and ready to bind the origin DNA. But in several places, it was stated that the structure does not hydrolyze ATP (ATP binding sites are disrupted) and cannot bind ssDNA (Figure 6) (subsection âThe DNA and ATP binding sites are disrupted in the DnaBâ¢ Î»P complexâ). This seems to conflict with the mass spec data indicating the structure's ability to bind a 43-mer ori-lamda ssDNA (Figure 3D), and the fact that five ADP molecules occupy the structure â meaning the structure has hydrolyzed ATP. This issue is alluded to in the summary- with a potential resolution? If the reported structure is indeed incompatible with DNA binding, does this mean the structure is a non-functional structure not found in a cell or perhaps a minor conformation in the cell?</p><p>9) Related to the point in 8), the native mass spec shows the formation of DnaB-loader P-43-mer DNA (Figure 3D). Did the authors attempt to visualize the structure, and if yes, is DNA visible, and is the structure distinct from the one reported here which is in the absence of DNA?</p><p>10) Native mass spec revealed three species 6:5 (dominant), 6:4, and 6:6 stoichiometric binding. Did the authors identify the two non-dominant species (B6P4 and B6P6) in their 3D classification scheme of the cryo-EM dataset?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41140.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggested revisions:</p><p>1) The authors find that the inclusion of ssDNA improves the homogeneity of the complex when analyzed by native mass spectrometry and that it eliminates low abundant B6-P4 and B6-P6 assemblies.

Immediately prior to taking the MS spectra, the samples were buffer exchanged into a volatile salt that does not include nucleotide. Nucleotide is excluded from this buffer because we found that this reduced the extent of non-specific adduction to the entities of interest and provided cleaner spectra. Inclusion of nucleotide during buffer exchange led to nonspecific binding and broadening of the MS peaks, which complicated their interpretation. From our native MS experiments, we infer that although nucleotide may play a role in formation of the BP complex, it does not appear necessary for stability of the BP complex. The finding that the BP complex is stable without nucleotide (both in the absence and presence of ssDNA) led us not to prioritize cryoEM experiments with non-hydrolysable ATP analogues. However, this will be something we pursue in the future.</p><p>In parallel, we performed native MS measurements with the distinct <italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic> DnaB-DnaC helicase â helicase loader (BC) complex (Figure 8âfigure supplement 1 panel A).

In contrast to the BP complex, mass estimates for the BC complex reveal presence of five ATP molecules. From the comparison of the MS results of two samples, we conclude that the buffer exchange procedure differentially removes nucleotide molecules based on the individual complexâs affinities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The conformation of DnaB in the BP complex seems very similar to its conformation in the E. coli DnaB-DnaC complex.

Multiple efforts to express this segment of Î» P, in isolation or when co-expressed with DnaB, failed to show any expression of truncated Î» P whatsoever. However, during co-expression, DnaB was clearly expressed; this observation suggests that our expression trials succeeded, but that the Î» P construct of interest failed to express.

As such, the interaction between tagged Î»P (103-233) and untagged DnaB documented in panel D of Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 is specific and robust. We have adjusted the text to reflect that outcome of this control experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is very difficult to identify individual particles in Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D. The authors should consider showing a micrograph with better signal to noise and only highlight a few picked particles by circles. In addition, the 8 volumes that resulted from the 3D classification should be shown. There is also a discrepancy in the reported resolution of the cryoET reconstruction (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B) in the legend and text (40 vs 25 A), which should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the micrograph shown in Figure 2âfigure supplement 2 is difficult to identify individual particles. To remedy this issue, we have: (1) changed the displayed micrograph to one with higher contrast, and (2) elected to circle particles identified by template-based particle picking on the top half of the micrograph only, while leaving the bottom half of the micrograph unobstructed.</p><p>To address the question of the 8 volumes from the 3D classification, we have created an additional figure (Figure 2âfigure supplement 4). This figure depicts how we used the 3D classification procedure to clean our particle stack, as described in the Material and methods section and Appendix.</p><p>On the question of the resolution of the cryoET volume; this is challenging to determine due to the relatively low number of particles used to generate the model (1,000 particles were used to generate 3 cryoET volumes, each of which was nearly identical regarding global architecture). We estimate by visual comparison to filtered maps that the cryoET volume is in the 30-40 Ã range and have edited the text in the manuscript to reflect this. Our use of cryoET to generate a low resolution model of the BP complex is described here (Noble et al., 2018). All instances of the reported resolution have been set to the same value.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) To demonstrate agreement of the built model with the EM map, the authors should provide the FSC comparing model with EM map.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this by using the Mtriage functionality within the Phenix software suite to compare our cryoEM map to our model. We have reported the data in a FSC plot in panel B of Figure 2âfigure supplement 3. The resulting FSC comparing the model with our EM map results in two independently refined half-sets converging at 4.1 Ã; this value is in agreement with the resolution of our map.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 2âfigure supplement 5: It is unclear what the authors mean by &quot;heterogeneous&quot; and &quot;homogenous&quot; refinement and, therefore, these approaches should be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We have explained and defined these approaches more clearly in the Appendix of this manuscript (section titled âSingle-Particle CryoEM and CryoET Analysis of the BP Complex). We have also altered panels A and B of Figure 2âfigure supplement 5 to more clearly represent this procedure. Heterogenous refinement strategies involve the use of multiple ab initio models which each class is refined against, whereas homogenous refinement uses a single ab initio model for initialization of six classes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 6B: The authors' conclusion that the ATPase sites in the BP complex are misaligned is only weakly supported by the data shown. The authors report movements with distances much lower than the resolution of the structure. Although the authors acknowledge that the reported distances are only tentative, this practice is problematic, and we recommend that the authors should remove these distance measurements. In addition, it would be important to show densities for the side chains in the BP complex at the ATPase sites to demonstrate that the positioning of these side chains in the BP model is reliably supported by density in the map. Likewise, the authors should show densities for the bound nucleotide to support their conclusion that five ATPase sites are occupied by ADP instead of ATP.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the distance measurements but left the red arrows to reflect our best estimate for how the hairpin sub-structure has become mis-aligned at the level of the associated Î± carbon of residues known to be important for nucleotide hydrolysis (K440 and R442).</p><p>We have added Figure 2âfigure supplement 5 (panel B) that displays densities for the five nucleotide binding sites populated with ADP. These illustrations include insets of density that corresponds to the five observed ADP molecules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) A reviewer was confused about the exact state of the Stage II complex. Because Stage III is the loader-origin-helicase complex, so, Stage II as described in this manuscript should be competent and ready to bind the origin DNA. But in several places, it was stated that the structure does not hydrolyze ATP (ATP binding sites are disrupted) and cannot bind ssDNA (Figure 6) (subsection âThe DNA and ATP binding sites are disrupted in the DnaBâ¢ Î»P complexâ). This seems to conflict with the mass spec data indicating the structure's ability to bind a 43-mer ori-lamda ssDNA (Figure 3D), and the fact that five ADP molecules occupy the structure â meaning the structure has hydrolyzed ATP. This issue is alluded to in the summary- with a potential resolution? If the reported structure is indeed incompatible with DNA binding, does this mean the structure is a non-functional structure not found in a cell or perhaps a minor conformation in the cell?</p></disp-quote><p>In the introduction, we have clarified that in Stages II and III the ATPase and ssDNA translocation activities are suppressed in the helicase â helicase loader complex, but that the complex retains the ability to bind ssDNA. As is noted above, our native MS data reveals that the BP complex binds to Î» phage origin derived ssDNA, but not to other non-origin sequences of comparable length (Figures 3âfigure supplement 2). However, the native MS data is silent on which entity in the complex is actually making contacts to ssDNA. DnaB is not known to show a preference for any ssDNA sequence, and, as such, it is striking that on binding the loader, the complex now exhibits a preference for origin derived ssDNA. From the appearance of the ssDNA binding site on DnaB, we infer that binding by DnaB may be severely disrupted, if not completely abolished. In the discussion, we have clarified that, taken together, our data imply that most, if not all, of the contacts to origin derived ssDNA may be made by the Î»P loader and that this finding sheds light on the nature of Stage III. As well, we propose that the structure captured by our EM analysis in indeed a physiological conformer, and that it might perform a previously uncharacterized activity: an origin specificity factor for the DnaB helicase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Related to the point in 8), the native mass spec shows the formation of DnaB-loader P-43-mer DNA (Figure 3D). Did the authors attempt to visualize the structure, and if yes, is DNA visible, and is the structure distinct from the one reported here which is in the absence of DNA?</p></disp-quote><p>Structural analysis of the BP-origin ssDNA complex is ongoing in the Jeruzalmi research group. At this time, our efforts are too preliminary for discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Native mass spec revealed three species 6:5 (dominant), 6:4, and 6:6 stoichiometric binding. Did the authors identify the two non-dominant species (B6P4 and B6P6) in their 3D classification scheme of the cryo-EM dataset?</p></disp-quote><p>We have exhaustively probed our cryoEM dataset for additional stoichiometries of the BP complex, and have not found evidence of the B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>4</sub> or B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>6</sub> complexes suggested to be present in our preparation by our native MS experiments. In addition to the B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>5</sub> volumes that we have discussed in the manuscript, we find evidence for a) incomplete DnaB rings or b) non-planar, cracked DnaB absent density corresponding to Î» P. Our working explanation for this is that either these two populations (B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>4</sub> or B<sub>6</sub>P<sub>6</sub>) are not stable enough to survive the plunge freezing process during grid preparation or that these populations were artifacts associated with the method of complex preparation. These efforts are detailed in the Appendix.</p></body></sub-article></article>
