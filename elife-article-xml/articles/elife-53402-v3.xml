detrimental effects on cell survival and genomic stability, and are related to cancer and other human diseases. In this study, we identified microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin Kif2C as a protein associated with DSB-mimicking DNA templates and known DSB repair proteins in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts and mammalian cells. The recruitment of Kif2C to DNA damage sites was dependent on both PARP and ATM activities. Kif2C knockdown or knockout led to accumulation of endogenous DNA damage, DNA damage hypersensitivity, and reduced DSB repair via both NHEJ and HR. Interestingly, Kif2C depletion, or inhibition of its microtubule depolymerase activity, reduced the mobility of DSBs, impaired the formation of DNA damage foci, and decreased the occurrence of foci fusion and resolution. Taken together, our study established Kif2C as a new player of the DNA damage response, and presented a new mechanism that governs DSB dynamics and repair.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA can be damaged in many ways, and a double strand break is one of the most dangerous. This occurs when both strands of the double helix snap at the same time, leaving two broken ends. When cells detect this kind of damage, they race to get it fixed as quickly as possible. Fixing these double strand breaks is thought to involve the broken ends being moved to 'repair centers’ in the nucleus of the cell, but it was unclear how the broken ends were moved.</p><p>One possibility was that the cells transport the broken ends along protein filaments called microtubules. Cells can assemble these track-like filaments on-demand to carry cargo attached to molecular motors called kinesins. However, this type of transport happens outside of the cell’s nucleus, and while there are different kinesin proteins localized inside the nucleus, their roles are largely unknown.</p><p>In an effort to understand how broken DNA ends are repaired, Zhu, Paydar et al. conducted experiments that simulated double strand breaks and examined the proteins that responded. The first set of experiments involved mixing cut pieces of DNA with extracts taken from frog eggs or human cells. Zhu, Paydar et al. found that one kinesin called Kif2C stuck to the DNA fragments, and attached to many proteins known to play a role in DNA damage repair. Kif2C had previously been shown to help separate the chromosomes during cell division. To find out more about its potential role in DNA repair, Zhu, Paydar et al. then used a laser to create breaks in the DNA of living human cells and tracked Kif2C movement. The kinesin arrived within 60 seconds of the DNA damage and appeared to transport the cut DNA ends to 'repair centers'. Getting rid of Kif2C, or blocking its activity, had dire effects on the cells' abilities to mobilize and repair breaks to its DNA. Without the molecular motor, fewer double strand breaks were repaired, and so DNA damage started to build up.</p><p>Defects in double strand break repair happen in many human diseases, including cancer. Many cancer treatments damage the DNA of cancer cells, sometimes in combination with drugs that stop cells from building and using their microtubule transport systems. Understanding the new role of Kif2C in DNA damage repair could therefore help optimize these treatment combinations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Kif2C</kwd><kwd>MCAK</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>mobility</kwd><kwd>dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA172574</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peng</surname><given-names>Aimin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>148982</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kwok</surname><given-names>Benjamin H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>152920</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kwok</surname><given-names>Benjamin H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009326</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kwok</surname><given-names>Benjamin H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Kinesin Kif2C is recruited to DNA damage sites, modulates the mobility and dynamics of DNA damage foci, and promotes DNA double strand break repair.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA damage is frequently induced by both endogenous metabolic products and exogenous genotoxic agents. Upon DNA damage, the cell promptly activates the cellular DNA damage response (DDR), a surveillance mechanism that leads to DNA repair, cell cycle arrest (checkpoint), and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li and Zou, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lou and Chen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou and Elledge, 2000</xref>). Among all types of DNA damage, DNA double strand break (DSB) is of great toxicity and deleterious consequences. It is therefore crucial for cells to efficiently repair DSBs, whereas defects in DSB repair have been linked to cancer, immunodeficiency, neurological diseases, and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jalal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sancar et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The cell employs two major evolutionarily-conserved mechanisms, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) to repair DNA DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goodarzi and Jeggo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sancar et al., 2004</xref>). HR restores the broken DNA strands using an intact strand as template, and is available in S and G2 phases after replication of chromatin DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jasin and Rothstein, 2013</xref>). By comparison, NHEJ directly re-ligates the two broken ends of a DSB, and is accessible throughout the entire interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis and Chen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lieber, 2010</xref>). In addition to these core pathways of DSB repair, the spatiotemporal regulation of DSBs has emerged as a new aspect of DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amitai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hauer and Gasser, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krawczyk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lemaître and Soutoglou, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lottersberger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marcomini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marnef and Legube, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miné-Hattab and Rothstein, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Neumaier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schrank et al., 2018</xref>). Potentially, the physical mobility of DSBs mediates the sub-nuclear organization and positioning of DSBs to facilitate DNA repair. However, the precise mechanisms which propel and regulate DSB mobility remain largely obscure.</p><p>Microtubules (MTs) are composed of α/β tubulin dimers, and responsible for a variety of cell movements, including the intracellular transport of various vesicles and organelles, and separation of chromosomes in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dogterom et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forth and Kapoor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maizels and Gerlitz, 2015</xref>). For example, cargos, including proteins, nucleic acids and organelles, can be moved along MTs by the action of motor proteins which utilize ATP hydrolysis to produce force and movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dogterom et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forth and Kapoor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maizels and Gerlitz, 2015</xref>). A major group of molecular motors involved in intracellular transport are kinesins named Kif (kinesin superfamily protein). There are several dozen Kifs in mammalian cells to constitute at least 14 kinesin families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hirokawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lawrence et al., 2004</xref>). Unlike most kinesins, Kif2C, also known as Mitotic Centromere Associated Kinesin or MCAK, and other members of the kinesin-13 family do not utilize their ATPase activities to transport cargos, but rather to depolymerize MTs by disassembling tubulin subunits at polymer ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Desai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunter et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Walczak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wordeman and Mitchison, 1995</xref>). During cell division, Kif2C regulates MT dynamics and ensures the proper attachment of MTs to kinetochores, and thereby directing the positioning and movement of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ganem et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kline-Smith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Manning et al., 2007</xref>). In this study we identify and characterize Kif2C as a new factor involved in DSB repair; Kif2C is required for efficient DSB repair via both HR and NHEJ; and interestingly, Kif2C facilitates DSB mobility and modulates the formation, fusion, and resolution of DNA damage foci.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Kif2C associates with DSB-mimicking substrates and DNA repair proteins</title><p>As described in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>), we utilized DNA DSB-mimicking dA-dT oligonucleotides to isolate potential DNA damage-associated proteins in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract, a cell-free system well-defined for studying DNA damage repair and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lupardus et al., 2007</xref>).

This effort recovered a number of well-established DNA damage response proteins, including Ku70/Ku80, a DSB end binding complex, H2AX, a histone variant that is phosphorylated in chromatin regions flanking DSBs, and PARP1, an early responder of various DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The association of Kif2C with these DNA damage factors was subsequently confirmed using both pull-down and immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Treatment with DNase did not disrupt the protein association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that it was not mediated by DNA. It has been revealed that the catalytic function of Kif2C is mediated through a motor domain located in the middle region of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ems-McClung et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maney et al., 2001</xref>).

Interestingly, PARP inhibition disrupted the initial recruitment of Kif2C to laser-induced DNA damage sites; in the presence of a PARP inhibitor (PARPi), Kif2C slowly accumulated at DNA damage sites at about 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). By contrast, the sustained, but not the initial, recruitment of Kif2C was dependent on ATM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>).</p><p>To reveal additional molecular insights into the DNA damage recruitment of Kif2C, we generated multiple truncated segments of Kif2C, and examined their localization in laser-irradiated cells. Interestingly, the N-terminus of Kif2C exhibits efficient recruitment to DNA damage sites; the middle region of Kif2C containing the catalytic motif was very weakly enriched at DNA damage sites; and the C-terminus of Kif2C did not accumulate at DNA damage sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). Consistent with the strong recruitment of Kif2C N-terminus to DNA damage sites, a Kif2C mutant deleted of the N-terminus was deficient in the DNA damage recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). To identify minimal elements within the N-terminus that mediate DNA damage recruitment, we generated a series of truncation mutants within the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Interestingly, the efficient recruitment of Kif2C N-terminus depended on both a short five amino acid (aa 86–90) and the neck domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). The neck domain of Kif2C was shown to play a role in MT depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maney et al., 2001</xref>), hence, our study indicates an additional function of this domain in the DNA damage recruitment of Kif2C. By comparison, the aa 86–90 region lies outside of the minimal functional domain of Kif2C’s MT-depolymerizing activity and is not associated with any known mitotic functions of Kif2C. Interestingly, both of these motifs are important for Kif2C recruitment to DNA damage sites as full-length Kif2C deleted of either one exhibited reduced recruitment to the sites of laser cut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref>). Consistent with the recruitment deficiency, these mutants also exhibited reduced association with DNA repair proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Kif2C depletion or inhibition leads to accumulation of endogenous DNA damage</title><p>As we revealed the recruitment of Kif2C to DNA damage, and the association of Kif2C with DSB templates and repair factors, we set out to investigate the function of Kif2C in the DDR. Interestingly, Kif2C knockdown in HeLa cells led to <bold>γ</bold>-H2AX induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The induction of <bold>γ</bold>-H2AX was also detected in U2OS cells deleted of Kif2C using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, cells depleted of Kif2C exhibited increased foci formation of <bold>γ</bold>-H2AX and 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These lines of evidence suggested that Kif2C plays a role in DNA repair, and its removal caused accumulation of endogenous DNA damage. Consistent with this hypothesis, accumulation of DNA breaks in Kif2C knockout cells was shown using a single cell electrophoresis (comet) assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). As expected, the re-expression of RNAi-resistant Kif2C rescued <bold>γ</bold>-H2AX induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). By comparison, a G495A Kif2C mutant defective in ATP hydrolysis and MT depolymerization, as characterized previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2012b</xref>), was ineffective in suppressing endogenous DNA damage caused by Kif2C depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the ATPase activity of Kif2C is required for its function in DNA repair. Previously reported structural insights into the enzymatic action of Kif2C revealed that tubulin-binding, in addition to ATPase, is required for MT depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ritter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). For example, a β5 motif with in the motor domain of Kif2C recognizes the distal end of β-tubulin, and R420S, a specific mutation in this motif disrupted tubulin-binding and MT depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ritter et al., 2016</xref>). Like G495A, R420S mutant failed to rescue the accumulation of <bold>γ</bold>-H2AX in Kif2C knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), despite that these mutants were expressed at similar levels as WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>), and exhibited nuclear localization and DNA damage recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Kif2C depletion or mutation did not cause significant disruption of cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Interestingly, Kif2C depletion did not additively enhance the induction of <bold>γ</bold>-H2AX in cells pre-treated with nocodazole, an inhibitor of MT assembly, suggesting that Kif2C functions in DNA repair in the context of MT assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Moreover, the <bold>Δ</bold>86–90 Kif2C mutant deficient in DNA damage recruitment was incapable of suppressing endogenous DNA damage in Kif2C KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), indicating that the DNA damage recruitment of Kif2C is required for the prevention of DSB accumulation.

We speculated that Kif2C might function in regulation of DSB movement and dynamics in light of several existing findings. First, emerging evidence in both yeast and mammalian cells indicated increased chromatin mobility at sites of DNA DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krawczyk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lemaître and Soutoglou, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lottersberger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marnef and Legube, 2017</xref>), but the underlying mechanism is largely unclear. Second, MTs are well known to support intracellular trafficking of proteins, chromosomes, and other materials, and kinesins are known to produce mechanical work from ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dogterom et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forth and Kapoor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maizels and Gerlitz, 2015</xref>). Recent studies showed that MT dynamics enhanced the motion of chromatin, especially telomeres, in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lawrimore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lottersberger et al., 2015</xref>). Third, we showed that the MT depolymerase activity of Kif2C, mediated by ATP hydrolysis and tubulin-binding, is required for the prevention of <bold>γ</bold>-H2AX accumulation. To investigate this potential role of Kif2C, we quantified the mobility of etoposide-induced DSBs, as marked by GFP-53BP1 foci. The 3D trajectories of unbiasedly selected foci were tracked to determine the distance traveled by these foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We observed that Kif2C depletion, or inhibition of its MT depolymerase activity by DHTP, impaired the mobility of DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). This effect of Kif2C suppression was comparable to that of Taxol treatment which inhibits MT dynamics and was previously shown to retard DSB movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lottersberger et al., 2015</xref>). To clarify if Kif2C specifically regulates the mobility of damaged chromatin, we analyzed the movement of Centromere Protein B (CENP-B) and Pre-MRNA Processing Factor 6 (PRPF6), as controls. Both CENP-B and PRPF6 form distinct punctate foci in the nucleus that are not DNA damage-induced, and their motilities can indicate undamaged, general chromatin dynamics, and general intra-nuclear dynamics, respectively. Intra-nuclear CENP-B and PRPF6 foci are relatively less dynamic than 53BP1 foci, and there was no significant difference between WT and Kif2C KO or DHTP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). On the other hand, Taxol treatment reduced foci dynamics of CENP-B and PRPF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting a general effect in nuclear dynamics.

The role of Kif2C in interphase cells is less characterized, despite that its dominant localization in the nucleus suggests possible functions of Kif2C in intra-nuclear processes. Interestingly, we reported here a direct involvement of Kif2C in DNA repair, as a previously undefined interphase function of Kif2C. First, we showed that Kif2C associated with DSB-mimicking structures in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts and human cell lysates. Consistently, Kif2C bound several established DNA repair factors, including PARP1, H2AX, and Ku70/80. Second, Kif2C was recruited to DNA damage sites in interphase cells via two distinct mechanisms. The initial recruitment of Kif2C occurred within seconds in a PAR-dependent manner, whereas the sustained localization of Kif2C at DNA damage sites was disrupted by ATM inhibition. Thus, we characterized Kif2C as a downstream factor of the PARP1 and ATM-mediated DNA damage responses. Third, Kif2C was required for efficient DNA DSB repair via both NHEJ and HR; consequently, depletion or inhibition of Kif2C leads to both accumulation of endogenous DSB and DNA damage hypersensitivity. Interestingly, a Kif2C mutant (Δ86–90) specifically deficient in DNA damage recruitment was unable to rescue DSB accumulation or etoposide-sensitivity in Kif2C depleted cells. Furthermore, Kif2C inhibition led to DSB accumulation in cells synchronized at G1/S. Together, our studies revealed a new role of Kif2C in facilitating DNA DSB repair that is distinct from its known functions in mitotic progression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Kif2C mediates the mobility of DSBs, and the formation of DNA damage foci</title><p>While the core pathways of NHEJ and HR have been well studied, an emerging topic of DNA repair lies in the spatiotemporal dynamics of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hauer and Gasser, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lemaître and Soutoglou, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marnef and Legube, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miné-Hattab and Rothstein, 2013</xref>). In particular, clustering of DSB ends into ‘repair centers’ has been observed for longer than a decade; and the increased mobility of DSB ends within the nucleus has been reported in yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krawczyk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lemaître and Soutoglou, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lottersberger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marnef and Legube, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Neumaier et al., 2012</xref>). However, mechanistic understandings of these phenomena are largely absent within the context of current DDR regulators. We revealed in this study that a specific kinesin motor protein, Kif2C, directly promotes DSB mobility and mediates the formation and fusion of DNA damage foci. Our findings suggested a model that, upon recruitment to DSBs, Kif2C propels the physical movement of damaged chromatin to promote DNA repair, in a manner that relies on the ATPase and tubulin-binding activities of Kif2C; Kif2C facilitates the formation of DNA damage foci, which potentially involves the mobility and clustering of DSBs, as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asaithamby and Chen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aten et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aymard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Neumaier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roukos et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to foci formation, we observed also the occurrence of DSB foci fusion and resolution, indicating that DSBs may undergo dynamic organization and reorganization during DNA repair. These events are reduced by Kif2C depletion or inhibition, thus implicating a role of Kif2C in these processes.</p><p>In addition to the underlying mechanism, the functional impact of DSB mobility and foci formation remains to be better clarified. It has been generally hypothesized that this pattern of DSB dynamics facilitates DSB repair, for example by keeping DSB ends in close proximity, and increasing the local concentration of repair proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lottersberger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miné-Hattab and Rothstein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miné-Hattab and Rothstein, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, mounting evidence suggested that DSB mobility may enable homology search during HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marnef and Legube, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miné-Hattab and Rothstein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schrank et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, MT and the linker of the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC)-mediated DSB mobility was shown to promote NHEJ of dysfunctional telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aymard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lottersberger et al., 2015</xref>). By characterizing Kif2C as a specific regulator of DSB mobility, our study provided an opportunity to assess the functional involvement of DSB dynamics in repair. Interestingly, we demonstrated that Kif2C is required for the efficient DSB repair via both HR and NHEJ. Future studies shall be directed to determine more precisely how Kif2C mediates DSB dynamics, and how this process may interact with the core repair machinery of HR and NHEJ.</p><p>We showed that the initial or sustained recruitment of Kif2C to DNA damage sites is dependent on PARP1 or ATM activation, respectively. Thus, we set out to investigate if either PARP1 or ATM governs DNA damage dynamics via Kif2C. Of note, ATM was shown to govern DSB mobility in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dimitrova et al., 2008</xref>). PARP1 is known to play a crucial role in sensing DNA damage, recruiting repair factors, and modulating chromatin structure, but its involvement in DSB movement was not reported. We clarified in our study that PARP1 and ATM inhibition markedly retarded DSB mobility. Inhibition of PARP1 or ATM in Kif2C-depleted cells less significantly affected DSB mobility, validating that Kif2C is a major downstream of PARP1 and ATM in regulation of DSB mobility, but at the same time, suggesting the existence of redundant pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The emerging role of microtubule dynamics in DNA repair</title><p>Since the first report of nuclear actin in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, the existence of the actin network in the nucleus, and its function in nuclear architecture and genomic regulation, have been well recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caridi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grosse and Vartiainen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Misu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schrank et al., 2018</xref>). By comparison, MT assembly is viewed as a cytoplasmic event, except in mitosis after nuclear envelop breakdown. Thus, the function of Kif2C, a MT depolymerase, in DNA repair is largely unexpected. In particular, our studies using established Kif2C mutants and inhibitor suggested that the ATPase and tubulin-binding activities of Kif2C were indispensable for suppressing DNA damage accumulation. Potentially in line with our findings, previous studies showed that MT poisons caused endogenous DNA damage and reduced DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Branham et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lottersberger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Poruchynsky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rogalska and Marczak, 2015</xref>).</p><p>While cytoplasmic MTs can indirectly influence the DDR, for example, via the nuclear import of repair factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Poruchynsky et al., 2015</xref>), or via the LINC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aymard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lottersberger et al., 2015</xref>), our study suggested a rather direct involvement of nuclear MT components in the DDR. This is particularly relevant as many kinesins, as well as low levels of tubulins, are present in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akoumianaki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kırlı et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kumeta et al., 2013</xref>).

Yeast kinesin-14 and nuclear pore proteins mediate the perinuclear tethering of telomeric DSBs in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, recent evidence demonstrated that inhibitors of MT assembly reduced the mobility of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lawrimore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lottersberger et al., 2015</xref>), further suggesting a nuclear function of MTs.</p><p>To account for the potential role of MT dynamics in DNA repair, a provocative possibility is that MT assembly occurs in the nucleus after DNA damage, presumably at a low and transient level. Along this line, a previous study visualized increased tubulin nucleation and MT rearrangement after DNA damage, although it was not defined if this event occurs at least partially in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Porter and Lee, 2001</xref>). A study in yeast cells detected the assembly of long and stable MTs in the interphase nuclei when cell enters quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>); a more recent study visualized DNA damage-inducible intra-nuclear microtubule filaments (DIMs) in yeast cells using GFP-tagged tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oshidari et al., 2018</xref>). However, the formation of detectable DIMs in mammalian cells remains to be demonstrated. On the other hand, as an alternative hypothesis to be considered, MT filament assembly via tubulin nucleation may not occur in the nucleus of damaged mammalian cells, but rather, certain regulators and mechanisms of MT assembly/disassembly are employed by the DDR machinery to govern the dynamic movement and repair of broken DNA ends. In all cases, the characterization of Kif2C as a new DDR factor that mediates DNA damage movement and foci formation sheds new light on the spatiotemporal regulation of DNA damage dynamics. Future studies building on these findings shall further delineate the involvement of MT regulators in the DNA damage response.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, transfection and treatment</title><p>Human cervix carcinoma (HeLa) and bone osteosarcoma epithelial (U2OS) lines, authenticated by ATCC, were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Hyclone) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone).

Imaging of the control foci, that is CENP-B-mCherry and EGFP-PRPF6, was done in a similar manner except that their formation does not require etoposide addition. For foci mobility, time-lapse recordings were done every 30 s for 10 min. For foci disappearance or fusion, recordings were done every 3 min for one hours. Z-stack images were acquired at 0.5 μm intervals covering a range from 6 to 8 μm. Foci tracking was done using all the acquired stacks for positional information using ImageJ (NIH), and the foci number was quantified using the automatic particle counting option. For image presentation in figure panels, 2D-maximum intensity projection images were generated using the ZEN blue software. Data analysis and graph presentations were performed using Excel (Microsoft) and KaleidaGraph (Synergy). Student’s t-test was used for statistical analysis. Mean-square displacement was calculated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lottersberger et al., 2015</xref>) using the following equation<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Where<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:msqrt></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Pull-down assay</title><p>For protein association studies, MBP Kif2C WT and mutants were expressed in BL21 bacteria cell, purified on amylose beads, and then incubated in HeLa cell lysates for 1 hr at room temperature.

is directly involved in DSB repair, contributing to the DNA damage-induced motion of DSBs. The authors identify that Kif2C binds to linear but not circular DNA in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and HeLa cell extracts. They show that Kif2C localizes to laser-induced DNA damage within 1 min. The initial recruitment is dependent on PARP activity and stable association depends on ATM activity. They were able to map two critical sites in the N-terminal region of Kif2C that are both required for association with laser damage. Using siRNA knockdown and a U2OS knockout cell line the authors show that Kif2C is required to suppress accumulation of γ-H2AX, a marker for DNA damage in cycling cells without exogenous DNA damage. They show by back complementation that the MT depolymerizing activity of Kif2C is required for this effect. Finally, the authors report a small but reproducible effect on viability after cis-Pt treatment of Kif2C knockdown or knockout in multiple cell systems. Consistent with the regulation by PARP and ATM, pharmacological inhibition of PARP and ATM result in a defect of 53BP1 focus mobility in wild type cells and to a lesser degree in the Kif2C knockout cells, suggesting that these regulators target Kif2C and other proteins contributing to 53BP1 focus mobility.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review.

The observations you report are of great potential interest about a possible role of this MT depolymerase and nuclear MTs in DNA repair. However, the review process revealed a rather long list of concerns and issues that would need to be addressed in a revision.

The reviewers, which includes two specialists with good knowledge of the advanced cytology you conduct and mammalian cells, think that a satisfactory revision would take considerably longer than 8 weeks.</p><p>In this spirit, this submission is rejected, leaving you the choice to either submit the manuscript elsewhere, hopefully with changes based on the attached reviews, or coming back to <italic>eLife</italic> with a new submission that addresses the comments made in the reviews with particular attention to the major highlighted below.

Using siRNA knockdown and a U2OS knockout cell line the authors show that Kif2C is required to suppress accumulation of γ-H2AX, a marker for DNA damage in cycling cells without exogenous DNA damage (Figure 3). They show by back complementation that the MT depolymerase activity of Kif2C is required for this effect. Finally, the authors a small but reproducible effect on viability after cis-Pt treatment of Kif2C knockdown or knockout in multiple cell systems. The main conclusion is well supported by the data. Figure 4 expands this data into a time course analysis of γ-H2AX accumulation and turnover, showing an effect of Kif2C knockdown or knockout on γ-H2AX turnover after IR. Reporter assays show a clear effect of Kif2C knockdown on NHEJ and HR. Figure 5 demonstrates that genetic or pharmacological Kif2C turnover and fusion. Consistent with the regulation by PARP and ATM, pharmacological inhibition of PARP and ATM result in defect of 53BP1 focus mobility in wild type cell san dot a lesser degree in the Kif2C knockout cells, suggesting that these regulators target Kif2C and other proteins contributing to 53BP1 focus mobility. The conclusions are well supported by the data. Some of the data could be presented better and with more information, but overall, I do not see the need for additional experimentation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1 needs additional description about the exact DNA substrates being used.

The authors show that Kif2C is associated with DNA repair proteins and recruited to DSBs at early repair steps. They identified the importance of ATR and PARP1 in this recruitment, and mapped Kif2C regions required for loading to damage sites. Further, they show that Kif2C defects affect both NHEJ and HR repair pathways, along with the mobility of repair sites. Kif2C is required for microtubule stability in mitosis. The data collected in this study suggest the possibility that microtubule destabilization at repair sites facilitates repair progression.</p><p>This study convincingly shows that Kif2C is recruited to repair sites, and support the model that Kif2C is a bona fide repair component. However, the data supporting a direct role of this component in repair and particularly on the nuclear dynamics of repair foci are less convincing. Importantly, the role of Kif2C microtubule-binding and depolymerizing activity in this pathway remains poorly characterized, as is the role of nuclear microtubules. Previous studies showed that cytoplasmic microtubules promote the nuclear dynamics of repair sites through the LINC complex in mammalian cells, and recent work uncovered nuclear microtubules responsible for the dynamics of repair sites in budding yeast. This paper suggests the possibility that nuclear microtubule exist in mammalian cells and their disassembly by Kif2C facilitates repair. However, this is not tested directly, leaving us wonder whether the function of Kif2C identified here is in any way linked to microtubule metabolism, or it represents an independent and unrelated role of Kif2C. Critical unanswered points include whether the nuclear function of Kif2C in repair is linked with its microtubule depolymerizing activity, and the existence of nuclear microtubules during DNA repair (particularly in the absence of Kif2C depolymerizing activity). Additionally, some experiments are missing critical controls or statistical validation, as highlighted below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Kif2C physically interacts with DNA ends and repair proteins, as shown with biochemical approaches in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts and HeLa cell extracts in the presence of DNA damage. However, this interaction does not appear to be driven by DNA damage (Figure—figure supplement 1). Do the authors think Kif2C is constitutively associated with these proteins? Or is the damage dose used in these CoIP not sufficient to reveal a damage-induced interaction? Alternatively, this could indicate a cytoplasmic-Kif2C-dependent transport of these proteins, which would not support the role of this interaction in repair. It is worth testing the interaction at higher doses of damage or with different damage sources.</p><p>2) A nice analysis of domains required for recruitment to DNA damage is provided, suggesting that the N-terminal region, particularly AA86-90 and the neck domain, mediates this recruitment. However, this interpretation assumes these mutants are stable end expressed at normal levels in the nuclei. This should be shown by western blot. We note that the D86-90 mutant appears to form aggregates in the nuclei, which might reflect an unstable state of the protein. Is this a common phenotype for this mutant? Additionally, are mutated proteins still able to interact with PARP1 and ATM? If not, this would provide a mechanistic explanation of this recruitment defect.</p><p>3) Biochemical experiments in Figure 3 show that loss of Kif2C results in increased level of spontaneous damage, which is suppressed by Kif2C WT but not G495 and R420 mutants that disable Kif2C from interacting with microtubules and depolymerizing them. This is an important point that should be addressed in experiments more directly targeted to understanding the DSB repair response. Specifically, pH2AX increase could be detected in different conditions, including: (i) accumulation of cells in S-phase, (ii) accumulation of cells in mitosis (at least in some cell types); (iii) increased apoptosis; (iv) telomere dysfunction. To make the point that these mutants have impaired ability to repair DSBs, the authors should for example show that the resolution of IR-induced damage is affected (as in Figure 4). These mutants also need to be validated as in point 2) above. Specifically, the stability, expression level, nuclear enrichment, and damage recruitment of these mutant proteins should be established.</p><p>4) Similarly, for the experiments shown in Figure 3 to be valid, a control of the effect of each mutation or RNAi on the cell cycle should be provided, or effects should be tested in arrested cells (like in panel H). This is also critical for a correct interpretation of Figure 4, given that cell cycle defects can be the source of repair defects in these assays.</p><p>5) In Figure 4B,D, the sample of the UNT time point is missing, without which these experiments are uninterpretable. Are we looking here at the spontaneous damage in Kif2C-KD or the IR-induced damage? If the damage is already present in UNT conditions, this experiment has a completely different interpretation. Along these lines, it would be important to confirm these kinetics with quantifications of repair foci in fixed cells after different time points from damage induction, to circumvent many confounding effects mentioned in 3).</p><p>6) The authors propose the model that microtubule depolymerization by Kif2C is required for repair. If this is the case, taxol treatment right before and during IR should mimic the effects observed in Figure 4B,D, while Nocodazole treatment might suppress the defects observed in 4B,D. These experiments would support the authors' hypothesis.</p><p>7) Figure 5, Figure 6 show a very mild defect of taxol or Kif2C inactivation on nuclear dynamics of repair sites. Notably, these effects are much smaller than those previously observed at eroded telomeres (Lottersberger, 2015). First, the authors need to show a statistical validation for MSD analyses (not just for distance travel calculations), to demonstrate these assays are sufficiently robust in their hands to detect low effects. Second, they need to confirm the effects observed (MSD analyses, effect on distance traveled, focus clustering) are directly linked to a reduction in chromatin dynamics, rather than a general effect on cellular dynamics. Affecting cytoplasmic microtubules likely reduces cell dynamics altogether (translational movements, torsional effects, nuclear positioning), all of which would artificially reduce nuclear dynamics in tracking experiments. A necessary control for those assays is the analysis of undamaged loci in the same conditions.</p><p>8) Most importantly, are nuclear microtubules actually detected in these cells in response to damage, at least in conditions when Kif2C is inactivated?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Zhu et al., report a novel role for the Kinesin Kif2C during DNA Double Strand break repair. They report that Kif2C is recruited at DSB (using DSB mimicking oligos and laser microirradiation) in a manner that is regulated by PARP and ATM. They found that Kif2C deficient cells show enhanced γ-H2AX signaling and damage accumulation, as well as increased sensitivity to etoposide and cisplatin, and delayed γ-H2AX foci clearance following IR. Their work also indicates impaired HR and NHEJ on reporter assays. Using live imaging, they further report that Kif2C depletion decrease DSB mobility as well as DSB clustering.</p><p>Overall this work reveals interesting new insights in DSB repair biology, and provide convincing data that indeed, Kif2C contributes to DSB repair. However, the mobility and clustering section is less developed and needs to be clarified and reinforced by additional experiments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 5A-C: Kif2C depletion, Taxol and DHTP decrease DSB mobility. However, here MSD of 53BP1-GFP was measured, which precludes the initial condition (before damage) to be measured. It is hence difficult to conclude that Kif2C affects the mobility of the DSB and it could also impair general chromatin mobility even without damage. While I realize this is a difficult question to address, the authors could at least investigate the impact of Kif2C depletion on the mobility of other loci without etoposide treatment (telomere, centromeres etc…)</p><p>2) I have a number of concerns regarding the Figure 5F-I.</p><p>2.1) It is unclear what is shown on Figure 5E. How long after etoposide treatment is the time 0 acquired? Can we see movies? Indeed, the examples showed in circles could also be disappearance events.</p><p>2.2) It is unclear what is shown Figure 5F. If I understood well, they first treated with taxol, DHTP (or used KO Kif2C U2OS) and then with etoposide. How long after etoposide treatment were the foci counted? If this is correct, can the author change the &quot;pre-etoposide treatment&quot; title as this is very confusing? Moreover, I cannot see what the sentence subsection “Kif2C mediates the movement of DSBs, and the formation, fusion, and resolution of DNA damage foci” relates to. (&quot;Because the level of DNA damage is rather elevated under Kif2C suppression, this finding indicates that the clustering of DSB is at least partially dependent on Kif2C&quot;). In Figure 3C, DNA damage was assayed without any etoposide treatment, and here foci are counted following DSB production. So, I do not understand how they can conclude from this that DSB clustering is dependent of Kif2C and compare foci number of Figure 5 with γ-H2AX signal from Figure 3 since this is not done in the same conditions.</p><p>2.3) Somehow they imply throughout the manuscript, that foci formation is driven by DSB clustering, and that repair foci can only be detected if clustering occurs (see also in the Discussion section &quot;Our findings indicate that […]to propel the physical movement and clustering of DSBs to enable the formation of DNA damage foci&quot;). This is not supported by previous work, since both γ-H2AX and 53BP1 can spread on megabase of surrounding DNA. Hence even if clustering is impaired one should still detect foci, of smaller size. So, are the etoposide induced foci detected smaller in Kif2C KO? Upon taxol and DHTP treatment?</p><p>2.4) Moreover, Kif2C depletion could simply affect 53BP1 foci formation by regulating 53BP1 binding or expression. Can the author show 53BP1 western blot in Figure 3?</p><p>2.5) Related to former points, the authors need to show the images as well as quantification of the number and size of both γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci, in the different conditions both before and after etoposide treatment. This would considerably clarify the picture and strengthen their conclusions.</p><p>2.6) Figure 5H, the decrease in foci disappearance, is in good agreement with their data on the role of Kif2C in DSB repair, but does not tell much about the dynamics of foci in the nucleus.</p><p>2.7) Finally, for Figure 5I, in the Materials and methods section, it states that 2D projections were produced for Z stacks. Were foci fusion events counted on these projections? If yes, given that both the amount of cells analyzed (about 20) and the number of fusion events per cells (about 3-5) are low and that the difference between Kif2C KO and WT is rather small (only 1-2 fusion event difference in average), it is difficult to conclude here that indeed, foci fusion is decreased. Counting should be done on unstacked images and using a higher number of cells.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Kinesin Kif2C in regulation of DNA double strand break dynamics and repair&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Live imaging with CenpB and PRPF6 provides excellent controls for their 53BP1-GFP mobility analyses, and the text has been reshaped to avoid confusion or misleading statements. This makes the study much more compelling. A few unanswered points remain, which will be restated here, and which should be addressed by text changes/additions (Points #1-3) and added analysis (#4) before publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) In Figure 4 G and H the NHEJ and HR efficiency is normalized to 1 in wild type. Please provide the% GFP-positive cells that correspond to this value in the figure legend that the reader has an appreciation of the experimental quality of the assay.</p><p>2) Aymard et al., 2017, should be cited when mentioning the LINC complex, as in this paper, the LINC was shown to promotes DSB clustering.</p><p>3) All the experiments with Kif2C G495A and R420S mutants do not directly test the effects on damage repair. They show that in the absence of these components there is an increase in accumulation of spontaneous damage, which could be an indirect effect. To test a role in damage repair, damage should be induced, and repair kinetics should be followed (e.g., by looking at repair foci, or using a comet assay). Showing the accumulation of spontaneous damage does not address the question.</p><p>Directly related to this point, in the absence of a direct measurement of repair efficiency the text includes several overstatements. These should be toned down. Among the problematic statements are:</p><p>&quot;…our studies using established Kif2C mutants and inhibitor supported the involvement of the ATPase and tubulin-binding activities of Kif2C in DNA repair&quot;.</p><p>&quot;the characterization of Kif2C as a new DDR factor that mediates DNA damage movement and foci formation, in a manner involving its MT depolymerase activity, sheds new light on the spatiotemporal regulation of DNA damage dynamics&quot;</p><p>&quot;Together, these findings demonstrated that both the DNA damage recruitment of Kif2C and its catalytic activity are involved in the DDR.&quot;</p><p>4) Figure 2 A quantification for Figure 2I (similar to B,E,G) is still missing. Additionally, a quantification over three independent replicates should be provided to account for variability across experiments, and the authors have the data available.

However, this is not tested directly, leaving us wonder whether the function of Kif2C identified here is in any way linked to microtubule metabolism, or it represents an independent and unrelated role of Kif2C. Critical unanswered points include whether the nuclear function of Kif2C in repair is linked with its microtubule depolymerizing activity, and the existence of nuclear microtubules during DNA repair (particularly in the absence of Kif2C depolymerizing activity). Additionally, some experiments are missing critical controls or statistical validation, as highlighted below.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comments. As suggested by the reviewer, our revised manuscript provides additional evidence to better characterize the role of Kif2C in DNA repair and DNA damage foci dynamics. Detailed responses to these comments are provided below:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Kif2C physically interacts with DNA ends and repair proteins, as shown with biochemical approaches in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts and HeLa cell extracts in the presence of DNA damage. However, this interaction does not appear to be driven by DNA damage (Figure S1). Do the authors think Kif2C is constitutively associated with these proteins? Or is the damage dose used in these CoIP not sufficient to reveal a damage-induced interaction? Alternatively, this could indicate a cytoplasmic-Kif2C-dependent transport of these proteins, which would not support the role of this interaction in repair. It is worth testing the interaction at higher doses of damage or with different damage sources.</p></disp-quote><p>We confirmed that the damage condition used was sufficient in inducing DNA damage signaling (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). This does indicate that a portion of Kif2C constitutively associates with DNA repair factors. This pattern is common for DNA damage response factors which often exhibit constitutive associations even without DNA damage. Thus, this association between Kif2C with repair factors further suggests a role of Kif2C in DNA repair. The alternative possibility to explain these associations, as mentioned by the reviewer, was that Kif2C mediates the transport of these repair factors. However, unlike most Kif proteins, Kif2C does not transport cargos, and is itself predominantly a nuclear protein in interphase. Our studies subsequently revealed the DNA damage recruitment of Kif2C and its functional importance for DNA repair and foci movement, all supporting a direct function of Kif2C in DNA repair.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A nice analysis of domains required for recruitment to DNA damage is provided, suggesting that the N-terminal region, particularly AA86-90 and the neck domain, mediates this recruitment. However, this interpretation assumes these mutants are stable end expressed at normal levels in the nuclei. This should be shown by western blot. We note that the D86-90 mutant appears to form aggregates in the nuclei, which might reflect an unstable state of the protein. Is this a common phenotype for this mutant? Additionally, are mutated proteins still able to interact with PARP1 and ATM? If not, this would provide a mechanistic explanation of this recruitment defect.</p></disp-quote><p>We confirmed that Kif2C mutants were expressed at similar levels as WT Kif2C (Figure 3F and Figure 2—figure supplement 3). Like WT Kif2C, these mutants were localized predominantly in the interphase nucleus (Figure 2I). We did notice some punctate foci for Δ86-90 and other mutants (WT to lesser extent), which may indicate aggregation. However, the majority of all proteins exhibited similar, and predominantly pan-nuclear expression. As suggested by the reviewer, we examined the association of WT, Δ86-90 and Δneck Kif2C with PARP1, Ku70, and γ-H2AX. The mutants which were deficient in DNA damage recruitment also showed reduced associations with DNA repair proteins (Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Biochemical experiments in Figure 3 show that loss of Kif2C results in increased level of spontaneous damage, which is suppressed by Kif2C WT but not G495 and R420 mutants that disable Kif2C from interacting with microtubules and depolymerizing them. This is an important point that should be addressed in experiments more directly targeted to understanding the DSB repair response. Specifically, pH2AX increase could be detected in different conditions, including: (i) accumulation of cells in S-phase, (ii) accumulation of cells in mitosis (at least in some cell types); (iii) increased apoptosis; (iv) telomere dysfunction. To make the point that these mutants have impaired ability to repair DSBs, the authors should for example show that the resolution of IR-induced damage is affected (as in Figure 4). These mutants also need to be validated as in point 2) above. Specifically, the stability, expression level, nuclear enrichment, and damage recruitment of these mutant proteins should be established.</p></disp-quote><p>This portion of study is improved as follow:</p><p>a) The accumulation of DNA damage due to Kif2C depletion is now also confirmed by foci formation of γ-H2AX and 53BP1, which was rescued by WT but not mutant Kif2C (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><p>b) Comet assay which directly indicates DNA breaks confirmed the elevated DNA damage and reduce repair in Kif2C KO cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>c) The expression level, nuclear localization, and DNA damage recruitment of these mutants are established in Figure 3D, 3E and Figure 3—figure supplement 2A.</p><p>d) The above points indicate direct function of Kif2C in DNA repair, in comparison to indirect effects of cell cycle defects. To further address this concern, we showed that Kif2C depletion did not significantly alter cell cycle progression (Figure 3—figure supplement 2B); this is consistent with the normal viability of KO cells; neither Kif2C KO nor mutant expression exhibited cell cycle deficiencies (Figure 3—figure supplement 2B).</p><p>e) The manuscript was edited to include the above points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Similarly, for the experiments shown in Figure 3 to be valid, a control of the effect of each mutation or RNAi on the cell cycle should be provided, or effects should be tested in arrested cells (like in panel H). This is also critical for a correct interpretation of Figure 4, given that cell cycle defects can be the source of repair defects in these assays.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, the concern of cell cycle deficiency is addressed by FACS, neither Kif2C KO or mutant expression exhibited cell cycle deficiencies (Figure 3—figure supplement 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 4B,D, the sample of the UNT time point is missing, without which these experiments are uninterpretable. Are we looking here at the spontaneous damage in Kif2C-KD or the IR-induced damage? If the damage is already present in UNT conditions, this experiment has a completely different interpretation. Along these lines, it would be important to confirm these kinetics with quantifications of repair foci in fixed cells after different time points from damage induction, to circumvent many confounding effects mentioned in 3).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, the untreated time points are included. Although Kif2C depletion led to higher endogenous DNA damage, the kinetics of the induction and repair of DNA damage after IR are clearly shown. Quantification is also provided to illustrate the kinetics (Figure 4C and 4F). Consistent result was also provided by the comet assay measuring DNA breaks (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors propose the model that microtubule depolymerization by Kif2C is required for repair. If this is the case, taxol treatment right before and during IR should mimic the effects observed in Figure 4B,D, while Nocodazole treatment might suppress the defects observed in 4B,D. These experiments would support the authors' hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Unlike Kif2C depletion, taxol or nocodazole exhibits strong toxicity by impacting all cellular processes involving microtubules. For example, these drugs will lead to substantial mitotic arrest and cell death during the 6-hour treatment, as needed for repair kinetics in Figure 4. These confounding effects of taxol/nocodazole make measuring DNA repair challenging, and results difficult to interpret. However, along with the reviewer’s point, we were able to confirm that, like Kif2C suppression, taxol reduced DNA damage mobility and foci dynamics (Figure 5). These experiments were carried out in a much shorter time window (10-20 minutes), in morphologically normal interphase cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 5, Figure 6 show a very mild defect of taxol or Kif2C inactivation on nuclear dynamics of repair sites. Notably, these effects are much smaller than those previously observed at eroded telomeres (Lottersberger, 2015). First, the authors need to show a statistical validation for MSD analyses (not just for distance travel calculations), to demonstrate these assays are sufficiently robust in their hands to detect low effects. Second, they need to confirm the effects observed (MSD analyses, effect on distance traveled, focus clustering) are directly linked to a reduction in chromatin dynamics, rather than a general effect on cellular dynamics. Affecting cytoplasmic microtubules likely reduces cell dynamics altogether (translational movements, torsional effects, nuclear positioning), all of which would artificially reduce nuclear dynamics in tracking experiments. A necessary control for those assays is the analysis of undamaged loci in the same conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made significant improvement in this part of the manuscript, as explained below:</p><p>a) Our mean square displacement (MSD) data are in fact quite consistent with those reported by Lottersberger et al., 2015. Our MSD value at 10 minutes in control condition is around 0.65 μm<sup>2</sup> (Figure 5B and 5C), consistent with theirs at ~0.6 μm<sup>2</sup>. For the effect of taxol, Lottersberger et al., was 20 μM, which is 4 times higher than the dose we used in our study. We did try higher concentrations of taxol in our pilot assays and obtained similar value as theirs. At 10 μM taxol, our MSD value at 10 minutes is at around 0.2 μm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), similar to their reported value at ~0.2 μm<sup>2</sup> with 20 μM taxol. To reveal more specific effects and avoid excessive general toxicity of taxol (such as the reduction of general nuclear dynamics shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 2), we chose this lower dose for this study.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Mean ssquare displacement analysis of EGFP-53BP1 monility over 10 minutes in WT-U2OS cells DMSO control and in the presence of 5 μM or 10 μM taxol.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53402-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>b) As in Lottersberger et al., 2015, statistics are typically not applied to MSD analyses because errors amplify with increasing time intervals (“square” of displacement in Brownian motion). For this reason, we resorted to perform statistical analysis on the distance travelled in 10 minutes as in Lottersberger et al., 2015, shown in Figure 5D, to distinguish the effect of Kif2C KO or inhibition from that of WT. With that being said, we are open to better suggestions.</p><p>c) As the most significant addition, we have now included two controls: CenpB (for undamaged, and general chromatin dynamics) and PRPF6 (for general intra-nuclear dynamics). Both CenpB and PRPF6 form distinct punctate foci in the nucleus that are not related to DNA damage. Interestingly, intra-nuclear CenpB and PRPF6 foci are relatively less dynamics than 53BP1 foci, and there was no significant difference between WT and Kif2C KO or DHTP treatment (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Remarkably, taxol treatment (even at 5 µM) reduced all foci dynamics (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). Based on these data, we concluded that Kif2C is a specific regulator in DDR and DHTP treatment is much more selective than MT poisons, with no effect on other cellular dynamics in general. We believe these controls provide new and important information for not only our current study, but also previous studies defining the mobility of damaged chromatin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Most importantly, are nuclear microtubules actually detected in these cells in response to damage, at least in conditions when Kif2C is inactivated?</p></disp-quote><p>Although our data may suggest the existence of nuclear microtubules, we understand this is a provocative point. As discussed in the manuscript, DNA damage-induced intra-nuclear microtubule filaments were visualized in yeast cells, but not yet in mammalian cells. We carefully discuss all possibilities, for example, nuclear MTs may not exist as long hollow tubules like cytoplasmic MTs. This possibility reminded us about the early days of proving the existence of nuclear F-actin. On the other hand, instead of forming MT filaments, dynamic tubulin assembly/disassembly, mediated by Kif2C and other MT regulators, may participate in DNA repair. We feel that visualization of nuclear MT is beyond the scope of this manuscript and will require a much more substantial and focused effort in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] Overall this work reveals interesting new insights in DSB repair biology, and provide convincing data that indeed, Kif2C contributes to DSB repair. However, the mobility and clustering section is less developed and needs to be clarified and reinforced by additional experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comments. As suggested by the reviewer, the mobility and clustering section is now better developed, as explained below:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 5A-C: Kif2C depletion, Taxol and DHTP decrease DSB mobility. However, here MSD of 53BP1-GFP was measured, which precludes the initial condition (before damage) to be measured. It is hence difficult to conclude that Kif2C affects the mobility of the DSB and it could also impair general chromatin mobility even without damage. While I realize this is a difficult question to address, the authors could at least investigate the impact of Kif2C depletion on the mobility of other loci without etoposide treatment (telomere, centromeres etc…)</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have now included two controls: CenpB (for undamaged, and general chromatin dynamics) and PRPF6 (for general intra-nuclear dynamics).

Intra-nuclear CenpB and PRPF6 foci are relatively less dynamics than 53BP1 foci, and there was no significant difference between WT and Kif2C KO or DHTP treatment (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).

How long after etoposide treatment is the time 0 acquired? Can we see movies? Indeed, the examples showed in circles could also be disappearance events.</p></disp-quote><p>As better explained now in the revised manuscript, time 0 is 5 minutes after etoposide treatment (for microscopy set up time and for consistency). We have also included representative movies to illustrate these foci events (Video 3 and Video 4). Indeed, as shown in these movies, the fusion and disappearance events are quite distinct from each other. For fusion events, the two foci move across and get close to each other right before fusion, and we observed a brighter focus formed as a result of the two fused foci.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.2) It is unclear what is shown Fig5F. If I understood well, they first treated with taxol, DHTP (or used KO Kif2C U2OS) and then with etoposide. How long after etoposide treatment were the foci counted? If this is correct, can the author change the &quot;pre-etoposide treatment&quot; title as this is very confusing? Moreover, I cannot see what the sentence subsection “Kif2C mediates the movement of DSBs, and the formation, fusion, and resolution of DNA damage foci” relates to. (&quot;Because the level of DNA damage is rather elevated under Kif2C suppression, this finding indicates that the clustering of DSB is at least partially dependent on Kif2C&quot;). In Figure 3C, DNA damage was assayed without any etoposide treatment, and here foci are counted following DSB production. So, I do not understand how they can conclude from this that DSB clustering is dependent of Kif2C and compare foci number of Figure 5 with γ-H2AX signal from Figure 3 since this is not done in the same conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>In this experiment, taxol or DHTP treatment was done 5 minutes before etoposide treatment (therefore was called “pre-etoposide treatment”). We have rephrased it to “pre-treatment (before etoposide)”. The foci were counted 5 minutes after etoposide treatment. These descriptions are now better explained in the legend.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, new results are added to confirm that Kif2C suppression increased the level of DNA damage induced by etoposide (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C). Relative statements in the manuscript were also rephrased to avoid potential overstatement or confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.3) Somehow they imply throughout the manuscript, that foci formation is driven by DSB clustering, and that repair foci can only be detected if clustering occurs (see also in the Discussion section &quot;Our findings indicate that […]to propel the physical movement and clustering of DSBs to enable the formation of DNA damage foci&quot;). This is not supported by previous work, since both γ-H2AX and 53BP1 can spread on megabase of surrounding DNA. Hence even if clustering is impaired one should still detect foci, of smaller size. So, are the etoposide induced foci detected smaller in Kif2C KO? Upon taxol and DHTP treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that γ-H2AX and 53BP1 focus can be induced by a single DSB (and potentially detectable at a higher resolution). However, previous evidence demonstrated that the macro-domains commonly defined as DNA damage foci involved clustering of multiple DNA damage sites (Neumaier et al., 2012; Aten et al., 2004; Aymard et al., 2017; Roukos et al., 2013; Asaithamby and Chen,2011). Our initial reasoning was that this clustering process must rely on DNA damage mobility. In light of the reviewer’s suggestion, we rephrased the statement. We withdrew the notion that foci formation is enabled by DNA damage movement and clustering. Instead, we showed that Kif2C mediated both DSB mobility and foci formation/fusion, which provided new evidence to potentially connect these processes at the mechanistic level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.4) Moreover, Kif2C depletion could simply affect 53BP1 foci formation by regulating 53BP1 binding or expression. Can the author show 53BP1 western blot in Figure 3?</p></disp-quote><p>We confirmed in the revision that Kif2C depletion did not alter 53BP1 expression (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.5) Related to former points, the authors need to show the images as well as quantification of the number and size of both γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci, in the different conditions both before and after etoposide treatment. This would considerably clarify the picture and strengthen their conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, we have re-justified conclusions related to foci formation and DNA damage mobility. As for foci measurement in conditions before and after etoposide, we observed 53BP1 foci formation in our live-cell imaging only after etoposide treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.6) Figure 5H, the decrease in foci disappearance, is in good agreement with their data on the role of Kif2C in DSB repair, but does not tell much about the dynamics of foci in the nucleus.</p></disp-quote><p>The following improvements were made in the foci disappearance study:</p><p>a) The conclusion is more carefully justified. We agree with the reviewer that foci disappearance may reflect repair, we do not rule out the possibility of foci disassembly (resolution), e.g., one focus is resolved and the released, unrepaired DSBs join other foci.</p><p>b) A high-resolution movie is added to provide an example of foci disappearance (Video 4).</p><p>c) To better illustrate the dynamics of foci disappearance, we have added a new panel showing the time taken for the foci to disappear under each condition (Figure 5J). The time of disappearance was longer in Kif2C KO cells than in the WT, and both taxol and DHTP treatment lengthened the time of disappearance. Most foci disappeared in the first 30 minutes in the WT cells, drastically differed from those under other experimental conditions (Kif2C KO, taxol and DHTP, Figure 5I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.7) Finally, for Figure 5I, in the Materials and methods section, it states that 2D projections were produced for Z stacks. Were foci fusion events counted on these projections? If yes, given that both the amount of cells analyzed (about 20) and the number of fusion events per cells (about 3-5) are low and that the difference between Kif2C KO and WT is rather small (only 1-2 fusion event difference in average), it is difficult to conclude here that indeed, foci fusion is decreased. Counting should be done on unstacked images and using a higher number of cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion: the 2D projections were used only for presentations in the figures and the related videos. For the tracking of the foci and counting the disappearance and fusion events, we did not use the projection from the Z stacks. We identified foci in different Z stacks throughout the time series to determine the occurrence of disappearance and fusion events. We also used this positional tracking for our analysis of DSB mobility. To clarify this, we added more details about the tracking and data analyses to the methods section in the revised manuscript. With regard to low number of fusion events, it should be noted that the fusion events are infrequent (even in the WT cells) and these numbers were reported as per cell. To avoid this confusion, now we present these data as total number of events in 15 cells per condition over three independent experiments which achieved clear statistical significance (Figure 5H).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>[...] A few unanswered points remain, which will be restated here, and which should be addressed by text changes/additions (Points #1-3) and added analysis (#4) before publication in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, points #1-3 are now addressed by corresponding text changes/additions; quantification is included in Figure 2I, per point #3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) In Figure 4 G and H the NHEJ and HR efficiency is normalized to 1 in wild type.
