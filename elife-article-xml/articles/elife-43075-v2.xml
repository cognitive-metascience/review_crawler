transcription. The intrinsic flexibility of nucleocapsids usually prevents their full-length structural characterisation at high resolution. Here, we describe purification of full-length recombinant metastable helical nucleocapsid of Hantaan virus (<italic>Hantaviridae</italic> family, <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order) and determine its structure at 3.3 Å resolution by cryo-electron microscopy. The structure reveals the mechanisms of helical multimerisation via sub-domain exchanges between protomers and highlights nucleotide positions in a continuous positively charged groove compatible with viral genome binding. It uncovers key sites for future structure-based design of antivirals that are currently lacking to counteract life-threatening hantavirus infections. The structure also suggests a model of nucleoprotein-polymerase interaction that would enable replication and transcription solely upon local disruption of the nucleocapsid.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43075.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Rats and mice sometimes transmit hantaviruses, a family of microbes that can cause deadly human diseases. For example, the Hantaan virus leads to haemorrhagic fevers that are potentially fatal. There are no vaccine or even drugs against these infections.</p><p>To multiply, viruses must insert their genetic material inside a cell. While the body often detects and destroys foreign genetic information, hantaviruses can still evade our defences. Molecules called nucleoproteins bind to the viral genome, hiding it away in long helices called nucleocapsids. When the virus needs to replicate, an enzyme opens up the nucleocapsid, reads and copies the genetic code, and then closes the helix. Yet, researchers know little about the details of this process, or even the structure of the nucleocapsid.</p><p>Here, Arragain et al. use a method called cryo-electron microscopy to examine and piece together the exact 3D structure of the Hantaan virus nucleocapsid. This was possible because the new technique allows scientists to observe biological molecules at an unprecedented, near atomic resolution. The resulting model reveals that the viral genome nests into a groove inside the nucleocapsid. It also shows that specific interactions between nucleoproteins stabilise the helix. Finally, the model helps to provide hypotheses on how the enzyme could read the genome without breaking the capsid.</p><p>Mapping out the structure and the interactions of the nucleocapsid is the first step towards finding molecules that could destabilise the helix and neutralise the virus: this could help fight both the Hantaan virus and other members of its deadly family.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Bunyavirales</kwd><kwd>Hantavirus</kwd><kwd>Hantaan</kwd><kwd>Nucleocapsid</kwd><kwd>nucleoprotein</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012952</institution-id><institution>Université Grenoble Alpes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G7H-IRS17H50</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malet</surname><given-names>Hélène</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hantaan virus nucleocapsid cryo-EM structure determined at 3.3 Å resolution reveals how nucleoproteins assemble into a metastable helix containing a continuous RNA-binding groove compatible with genome encapsidation and compaction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order is one of the largest groups of segmented negative-strand RNA viruses (sNSV) that include many pathogenic strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, the <italic>Hantaviridae</italic> family comprises the virus Hantaan (HTNV) that gives rise to haemorrhagic fevers with renal syndrome and the virus Sin Nombre that is linked to severe pulmonary illnesses with fatality rates up to 40%. Neither treatment nor vaccine is currently available to counteract them.</p><p>The <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> genome is usually divided into three RNA segments enwrapped by the viral nucleoproteins (NP). The resulting nucleocapsids (NCs) protect the genome and serve as a replication/transcription template for the viral polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Reuter and Krüger, 2018</xref>). They coat the genomic and anti-genomic RNA during replication but not the mRNA produced by transcription. As they are specific and essential to the viral cycle, NCs constitute an attractive potential target for antiviral drugs.</p><p>Nucleoproteins of segmented NSV (sNSV) present a large diversity of folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). Most of the available structures have been determined as rings and monomers that present the advantage of being rigid enough for crystallisation. However, the relevant conformations of assembled NPs in the viral context correspond to flexible helices or pearl-necklaces that encapsulate long RNA segments. Helical crystal structures of La Crosse virus NP (<italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic>, LACV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Reguera et al., 2013</xref>) and Crimean Congo Fever Virus NP (<italic>Nairoviridae,</italic> CCFHV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) have been determined but they correspond to local organisations of pearl-necklace-like native NCs. Influenza double-helical NCs 3D structures have been described at low resolution but display different helical parameters, also reflecting their malleability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arranz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moeller et al., 2012</xref>). NC flexibility appears as a hallmark in NSVs as NCs from non-segmented NSV such as Ebola or measles virus require C-terminal NP truncations in order to obtain rigid NCs and high-resolution 3D structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gutsche et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sugita et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wan et al., 2017</xref>). In this context, HTNV-NCs are intriguing as they were shown to be able to form rather rigid helices of 10 nm diameter within viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battisti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huiskonen et al., 2010</xref>) and during cell infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldsmith et al., 1995</xref>). We therefore aimed at obtaining their high-resolution 3D structure, identifying the determinants of NP polymerisation and visualising RNA organisation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Expression of recombinant full-length HTNV-NP in insect cells led to formation of recombinant NCs that have a diameter consistent with native NCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Interestingly, a NP<sub>74-429</sub> construct obtained by trypsin limited proteolysis still forms a rigid helix, which means that the N-ter<sub>1-73</sub> is not necessary for helix stabilisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The N-ter<sub>1-73</sub> might correspond to a flexibly-linked coiled-coil as previously visualised in the structure of an N-ter construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boudko et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The structure of NP<sub>80-429</sub> is composed of a core comprising residues 117 to 398 (NP<sub>core</sub>) that defines two lobes surrounding a positively charged groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The NP<sub>core</sub> structure is relatively conserved compared to the apo monomeric truncated crystal structure, with a Cα RMSD of 0.808 Å over 205 atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). N-terminal and C-terminal arms (Nt<sub>arm</sub>, Ct<sub>arm</sub>) are connected to each extremity of NP<sub>core</sub> by flexible hinges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Superimposition of HTNV-NC with the truncated monomeric structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Olal and Daumke, 2016</xref>) shows that the Ct<sub>arm</sub> undergoes a 130.4° rotation upon multimerisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As a result, Nt- and Ct<sub>arm</sub> of the same subunit embrace each other: residues 97–98 of Nt<sub>arm</sub> contact residues 423–424 of Ct<sub>arm</sub>, revealing a unique intra-arms interaction specific to HTNV-NC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).</p><p>Recombinant HTNV-NC are rigid and remain stable in a large range of salt, pH and temperature conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This can be explained by the multiplicity of interactions between protomers, each NP interacting with six other subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Successive subunit interactions rely on exchange of their Nt<sub>arm,</sub> and Ct<sub>arm</sub> that make intimate contacts with the core domain of neighbouring protomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B,C</xref>), resulting in a buried area of 2704 Å<sup>2</sup> at each NP-NP interface. The NP<sub>i</sub> Nt<sub>arm</sub> forms an elongated structure that binds to residues 155–160, 177–181, 189–192 and 136–140 of the NP<sub>i-1</sub> subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Since constructs lacking the Nt<sub>arm</sub> remain monomeric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Olal and Daumke, 2016</xref>), the identified contacts appear to be essential for multimerisation. The NP<sub>i</sub> amphipatic Ct<sub>arm</sub> binds in a hydrophobic pocket of the protomer NP<sub>i+1</sub> comprising residues 334–346 and 378–394 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). This agrees with the results of double hybrid experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaukinen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yoshimatsu et al., 2003</xref>) which suggested that interaction of C-terminal helices of neighbouring protomers are critical to oligomerisation. Another key actor of multimerisation is the β-hairpin<sub>152-181</sub> that protrudes towards the exterior of the NP-core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The two β-strands of the hairpin (residues 155–160 and 177–181) interact with the Nt<sub>arm</sub> residues 101–103 from the following subunit to form a 3-stranded β-sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). As shown by pull-down assays of mutants L102A, V104A, this structure has a main contribution in NC stabilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, the β-hairpin<sub>152-181</sub> tip (residues 162–175) acts as a clamp and seals the C-terminus-mediated contacts between NP<sub>i+2</sub> (residues 409 to 419) and NP<sub>i+3</sub> (residues 385–390), thereby buttressing and rigidifying the metastable helical form of the HTNV-NC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43075.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>NP-NP interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) General view.

Conserved residues R197, R314, R368, R146 and K153 interact via salt bridges with RNA phosphates, in line with the versatility of RNA sequence to be incorporated by NP. In addition, F361 stabilises a stacking interaction network between the nucleotide bases. The nucleotides bind in a continuous positively charged groove oriented towards the interior of the NC. Density corresponding to additional nucleotides is visible in this groove, but present at low occupancy, suggesting the lower affinity of NC-RNA binding in these regions. Interestingly, the observed nucleotides occupancy is in accordance with electromobility shift assays of Sin Nombre NP mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2016</xref>): indeed, in this work, residues directly interacting with the three visible RNA nucleotides were identified as the ones displaying the highest affinity with RNA.

It fits together the pieces of the jigsaw accumulated over several years of biochemistry and structural analysis on Hantavirus NP. HTNV recombinant NC structure indeed displays 3.6 subunits per turn and is thus consistent with observations of HTNV-NP trimers made by several groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfadhli et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaukinen et al., 2004</xref>). The present structure is also compatible with the proposed model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaukinen et al., 2001</xref>) which suggested that NPs first trimerise around the viral RNA and then gradually assemble to form longer multimers. The role of Nt<sub>arm</sub> and Ct<sub>arm</sub> exchange between successive subunits, identified by double-hybrid and pull-down experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaukinen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yoshimatsu et al., 2003</xref>), is in line with HTNV recombinant NC structure. These observations, together with the visualisation of a continuous positively charged groove, strongly suggest that the present structure is biologically pertinent. HTNV recombinant NCs are thus likely to be similar to helical NCs observed within viral particles, although the fact that the latter are less straight implies that at least the β-hairpin<sub>152-181</sub> might change conformation in the viral context, thereby enabling more flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battisti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huiskonen et al., 2010</xref>). Other conformations of NCs are in addition likely to exist because the 5’ and 3’ end of HTNV viral RNA are known to bind to the viral polymerase, implying that the NC must somehow be circularised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Garcin et al., 1995</xref>). Accordingly, flexible pearl-necklaces are also visible within virions, in infected cells and in NC extracted from viral particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battisti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldsmith et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huiskonen et al., 2010</xref>). Combination of helical NCs observed here and flexible pearl-necklaces thus represent relevant genome-encapsidating conformations.</p><p>HTNV and LACV NP<sub>core</sub> share a common fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Olal and Daumke, 2016</xref>) enabling their structural superimposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and comparison of their RNA binding mode. This reveals that the three nucleotides present in HTNV-NC adopt similar conformations as the nucleotides 5, 6 and 7 of LACV-NP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Reguera et al., 2013</xref>). Key residues involved in the binding of HTNV-NC nucleotides, namely R197, R367 and F361 are conserved in LACV-NP (R94, R183 and Y177). Superposition of RNA-bound LACV-NP monomers on HTNV-NC shows that LACV RNA fits reasonably well into the HTNV-NC positively charged groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, the proposed HTNV-NC RNA path is slightly shorter, suggesting that each HTNV-NP can contain between 8 and 10 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Modelling of RNA binding in HTNV-NC based on RNA position in LACV-NP (see Materials and methods) indicates that RNA phosphates and riboses interact with residues R146, K150, K153, R197, R314, R339, R367 and R368, while bases are surrounded by residues 113–116, 143–151, 182–188 and 217–222 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>While the structures of HTNV and LACV NPs share a common fold for their cores, they however differ in their N-terminal organisation, HTNV Nt<sub>arm</sub> being significantly longer and linked to the unresolved N-terminal<sub>1-73</sub> region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The N-terminal<sub>1-73</sub> region may bring the polymerase in close contact to NP as suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>), and thus play a role similar to the intrinsically disordered phosphoproteins and NP C-terminal regions in nsNSV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ivanov et al., 2011</xref>). One may therefore hypothesise that during genome reading by the polymerase, the Nt<sub>arm</sub> of one HTNV-NP could detach from its adjacent subunit, thereby affecting the conformation of the next NP β-hairpin and removing the seal over the two following NPs. This would provoke a local disruption of the metastable NC and provide RNA access to the polymerase, enabling replication and transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This opens new routes for future experiments, such as cryo-EM analysis of <italic>in vivo</italic> reconstituted mini-ribonucleoprotein particles (RNP) or cryo-electron tomography of viral RNPs, that would decipher the exact mode of interaction between NPs, polymerase and RNA during RNA replication/transcription. The rigidity of HTNV-NC and the absence of disordered phosphoprotein in HTNV should facilitate this study compared to the more complex NP/phosphoprotein/polymerase complex of nsNSV, and thus represents a unique opportunity to unravel significant properties of NSV replication.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43075.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Model of HTNV replication and transcription.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics representation of HTNV-NP.

The model proposes that the polymerase binds to the flexible N-terminal<sub>1-73</sub> region during replication/transcription in order to move along the NC. This would be reminiscent to P and L binding to flexible sNSV C-terminal region. Binding of the polymerase to the N-terminal<sub>1-73</sub> region could destabilise the adjacent Nt<sub>arm</sub> binding. This localised disruption of NP-NP interaction would create a local opening of the NC enabling transient access of the polymerase to few RNA nucleotides for replication/transcription. Such an opening could be possible without disturbing the whole NC as NP to NP contacts are driven not only by the Nt<sub>arm</sub> but also by the Ct<sub>arm</sub>. The Ct<sub>arm</sub> interaction is likely to remain intact even with a local opening of the NC as the C-terminal hinge allows the Ct<sub>arm</sub> to undergo large rotation.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43075-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In addition to these fundamental aspects, the HTNV-NC structure reveals the position of specific antigenic sites on variable regions of the NC surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tischler et al., 2008</xref>) thus providing a structure-based rationale for diagnosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The 10 last frames of each motion corrected micrographs were removed resulting in a total dose of ~22 e-/Å<sup>2</sup>. The latest 3D map filtered at 15 Å resolution was used as initial model and helical symmetry search further refined during a last refinement. The resulting final reconstruction displays refined helical parameters of −99.95° for the twist and 18.87 Å for the rise. Post-processing, done using a B-factor of −103 Å<sup>2</sup>, resulted in a 3.3 Å resolution reconstruction using the FSC 0.143 cutoff criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Local resolution variations were estimated in Relion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Observation of nucleotides with partial occupancy suggests that only a fraction of HTNV-NC segments analysed contains RNA. We thus attempted to perform both 2D and 3D classifications in order to separate RNA-bound and apo HTNV-NC segments using several strategies including usage of different masks, subtraction/absence of subtraction of protein density, symmetry release. However, due to the low molecular weight of RNA compared the protein (9 RNA nucleotides bound per HTNV-NP would correspond to 3 kDa of RNA versus 50 kDa of protein), these classifications did not succeed in separating the apo and RNA-bound states.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Model building and refinement</title><p>The monomeric crystal structure of HTNV-NP comprising residues 113 to 429 (PDB code: 5FSG) was initially fitted into the EM density as two separate rigid bodies containing residues 113–398 and 399–429. Loops comprising residues 146–155 and 349–360, β-hairpin 160–172 and the N-terminal arm residues 80 to 112 - previously not present in the crystal structure - were manually built in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>). The three RNA nucleotides visible in the density map were manually built and adjusted using Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014222">SCR_014222</ext-link>) and RCrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keating and Pyle, 2012</xref>). NP monomeric model was symmetrised according to the helical parameters to form a filament model of 7 subunits. Fiber model was then iteratively rebuilt and all-atom refined using stereochemical and NCS restraints within PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014224">SCR_014224</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA modelling based on LACV NP RNA</title><p>In order to model HTNV RNA, two HTNV-NP were extracted from HTNV-NC, together with their respective three nucleotides (called ‘HTNV-nts’). Five, six or seven LACV-nts were used to link the three HTNV-nts, giving rise to hybrid models containing between eight and ten nucleotides per NP. They were regularised in Coot, minimised in Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004097">SCR_004097</ext-link>) and were then subjected to modelling in Haddock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Vries et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">van Zundert et al., 2016</xref>). During the modelling procedure, the interaction between HTNV-NP and HTNV-nucleotides was maintained in the same conformation as in the EM map using unambiguous distance restraints. In addition, Haddock ambiguous interaction restraints were defined: residues involved in interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2016</xref>) were considered as ‘active’, while all solvent accessible surface neighbours of active residues were defined as ‘passive’. The initial starting orientations were not randomised. Rigid body minimisation, semi-flexible simulated annealing and flexible explicit solvent refinement was performed. For each starting RNA, the resulting models were very similar and gathered in one single cluster. The model with the lowest energy and the lowest Haddock score was thus considered as being the modelling result.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Accession numbers</title><p>The atomic coordinates and the cryo-EM map have respectively been deposited in the PDB and EMDB under the accession codes 6I2N and EMD-0333.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Stephen Cusack for providing the synthetic gene and enabling JR and HM to initiate this project while being post-doctoral researchers in his lab.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Edward H Egelman as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has also agreed to reveal their identity: Matthias Wolf.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors report an interesting structure of recombinant nucleocapsid of Hantaan virus HTNV, determined by cryo-EM. Compared to another <italic>Bunyavirus</italic>, La Crosse virus (LACV), there are similarities and differences. The essential core of N- and C-lobes is the same in both viruses, as well as other bunyaviruses. The main differences are the long N-terminal end and the C-terminal end. In HTNV, the ends assume quite a different structure compared to others. This leads to the suggestion by the authors that the terminal regions may be opened by the viral polymerase in order to read the sequence of the genomic RNA. Based on the structure and the flexibility of the nucleocapsid protein, this mechanism is very plausible. The manuscript is well and clearly written and focuses on essential points. Hantaan virus is pathologically highly relevant as it leads to illness with high fatality rate without any currently available vaccines.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although their model of polymerase interaction is only deduced indirectly and not backed by their own experimental results, the authors clearly present it as a hypothesis. One additional experiment that would strengthen their claim may be cryo-tomography of HTNV-NP in the presence of viral polymerase, catching RdRp in the act near a kink of the HTNV-NP complex. But this is technically very challenging (probably requiring phase plate, movie processing and highest skills in cryo-ET), their construct may not be replication competent, and two months is a very short time. An easier one may be to ask for 2D class averages in presence of RdRp (ideally cryo, or at least negative stain), provided that the reaction can be carried out in vitro. This should be doable within 2 months and would add additional evidence to back up their interesting hypothesis (points 2 and 3).</p><p>2) The structure of three nucleotides per subunit was observed in the recombinant helical nucleocapsid, suggesting that the remaining nucleotides out of 8 to 10 per subunit are flexible. This raises questions about the inter-subunits observed in the recombinant helical nucleocapsid. What is reported here is one conformation of the nucleocapsid. As shown previously, the nucleocapsid in the viral particle and that extracted from the viral particle did not show a straight helical conformation. The authors need to discuss about the limitation of their current structure in the context of virus assembly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43075.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although their model of polymerase interaction is only deduced indirectly and not backed by their own experimental results, the authors clearly present it as a hypothesis.

Please note that this is very challenging as negative strand RNA virus RdRps are known to be difficult to handle. HTNV RdRp is a rather unstable protein, difficult to express/purify, and we are only in early phase of its characterization.</p><p>In order to maximize chances of success compared to a simple incubation of purified NC and purified L, we performed a co-expression of HTNV NP and L in insect cells. Co-purification however revealed that L and NC, although nicely purified, elute in different fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43075.017</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Purification and negative stain electron microscopy analysis of HTNV NP and L co-expression/co-purification.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SDS-PAGE gel of HTNV NP-L co-expression/co-purification that was done as follow: insect cells were co-infected with two baculoviruses respectively producing NP and L.

Indeed, interactions between NP and polymerase clearly exist <italic>in vivo</italic> and are necessary for replication and transcription. However, as spotted by the reviewers, it might not be possible to carry out this reaction <italic>in vitro</italic> or by co-expression/co-purification. Actually, all attempts of this kind performed by us on La Crosse virus failed (experiments performed by Juan Reguera, Piotr Gerlach and Hélène Malet during their postdoctoral/PhD research in Stephen Cusack group). Attempts of in vitro reconstitution of Influenza RNP that we are aware of were also unsuccessful (Stephen Cusack, personal communication).</p><p>We therefore think that it is very likely that only replication-competent active RNP would allow to observe NC-polymerase interaction. A replication-competent active RNP would contain a nucleocapsid bound to viral RNA, 3’ and 5’ extremities of viral RNA bound to the polymerase to initiate the reaction, and nucleotides to allow reaction to proceed. In order to obtain these RNPs and validate/invalidate our hypothesis, we think it would thus be necessary to either (i) reconstitute mini-RNP <italic>in vivo</italic> (as nicely done for influenza by Coloma et al., 2009, PLoS Pathogen) and image them by cryo-electron microscopy or (ii) perform cryo-electron tomography of viral RNP. As mentioned by the reviewers, these extremely interesting experiments are very challenging and cannot be carried out in two months. They would constitute another major advancement and would deserve a dedicated publication focusing on the NC-polymerase interaction.</p><p>We would therefore kindly suggest keeping the focus of our current article on HTNV nucleocapsid. The so-called model is only a hypothesis and we added a sentence to emphasize this point and make it clear to all readers: “One may therefore hypothesize that during…”. It is also clearly stated as a “Replication working hypothesis model”. Validation of this model is one of the main directions of our future research. We thus mention these long-term experiments as important perspectives:“This opens new routes for future experiments, such as cryo-EM analysis of in vivo reconstituted mini-ribonucleoprotein particles (RNP) or cryo-electron tomography of viral RNPs, which would decipher the exact mode of interaction between NPs, polymerase and RNA during RNA replication/transcription”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The structure of three nucleotides per subunit was observed in the recombinant helical nucleocapsid, suggesting that the remaining nucleotides out of 8 to 10 per subunit are flexible.

This important point was previously only described in the Supplementary Note 3. It is now fully integrated in the Discussion (see corresponding text copied in the next paragraph). As suggested by reviewers, we have also added the following points:</p><p>- We mention that helical NCs seen in the viral particles are not as straight as recombinant NCs (although bent recombinant NCs are also visible in a minority of EM micrographs, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43075.018</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Bent recombinant NCs seen in some EM micrographs.</title><p>Bending localisations are shown with arrows.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43075-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><p>- We discuss that potential differences in inter-subunit contacts may exist between recombinant NC and viral NC. We propose that theβ-hairpin<sub>152-181</sub> tip, that is an essential element of recombinant NC rigidity, may be more flexible or change conformation in the viral context.</p><p>- We also mention that other conformations are present in virions, infected cells and RNPs extracted from viral particles. We are convinced that both helical and pearl-necklaces conformations are biologically relevant, and clearly state it in the article.</p><p>The corresponding text added in the article is the following:</p><p>“HTNV recombinant NCs are thus likely to be similar to helical NCs observed within viral particles, although the fact that the latter are less straight implies that at least the β-hairpin<sub>152-181</sub> might change conformation in the viral context, thereby enabling more flexibility (Battisti et al., 2011; Huiskonen et al., 2010). […] Combination of helical NCs observed here and flexible pearl-necklaces thus represent relevant genome-encapsidating conformations.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
