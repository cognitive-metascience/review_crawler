to promote cellular remodeling. The Autophagy linked FYVE protein (Alfy), previously identified as a molecular scaffold between the ubiquitinated cargo and the autophagic machinery, is highly expressed in the developing central nervous system, indicating that this pathway may have yet unexplored roles in neurodevelopment. To examine this possibility, we used mouse genetics to eliminate Alfy expression. We report that this evolutionarily conserved protein is required for the formation of axonal tracts throughout the brain and spinal cord, including the formation of the major forebrain commissures. Consistent with a phenotype reflecting a failure in axon guidance, the loss of Alfy in mice disrupts localization of glial guidepost cells, and attenuates axon outgrowth in response to Netrin-1. These findings further support the growing indication that macroautophagy plays a key role in the developing CNS.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14810.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14810.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14810.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Unlike many other cells in the body, neurons typically survive throughout the life of a mammal. This long life suggests that they may be more vulnerable to damage from cellular debris. Previous research has found that a protein called Alfy, which is abundant in the brain, is involved in cleaning up debris, such as those involved in neurodegenerative diseases, by a pathway known as autophagy. Alfy guides the formation of spherical compartments called autophagosomes, which deliver the debris to another compartment known as the lysosome to permit degradation.</p><p>In developing embryos, neurons need to migrate to the right location within the central nervous system and extend projections called axons to communicate with other cells. However, it was not clear whether this process requires cell materials to be selectively sent to lysosomes, and whether this involves the Alfy protein.</p><p>Dragich et al. addressed this question by studying mouse embryos that lack Alfy. The brains of these mice developed abnormally and were missing the corpus callosum (the dense band of fibers that normally connects the two halves of the brain). Without Alfy, the growing axons could not navigate their way to the right places to connect with other neurons. Furthermore, some neurons migrated to the wrong places in the developing brain, which resulted in the abnormal formation of cell-clusters.</p><p>The findings of Dragich et al. suggest that autophagy also plays an important role in normal brain development. Future studies are now needed to work out exactly how Alfy controls neuron migration and the growth of axons. The human gene <italic>WDFY3</italic> is nearly identical to the gene that encodes the Alfy protein, and has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and microencephaly. Studying Alfy therefore may help us to understand human conditions that affect the developing or aging brain.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Autophagy linked FYVE domain protein (Alfy) [gene name, WD40 repeat and FYVE domain protein 3 (<italic>Wdfy3</italic>)] is a member of the Beige and Chediak-Higashi (BEACH) domain containing proteins, a family of proteins implicated in vesicle trafficking and membrane dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Isakson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Simonsen et al., 2004</xref>). As its name implies, Alfy has been implicated in the degradative pathway macroautophagy, by acting as a molecular scaffold between select cargo and core members of the mammalian autophagic machinery such as Atg5, p62 and Atg8 homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clausen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Filimonenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lystad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Simonsen et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, its functional FYVE zinc finger domain at the COOH-terminus permits partial co-localization to phosphatidylinositol-3-monophosphate (PtdIns3P), especially at autophagosome membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Simonsen et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p><italic>Wdfy3</italic> is evolutionarily conserved and the most extensively studied homolog is <italic>Blue Cheese (bchs)</italic> in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Finley et al., 2003</xref>). In the developing and adult fly central nervous system (CNS), Bchs is abundantly expressed, with preferential accumulation in axon terminals and at the growth cone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Finley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khodosh et al., 2006</xref>). Adult <italic>bchs</italic> null flies have a shortened life span and show signs of adult onset neurodegeneration, including the accumulation of ubiquitinated aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Filimonenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Finley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khodosh et al., 2006</xref>). Loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in <italic>bchs</italic> disrupt the axonal transport of endolysosomal vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lim and Kraut, 2009</xref>), however no defects in axon guidance have been reported in <italic>bchs</italic> null larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khodosh et al., 2006</xref>). Recently it has been reported that in vertebrates, genetically diminished levels of Alfy disrupts neurogenesis leading to altered forebrain morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Orosco et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, genetic screening has revealed a possible role for the human homolog <italic>WDFY3</italic> as a genetic risk factor for intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), microcephaly and neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonnet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iossifov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kadir et al., 2016</xref>). These findings raise the possibility that Alfy could have an important function in mammalian CNS development.</p><p>Here, we present two new mouse models that eliminate Alfy expression and identify an essential role for Alfy during murine development. Constitutive elimination of Alfy leads to perinatal lethality, in conjunction with developmental brain wiring defects throughout the CNS, involving forebrain commissures, internal capsule, optic chiasm, spinal cord and longitudinal tracts such as the medial forebrain bundle. In the ventral midbrain, dopaminergic cell populations retain an immature morphology and their axons aberrantly project into the hypothalamic region, forming an ectopic commissure near the optic chiasm. Consistent with a failure of axon guidance mechanisms, localization of glial guidepost cells for callosal axons were disrupted, and sensitivity of Alfy knockout axons to the trophic effect of Netrin-1 was significantly diminished. Moreover, Alfy is enriched in membrane fractions, suggesting that it may play a key role in membrane trafficking events to establish neural connectivity in the mammalian brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Alfy is highly expressed in the CNS</title><p>To characterize the role of Alfy in mouse, we initially determined when and where Alfy/Wdfy3 is expressed.

In light of the presence of Alfy in astroglial cells, as well as the midline crossing defects, we hypothesized that migration abnormalities could contribute to the connectivity defects in Alfy GT and KO mice. Thus, we next examined the callosal guidepost cells, a key population implicated in providing intermediate guidance cues to developing cortical axons. Immunostaining against GFAP on P0 mouse brains revealed abnormalities in Alfy GT brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). Unlike control brain, the ig cells were undetectable and the gw appeared disorganized and loosely packed. The midline zipper glia (mz), cells proposed to promote fusion of the two telencephalic hemispheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Silver, 1993</xref>), were present but distributed abnormally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), whereas cells in the fimbria and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus appear largely normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Taken together, the disorganization of the ig, gw and mz is consistent with the agenesis of the corpus callosum observed in the absence of Alfy. These findings suggest that cells that act as important guideposts for decussating callosal axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shu and Richards, 2001</xref>) fail to migrate properly in the absence of Alfy, contributing to the connectivity defects observed.</p><p>In addition to the localization of the midline glial cells, we also determined if intrinsic alterations in the proliferation or differentiation of cortical projection neurons were also contributing to the disruptions in forebrain axonal connectivity. Nissl staining revealed that cortical layering appeared normal, however there was a significant but modest thinning of the cortical plate/subplate at P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Although this may be due to the diminished NF staining observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we next determined if cell proliferation was affected. Pulse-labeling with bromo-6-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) at E15.5 revealed cell division in the developing cortex at the expected location in Alfy GT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To determine if the amount of proliferation was impacted by the loss of Alfy, stereology was performed on BrdU labeled embryos at ages E13.5 and E15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). No significant difference across genotypes was detected at E13.5, but a modest yet significant reduction in the number of BrdU-positive cells was detected in Alfy KO embryos at E15.5. This difference appeared limited to the cortex, since staining against Ki67 within the subventricular zone at P0 revealed no significant difference between Alfy null mice and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Further, despite this modest decrease in embryonic proliferation, there were no detectable differences across genotypes in the amount of cell death in E15.5 brains, as indicated by immunohistochemistry against cleaved caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to determine if the loss of Alfy disrupted proliferation in the embryonic cerebral cortex. Although qualitative immunofluorescence against expression markers for immature migrating neurons (DCX) and for early born layer VI neurons (Tbr1) also were not significantly altered in the absence of Alfy, histological staining revealed focal cortical malformations known as focal cortical dysplasias (FCD) present throughout the cerebral cortex of Alfy KO mice, as described previously in a <italic>Wdfy3</italic> hypomorph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Orosco et al., 2014</xref>). These structures were observed as early as E15.5. Thus, the loss of Alfy leads to subtle defects in proliferation, but no changes in cell death or specification in the developing cortical projection neurons. Although columnar organization of discrete regions of the cerebral cortex can be disrupted by the absence of Alfy during embryonic development, it is unlikely that these defects can account for the midline crossing defects observed in Alfy null mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Developmental axonal connectivity defects in Alfy KO brains</title><p>In addition to the absence of interhemispheric commissures, another striking feature revealed by NF staining in Alfy GT and KO brains was the evident disorganization and apparent loss of other CNS axon tracts. One particularly prominent defect was found in the organization of the internal capsule, which carries the corticospinal tract, and corticothalamic and thalamocortical projections; the internal capsule of Alfy GT brains was disorganized and followed an unusual trajectory through the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To gain a temporal perspective on the development of the internal capsule, we examined its development during E15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and E17.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) staining revealed that the projections and morphology of vMB DAergic neurons were clearly abnormal in the P0 Alfy KO brains. Notably, the A9 and A10 cell populations, which represent the ventral tegmental area (A9) and substantia nigra (A10), revealed that the morphology of the regions had an immature appearance relative to control littermates at the same age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Moreover, rather than follow their typical trajectory through the medium forebrain bundle to striatal targets in the forebrain, in Alfy KO brain, ectopic TH fibers were observed projecting ventrolaterally into the hypothalamus, near the location of the supraoptic decussation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>).</p><p>Axonal abnormalities were not limited to the developing brain but were also detected in the developing spinal cord of mice lacking Alfy.

In summary, these data indicate that Alfy is essential for establishing axonal tracts throughout the CNS, from forebrain commissures to the spinal cord.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Attenuated responsiveness to guidance cues in Alfy KO axons</title><p>Using two independent mouse models, we find that the loss of Alfy leads to erroneous pathfinding throughout the CNS. Several of these findings are suggestive that the anatomical phenotype observed in Alfy mutant mice may in part be due to defects in axon guidance. For example, an abnormal dopaminergic commissure at the level of the diencephalon traveling through the hypothalamus from the MFB has been previously reported in the <italic>Slit1/Slit2</italic> double KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bagri et al., 2002</xref>), the <italic>Deleted in colorectal cancer (Dcc</italic>) KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2010</xref>), and the <italic>NK2 Homeobox 1 (Nkx2.1</italic>) KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kawano et al., 2003</xref>) mice. Moreover, diminished guidance cue responsiveness could also account for the failure of the midline astroglia to migrate properly. We therefore hypothesized that Alfy may be involved in the ability of neural cells to respond to guidance cues.</p><p>Prior to determining if Alfy is involved in axon guidance, we first determined where Alfy is expressed. To do so, we reintroduced full length Alfy into Alfy null primary dissociated cultures to visualize its localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Full length Alfy constructs with an N-terminus tag were transfected into DIV7 dissociated primary cortical cultures. Alfy localized throughout the neuron, including within the axon. Neighboring astroglia also showed a diffuse localization of Alfy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Next, we performed subcellular fractionation of adult cortical lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hallett et al., 2008</xref>). Fractionation revealed that Alfy enriched in the light membrane fraction (P3) along with synaptosomal membrane protein synaptophysin and a classic marker for autophagic vesicles, the membrane bound form of microtubule associated protein light chain 3 (LC3-II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kabeya et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). Additionally, Alfy was enriched in the crude synaptic vesicle fraction (LP1).

Therefore, our data suggest that Alfy function could involve the regulation of intracellular membrane-based signaling events in response to changes in the extracellular milieu of the developing brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>A<bold>lfy is an adaptor protein for selective macroautophagy</bold> </title><p>We and others previously found using stable cell lines that Alfy was an adaptor protein for the degradation of aggregated proteins by selective macroautophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clausen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Filimonenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lystad et al., 2014</xref>). A key step in response to a guidance cue signaling is the recycling and degradation of large signaling protein complexes. Moreover, upon responding to cues, the resultant neuronal remodeling is also accompanied by the local sequestration and turnover of various cellular components, including cytoskeletal proteins. In light of the degradative capacity of macroautophagy, it is possible that this degradative pathway may be involved, and Alfy acts to sequester these cargoes.</p><p>As an adaptor protein, the absence of Alfy should not impact macroautophagic degradation overall.

Although neurons can properly mount an autophagic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), no abnormal accumulation of LC3-II was observed in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), suggesting that autophagosome maturation also is unaffected.

One naturally occurring Alfy substrate are known as aggresome-like induced structures (ALIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clausen et al., 2010</xref>). Cytosolic ubiquitinated ALIS were formed in MEFs upon mitotic inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). In contrast to control MEFs, these structures accumulated more rapidly in the absence of Alfy, suggesting that in its absence, the turnover of ALIS are impeded. Moreover, unlike in MEFs that lack all forms of macroautophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuma et al., 2004</xref>), Alfy GT MEFs do not demonstrate basal protein accumulation, suggesting that Alfy is not required for the turnover of all ubiquitinated substrates. Nonetheless, over-expression of a canonical aggregation-prone polyQ protein, a 17 amino acid fragment of the mutant huntingtin protein with 103 glutamines and an eGFP tag (17aahtt(103Q)eGFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kazantsev et al., 1999</xref>), accumulated more rapidly by the absence of Alfy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Thus, in the absence of Alfy, the elimination of ubiquitinated proteins by selective macroautophagy, but not basal macroautophagy, is impaired. Taken together with the rest of our findings, we hypothesize that Alfy-mediated sequestration of cargoes may help selectively eliminate cargoes at or around the membrane, thereby affecting the ability of axons to properly respond to guidance cues.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, our genetic models revealed that Alfy influences how growing axons interact with their environment to form stereotyped axonal connectivity in the central nervous system (CNS). The homozygous loss of <italic>Wdfy3</italic> disrupts the formation of many axonal connections, causing agenesis of all three forebrain commissural tracts and leading to profound changes in brain wiring throughout the CNS, including the optic chiasm, internal capsule, cerebral peduncle, medial forebrain bundle and spinal cord tracts. At the cellular level, the loss of Alfy led to defects in the development of midline glial population, impacted embryonic cortical neuron proliferation and impeded the ability of axons to respond to Netrin-1. Furthermore, Alfy KO mice present a phenotype unlike mice lacking core autophagy genes such as <italic>Atg5</italic>, suggesting the perinatal lethality is not due to a loss of general autophagic degradation, as Alfy mutant tissue and cells display the classic response to starvation. We hypothesize that Alfy functions as a selective macroautophagy adaptor protein and that Alfy-dependent regulation of intracellular vesicle trafficking and signaling pathways upstream of macroautophagy can have a significant influence over brain development.</p><p>The widespread disruption of axonal wiring identified in the absence of Alfy supports a functional role for this protein in the sequestration and trafficking of substrates into the autophagic pathway. In the adult brain, Alfy facilitates the sorting of ubiquitinated cargo into APs, and one possibility is that during development Alfy has an analogous function. For instance, APs are present in the growth cone and axon tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hollenbeck, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maday and Holzbaur, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maday et al., 2012</xref>). We propose that Alfy could regulate the ability of growth cones to respond to cues by sequestering and sorting proteins into degradative vesicles. Such regulation could be critical for responding to cues in the environment through changes in cell shape and motility. It has been suggested previously that the ubiquitination of guidance receptor complexes could regulate the responsiveness of axons to guidance cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">O'Donnell et al., 2009</xref>). The trafficking and responsiveness of the axonal guidance receptors Robo1 and UNC5 has been shown to be regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligases rpm-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and USP33 in murine commissural axons, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yuasa-Kawada et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, deletion of the rpm-1 homologue, Phr1, in mice, causes axonal wiring defects reminiscent of Alfy mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bloom et al., 2007</xref>). One intriguing possibility is that Alfy might sequester cargo ubiquitinated by E3 ligases such as Phr1 or USP33. Alternatively, the association of Alfy with the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lystad et al., 2014</xref>), implies Alfy could be involved in the selective sorting of plasma membrane receptors. Based on this model, we predict that in the absence of Alfy, the efficient degradation of Alfy-associated cargo would be slowed, or the cargo would be trafficked into alternative pathways, disrupting the temporal regulation of signaling events within the growth cone. Similarly, the disruption of the midline glial structures may also reflect the disruption of signaling events that promote the differentiation and migration of these cell populations. Examination of substrates labeled with a Lys63 polyUb chain, which are also associated with APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shaid et al., 2013</xref>), may identify other Alfy-interacting substrates.</p><p><italic>Wdfy3</italic> and its homologue <italic>bchs</italic> have been implicated in trafficking events associated with lysosomes, yet genetic disruptions yield distinct phenotypes in their respective model systems. Both homologues have been shown to co-localize with markers for degradative vesicles, including APs in mammals and endolysosomes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lim and Kraut, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lystad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Simonsen et al., 2004</xref>) yet, despite the conservation of domain structure, <italic>bchs</italic> loss of function (LoF) mutants have no reported developmental neuroanatomical defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khodosh et al., 2006</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>bchs,</italic> however can impact synaptic and axonal morphology at the neuromuscular junction and the retina, revealing that <italic>bchs</italic> dosage plays a role in CNS development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khodosh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kraut et al., 2001</xref>). The difference in phenotype between <italic>bchs</italic> LoF flies and Alfy mutant mice might be explained by the emergence of novel biological functions due to the evolutionary expansion of the BEACH family of genes from six in invertebrates to nine in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cullinane et al., 2013</xref>). Evolutionary divergence also has been described for the BEACH protein, <italic>Neurobeachin (Nbea</italic>), which has evolved distinct biochemical properties from its <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue <italic>rugose</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Volders et al., 2012</xref>). We propose Alfy, which shares 48% protein sequence identity with bchs, may have similarly diverged, acquiring new functions that are essential for vertebrate development.</p><p>Whereas proteasome-mediated degradation is thought to be the primary catabolic pathway regulating neurodevelopmental signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yi and Ehlers, 2007</xref>), recent studies indicate that macroautophagy may also play a critical role in morphogenesis. For instance, the loss of Ambra1, a regulator of the autophagy protein Beclin1, causes neural tube closure defects in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fimia et al., 2007</xref>). In humans, recessive mutations in <italic>TECPR2</italic> and <italic>EPG5</italic>, genes implicated in AP maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stadel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tian et al., 2010</xref>), are responsible, respectively, for spastic paraplegia 49 with brain malformations, including hypogenesis of the corpus callosum [OMIM 615031] and Vici syndrome with brain malformations, including agenesis of the corpus callosum [OMIM 242840] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cullup et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oz-Levi et al., 2012</xref>). Why loss of these autophagy-related proteins causes corpus callosum defects remains unclear. Although little is known about the importance of core autophagy genes such as <italic>Atg5, Atg7</italic> and <italic>Atg14</italic> in neurodevelopment, no obvious defects in axonal connectivity have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Komatsu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liang et al., 2010</xref>). One exception is that the conditional elimination of <italic>Atg7</italic> in POMC neurons leads to a defect in postnatal axonal outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coupe et al., 2012</xref>), and recently, a partial LoF mutation in a core autophagy gene, Atg5, have been reported to lead to cerebellar hypoplasia and developmental delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2016</xref>), but connectivity of the callosum appears unaffected. Given that degradation by autophagy is slower than proteasome-mediated turnover, these data suggest that the sorting and sequestration of cargo, rather than elimination of cargo, is critical for the timing of cellular processes regulated by macroautophagy. Alternatively, as a scaffold for ubiquitinated structures for degradation by macroautophagy, the loss of Alfy might have indirect effects on proteasome activity. For example, Alfy is recruited to aggregated structures that form upon proteasome-inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clausen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Simonsen et al., 2004</xref>); when Alfy is absent, the persistence of structures that might otherwise be eliminated may impact the efficiency of proteasome-mediated degradation. We have previously reported that the deletion of Alfy does not measurably affect the enzymatic activity of the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Filimonenko et al., 2010</xref>) and does not lead to the accumulation of ubiquitinated structures in <italic>Alfy</italic> null MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Nonetheless, it is still possible that localized, discrete disruptions of proteasome activity or modifications in activity enough to disrupt timing might be present, leading to the profound phenotype we observe here.</p><p>Genetic screening has revealed a possible role for the human <italic>Wdfy3</italic> homolog (<italic>WDFY3</italic>) as a genetic risk factor for intellectual and developmental disabilities. Most recently, a missense mutation in <italic>WDFY3</italic> has been linked to autosomal dominant primary microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kadir et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), rare <italic>de novo</italic> nonsense mutations within <italic>WDFY3</italic> have been identified across two independent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Rubeis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iossifov et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>WDFY3</italic> resides on chromosome 4q21.23 and this region of chromosome 4 was suggested to harbor a genetic predisposition to ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2006</xref>) and to schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Faraone et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paunio et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, the dosage of <italic>WDFY3</italic> is affected in a subset of individuals with a rare chromosome disorder known as 4q21 deletion syndrome [OMIM 613509], characterized by intellectual disabilities (ID), language impairment and congenital birth defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonnet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cooper et al., 2011</xref>). Taken together, these data imply <italic>WDFY3</italic> is a rare genetic risk factor for childhood neurological disorders. Future studies should aim to determine whether <italic>WDFY3</italic> dosage is critical for human brain development and how mutations could potentially disrupt the biological function of Alfy. A network analysis study on genomic data found that CNVs in genes associated with autophagy were enriched in patients with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Poultney et al., 2013</xref>). While it remains to be determined whether computational modeling can be used to accurately predict the cellular pathways disrupted in ASD, in light of our findings, we would propose that further study is warranted.</p><p>In conclusion, mice lacking Alfy survive embryogenesis, but the loss of Alfy function produces widespread CNS defects in axonal tracts, including loss of the major forebrain commissures. The results of our study provide new insight into the genetic control of brain wiring and open the door to many new questions surrounding the physiological role of Alfy and selective autophagy in CNS development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies</title><p>The following antibodies were used for western blot, immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and immunoprecipitation experiments: Anti-Alfy (rabbit polyclonal anti-COOH Alfy; generously provided by Dr. Anne Simonsen and used for western blots and immunoprecipitation), anti-Alfy-N1 (rabbit polyclonal anti-NH3 Alfy; generously provided by Dr. Masaaki Komatsu and used for western blots), anti-BrdU clone BU-33 (B2531, Sigma-Aldrich [St. Louis, MO]), anti-Caspase 3 active/cleaved form (AB3623, EMD Millipore [Germany]), anti-Class βIII-Tubulin (PRB-435P, Covance [Princeton, NJ]), anti-Human DCC (554222, BD Biosciences [San Jose, CA]), anti-Digoxigenin-AP, Fab fragments (Roche [Switzerland]), anti-Doublecortin (ab18723, Abcam [Cambridge, MA]), anti-GFAP, clone GA5 (MAB3402, EMD Millipore), anti-LC3 (for immunofluorescence, rabbit polyclonal; generously provided by Ron Kopito), anti-LC3B (for western blots, ab48394, Abcam), anti-Ki67 clone B56 (550609, BD Biosciences), anti-MAP-2 (ab11267, Abcam), anti-NCAML1, clone 324 (MAB5272, EMD Millipore), anti-Neurofilament clone2H3 (developed by TM Jessell and J Dodd and was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD and maintained by the University of Iowa), anti-Robo1 (H-200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology [Santa Cruz, CA]), anti-synaptophysin (101 002, Synaptic Systems [Germany]), anti-Tau-1, clone PC1C6 (MAB3420, EMD Millipore), anti-Tbr1 (AB2261, EMD Millipore), and anti-Ubiquitin, clone FK2 (Enzo Life Sciences [Farmingdale, NY]).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Additional shared reagents</title><p>The following reagents were generously provided: Atg5 knockout and wildtype MEFs (Noboru Mizushima, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Itakura and Mizushima, 2010</xref>]) and MYC-tagged Netrin-1 (pGNET1-myc) (Marc Tessier-Lavigne [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Serafini et al., 1994</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Mice</title><p>All animals and procedures complied with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the IACUC committee at Columbia University.

All dissections were carried out in ice-cold PBS. The embryonic cerebral cortex was dissected out and finely cut into pieces, then 28 gauge needles were used to transfer and position explant pieces inside a drop (5 µL) of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) on a collagen-coated glass bottom petri dish (MatTek). Once explants were placed, 350 µm diameter punches of solidified agarose cell blocks containing either untransfected or Netrin1-MYC transfected HEK293T cells were placed alongside cortical explant pieces. Explants were grown for 48 hr, and then fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min. Explants were imaged and measured using phase contrast microscopy using a 10X objective on a Nikon TiE microscope and NIS Elements software (Nikon). Across two experiments, outgrowth in microns towards the HEK293T cellblock was recorded for the three longest processes in a single plane. The measurements were averaged for each explant and statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA followed by the Fisher LSD post hoc test. Following analysis of outgrowth, explants were further processed for immunocytochemistry as described above. To prepare HEK293T agarose cell blocks, HEK293T cells were seeded at 600,000 cells per six well, then 16 hr later transiently transfected with pGNET1-myc using Lipofectamine 2000. The following day, untransfected HEK293T or HEK293T cells transfected with Netrin1-MYC were trypsinized, pelleted and resuspended in 900 µL of warm (~50°C) 1% agarose dissolved in DMEM.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Ralph Nixon, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ivan Dikic as the Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports that Alfy deletion disrupts brain development and especially the guidance of axons and formation of forebrain commissures. Concerns expressed about validating the presence of Alfy in the neuronal and glial populations under investigation have been thoroughly addressed. The evidence presented also supports the conclusion that loss of Alfy disrupts localization of glial guidepost cells and prevents axons from responding to guidance cues such as Netrin-1. Alfy knockout mice display malformations of most major axon tracts in the brain as well as a thinner cerebral cortex and a markedly reduced thalamus. These are novel and worthwhile findings of interest to a broad neuroscience audience and indicate a key developmental role for Alfy. They raise the possibility that the known function of Alfy in selective autophagy may be critical in development. Some support for this latter conclusion is provided by showing that Alfy deletion in the mouse model somewhat impairs selective autophagy of previously established Alfy targets but not macroautophagy as monitored by LC3 behaviour. Overall this manuscript makes an important contribution but there are some important issues that need to be addressed by the authors.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors show that Alfy is expressed in astrocyte cultures. They then look at mixed astrocyte and neuronal cultures and find Alfy expression. They conclude from this that Alfy is expressed in both neurons and glia but this conclusion cannot follow from this experiment. The expression in the mixed culture likely comes from the astrocytes. The data on the mixed culture adds nothing. If the authors want to claim that Alfy is expressed in neurons, which is important for their hypothesis of a cell autonomous role in axonal guidance, then they need to demonstrate expression in neurons that are free of astrocytes.</p><p>2) The relationship between the axonal defects and the disruption of selective autophagy of Alfy substrates is correlational and the possibility exists that Alfy serves additional functions that are driving the developmental defects or that deletion elicits a response in another system that is responsible. The authors point out that evidence that the proteasome has been implicated to a greater extent in developmental abnormalities and the possibility of an indirect effect of Alfy deletion on proteasome activity should be discussed. The initial description of Alfy in fact mentioned that proteasome inhibition alters Alfy behavior and it is reasonable to suppose that blocking Alfy function could have some effects on proteasome as compensation. This is one of various possible unconventional roles that might be imagined for a protein with the properties of Alfy. In the absence of direct evidence that selective autophagy block is responsible for the developmental phenotype, it would be advisable to discuss this possibility as an alternative.</p><p>3) The authors perform 1 BrdU pulse experiment at E15.5 and find no difference in proliferation by visualisation.

They then look at mixed astrocyte and neuronal cultures and find Alfy expression. They conclude from this that Alfy is expressed in both neurons and glia but this conclusion cannot follow from this experiment. The expression in the mixed culture likely comes from the astrocytes. The data on the mixed culture adds nothing. If the authors want to claim that Alfy is expressed in neurons, which is important for their hypothesis of a cell autonomous role in axonal guidance, then they need to demonstrate expression in neurons that are free of astrocytes.</italic> </p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> we now provide evidence that Alfy is expressed in neurons. To eliminate glial cells, we add mitotic inhibitors to our culture preparation, and maintain the cultures until the glial cells have been eliminated, as measured by the abundance of GFAP by western blot. First, despite the presence of mitotic inhibitors, the amount of BIII tubulin in the cultures remained constant, suggesting that the neuronal population was largely unaffected by this treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Alfy is present in these predominately neuronal cultures, providing evidence that Alfy is endogenously expressed by neurons. When compared with mixed cultures containing both neurons and glia, we detect lower levels of Alfy, implying that both neuronal and non-neuronal cells produce Alfy. Glial expression of Alfy is supported by additional data included in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, showing that Alfy is detectable in purified astroglial cultures.</p><p><italic>2) The relationship between the axonal defects and the disruption of selective autophagy of Alfy substrates is correlational and the possibility exists that Alfy serves additional functions that are driving the developmental defects or that deletion elicits a response in another system that is responsible. The authors point out that evidence that the proteasome has been implicated to a greater extent in developmental abnormalities and the possibility of an indirect effect of Alfy deletion on proteasome activity should be discussed. The initial description of Alfy in fact mentioned that proteasome inhibition alters Alfy behavior and it is reasonable to suppose that blocking Alfy function could have some effects on proteasome as compensation. This is one of various possible unconventional roles that might be imagined for a protein with the properties of Alfy. In the absence of direct evidence that selective autophagy block is responsible for the developmental phenotype, it would be advisable to discuss this possibility as an alternative.</italic> </p><p>Given that we are uncertain of the molecular mechanism of Alfy leading to this neurodevelopmental phenotype, we agree that a greater discussion of a potential interplay between Alfy expression and proteasome function should be included, especially as an alternative interpretation. This has now been included in the Discussion section, and it reads as follows:</p><p>“Alternatively, as a scaffold for ubiquitinated structures for degradation by macroautophagy, the loss of Alfy might have indirect effects on proteasome activity. […] Nonetheless, it is still possible that localized, discrete disruptions of proteasome activity or modifications in activity enough to disrupt timing might be present, leading to the profound phenotype we observe here.”</p><p><italic>3) The authors perform 1 BrdU pulse experiment at E15.5 and find no difference in proliferation by visualisation. They conclude that Alfy knockout mice do not display a defect in proliferation. This data is not comprehensive enough for such a sweeping statement. Analyses should be completed at multiple developmental stages from E12.5 and quantifications performed. The fact that the cortex is thinner and the thalamus is considerably reduced indicate that there is an issue with the generation, or premature differentiation, of neurons in Alfy mutant mice. Although these may not underlie the axonal guidance disorders, the authors cannot present their argument that Alfy specifically regulates axonal guidance and not neuronal development, based on the current evidence provided.</italic> </p><p>To address this issue, we now provide stereologic quantification of BrdU incorporated nuclei from E13.5 and E15.5. As now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, we report that the number of proliferating cells in the neocortical ventricular zone labeled by BrdU at E13.5 was similar between Alfy KO and control embryos, but a modest but significant reduction was observed in Alfy KO embryos at E15.5. In light of this addition, we have now updated our Discussion section to reflect this new finding.</p><p><italic>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> the authors nicely demonstrate that Alfy mutant mice display migration defects (although it is not clear what the n value for these observations is). However, the authors conclude from a gross inspection of Doublecortin staining that the mice have no migration defects. This is confusing. Is it because the migration phenotypes occur in only a subset of the mice? It is also not clear what the Tbr1 staining provides? There is no quantification of this result.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the confusion. Our inclusion of the Doublecortin staining and the Tbr1 patterning was to indicate qualitatively that markers indicative of migration were intact, but, as the reviewers indicate, discrete focal cortical dysplasias (FCD) are observed. We clarify this statement accordingly. In addition, we now provide in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> a quantification of the number of animals in which we observe FCDs (which are in all Alfy null animals examined). We also provide new data, indicating that these malformations are already present in E15.5 cortices.</p><p><italic>5) The axonal guidance assays on explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) show an increase in outgrowth to Netrin1 in control cultures compared with Alfy mutant cultures. This experiment can only conclude an effect on outgrowth, not direction (and therefore not axonal guidance). In order to conclude an effect on axonal guidance, the cue must be derived from a source and a quantification of outgrowth on the side closest to the guidance cue compared to the side away from the guidance cue is conventionally performed.</italic> </p><p>We previously performed a co-culture assay to investigate whether Alfy regulates axonal outgrowth and guidance in response to extracellular cues in the environment but without the quantification of directional axonal outgrowth from the explant, we cannot conclude that Alfy is involved in regulating axon guidance. In this submission, we include an analysis of directional outgrowth that was calculated by measuring the length of axons growing on the side of the explant facing the cue and dividing by the length of axons on the opposite side of the explant. We represent this as a guidance ratio and find that while our co-culture conditions generate a reproducible effect on outgrowth in response to Netrin-1 exposure, we do not observe directional growth in either genotype, indicating that our culture conditions do not permit this measurement. We now include both measurements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and additional images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>. One explanation for this outcome is that HEK293T cells have a high secretory capacity, which may cause Netrin-1 act more diffusely. In light of these findings, we have updated our Results and Discussion sections to indicate that the Alfy KO neurons respond less robustly to the trophic effects of Netrin-1, but that we cannot conclude that the loss of Alfy causes a defect in axon guidance.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors need to include the n values in each figure legend for every analysis – even those that are descriptive – so that the reader knows that the result has been replicated.</italic> </p><p>Please find enclosed all of the n values throughout the figure legends, including all subsections.
