This methyl group has also been found in the mRNA of certain viruses, including the Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) which causes cancer. Recent work has shown that a family of proteins, known as the YTH family, can recognise and bind to this specific methyl group and regulate the rate at which mRNA degrades. To investigate whether other proteins can recognise m<sup>6</sup>A, Baquero-Pérez et al. mapped the m<sup>6</sup>A residues of mRNAs encoded by KSHV genes and looked at which proteins the methyl mark interacts with.</p><p>The experiments revealed that a family of proteins – nicknamed the ‘Royal family’ – that recognise methyl groups in proteins, can also bind to mRNA that contains m<sup>6</sup>A.

Further experiments showed that SND1 binds to and stabilises a viral mRNA which provides the template for a protein that the virus needs to replicate. When SND1 was removed from human immune cells infected with KSHV, this caused the virus to replicate less efficiently.</p><p>The discovery that the Royal family of proteins can recognise methylated mRNA as well as methylated proteins suggests that there may be a common feature that allows proteins to read methylation.

Despite the identification of this modification over four decades ago, only recently have major breakthroughs in our understanding of this modification been made due to the development of m<sup>6</sup>A-seq, which allows immunoprecipitation of fragmented m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNAs followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. m<sup>6</sup>A-seq and subsequent enhanced versions of the technique led to transcriptome-wide maps of cellular m<sup>6</sup>A modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dominissini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Patil et al., 2016</xref>). m<sup>6</sup>A writers have also been identified, a catalytically active methyl-transferase, METTL3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), together with adapter components, catalyses m<sup>6</sup>A addition onto specific RNA sequences containing the DRm<sup>6</sup>ACH motif, where D = A, G or U; R = A or G; H = A, C or U. The RNA demethylases FTO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jia et al., 2011</xref>) and ALKBH5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>) can erase m<sup>6</sup>A marks offering a dynamic regulation of m<sup>6</sup>A status in RNA. Importantly, a family of effector m<sup>6</sup>A readers have also been identified comprising five YT521-B homology (YTH) domain-containing proteins. YTH readers directly bind m<sup>6</sup>A in target RNAs through an aromatic cage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liao et al., 2018</xref>), directing their targets towards different biological fates. YTHDF2 recruits the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex and promotes degradation of m<sup>6</sup>A-containing RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Du et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) while YTHDF1, YTHDF3 and YTHDC2 stimulate mRNA translation of their targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hsu et al., 2017</xref>) and YTHDC1 regulates mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>). Whether other proteins can directly recognise m<sup>6</sup>A has remained a question to date. Other RNA-binding proteins can read m<sup>6</sup>A indirectly, in a so-called ‘m<sup>6</sup>A switch’ mechanism, in which m<sup>6</sup>A destabilises the local RNA structure in hairpins allowing recruitment of either hnRNPC to U-tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2015</xref>) or hnRNPG to a purine-rich motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), both readers then regulate alternative splicing. Recently, IGF2BP proteins were reported to enhance mRNA stability and translation of m<sup>6</sup>A-containing RNAs and proposed to be a novel class of m<sup>6</sup>A readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Due to recent transcriptome-wide m<sup>6</sup>A mapping of multiple viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kennedy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lichinchi et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tirumuru et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gokhale et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lichinchi et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Courtney et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hesser et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tan et al., 2018</xref>), it is becoming evident that there is an interplay between m<sup>6</sup>A-decorated viral RNA and cellular m<sup>6</sup>A machinery, resulting in modulation of viral replication output.</p><p>Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a DNA virus responsible for several Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome-associated aggressive malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baquero-Pérez and Whitehouse, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schumann et al., 2017</xref>). KSHV has a biphasic life cycle, with a latent phase and a productive lytic phase. During latency, the KSHV episome is dormant in the nucleus of endothelial progenitor cells and B-lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Giffin and Damania, 2014</xref>), with few viral latent genes expressed. Under various stimuli, the KSHV episome can be reactivated into lytic replication, leading to the ordered expression of more than 80 viral proteins. The replication and transcription activator (RTA) viral protein, which is encoded from open reading frame 50 (ORF50), is the first lytic protein produced and is essential for the latent-lytic switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guito and Lukac, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here we accurately decipher the KSHV m<sup>6</sup>A epitranscriptome using a novel m<sup>6</sup>A peak-calling algorithm and characterise m<sup>6</sup>A readers that specifically interact with KSHV m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNA sequences found in <italic>ORF50</italic> and <italic>ORF37</italic>. Through the use of RNA affinity, in addition to YTH readers, eight members from the Tudor domain ‘Royal family’, including SND1 (Staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing protein 1), were specifically enriched in m<sup>6</sup>A-modified KSHV sequences. The ‘Royal family’ is a well-characterised family that reads methylated residues in histones through the use of an aromatic cage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2011</xref>) which is structurally similar to the one found in YTH readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Luo and Tong, 2014</xref>). Electromobility shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrate the ability of specific Royal domains to selectively bind m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNA. As these domains do not bind all m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNA sequences it suggests this binding may occur in a RNA secondary structure/sequence-dependent manner. We further developed a modified RIP-seq technique, which significantly improves the resolution of standard RIP, accompanied by a unique bioinformatic analysis to characterise for the first time the transcriptome-wide binding profile of SND1 to cellular and KSHV mRNAs, revealing SND1 as a <italic>bona fide</italic> RNA-binding protein that targets m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNAs in KSHV-infected cells, including the extensively m<sup>6</sup>A-modified <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA. SND1 eCLIP (enhanced crosslinking immunoprecipitation) analysis using publically available datasets deposited in the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) further confirmed that SND1 has a binding profile similar to other m<sup>6</sup>A reader proteins. Importantly, depletion of SND1 in KSHV-infected cells significantly reduced the stability of unspliced <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA and led to markedly reduced levels of RTA protein together with a global impairment of KSHV lytic replication. Furthermore, we show that m<sup>6</sup>A-modification in <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA regulates SND1 binding to this RNA, particularly to the unspliced form. These data identify SND1 as an essential m<sup>6</sup>A reader for KSHV lytic replication and implicate the ‘Royal family’ as a family which comprises m<sup>6</sup>A readers. This, considerably expands the landscape of m<sup>6</sup>A readers and the epigenetic functions of Royal members beyond protein methylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The KSHV transcriptome is extensively m<sup>6</sup>A-methylated in a cell type-specific manner</title><p>We have previously developed dedicated software (m6aViewer) which implements a novel m<sup>6</sup>A peak-calling algorithm that identifies high-confidence methylated residues with more precision than previously described approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antanaviciute et al., 2017</xref>). Utilising this software we mapped m<sup>6</sup>A modifications in the KSHV transcriptome by performing m<sup>6</sup>A-seq in TREx BCBL1-Rta cells, a BCBL1-based, primary effusion lymphoma B-cell line containing latent KSHV episomes capable of doxycycline-inducible reactivation of lytic replication. We carried out m<sup>6</sup>A-seq in latent cells and cells undergoing lytic replication for 8 hr and 20 hr post-induction in two biological replicates. In latent cells, we consistently observed m<sup>6</sup>A peaks in six viral RNAs, including <italic>ORF72</italic> and <italic>ORF73</italic>. At 8 hr post-reactivation, 33 m<sup>6</sup>A peaks were identified in 21 KSHV ORFs in both biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). At 20 hr post-reactivation, 75 m<sup>6</sup>A peaks were mapped in 42 KSHV ORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The positions of these m<sup>6</sup>A peaks were highly reproducible across the different time points and replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). 12 viral m<sup>6</sup>A peaks were further validated by two-step quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). m<sup>6</sup>A peaks in cellular RNAs were also consistently called, with 18,946 m<sup>6</sup>A peaks common to both replicates in latent cells and 18,935 and 13,926 m<sup>6</sup>A peaks in cells reactivated for 8 hr and 20 hr, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Cellular m<sup>6</sup>A peaks remained mostly unchanged between latent and 8 hr of lytic replication. Lower detection of m<sup>6</sup>A peaks at 20 hr post-reactivation was observed in part due to KSHV-mediated host cell shut-off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conrad, 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). However, the majority of uniquely identified m<sup>6</sup>A peaks at this time point were found in RNAs whose expression was increased during lytic replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Cellular m<sup>6</sup>A peaks were enriched in the coding region (CDS) and 3’ untranslated region (UTR) throughout KSHV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). In viral mRNAs, the majority of m<sup>6</sup>A peaks were located in the CDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). We also confirmed the DRm<sup>6</sup>ACH motif both in cellular and viral mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f and g</xref>, respectively). Approximately 60% of viral m<sup>6</sup>A peaks contained the GGm<sup>6</sup>AC[G/U] motif, a significant over-representation of the motif when compared to the expected DRm<sup>6</sup>ACH frequency.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47261.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The KSHV transcriptome is extensively m<sup>6</sup>A-modified.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) KSHV epitranscriptome map in TREx BCBL1-Rta cells at 20 hr post-lytic reactivation. m<sup>6</sup>A-IP reads and input reads are shown. m<sup>6</sup>A peaks identified by m6AViewer software with associated p-values are indicated.

After applying these cut-offs, our TREx BCBL1-Rta cells datasets contained twice as many m<sup>6</sup>A peaks as compared to the Tan dataset in the same cell line. ~17,000 and~10,000 cellular m<sup>6</sup>A peaks were identified in our dataset during latency and lytic replication, respectively, while the Tan dataset yielded ~9,000 m<sup>6</sup>A peaks during latency and ~4,500 m<sup>6</sup>A peaks during lytic replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The most cellular m<sup>6</sup>A peaks were identified in the Hesser datasets in iSLK cells with ~25,000 m<sup>6</sup>A peaks. A direct one-to-one reciprocal overlap comparison between each of our m<sup>6</sup>A peaks and those found in the other datasets was not possible, mostly due to vastly different peak widths (with the other datasets having narrower peaks and containing short read length coupled to single end data). In such situations, many peaks cannot be mapped one-to-one, with multiple peaks often overlapping a single one when comparing datasets, which leads to overlap quantifications that are not easily interpretable. Therefore, we compared the overlap of m<sup>6</sup>A-modified transcripts identified between all three studies. In TREx BCBL1-Rta cells, 72% of our 5,830 m<sup>6</sup>A-modified transcripts in latent cells were also present in the same cell line during latency in the Tan dataset, while 52% of our 4,059 m<sup>6</sup>A-modified transcripts in lytic cells were common to the lytic Tan dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).~80% of m<sup>6</sup>A-modified transcripts in our TREx BCBL1-Rta dataset were also identified in the Hesser dataset which mapped m<sup>6</sup>A in iSLK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).

Of particular interest were the m<sup>6</sup>A peaks found in the second exon of <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA, as this RNA encodes the latent to lytic switch RTA protein. To this end, RNA affinity coupled to mass spectrometry analysis was performed. Viral RNA baits were centred on the closest GGACU motif to the m<sup>6</sup>A peak positions of the largest peak of <italic>ORF37</italic> and the first and fourth m<sup>6</sup>A peaks of the second exon of <italic>ORF50</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>) (hereafter referred to as ORF37, ORF50-1 and ORF50-4 baits respectively). See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> for m<sup>6</sup>A peak positions from all m<sup>6</sup>A-seq time points. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that all three m<sup>6</sup>A baits enriched for YTH readers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). An intriguing observation was that of the three viral baits, exclusively the methylated ORF50-1 (m<sup>6</sup>A-ORF50-1) distinctly enriched SND1, a Tudor domain-containing protein. SND1 was in the top thirteen enriched protein hits, together with YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3. Further binding validation of YTHDF1 and SND1 in RNA affinity experiments demonstrated that YTHDF1 was greatly enriched in all three methylated baits while SND1 showed a modest but clear enrichment exclusively in m<sup>6</sup>A-ORF50-1 bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). SND1 binds symmetrically dimethylated arginines (sDMA) via its Tudor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), thus it harbours the ability to selectively recognise methyl groups. In addition to SND1, m<sup>6</sup>A-ORF50-1 bait also prominently pulled down three spliceosomal proteins known to interact with the Tudor domain of SND1, snRNP200, snRNP116 and PRPF8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). These proteins were within the top fifteen enriched protein hits. Multiple proteins related to RNA processing were also enriched in this bait (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). SND1 belongs to the Tudor domain ‘Royal family’, comprising five subfamilies: Tudor, plant agenet, chromo, PWWP and MBT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Maurer-Stroh et al., 2003</xref>). Members from each subfamily share a structurally related β-barrel that harbours an aromatic cage implicated in binding methylated arginines and lysines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). Intriguingly, the aromatic cage used for m<sup>6</sup>A recognition by YTH readers is structurally similar to the one present in the ‘Royal family’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Luo and Tong, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, further scrutiny for Royal members was carried out in the mass spectrometry data. Strikingly, several Royal members were also enriched in methylated viral baits. All three plant agenet members, which were recently identified as RNA sequence-dependent m<sup>6</sup>A readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Edupuganti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arguello et al., 2017</xref>), were exclusively bound to m<sup>6</sup>A-ORF50-1 bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Three PWWP domain-containing proteins were also enriched in m<sup>6</sup>A-ORF50-1 bait while m<sup>6</sup>A-ORF37 bait retrieved the chromo protein CBX3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). These results suggest that Royal domains may be capable of reading methyl-decorations not only in proteins but also in RNA. None of the indirect m<sup>6</sup>A readers, hnRNPA2B1, hnRNPC or hnRNPG, or IGF2BP proteins were enriched in any of the baits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Eight proteins with methyl-transferase activity were also recruited to methylated baits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), of these, METTL16 is the second m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase identified to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pendleton et al., 2017</xref>), which methylates structured RNAs where the adenosine is present in a bulge in the nonamer sequence UAC<underline>A</underline>GAGAA, where <underline>A</underline> is modified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mendel et al., 2018</xref>).

The complete Royal Tudor domain of SND1 (residues 650–910) is required for sDMA-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), consequently, a GST-recombinant protein containing these residues (548-910), referred here as SND1-C-terminus, was used in native electromobility shift assays (EMSAs). Notably, SND1-C-terminus shifted m<sup>6</sup>A-ORF50-1 bait in contrast to the control bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Neither ORF50-4 nor ORF37 methylated baits were selectively bound by SND1-C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>, respectively). Note that the membranes had to be overexposed to obtain a good shift signal due to the small amount of shifted RNA in comparison with the free bait, consistent with the modest enrichment of SND1 in m<sup>6</sup>A-ORF50-1 bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similarly, a weak shift has also been previously observed in EMSAs for FMRP protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Edens et al., 2019</xref>) and IGF2BP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). RNA secondary structure prediction of all baits indicates that they form strongly base-paired hairpins with an apical loop in which m<sup>6</sup>A is exposed and an additional large unpaired bulge; however, ORF50-4 and ORF37 feature this unpaired bulge in the middle of their stem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). This may imply that SND1 cannot bind when the unpaired bulge is present at this position irrespective of m<sup>6</sup>A. In contrast, the beginning of the stem of ORF50-1 shows weak base-pairing with four unpaired bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, black box) that may allow opening of the hairpin and selective SND1-binding when m<sup>6</sup>A is present. Curiously, when running m<sup>6</sup>A-ORF50-1 bait on its own (without any protein), two distinct bands were visualised, one lower band which migrated at the same speed of A-ORF50-1 bait and another higher band migrating slower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Electrospray ionisation (ESI) of the ORF50-1 baits showed that there were no truncated forms and that the correct molecular weight of a methyl group had been added (15 daltons), demonstrating the purity of the baits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). As m<sup>6</sup>A can destabilise local RNA structure in hairpins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2015</xref>), it seems plausible that m<sup>6</sup>A addition to ORF50-1 destabilises the hairpin which then migrates slower compared with the non-methylated bait. To test this hypothesis, a cropped version of ORF50-1 bait (cORF50-1) with strong base-pairing throughout the stem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) was tested in EMSAs. Remarkably, SND1-C-terminus did not shift this bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>), highlighting that structural features of the RNA ligand are critical for SND1-binding and that the beginning of the m<sup>6</sup>A-ORF50-1 hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, boxed region) may be required for an interaction with SND1. We further mutated seven nucleotides to make this region very structured and stable, as demonstrated by the increase in free energy of this stable hairpin (sORF50-1). No specific selectivity for m<sup>6</sup>A-sORF50-1 by SND1-C-terminus was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>), indicating that destabilisation of this region is required for SND1 binding. Shorter exposure of the free m<sup>6</sup>A-sORF50-1 bait did not reveal two distinct bands as the ones present in m<sup>6</sup>A-ORF50-1 hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). To further support the hypothesis that Royal domains harbour selectivity for m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNA, GST-recombinant proteins containing the Royal domains of FXR1, PSIP1 and CBX3 were tested in EMSAs. Coomassie staining for all recombinant proteins can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>. The Royal domains of FXR1 and PSIP1 selectively shifted m<sup>6</sup>A-ORF50-1 bait, in contrast, none of the other baits were bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6a and b</xref>, respectively). The CBX3 chromodomain displayed a very faint shift for m<sup>6</sup>A-ORF50-1 bait, however this shift was not consistent between protein preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7a</xref>) indicating that this domain either may not be able to read m<sup>6</sup>A, or other protein partners could be required for its interaction with m<sup>6</sup>A in vivo. Control glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST), a protein with no RNA-binding properties, was also tested in EMSA showing no selectivity for m<sup>6</sup>A-ORF50-1 bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7b</xref>). EMSAs were also performed in the presence of excess herring sperm DNA as a source of non-specific DNA. In the presence of sperm DNA no shift was detected and the free bait remained uncomplexed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7c</xref>), suggesting that non-specific DNA prevents the interaction between SND1 and m<sup>6</sup>A-ORF50-1 bait. This is not surprising as excess of DNA may sequester SND1 which is a known DNA-binding transcription factor. Together, these results confirm that Royal domains in the absence of any other protein interaction display selectivity for m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNA, our data also suggests that this selectivity may occur in a RNA secondary structure-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>SND1 is an m<sup>6</sup>A reader in KSHV-infected cells</title><p>Next, we aimed to characterise the RNA-binding sites of endogenous SND1 transcriptome-wide during KSHV infection by performing RIP-seq in two biological replicates.

Unexpectedly, after construction of the cDNA library from the SND1-RNA immunoprecipitated (RIP) samples, the majority of the fragments ranged from 150 to 1000 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Thus, this technique has a binding site resolution of ~1 kB. A transcript-wide analysis enabled us to identify SND1 RNA targets, using a false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 1% and a fold change of RIP reads over input reads &gt;2, this analysis uncovered SND1 as a <italic>bona fide</italic> RNA-binding protein, yielding 5061 target transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Of these, 3319 transcripts were mRNAs and 748 were long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). These target RNAs were consistently bound by SND1 during latency and lytic KSHV replication (both at 8 and 20 hr). Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these transcripts code for proteins that are involved in regulating GTPase activity, nervous system development and cell morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Next, all highly expressed transcripts identified by RIP-seq (FDR &lt; 1%) were divided into high-confidence targets (those which had at least twice the normalised coverage in RIPs than input) and high-confidence non-targets (those which had at least twice as much coverage in inputs than RIPs) and the proportion of m<sup>6</sup>A-bearing RNAs in each group was determined. Strikingly, we observed that ~50% of high-confidence targets and ~24% of high-confidence non-targets were m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), representing a marked enrichment of m<sup>6</sup>A-bearing RNAs in the target group. It is worth noting that this transcript-wide analysis will not identify all SND1 targets, as when looking at the SND1-binding profile at the transcript level, it was evident that some RNAs are bound by SND1 at a specific region only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47261.016</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>SND1 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> RNA-binding protein that targets transcripts bearing m<sup>6</sup>A modification.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Most significantly enriched GO terms amongst the 5061 target RNAs (Ensembl transcripts) identified by RIP-seq which are consistently bound by SND1 at all time points (0 hr, 8 hr and 20 hr post-reactivation) in TREx BCBL1-Rta cells.

We then mined previously processed PAR-CLIP and m<sup>6</sup>A-seq data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shi et al., 2017</xref>) from HeLa cells and calculated the percentage of total RNA targets of YTH readers that contain m<sup>6</sup>A-modified transcripts. ~ 65% of all RNA targets contained m<sup>6</sup>A-modified transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, we compared the overlap of target genes containing or lacking m<sup>6</sup>A modification between SND1 and each heterologously expressed YTH reader.

These results show that SND1 does not merely co-precipitate with YTH readers and that it has a distinct RNA-binding profile.</p><p>To identify SND1 RNA targets that could be missed by transcript-wide analysis, a novel localised enrichment analysis was developed similar to that used in ChIP-seq analysis (see Materials and methods). In brief, both spliced transcripts and introns were segmented into a total of ~750,000 transcriptomic regions based on changes in their fold change RIP/input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Applying a fold change &gt;2 and &gt;50 mean reads per region (FDR &lt; 1%), 32,314 transcriptomic regions were significantly bound by SND1. These regions encompassed 12,915 Ensembl transcripts and after applying a cut-off of &gt;2 fold m<sup>6</sup>A-IP/input enrichment and a minimum RIP read depth of 50,~40% of these transcripts were m<sup>6</sup>A-modified. 4872 of these total targets showed SND1-binding throughout 5’UTR, CDS and 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). We then focused on analysing SND1-enriched intronic regions, as introns tend to be longer than spliced RNAs and RIP-seq has a low resolution, we hypothesised that if SND1 is an m<sup>6</sup>A reader we might observe m<sup>6</sup>A peaks overlapping with SND1-enriched regions in introns. Out of the total 32,314 SND1-enriched regions, 2563 regions were found in introns. Of the latter, 516 intronic regions (20%), directly overlapped with m<sup>6</sup>A peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and e</xref>). As a control for random overlap, 8,328 SND1-unbound intronic regions were used, these were defined using a fold change RIP/input &lt; 0.5 and &gt;50 mean reads per region (FDR &lt; 1%).

Interestingly, a U-tract was the most significant motif identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3b</xref>). In addition, several GAC-containing motifs appeared as significantly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3c</xref>). When searching for motifs that were 30 nucleotides long in SND1-bound intronic regions containing m<sup>6</sup>A peaks, a U-tract immediately followed by an m<sup>6</sup>A motif was identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3d</xref>). In SND1-bound intronic regions that do not have m<sup>6</sup>A peaks, a U-tract was also the most enriched motif. Notably, U-rich motifs found adjacent to m<sup>6</sup>A residues are also targeted by RBM15/15B and hnRNPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Patil et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>RIP-seq also enabled us to identify differential SND1-binding to target RNAs that correlated to both differentially m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNAs and the status of KSHV infection. During latency, one of the introns in <italic>TPO</italic> transcript was not m<sup>6</sup>A-modified and failed to bind SND1. In contrast, at 8 hr and 20 hr post-reactivation, several adenosines in this intron are m<sup>6</sup>A-modified and SND1 binding ensues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). The reverse scenario was also observed for example in the overlapping DUSP5P1-<italic>RHOU</italic> transcripts, in which specific m<sup>6</sup>A peaks and SND1-enriched regions present at 0 hr and 8 hr post-reactivation disappeared at 20 hr of lytic reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). A list of these differential SND1-binding events to target RNAs can be accessed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SND1 targets m<sup>6</sup>A-modified regions in KSHV-infected cells at the transcriptome level.</p><p>To further address the binding profile for SND1 we re-analysed multiple eCLIP datasets from the ENCODE consortium for established m<sup>6</sup>A reader proteins and SND1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Van Nostrand, 2017</xref>). Since the eCLIP datasets were derived from HepG2 cells, we firstly assessed the overlap between the m<sup>6</sup>A profile in latent TREx BCBL1-Rta cells and HepG2 cells using an existing m<sup>6</sup>A-seq dataset from HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). This revealed an extensive overlap of transcripts which contain m<sup>6</sup>A sites in these two cells lines, with 77% of TREx BCBL1-Rta m<sup>6</sup>A-modified transcripts being present in HepG2 cells. We then investigated the overlap between transcripts which are m<sup>6</sup>A-modified and bound by SND1 from RIP-seq and eCLIP datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). This showed an overlap of 1166 transcripts bound by SND1 of which 88% contained m<sup>6</sup>A sites. We next compared the extent of overlap between m<sup>6</sup>A and eCLIP peaks on transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). We found comparable binding site overlap for SND1 and established readers with m<sup>6</sup>A peaks, whereas a control protein (TIAL1) showed reduced overlap between m<sup>6</sup>A peaks and its binding sites. We investigated the repertoire of transcripts bound by SND1 and other reader proteins and found extensive binding to protein coding transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). SND1 showed a similar distribution to m<sup>6</sup>A across transcripts with a bias towards coding region binding in common with most other reader proteins, whereas the control TIAL1 protein displayed a strong 3’ UTR bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). We used HOMER to identify motifs bound by SND1 and other established reader proteins using the ENCODE eCLIP datasets. This analysis, using peaks called from all transcripts, revealed a common sequence GGAC, the core of the consensus motif surrounding m<sup>6</sup>A sites. For SND1, this motif is further enriched from the eight highest scoring motif, when performed on all eCLIP peaks (30,121 peaks), to the second highest scoring motif, upon restricting the analysis to SND1 binding sites on exons which contain the m<sup>6</sup>A modification (7965 peaks), of which 58% (4,637) directly overlap an m<sup>6</sup>A site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). Together, this analysis reveals that SND1 recognises the consensus m<sup>6</sup>A motif in vivo and has a similar binding profile to other established reader proteins.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47261.021</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>SND1 binds the consensus m<sup>6</sup>A motif.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Overlap of m<sup>6</sup>A-modified transcripts in the indicated cell lines.

Here, two TREx BCBL1-Rta cell lines with stable shRNA knockdown of SND1 (SND1 KD1 and SND1 KD2) and a shRNA scramble cell line were generated. Surprisingly, following 24 hr of lytic replication there were no significant differences between the scramble and the knockdown cell lines in the amount of KSHV lytic transcripts produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). In accordance with mRNA levels, RTA and ORF57 proteins were not reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). Similarly, the early lytic protein ORF54 was not decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). These data were also confirmed by RNA-seq performed in scramble and SND1 KD2 cells from two biological replicates. Following 24 hr of lytic reactivation, expression of the KSHV transcriptome in SND1-depleted cells was not significantly altered from scramble cells, with the exception of upregulation of <italic>ORF71</italic> and <italic>ORF72</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). qRT-PCR analysis confirmed a ~ 4 fold-induction of these transcripts in SND1-depleted cells during the lytic cycle (data not shown). These results possibly suggest that SND1 plays a role in maintaining low expression of these latent RNAs during lytic replication. Importantly, in the presence of overexpressed RTA protein, KSHV lytic replication is essentially unchanged in SND1-depleted TREx BCBL1-Rta cells, thus these cells still fulfil all viral functions necessary for triggering the lytic cascade.</p><p>TREx BCBL1-Rta cells are reactivated by expression of Myc-tagged RTA which is integrated in the host genome in a spliced form and its expression is under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. In contrast, the parental BCBL1 cell line lacks Myc-tagged RTA and reactivation is achieved by addition of the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate (NaB), which leads to the expression of unspliced <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA. This native RNA matures to the spliced form giving rise to RTA protein, which then transactivates the <italic>ORF50</italic> promoter in a positive transcriptional feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guito and Lukac, 2012</xref>). However, as SND1 does not take part in the splicing of <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>), it therefore suggests a potential role in the stabilisation of <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA, which could be masked by constitutive overexpression of Myc-tagged RTA in TREx BCBL1-Rta cells. Thus, the same lentiviral shRNAs targeting SND1 were used to knockdown SND1 in BCBL1 cells. Remarkably, both SND1 knockdown cell lines showed a dramatic decrease in viral RNAs, including <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>), and RTA, ORF57 and ORF54 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>). These data were also confirmed by RNA-seq performed in scramble and SND1 KD2 BCBL1 cells from two biological replicates. After 24 hr of lytic reactivation, 48 KSHV RNAs were significantly downregulated in SND1-depleted cells compared with scramble cells (FDR &lt; 5%), including <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7h</xref>). These results indicate that in the absence of SND1 there is a global impairment of lytic KSHV replication downstream of RTA and uncover SND1 as an essential protein for lytic KSHV replication.</p><p>Although SND1 did not affect splicing of the <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA, we assessed whether SND1 regulated splicing events in cellular RNA processing, due to the previously reported role of SND1 in the regulation of splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jariwala et al., 2015</xref>). Thus we hypothesised that SND1 may play a role in splicing through binding methylated intronic regions. Splicing analysis revealed multiple significant differential splicing events between scramble latent cells and scramble lytic TREx BCBL1-Rta cells, however, there were no significant splicing differences between scramble and SND1-depleted cells, when analysing cellular or viral transcripts from either latent or lytic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). The same results were also observed in BCBL1 cells (data not shown).</p><p>As SND1 has previously been described as a transcriptional activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jariwala et al., 2015</xref>) we determined whether it could associate with the <italic>ORF50</italic> promoter by carrying out chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with the ChIP-grade antibody we previously used for RIP-seq experiments. RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) antibody (clone CTD4H8) and non-specific immunoglobulin (IgG) were used respectively as positive and negative control antibodies. Whilst RNAPII was enriched at the <italic>GAPDH</italic> promoter and multiple viral promoters including <italic>ORF50</italic>, there was no significant enrichment for either SND1 or the non-specific IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Moreover, RNA-seq analysis of TREX BCBL1-Rta-SND1 depleted cells showed no significantly downregulated viral gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). Consequently, we conclude that SND1 does not participate in the activation of the <italic>ORF50</italic> promoter.</p><p>The strikingly different knockdown phenotype between TREX BCBL1-Rta and BCBL1 cells directly points to a potential regulatory role of SND1 on the essential lytic <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA, and suggests that SND1 may stabilise the <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA. To test this hypothesis without the possible interference of NaB on <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA decay, the decay of native (unspliced) <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA was monitored in scramble and SND1-depleted TREx BCBL1-Rta cells that had been reactivated into the lytic cycle for 24 hr before addition of actinomycin D. Strikingly, native <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA was significantly more unstable in SND1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>) with ~80% of <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA remaining at 6 hr post-transcription inhibition in scramble cells and ~50% in depleted cells. To further determine whether SND1 may also play a role in regulating the stability of <italic>ORF71</italic> and <italic>ORF72</italic> RNAs during the KSHV lytic cycle, the turnover of these transcripts together with other high confidence SND1 KSHV RNA targets was also investigated. In contrast to <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA, these transcripts decayed in a similar manner in scramble and depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Removal of m<sup>6</sup>A in <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA impairs SND1 binding to <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA</title><p>Due to the broad and overlapping m<sup>6</sup>A-seq peaks across the <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA and the high frequency of DRm<sup>6</sup>ACH motifs throughout <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA, we attempted to deplete global m<sup>6</sup>A levels in <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA by stably depleting METTL3 in BCBL1 cells and assess its effect on lytic replication, however limited depletion was achieved and no significant effect on KSHV lytic replication was observed (data not shown). The same METTL3 knockdowns were repeated in BCBL1 cells but transiently. After five days post-lentiviral transduction, cells were reactivated for 24 hr and viral and protein levels analysed. Here, one METTL3 knockdown cell line (METTL3 KD2) achieved a higher level of depletion of METTL3 protein and viral transcript and protein levels were both significantly reduced compared with the scramble cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4a and b</xref>). In contrast, a second cell line (METTL3 KD1) showed no depletion of METTL3 protein and no significant differences in viral replication between these cells and the scramble were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4a and b</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we generated stable BCBL1 cell lines harbouring shRNA knockdown of either FTO, YTHDF1 or YTHFD3. In contrast, despite consistently achieving ~75% depletion of YTHDF2 at the mRNA level, following 12 days post-transduction these depleted cells would dramatically lose their knockdown at the mRNA level, suggesting that YTHDF2 may be essential for BCBL1 cells, therefore we performed transient transductions for YTHDF2. Following reactivation, FTO-depleted cells displayed increased viral mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4c and d</xref>), including increased levels of <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA and RTA protein. Depletion of YTHDF1 or YTHDF3 readers resulted in decreased <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA together with other lytic RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5a-b and e-f</xref>), particularly, in YTHDF1-depleted cells, which also showed a marked reduction of viral protein levels. Depletion of YTHDF2 did not affect viral RNA levels, with the exception of PAN RNA, however a clear decrease in RTA protein and a slight reduction in ORF57 protein levels were evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5c and d</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that m<sup>6</sup>A modification has a pro-viral role in the KSHV lytic replication cycle, in agreement with previous studies performed in the same cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ye et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Next, we set out to determine whether the m<sup>6</sup>A status of <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA regulates SND1 binding. Firstly, single-point mutations were performed in the GGACU motifs present in ORF50 baits to elucidate whether the chosen motifs were m<sup>6</sup>A-modified in the context of the full length <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA. Wild type (WT) FLAG-ORF50 -containing both ORF50 exons and the intron- and mutant plasmids were transfected into HEK-293 cells and m<sup>6</sup>A enrichment quantified by m<sup>6</sup>A-IP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). In transfected cells, <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA was particularly m<sup>6</sup>A-modified in ORF50-1 and ORF50-4 regions, suggesting cell type differences between TREx BCBL1-Rta and HEK-293 cells. Point mutation in the motif contained in ORF50-1 bait, but not in ORF50-4 bait, significantly reduced m<sup>6</sup>A enrichment, confirming that this site is m<sup>6</sup>A-modified. Next, the binding of SND1 to WT FLAG-ORF50 and to a FLAG-ORF50 plasmid with a point mutation in the motif contained in ORF50-1 bait was evaluated by RIP. No significant decrease in SND1 binding was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>), indicating that other SND1 binding sites are necessary for <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA-SND1 interaction.</p><p>We finally assessed the binding of SND1 to <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA in the absence or presence of m<sup>6</sup>A modification. For this purpose, we made use of the drug 3-deazaadenosine (DAA), which inhibits m<sup>6</sup>A deposition by reducing levels of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). HEK-293 cells were transfected with WT FLAG-ORF50 plasmid and 4 hr after transfection, control 0.25% (v/v) DMSO or 200 µM DAA was incubated for an additional 24 hr. Note that DAA did not result in cytotoxicity at this concentration after 26 hr post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). DAA effectively reduced m<sup>6</sup>A enrichment in all m<sup>6</sup>A-modified regions of <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>) and led to a significant decrease of SND1 binding across <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>). Interestingly, DAA completely abolished SND1 binding to the native <italic>ORF50</italic> transcript, indicating that m<sup>6</sup>A inhibition on <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA regulates SND1 binding to it, however the exact points of interaction between SND1 and <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA remain to be elucidated at single nucleotide resolution.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47261.029</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>SND1 stabilises native <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA and inhibition of m<sup>6</sup>A deposition on this RNA abolishes SND1 binding.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) RNA-seq analysis reveals significant alterations in splicing events between scramble latent and scramble lytic TREx BCBL1-Rta cells (left panel), whilst no significant changes in splicing are observed between scramble and SND1-depleted cells during latency (middle panel) or 24 hr lytic replication (right panel).

It functions as a transcriptional co-activator of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear protein 2, STAT5, STAT6 and c-Myb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jariwala et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, SND1 has multiple roles modulating gene expression at a post-transcriptional level. SND1 is a component of the RISC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jariwala et al., 2015</xref>) and acts in the processing of specific miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heinrich et al., 2013</xref>). m<sup>6</sup>A promotes processing of primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alarcón et al., 2015</xref>), thus SND1 may also process m<sup>6</sup>A-modified pri-miRNAs, which could explain the SND1-binding in methylated introns we observed. In agreement with our finding that SND1 stabilises <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA, SND1 binds to the 3′UTR of angiotensin II type one receptor (AT1R) and stabilises this mRNA leading to elevated protein AT1R levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jariwala et al., 2015</xref>). Intriguingly, <italic>AT1R</italic> mRNA contains a single m<sup>6</sup>A site which is located in the 3’UTR region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, SND1 also participates in RNA editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jariwala et al., 2015</xref>). Under stress conditions, in mammalian cells SND1 co-localises with G3BP protein in stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gao et al., 2010</xref>) and stabilises <italic>AT1R</italic> and <italic>IGFBP2</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, in plants SND1 is essential for the stabilisation of a subset of stress-responsive mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frei dit Frey et al., 2010</xref>). It will be of interest to address to what extent SND1 regulates the stability of its target RNAs. Curiously, the readers YTHDF1-3, FXR1, FXR2 and FMR1 have also been identified in mammalian stress granule cores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jain et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We performed RNA-lifetime profiling in scramble and SND1-depleted cells using latent and lytic TREx BCBL1-Rta and BCBL1 cells; however the NGS data were extremely noisy and this precluded us from identifying a consistent phenotype between replicates.</p><p>To date, very little research has been performed on deciphering the role of SND1 during viral infections. SND1 binds the 3’UTRs of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Galán et al., 2009</xref>) and dengue virus (DENV). Moreover, SND1 silencing reduced the levels of viral RNA and protein in DENV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lei et al., 2011</xref>). Intriguingly, the 3’UTR of DENV contains m<sup>6</sup>A sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gokhale et al., 2016</xref>), thus it would be of considerable interest to examine whether this modification enables SND1 recruitment to the 3’UTR to stabilise the RNA DENV genome.</p><p>Differences in the binding affinities for the different RNA baits used in this study between YTH readers and the Royal members can be inferred from previous structural studies. Interestingly, in SND1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2009a</xref>), plant agenet members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams-Cioaba et al., 2010</xref>), PSIP1, HDGFRP2 and MSH6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Qin and Min, 2014</xref>), the aromatic pocket is hydrophobic and surrounded by both positive and negative residues thus, it seems plausible that binding only ensues when matching electrostatic interactions are achieved between the RNA sequence and the Royal domain, consequently, methylated proteins would adopt a different orientation to interact with negatively charged residues while m<sup>6</sup>A-decorated RNAs would interact with positively charged residues. This model would explain the RNA structure dependency observed for these proteins in binding m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNA. In contrast, the aromatic cage of YTH readers resides in a hydrophobic pocket surrounded by a positively charged surface, rendering the YTH domain favourable to bind any methylated RNA sequence. Of note, plant agenet members contain two plant agenet domains (Agenet1 and Agenet2) in tandem, each harbouring an aromatic cage. Whilst the aromatic cage of Agenet2 is proposed to be the site that binds methylated lysines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams-Cioaba et al., 2010</xref>), Agenet1 exhibits a basic surface patch with potential for RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Myrick et al., 2015</xref>). The plant Agenet domain of FMRP (1-134) has already been shown to harbour RNA-binding ability to RNA homopolymers, with progressively increased affinity when testing longer FMRP constructs (1–180 and 1–214), suggesting a cooperative effect between the positively charged residues distributed along the N-terminus region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Milosevich and Hof, 2016</xref>). In a similar manner, the other domains present in SND1 cannot be disregarded in considering how SND1 may bind its target RNAs. Our RIP-seq data and eCLIP analysis reveals for the first time that SND1 is indeed a <italic>bona fide</italic> RNA-binding protein acting at the transcriptome level. Structural and biochemical analysis had already proposed that the N-terminal region of SND1, specifically SN3 and SN4, possess RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2008</xref>), thus, in addition to the Tudor domain interacting with methylated RNA, the N-terminal region of SND1 most likely also contributes to RNA binding and may play a significant role in determining which RNAs are targeted by SND1, including those that are methylated.</p><p>Elucidating Royal domains structures in complex with m<sup>6</sup>A-ORF50-1 hairpin will help reveal the reason for the distinct selectivity between YTH readers and Royal members and to elucidate to which extent the aromatic cage of Royal domains plays a role in recognising m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNA. Moreover, these studies could lead to the development of small molecule inhibitors that specifically block the aromatic cage of SND1 to hinder recognition of methylated <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA for the treatment of KSHV-related malignancies. Pioneering inhibitors for some methyl-lysine readers of the Tudor subfamily and other Royal members are currently being investigated with success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Milosevich and Hof, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our findings underscore the potential of other members from the ‘Royal family’ as putative new regulators of m<sup>6</sup>A. Of the Tudor subfamily, the Tudor domain-containing (TDRD) proteins, AKAP1, SMN and SPF30 display methyl-arginine-binding and are involved in RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2011</xref>), therefore these are ideal candidates to reveal more m<sup>6</sup>A readers. In contrast to the ubiquitously expressed SND1, most of the mammalian TDRD proteins display male germline-enriched expression and are essential for spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). It will be of interest to examine whether m<sup>6</sup>A-decorated RNAs are regulated post-transcriptionally via TDRD proteins during germ cell differentiation. Notably, spermatid perinuclear RNA-binding protein (STRBP) was within the top ten enriched proteins in m<sup>6</sup>A-ORF50-1 bait. The remainder members of the Tudor protein subfamily bind methyl-lysine residues and contain other domains related to chromatin biology, consequently, these proteins are unlikely to participate in RNA metabolism. The discovery of PSIP1, HDGFRP2 and MSH6 as putative m<sup>6</sup>A readers is surprising as the PWWP domain is a well-established nucleosome-binding domain and these proteins participate in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Qin and Min, 2014</xref>). However, FMRP takes part in the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alpatov et al., 2014</xref>) but FMRP is also a RNA-binding protein that regulates the translation of its m<sup>6</sup>A-containing target RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Edupuganti et al., 2017</xref>). An m<sup>6</sup>A RNA-mediated response to UV-induced DNA damage was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Xiang et al., 2017</xref>), as such, these PWWP proteins could represent a link between methylation of RNA and DNA damage. In support of the putative m<sup>6</sup>A reading ability of these proteins is the fact that mass spectrometry identification of PSIP1 short (p52) isoform, which includes the PWWP domain, revealed that ~95% of interactors function in pre-mRNA processing. Moreover this isoform co-localised with SRSF2 in nuclear speckles and modulated alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pradeepa et al., 2012</xref>), thus the implication of these proteins in m<sup>6</sup>A RNA metabolism requires further investigation.</p><p>Finally, it is worth pointing out the possibility that SND1 may be able to read other RNA methyl-modifications in addition to m<sup>6</sup>A. Further studies characterising these methyl-modifications and their corresponding readers will help resolve this matter.</p><p>In conclusion, our data supports the hypothesis that highly specialised domains such as the Royal domains, which harbour a structurally-related aromatic cage to the one found in the YTH domain, may be required for the selective and direct recognition of m<sup>6</sup>A, while proteins without aromatic cages may not be able to directly read m<sup>6</sup>A.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

For each m<sup>6</sup>A-immunoprecipitation (m<sup>6</sup>A-IP), 25 μl of slurry of Magna ChIP Protein A+G magnetic beads (Merck Millipore) were washed twice with IP/wash buffer [20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% NP-40 (v/v)]. Beads were re-suspended in 100 μl of IP/wash buffer and coated with 5 μg of rabbit anti-m<sup>6</sup>A antibody (ABE572) (Merck Millipore) for 45 min at room temperature with rotation.

IPs were incubated overnight at 4°C with rotation. Beads were then washed six times with IP/wash buffer. IP samples were further incubated with 126 μl of IP/wash buffer, 15 μl of 10% SDS (v/v) and 9 μl of PCR-grade proteinase K (20 mg/mL) (Thermo Scientific) for 30 min at 55°C. After incubation, the supernatant containing the RNA was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube and 250 μl of IP/wash buffer was added to each sample.

Several m<sup>6</sup>A-IPs (four to six) were pooled to provide enough sample for cDNA library construction and next-generation sequencing (NGS) as described below. 1.5 to 3 ng of RNA from input and m<sup>6</sup>A-IPs were used for NGS library production using NEBNext Ultra kit (NEB) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries for the first biological replicate were sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina) with 101 bp paired-end lane. Libraries from the second biological replicate were sequenced on a HiSeq 3000 platform (Illumina) with 151 bp paired-end lane.

For each RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), 7 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were used. Cells were fixed with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde (Calbiochem) for 10 min at room temperature. Crosslinking was stopped by addition of glycine at a final concentration of 125 mM for 5 min. Cells were washed with PBS (Lonza) and re-suspended in 200 μl of ice-cold shearing buffer [50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl and 0.1% (v/v) NP-40] supplemented with Complete, EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche) and 1 µl of murine RNase inhibitor (NEB). Samples were then sonicated with an EpiShear multi-sample sonicator (Active Motif) with pulses of 30 s of sonication followed by a 30 s rest for a total of 12 min at 30% amplitude. Polystyrene sonication tubes (Active Motif) were used to achieve efficient sonication.

For each RIP, 25 μl of slurry of Magna ChIP Protein A+G magnetic beads (Merck Millipore) were coated with the antibody of interest as previously described for m<sup>6</sup>A-seq. RIPs were prepared by mixing the antibody-coated beads with 800 μl of IP/wash buffer [20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% NP-40 (v/v)], 35 μl of 0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0, 4 μl of murine RNase inhibitor (NEB) and 200 μl of lysate containing fragmented RNA. RIPs were incubated for 3 hr at 4°C with rotation. Beads were then washed six times as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gilbert and Sj, 2006</xref>).

DNA-<italic>free</italic> DNA Removal Kit (Ambion) was used to remove any contaminating DNA from RIP RNA samples. Total RNA from input samples was isolated with the use of TRIzol (Thermo Scientific) according to the supplier’s protocol and treated with DNase I using the DNA-<italic>free</italic> DNA Removal Kit (Ambion). Input RNA was saved without applying sonication because we observed lower quality sequencing libraries when using sonicated input RNA than when using input RNA that was heat-fragmented. Saved input RNA was therefore heat-fragmented for 8 min at 94°C before proceeding with library construction. Due to the large size of RNA fragments observed after SND1 immunoprecipitation, isolated RNA from RIP samples was further fragmented for 7 min at 94°C before first strand synthesis. 100 to 200 ng of each input and RIP sample was used for NGS libraries which were made using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA library production kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All samples were multiplexed and sequenced on two 151 bp paired-end lanes on a HiSeq 3000 instrument (Illumina). For RIP-seq, two independent biological replicates were prepared for each time point analysed (0 hr, 8 hr and 20 hr post-reactivation). Additionally, for one biological replicate, two technical replicates were deep-sequenced for all RIP samples. A third biological replicate RIP sample at 0 hr was also deep-sequenced.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>RNA-seq</title><p>NGS libraries were generated from two independent biological replicates using scramble and SND1 KD2 TREx BCBL1-Rta cells both during latency and after 24 hr of lytic reactivation.

Input samples were processed together with immunoprecipitated samples from the proteinase K treatment onwards. Purified input and immunoprecipitated RNA was resuspended in 10 μl of RNase-free water and reverse transcribed as described in the RT-qPCR analysis section. qPCR normalisation was performed similarly to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled to detection by qPCR analysis using ΔΔCt method (relative quantification). An example for m<sup>6</sup>A-IPs follows. Each m<sup>6</sup>A-IP sample Ct value for each primer used was normalised to the corresponding input Ct value: ΔCt normalised m<sup>6</sup>A-IP = Ct m<sup>6</sup>A-IP – [Ct Input –log<sub>2</sub> (Input dilution factor)]. Input dilution factor = (fraction of the input reaction saved)<sup>−1</sup>. As 1% input was saved, the dilution factor is 100 or 6.644 cycles (i.e. log<sub>2</sub> of 100). Percentage of recovery from the initial reaction (% input) was then calculated for each primer as 100 x Amplification efficiency (AE) <sup>(-ΔCt normalised m6A-IP)</sup>. m<sup>6</sup>A enrichment was finally calculated as the fold change between the % input for a region containing m<sup>6</sup>A peaks over the % input for a negative control region.

Since the library preparation protocol preserved the strand of the original RNA molecule, only ‘correctly’ stranded read pairs were counted for each transcript. DESeq2 R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Love et al., 2014</xref>) was used to normalise the data and identify transcripts that showed a significant increase in the coverage of the normalised RIP samples when compared to the input controls. In order to increase the resolution of the SND1-bound regions, custom Java code was used that identified transcriptome regions that were enriched in the RIP data when compared to the control data. Initially, the application segmented regions into intronic or exonic sequences: a region was classified as exonic if the sequence was present in at least one mature transcript. The per-base raw read coverage was determined for both intronic and exonic sequences and normalised using the size factors determined from the earlier normalisation step (DESeq2) to account for library compositions and sizes. Using a sliding window approach, first each mature transcript or intron was divided into contiguous segments that loosely showed putative enrichment in the RIP data (&gt;1 fold enrichment) compared to the input data and those that putatively were depleted in (or equal to) RIP (≤1 fold enrichment). Low coverage segments (&lt;20 reads in RIP) were filtered out as quality control. All data from the different samples in the analysis were then merged to generate a single dataset that contained read depth data for all consensus segments identified this way, both intronic and exonic. Each segmented region was subsequently treated as an individual ‘gene’ for re-analysis using DESeq2, specifically testing for RIP signal enrichment over input (alternative hypothesis: normalised segment read coverage in RIP greater than in input) in order to identify regions with a significant increase in RIP over input signal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Differential expression and functional enrichment analyses</title><p>Differential expression analyses were performed in R using DESeq2 package.

Tandem mass spectra were acquired using an LTQ- Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer controlled by Xcalibur 2.1 software (Thermo Scientific) and operated in data-dependent acquisition mode. The Orbitrap was set to analyse the survey scans at 60,000 resolution (at m/z 400) in the mass range m/z 300 to 2000 and the top twenty multiply charged ions in each duty cycle selected for MS/MS in the LTQ linear ion trap. Charge state filtering, where unassigned precursor ions were not selected for fragmentation, and dynamic exclusion (repeat count, 1; repeat duration, 30 s; exclusion list size, 500) were used. Fragmentation conditions in the LTQ were as follows: normalised collision energy, 40%; activation q, 0.25; activation time 10 ms; and minimum ion selection intensity, 500 counts.

Your article has been reviewed by Päivi Ojala as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.

Seven members of the &quot;Royal family&quot; of TUDOR domain containing proteins were identified as new putative m6A readers, including SND1. SND1 associates with the KSHV ORF50 transcript in a manner dependent on the m6A modification and SND1 depletion leads to a global impairment of KSHV gene expression. Identification of members of the 'Royal family' as new m6A-readers greatly increases their epigenetic functions beyond protein methylation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewers 1 and 3 suggested the authors to map the SND1 binding sites by CLIP-seq rather than RNA-IP.</p><p>2) Reviewer 2 suggested the authors to perform a ChIP-seq analysis of the viral genome to exclude the possibility that SND1 binds and activates the ORF50 promoter.</p><p>The full reviews are listed below, in the hope that the comments can help to improve the quality of the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>More evidence is needed to improve the quality of the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) I have several concerns for the gel shift assay and the data interpretation:</p><p>(A) The components of the 1x binding buffer of the gel shift assay (subsection “Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs)”) looked different from that is stated in the manual of the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit from ThermoScientific in terms of salt concentrations. This could affect the secondary structure of the probes used in the assay. Also, it is not clear whether the authors used non-specific Poly (dI•dC) as instructed by the kit. Considering the function of SND1 as a transcriptional factor, does the presence of non-specific DNA affect the RNA binding of SND1 in gel shift assay?</p><p>(B) In Figure 2, Figure 3—figure supplement 6 and Figure 3—figure supplement 7, the biotin signals from the probe were always overwhelming compared to the shifted probes, making it hard to calculate the ratio of free probe to bound probe and estimate the binding affinity (Kd). Why is this the case? Any way to optimize the imaging condition? Maybe fluorescent dye labelled probe could help.</p><p>2) The authors saved the input sample of the RIP-seq saved before crosslinking the cells. Normally people process the input and RIP samples in parallel until before IP. The authors claimed the reason is that the sonicated input gave lower quality sequencing libraries maybe due to overshearing (subsection “RIP-seq”). I still believe that the input sample should be saved after sonication, otherwise it is hard to estimate artifacts introduced by the sonication step. And &quot;overshearing&quot; itself may already be a concern for high-quality RIP assays. Instead of &quot;formaldehyde-crosslinked RIP-seq&quot;, the authors may consider performing &quot;CLIP-seq&quot; as a validation which also gives high-resolution binding sites of protein on RNA based on crosslinking-induced mutations in cDNA libraries.</p><p>3) &quot;SND1 binds symmetrically demethylated arginines (sDMA)&quot; via its Tudor domain, as described on subsection “RNA affinity identifies putative m6A readers which belong to the Tudor domain ‘Royal family’”. I am wondering if the authors have tested affinity of the protein towards N6, N6-dimethyladenosine. It may worth checking if known ribosomal RNA N6, N6-dimethyladenosine sites were enriched in their SND1 RIP-seq data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>The authors cannot demonstrate the final consequences of SND1 binding to the ORF50 RNA. Here the manuscript reveals conceptual deficits. Also, the work of another laboratory with similar findings is not discussed sufficiently.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Abstract: The authors provide interesting structural data, but the claim that all identified proteins recognize m6A in a structural-dependent manner is an overstatement (see also below). To verify this more mutants are necessary. The critical claim of the manuscript is that SND1 stabilizes the ORF50 RNA. However, the single data figure given in Figure 6 does not clarify this point (see below). The following sentence mentions a global impairment of KSHV gene expression, which is no surprise if the master switch of reactivation is blocked. This claim has to be toned down to &quot;inhibits KSHV early gene expression&quot;.</p><p>2) Subsection “Royal domains bind m6A-modified RNA hairpins in a RNA secondary structure-dependent manner”, Figure 2, Figure 3—figure supplement 4 and Figure 3—figure supplement 4: First, these data nicely show that SND1 binds the ORF50-1 sequence. However, the interpretation of the cORF50-1 shortened stem and the sORF50-1 mutant is not straightforward. To state &quot;in structural-dependent manner&quot; the authors need to increase the stability of the stem by erasing the bulges only. Also, the cORF50-1 sequence may be just too short to form the correct stem. The authors should extend the stem of cORF50-1 mutant by unrelated bases to provide more insights on the structural features needed by SND1.</p><p>3) Subsection “SND1 is a m6A reader in KSHV-infected cells”, Figure 3: The authors should compare their obtained m6A frequency in the high-confidence SND1 targets to ratios available for other m6A reader proteins such as the YTHDF family members. Is there a similar correlation or do these readers contains even more m6A modified target sequences in their high-confidence interval? These data should be available from public resources.</p><p>4) Subsection “SND1 is a m6A reader in KSHV-infected cells”: how SND1 recognizes its RNA target sequences is pure speculation and should be removed from the result section. In addition, the motif provided in Figure 4—figure supplement 3D looks like 3' splice site and may argue for SND1's role in splicing.</p><p>5) Subsection “SND1 stabilises <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA and is essential for KSHV replication” and Figure 5: The authors provide an interesting discrepancy between the TREx BCBL-1 cells and naturally infected BCBL-1 cells. Their argument reads as follows: in naturally, unmodified BCBL-1 cells, the ORF50 RNA is decreased during SND1 knockdown. This effect is masked in the TREx BCBL-1 cells since they contain a chromosomally integrated doxycycline-inducible ORF50 gene. However, the authors fail short in the interpretation of their results. An alternative explanation would be that the DNA-binding and promoter-modifying capacity of SND1 comes into play. The major difference between the two ORF50 versions is the nature of the promoter driving their expression. The dox version harbors 6 to 7 tetracyclin-operators and a minimal CMV promoter. In the virus the ORF50 promoter is the sensor of the cellular status and is highly regulated to induced lytic reactivation only under certain conditions. To clarify the role of SND1 the authors need to perform a ChIP-seq analysis of the viral genome to exclude the possibility that SND1 binds and activates the ORF50 promoter. Thus, a lack of SND1 may cause an inhibition of ORF50 transcription and may explain all downstream effects. If this is the case the derived claims such as &quot;SND1 stabilizes the ORF50 transcript&quot; may not be corrected. In addition, the impairment of viral lytic gene expression could also be explained in a similar manner. The authors themselves mention this possibility indirectly in the Discussion section stating that SND1 functions as co-activator of the EBV protein EBNA-2.</p><p>6) Figure 5D and G: The authors should include lytic markers such as K8.1 and ORF59.</p><p>7) Figure 6B: Here, the authors need to provide the raw data. In addition, to an accelerated decay the SND1 knockdown may already reduce the amount ORF50 transcript. See also argument provided above. Also, the authors should distinguish between the decay of spliced vs. unspliced ORF50 RNA if possible.</p><p>8) Supplementary Figure S11: I agree with the authors that a METTL3 knockdown might be difficult in BCBL-1 cells. Even though the increase in ORF50 RNA is not significant I am wondering if the authors here observe the same effect as the Glaunsinger laboratory (Hesser et al., 2018). These authors were able to reduce the amount of METTL3 in BCBL-1 cells sufficiently and observed an increase in ORF50 protein, but not RNA. These findings are not discussed in the current manuscript! If METTL3 knockdown is too difficult, the authors should use the DAA treatment presented in Figure 6C,D to assess ORF50 RNA levels in the absence of m6A modifications.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The most exciting part of this manuscript is the identification of novel m6A reader proteins, which were originally thought to bind methylated proteins only. While I am convinced of the specificity of SND1 towards m6A, my main criticism is directed towards the authors' choice of experimental approach to map SND1 binding sites on RNA. As detailed below, RNA-IP in this particular instance appears inappropriate to locate SND1 binding sites.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While different experimental approaches can be applied to identify RNA-protein interactions, such as RNA-IP or CLIP-based techniques, in the case of SND1 the use of RNA-IP appears inappropriate. As mentioned in subsection “SND1 is a m6A reader in KSHV-infected cells” and shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1, the vast majority of RNA fragments was sheared to &lt;200 nt (not &quot;bp&quot;), yet the enriched fragments were of considerably greater size, which the authors suggest may be due to the anti-SND1 antibody having higher affinity for longer fragments. This statement is not very plausible. On the other hand, given the affinity of SND1 for methylated arginines, it is possible that chromatin-associated nascent RNAs were indirectly precipitated through SND1 binding to other chromatin-associated factors (e.g. histones or spliceosomal proteins). These complexed RNAs would greatly resist shearing by sonication as compared to free RNAs. According to Materials and methods section, no DNase treatment was included prior to IP and hence indirect RNA IP cannot be excluded. While bona fide SND1 targets may certainly be present within the deep sequenced RNAs, this cohort may be largely polluted by non-specific transcripts.</p><p>Rather than RNA-IP, eCLIP or iCLIP would have the advantage that the crosslinked sites can be identified unambiguously, which would be particularly useful in overlapping m6A sites on RNA with SND1 binding sites.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47261.057</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewers 1 and 3 suggested the authors to map the SND1 binding sites by CLIP-seq rather than RNA-IP.</p></disp-quote><p>To confirm our SND1 RIP analysis, we have analysed SND1 binding profiles using existing eCLIP datasets from the ENCODE consortium. This has allowed us to compare the binding profiles for established m<sup>6</sup>A reader proteins and SND1. Although these datasets are from different cell lines, Figure 6A, shows that there is an extensive overlap of transcripts which contain m<sup>6</sup>A sites, showing that this analysis approach is valid. Therefore, comparing the overlap between transcripts which are both m<sup>6</sup>A-modified and bound by SND1 from RIP-seq and eCLIP datasets, we observe 1,166 transcripts bound by SND1 of which 88% contained m<sup>6</sup>A sites (Figure 6B). In addition, using this eCLIP dataset it allowed the direct comparison of SND1 binding to other established m<sup>6</sup>A readers using existing eCLIP datasets for these respective proteins (Figure 6C-E). Furthermore, we found comparable binding site overlap for SND1 and established readers with m<sup>6</sup>A peaks, whereas a control protein (TIAL1) showed reduced overlap between m<sup>6</sup>A peaks and its binding sites. Importantly, we also utilised HOMER to identify motifs bound by SND1 using the ENCODE eCLIP datasets, which excitingly revealed that SND1 has a high scoring binding motif which matches the core of the m<sup>6</sup>A consensus motif (Figure 6f). We thank the reviewers for this suggestion, which has led to this important new discovery. These results of all the new eCLIP analysis has been incorporated as Figure 6, subsection “SND1 is an m6A reader in KSHV-infected cells” and in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reviewer 2 suggested the authors to perform a ChIP-seq analysis of the viral genome to exclude the possibility that SND1 binds and activates the ORF50 promoter.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this a critical check, however we consider a genomic-wide analysis unnecessary to address this concern, as our RNA-seq analysis on the SND1 knockdown cell line showed that KSHV replication is basically unchanged in TREx BCBL1-Rta cells in the absence of SND1, with no significant downregulation of any of the KSHV ORFs (Figure 7E) suggesting that SND1 may not be necessary to promote transcription. Thus, the key question is addressing whether SND1 may bind the <italic>ORF50</italic> promoter in BCBL1 cells. Therefore, to conclusively address this query we have performed ChIP coupled to qPCR detection with the control antibody RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), the rabbit SND1 antibody and a non-specific isotype antibody. We tested the occupancy of these proteins at the viral <italic>ORF50</italic> promoter and several other viral promoters in BCBL1 cells. Primers for the cellular <italic>GAPDH</italic> promoter were used as positive control for RNAPII antibody. Whilst RNAPII was present in 4 viral out of 5 viral promoters tested at different levels of occupancy, there was no specific enrichment for either SND1 or the negative control antibody when using 2 µg of antibody per ChIP (the same concentration used for RIP experiments). Note that the rabbit SND1 antibody is a ChIP-grade antibody as demonstrated by our formaldehyde-fixed RIP-seq experiments, in which cells are subjected to identical formaldehyde fixation conditions, and was able to efficiently immunoprecipitate SND1 protein. The same lot number (00020506) of SND1 antibody (Proteintech, 10760-1-AP) was used for western blot, RIP and ChIP experiments. Consequently, we conclude that SND1 does not bind the <italic>ORF50</italic> promoter. These data has been incorporated as Figure 7 —figure supplement 3 and discussed in the manuscript (subsection “SND1 stabilises <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA and is essential for KSHV replication” and Materials and methods section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The full reviews are listed below, in the hope that the comments can help to improve the quality of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More evidence is needed to improve the quality of the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) I have several concerns for the gel shift assay and the data interpretation:</p><p>(A) The components of the 1x binding buffer of the gel shift assay (subsection “Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs)”) looked different from that is stated in the manual of the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit from ThermoScientific in terms of salt concentrations.

In the presence of this non-specific DNA the interaction between SND1 and the m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNA bait (ORF50-1) was abolished, as shown by the disappearance of the shifted bait and full detection of the free ORF50-1 bait. This result is not surprising as SND1 is a known transcription factor and this result suggests that excess DNA may sequester SND1 away from RNA. This experiment has been incorporated to the manuscript as figure 3 —figure supplement 7C and discussed in the manuscript (subsection “Royal domains display selectivity for specific m6A-modified RNA hairpins”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(B) In Figure 2, Figure 3—figure supplement 6 and Figure 3—figure supplement 7, the biotin signals from the probe were always overwhelming compared to the shifted probes, making it hard to calculate the ratio of free probe to bound probe and estimate the binding affinity (Kd).

Because the RNA EMSA kit makes use of a highly sensitive chemiluminescent substrate, the signal from the free probes were always really strong in comparison with the shift. We tried FAM fluorescent dye labelled baits, but due to the lack of amplification of signal, such as it is the case in the biotin/streptavidin/ECL system, this system did not have enough sensitivity to detect a clear shift.</p><p>This sentence has been included in the main manuscript (subsection “Royal domains display selectivity for specific m6A-modified RNA hairpins”): “Note that the membranes had to be overexposed to obtain a good shift signal due to the small amount of shifted RNA in comparison with the free bait, consistent with the modest enrichment of SND1 in m<sup>6</sup>A-ORF50-1 bait (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).

Normally people process the input and RIP samples in parallel until before IP. The authors claimed the reason is that the sonicated input gave lower quality sequencing libraries maybe due to overshearing (subsection “RIP-seq”). I still believe that the input sample should be saved after sonication, otherwise it is hard to estimate artifacts introduced by the sonication step. And &quot;overshearing&quot; itself may already be a concern for high-quality RIP assays. Instead of &quot;formaldehyde-crosslinked RIP-seq&quot;, the authors may consider performing &quot;CLIP-seq&quot; as a validation which also gives high-resolution binding sites of protein on RNA based on crosslinking-induced mutations in cDNA libraries.</p></disp-quote><p>See response in essential revisions 1 above. We have removed the sentence “The lower quality libraries may have been a result of overshearing” as we have no evidence to demonstrate this. We do have evidence that after sonication the input RNA was of equivalent size (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and 1B) to the one generated for m<sup>6</sup>A-seq libraries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) &quot;SND1 binds symmetrically demethylated arginines (sDMA)&quot; via its Tudor domain, as described on subsection “RNA affinity identifies putative m6A readers which belong to the Tudor domain ‘Royal family’”. I am wondering if the authors have tested affinity of the protein towards N6, N6-dimethyladenosine. It may worth checking if known ribosomal RNA N6, N6-dimethyladenosine sites were enriched in their SND1 RIP-seq data.</p></disp-quote><p>Our SND1 RIP-seq samples were ribosomal depleted before cDNA library construction, thus we are unable to check this. However, it is possible that SND1 may have the ability to bind other RNA-modifications, this has been included in the discussion as follows: “Finally, it is worth pointing out that it exists the possibility that SND1 may be able to read other RNA methyl-modifications in addition to m<sup>6</sup>A. Further studies characterising these methyl-modifications and their corresponding readers will help explore this possibility.” Discussion section.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors cannot demonstrate the final consequences of SND1 binding to the ORF50 RNA. Here the manuscript reveals conceptual deficits. Also, the work of another laboratory with similar findings is not discussed sufficiently.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Abstract: The authors provide interesting structural data, but the claim that all identified proteins recognize m6A in a structural-dependent manner is an overstatement (see also below). To verify this more mutants are necessary. The critical claim of the manuscript is that SND1 stabilizes the ORF50 RNA. However, the single data figure given in Figure 6 does not clarify this point (see below). The following sentence mentions a global impairment of KSHV gene expression, which is no surprise if the master switch of reactivation is blocked. This claim has to be toned down to &quot;inhibits KSHV early gene expression&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The Abstract has been modified to address these comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Royal domains bind m6A-modified RNA hairpins in a RNA secondary structure-dependent manner”, Figure 2, Figure 3—figure supplement 4 and Figure 3—figure supplement 4: First, these data nicely show that SND1 binds the ORF50-1 sequence. However, the interpretation of the cORF50-1 shortened stem and the sORF50-1 mutant is not straightforward. To state &quot;in structural-dependent manner&quot; the authors need to increase the stability of the stem by erasing the bulges only. Also, the cORF50-1 sequence may be just too short to form the correct stem. The authors should extend the stem of cORF50-1 mutant by unrelated bases to provide more insights on the structural features needed by SND1.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that to state “in a structural-dependent manner” may be an overstatement. However, the proposed experiments do not clarify either how the structure differs between the different RNA baits in the presence or absence of m<sup>6</sup>A. The use of SHAPE or NMR would help addressing this question, but this is beyond the scope of this manuscript. Consequently, we have changed the abstract and the sections in which we stated the royal domains bound “in structural-dependent manner”. For example in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “SND1 is a m6A reader in KSHV-infected cells”, Figure 3: The authors should compare their obtained m6A frequency in the high-confidence SND1 targets to ratios available for other m6A reader proteins such as the YTHDF family members. Is there a similar correlation or do these readers contains even more m6A modified target sequences in their high-confidence interval? These data should be available from public resources.</p></disp-quote><p>This information has been added. As stated in the original manuscript, we observe a 50% of SND1 high confidence targets are m<sup>6</sup>A methylated. We have now compared PAR-CLIP and m<sup>6</sup>A-seq datasets and shown that ~65% of total target RNAs bound by YTH readers are m<sup>6</sup>A methylated. See figure 4 —figure supplement 2 and subsection “SND1 is an m6A reader in KSHV-infected cells”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “SND1 is a m6A reader in KSHV-infected cells”: how SND1 recognizes its RNA target sequences is pure speculation and should be removed from the result section. In addition, the motif provided in Figure 4—figure supplement 3D looks like 3' splice site and may argue for SND1's role in splicing.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “SND1 stabilises ORF50 RNA and is essential for KSHV replication” and Figure 5: The authors provide an interesting discrepancy between the TREx BCBL-1 cells and naturally infected BCBL-1 cells. Their argument reads as follows: in naturally, unmodified BCBL-1 cells, the ORF50 RNA is decreased during SND1 knockdown. This effect is masked in the TREx BCBL-1 cells since they contain a chromosomally integrated doxycycline-inducible ORF50 gene. However, the authors fail short in the interpretation of their results. An alternative explanation would be that the DNA-binding and promoter-modifying capacity of SND1 comes into play. The major difference between the two ORF50 versions is the nature of the promoter driving their expression. The dox version harbors 6 to 7 tetracyclin-operators and a minimal CMV promoter. In the virus the ORF50 promoter is the sensor of the cellular status and is highly regulated to induced lytic reactivation only under certain conditions. To clarify the role of SND1 the authors need to perform a ChIP-seq analysis of the viral genome to exclude the possibility that SND1 binds and activates the ORF50 promoter. Thus, a lack of SND1 may cause an inhibition of ORF50 transcription and may explain all downstream effects. If this is the case the derived claims such as &quot;SND1 stabilizes the ORF50 transcript&quot; may not be corrected. In addition, the impairment of viral lytic gene expression could also be explained in a similar manner. The authors themselves mention this possibility indirectly in the Discussion section stating that SND1 functions as co-activator of the EBV protein EBNA-2.</p></disp-quote><p>See response in essential revision 2 section above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 5D and G: The authors should include lytic markers such as K8.1 and ORF59.</p></disp-quote><p>Markers for the lytic ORF54 protein have now been included, see updated Figure 7D and 7G.

Even though the increase in ORF50 RNA is not significant I am wondering if the authors here observe the same effect as the Glaunsinger laboratory (Hesser et al., 2018). These authors were able to reduce the amount of METTL3 in BCBL-1 cells sufficiently and observed an increase in ORF50 protein, but not RNA. These findings are not discussed in the current manuscript! If METTL3 knockdown is too difficult, the authors should use the DAA treatment presented in Figure 6C,D to assess ORF50 RNA levels in the absence of m6A modifications.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now repeated the METTL3 knockdowns in BCBL1 transiently, instead of generating stable depleted cell lines. After five days post-lentiviral transduction cells were reactivated for 24hours and viral and protein levels analysed. In addition, we have also created stable cell lines with two different shRNAs targeting FTO, YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3. Our results are all supportive of a positive role of m<sup>6</sup>A-methylation in the KSHV lytic replication, with reduced ORF50 mRNA levels following METTL3, YTHDF1 or YTHDF3, and increased ORF50 mRNA levels following FTO depletion. Our results are consistent with previous studies performed in the same BCBL1 cell line (Ye et al., 2017).</p><p>All these data have been incorporated as Figure 7—figure supplement 4 and Figure 7—figure supplement 5 and in the main manuscript, subsection “Removal of m6A in <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA impairs SND1 binding to <italic>ORF50</italic> RNA”.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The most exciting part of this manuscript is the identification of novel m6A reader proteins, which were originally thought to bind methylated proteins only.

As mentioned in subsection “SND1 is a m6A reader in KSHV-infected cells” and shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1, the vast majority of RNA fragments was sheared to &lt;200 nt (not &quot;bp&quot;), yet the enriched fragments were of considerably greater size, which the authors suggest may be due to the anti-SND1 antibody having higher affinity for longer fragments. This statement is not very plausible. On the other hand, given the affinity of SND1 for methylated arginines, it is possible that chromatin-associated nascent RNAs were indirectly precipitated through SND1 binding to other chromatin-associated factors (e.g. histones or spliceosomal proteins). These complexed RNAs would greatly resist shearing by sonication as compared to free RNAs. According to Materials and methods, no DNase treatment was included prior to IP and hence indirect RNA IP cannot be excluded. While bona fide SND1 targets may certainly be present within the deep sequenced RNAs, this cohort may be largely polluted by non-specific transcripts.</p><p>Rather than RNA-IP, eCLIP or iCLIP would have the advantage that the crosslinked sites can be identified unambiguously, which would be particularly useful in overlapping m6A sites on RNA with SND1 binding sites.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above we have now included new analysis of SND1 eCLIP data which shows binding profiles similar to other m<sup>6</sup>A reader proteins and shows that the m<sup>6</sup>A consensus sequence is a high scoring binding motif for SND1.</p><p>We have additionally removed the sentence “suggesting the antibody had higher affinity for longer fragments”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
