area reflects functions of that region and is often estimated by the magnitude of the autocorrelation of intrinsic neural signals in the area. Here, we investigated such intrinsic neural timescales in high-functioning adults with autism and examined whether local brain dynamics reflected their atypical behaviours. By analysing resting-state fMRI data, we identified shorter neural timescales in the sensory/visual cortices and a longer timescale in the right caudate in autism. The shorter intrinsic timescales in the sensory/visual areas were correlated with the severity of autism, whereas the longer timescale in the caudate was associated with cognitive rigidity. These observations were confirmed from neurodevelopmental perspectives and replicated in two independent cross-sectional datasets. Moreover, the intrinsic timescale was correlated with local grey matter volume. This study shows that functional and structural atypicality in local brain areas is linked to higher-order cognitive symptoms in autism.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42256.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Autism is a brain disorder that affects how people interact with others. It occupies a spectrum, with severe autism at one end and high-functioning autism at the other. People with severe autism usually have intellectual impairments and little spoken language. Those with high-functioning autism have average or above average IQ, but struggle with more subtle aspects of communication, such as body language. As well as social difficulties, many individuals with autism show repetitive behaviors and have narrow interests.</p><p>The brains of people with autism process information differently to those of people without autism. The brain as a whole shows less coordinated activity in autism, for example. But whether individual brain regions themselves also work differently in autism is unclear. Watanabe et al. set out to answer this question by using a brain scanner to compare the resting brain activity of high-functioning people with autism to that of people without autism.</p><p>In both groups, networks of brain regions increased and decreased their activity in predictable patterns. But in individuals with autism, sensory areas of the brain showed more random activity than in individuals without autism. The most random activity occurred in those with the most severe autism. This suggests that the brains of people with autism cannot hold onto and process sensory input for as long as those of neurotypical people. By contrast, a brain region called the caudate showed the opposite pattern, being more predictable in individuals with autism. The most predictable caudate activity occurred in those individuals with the most inflexible, repetitive behaviors. These differences in this neural randomness appear to result from changes in the structure of the individual brain regions.</p><p>The findings of Watanabe et al. suggest that changes in the structure and activity of small brain regions give rise to complex symptoms in autism. If these differences also exist in young children, they could help doctors diagnose autism earlier. Future studies should investigate whether the differences in brain activity cause the symptoms of autism. If so, it may be possible to treat the symptoms by changing brain activity, for example, by applying magnetic stimulation to the scalp.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>intrinsic timescale</kwd><kwd>temporal receptive window</kwd><kwd>autism spectrum disorder</kwd><kwd>resting-state fMRI</kwd><kwd>grey matter volume</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>656161</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watanabe</surname><given-names>Takamitsu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18H06094</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watanabe</surname><given-names>Takamitsu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004687</institution-id><institution>Yamaha</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Yamaha Sports Challenge Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watanabe</surname><given-names>Takamitsu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fukuhara Fund for Applied Psychoeducation Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watanabe</surname><given-names>Takamitsu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008667</institution-id><institution>SENSHIN Medical Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watanabe</surname><given-names>Takamitsu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100227</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rees</surname><given-names>Geraint</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJCR1304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Masuda</surname><given-names>Naoki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Atypical intrinsic neural timescales in the sensory cortex and caudate were associated with local grey matter volume, and linked with the severity of autism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>How long neural information is likely to be stored in a neural area is a fundamental functional property of the local brain region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>;

Computational studies propose that such neural timescales should show a rostrocaudal gradient in the brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kiebel et al., 2008</xref>) and that densely interconnected central regions, such as prefrontal and parietal areas, should have slower timescales compared to peripheral sensory areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaudhuri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gollo et al., 2015</xref>). These proposals are supported by empirical observations.

A recent brain stimulation study directly demonstrates that such a hierarchy of the intrinsic timescale is closely related to functional interactions between lower and higher brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cocchi et al., 2016</xref>). The heterogeneity of the neural timescale is considered to be a basis of the functional hierarchy in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hasson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Himberger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaudhuri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gollo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cocchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kukushkin and Carew, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friston and Kiebel, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Given such fundamental roles of local neural dynamics in highly-organised information processing in the brain, we hypothesised that atypical intrinsic neural timescales should be observed in autism. In fact, the core symptoms of this prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder â challenges in socio-communicational skills and repetitive, restricted behaviours (RRB) â are often linked to atypical information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">HappÃ© and Frith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Palmer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Booth and HappÃ©, 2018</xref>): weak coherence theory suggests that autism spectral disorder (ASD) is associated with impairments of the global integration of diverse information and over-enhancement of individual inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">HappÃ© and Frith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Booth and HappÃ©, 2018</xref>); a recent Bayesian view also attributes autism to overweighing of local sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Palmer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lawson et al., 2017</xref>). These theories suggest that measures of local neural dynamics â such as intrinsic neural timescales â should be linked to the symptomatology of individuals with ASD.</p><p>Despite such theoretical implications, no study has investigated intrinsic timescales of neural signals in autism. Here, we aimed at exploring this local neural property in the brains of high-functioning individuals with ASD and examining its associations with the core symptoms of this condition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>First, we introduced a measurement of the intrinsic neural timescales for resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) signals, and validated it using simultaneous EEG-fMRI data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deligianni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deligianni et al., 2014</xref>). We then applied the index to a rsfMRI dataset recorded from high-functioning adults with ASD and its demographically-matched controls, and searched for brain regions whose atypical neural timescales were associated with the ASD symptoms. Next, using a longitudinal rsfMRI dataset collected from adolescent children, we examined developmental trajectories of the local neural dynamics of these regions. Finally, we explored neuroanatomical bases of the intrinsic neural timescales. The reproducibility of our findings was tested using two independent MRI datasets.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Timescales of resting-state fMRI signals</title><p>Based on previous macaque studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaudhuri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cavanagh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murray et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernacchia et al., 2011</xref>), we calculated an intrinsic neural timescale by assessing the magnitude of autocorrelation of the resting-state brain activity. First, we estimated the sum of autocorrelation function (ACF) values in the initial positive period of the ACF (i.e., the sum of the area of the green bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The upper limit of this period was set at the discrete time lag value just before the one where the ACF became non-positive for the first time. To adjust for differences in the temporal resolution of the neural data, we then multiplied the obtained sum of ACF values by the repetition time (TR) of the fMRI recording.

Given that spontaneous neural activity largely depends on such recurrent neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ikegaya et al., 2004</xref>), resting-state neural activities of brain regions with large GMVs would show more repetition patterns and larger autocorrelations. Although future studies have to directly examine this hypothesis, this logic accounts for the significant correlations between the local neural dynamics and local neuroanatomical structures.</p><p>Some human neuroimaging researches examined autistic local neural dynamics in the sensory-related areas and reported observations that are consistent with the current findings. For example, fMRI studies that investigated intra-participant variability of brain signals across time found atypically large signal variability in the prefrontal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dinstein et al., 2011</xref>), somato-sensory area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haigh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dinstein et al., 2012</xref>), auditory area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haigh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dinstein et al., 2012</xref>), and primary visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dinstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dinstein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Milne, 2011</xref>) in individuals with ASD. In particular, one study found that the severity of ASD was significantly correlated with such atypical signal variability in the sensory/visual areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dinstein et al., 2012</xref>). If we can assume that such large variability of local brain signals indicates more random brain activity and consequently yields weak autocorrelations, these previous reports can be interpreted as being consistent with the current findings.</p><p>In contrast, local neural dynamics in the caudate in autism were poorly understood. In fact, the neuroanatomical association between the subcortical region and the RRB symptoms was reported in previous structural MRI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Langen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Langen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Langen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hollander et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schuetze et al., 2016</xref>), which is consistent with the current observation about the caudate. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior research has been conducted on intrinsic neural timescales or signal variability of the caudate in autism.</p><p>A recent review has suggested that the intrinsic timescale and TRW is not an artefact of neuroimaging signals but closely associated with an ability of local brain areas to pool, normalise, and complete information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Himberger et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, for sensory information processing, a longer neural timescale is considered to make brain responses more robust against fluctuations in sensory inputs and enable steady and consistent perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Himberger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Honey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murray et al., 2014</xref>). Given this, we speculate that the atypically short intrinsic timescale in the primary sensory/visual cortices observed in the ASD group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4a</xref>) might potentially be one of neural bases of perceptual hyper-sensitivity often seen in autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</xref>).</p><p>This rsfMRI study did not adopt a formulation that has been used to measure neural timescales in previous human fMRI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hasson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hasson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lerner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stephens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yeshurun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gauthier et al., 2012</xref>), because this definition of neural timescale â so-called temporal receptive window (TRW) â was designed for task-related brain activity data and cannot be directly applied to resting-state fMRI data. Instead, based on previous non-human electrophysiology studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cavanagh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murray et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernacchia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Runyan et al., 2017</xref>), we defined the intrinsic neural timescale as the magnitude of autocorrelation of brain activity. In addition, to reduce adverse effects of the low sampling rates of fMRI recording, we did not conduct curve fitting to the autocorrelation coefficients as electrophysiological work did (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cavanagh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murray et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Runyan et al., 2017</xref>); we simply calculated the area under the autocorrelation function (ACF) to estimate the autocorrelation strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><p>We validated this definition of the intrinsic neural timescales using the simultaneously recorded EEG-fMRI data. Although the fMRI-based neural timescale was different from the EEG-based one by two orders of magnitude, the two measures were significantly correlated with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, such a difference would be reasonable because an EEG signal is likely to peakÂ ~100 ms after a stimulus onset and an fMRI signal â a product of neurovascular coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hillman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martindale et al., 2003</xref>) â tends to take 5Â ~Â 10 s to peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">YeÅilyurt et al., 2008</xref>). In fact, when we convolved the EEG signals with the hemodynamic response function (HRF) to take into account such neurovascular coupling, the resultant intrinsic timescales based on HRF-convolved EEG signals were similar in the magnitude to those based on the fMRI data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p>These EEG-fMRI comparisons indicate that the fMRI-based neural timescales represent an aspect of local neuronal activity. However, it is beyond the scope of this study to conclude that such an fMRI-based index reflects the same neuronal phenomena as those seen in previous electrophysiology work that calculated neural timescales from spike activity data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cavanagh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murray et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ogawa and Komatsu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Runyan et al., 2017</xref>). To clarify this issue, future studies have to directly compare the fMRI-based neural timescales with those based on neuronal spike activities that are collected simultaneously with fMRI data.</p><p>Our exploratory study identified significant associations between local brain dynamics and behavioural tendencies in autism; however, biological mechanisms underlying this brain-behaviour link remain unknown. Previous work proposed that such an atypical neural timescale may represent atypical functional hierarchy in information processing in brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Himberger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaudhuri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gjorgjieva et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is necessary to directly examine this hypothesis by analysing task-related whole-brain activity in ASD populations. Future work also needs to investigate mechanisms linking these local neural dynamics to atypical large-scale brain dynamics seen in autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Watanabe and Rees, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Another limitation of this study is the relative homogeneity of the participants with ASD that we have studied. To improve detectability, we limited the ASD group to high-functioning right-handed adult males. Although we confirmed the main findings in an adolescent dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), future studies have to examine the current observations in different subsets of ASD cohorts.</p><p>This resting-state fMRI study investigated how long local brain areas can store information in individuals with autism and identified a shorter intrinsic timescale in the bilateral primary sensory/visual cortices and a longer intrinsic timescale in the right caudate. This atypicality in local neural dynamics was associated with the severity of autism and also correlated with local grey matter volumes. Although these findings should be examined in larger and more diverse cohorts of individuals with ASD, our work highlights the importance of investigating neural dynamics in neuro-psychiatric disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Validation of the formulation of intrinsic neural timescale</title><p>We examined the validity of the current formulation of the intrinsic neural timescales by comparing simultaneously recorded resting-state EEG and fMRI data that were shared in the Open Science Framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deligianni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deligianni et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Data for the validation test</title><p>Simultaneous EEG-fMRI data were collected from 17 healthy adults (6 females, 32.84Â Â±Â 8.1 years old) at UCL under the ethical approval from the UCL Research Ethics Committee and informed consent obtained from all the participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deligianni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deligianni et al., 2014</xref>).

After conducting band-pass filtering (1â80 Hz), an optimal basis set (OBS) algorithm based on principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Niazy et al., 2005</xref>) was used to reduce the gradient artefacts induced by fMRI scanning. Cardio-ballistic artefacts (CBAs) were reduced as follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jamison et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2012</xref>): the alignment of the occipital CBAs was optimized with individual participantâs heartbeat; then, EEG components that were strongly correlated with the occipital CBAs were identified and excluded by conducting independent component analysis (ICA) and calculating mutual information. The remaining EEG artefacts induced by eye blinks, eye movements, and muscle activity were removed by ICA. Next, we excluded epochs whose mean global field power was larger than five standard deviations above the mean across the entire recording. Finally, to identify the source location of these preprocessed EEG signals, we conducted source reconstructions of the remaining ICA-components using DIPFIT2 function implemented in EEGLAB, and obtained MNI coordinates for each of the independent components. To reduce ambiguity in the following fMRI analysis, we excluded independent components whose whole-brain activity patterns did not show clear laterality and thus whose sources were calculated to be in both brain hemispheres.</p><p>We confirmed that the remaining independent components of EEG data were effectively free from fMRI-oriented gradient noise. In fact, the power spectrums of the EEG data showed that the preprocessing procedures significantly reduced fMRI-induced noise in the EEG signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1a and b</xref>).

No major statistical or design issues were identified. While the reproducibility data sets were laudable, in general all data sets are small to modest in size.</p><p>Some great clarity of analysis should be provided and closer linkages to computational work on time scale hierarchies in the brain should be provided.</p><p>None of the reviewers ask for substantial new work that could not be undertaken within a reasonable period of time.

They find significant differences in brain regions that are associated with the severity of symptoms and their gray-matter volume. This is an outstanding contribution to the understanding of structure, dynamics, and function in the human brain. The results are compelling and the analysis is thorough. I naturally recommend that the paper is published. To improve the presentation and the reproducibility of the results the authors should consider some minor suggestions:</p><p>1) The study finds a variety of regions that have atypical intrinsic timescales and the timescales of some of these regions have significant association with ADOS and with RRB. However, the authors do not discuss whether those regions have been reported before in other ASD studies. This should be discussed, and, if they have not been reported before, the authors might want to highlight the sensitivity of their new proposal.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>2) The authors mention &quot;functional hierarchies&quot; in the Introduction. Although this is a nice motivation, the concept of &quot;hierarchy of timescales&quot; should also be introduced. The hierarchy of timescales proposes a strong link between the well-established hierarchy in brain structure with a hierarchy in brain function with peripheral regions (at the bottom of the hierarchy) exhibiting fast timescales and core regions (at the top of the hierarchy) exhibiting slow timescales. This concept is proposed by Kiebel et al., 2008, and thoroughly explored by Gollo et al., 2015. Moreover, a distinct functional role of regions at the bottom and top of the hierarchy was demonstrated by Cocchi et al., 2016, using brain stimulation.</p><p>3) The authors mention &quot;core symptoms&quot; in the Introduction without providing additional details. A brief introduction and motivation of the different (social, communication, RRB) measures is missing in the manuscript, and would improve the presentation. Moreover, it is not clear how ADOS (total) was computed.</p><p>Results/Materials and methods</p><p>4) It is unclear why the results start with a negative sentence explaining what was not done. Instead of this approach, it would be better to provide a brief summary of what the results will cover (the cohorts, EEG, fMRI, structural imaging, symptom measures).</p><p>5) &quot;The largest time lag in calculating the initial positive period was set to the value at which the ACF hit zero for the first time as the time lag was increased&quot;. This sentence is misleading because it suggests that an interpolation might be required to find when ACF hits zero, and it also contradicts the caption &quot; The initial positive period is the area under the ACF before the ACF hits zero for the first time as the time lag increases&quot;.</p><p>6) Figure 1: Please indicate what was the parcellation used here, and how the time series were averaged within regions. A parcellation with 360 regions was used in other results. However, it is not clear if this was also the case for this comparison between EEG and fMRI.</p><p>7) Figure 1C and Figure 1âfigure supplement 2. These results show the correlation between the intrinsic timescales obtained from fMRI and from EEG at specific frequency bands. Is the correlation also significant if the EEG signal is considered without filtering at specific frequency bands?</p><p>8) Figure 2A: Please clarify the colorbar. How was the intrinsic timescale =1 defined?</p><p>9) As shown in Table 2, the regions have various cluster sizes. How was the intrinsic timescales computed in Figure 3? Was it averaged across voxels within the cluster size, or did it have a fixed volume? Please clarify.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>10) The first sentence proposes an interpretation of the meaning of intrinsic timescales &quot; an index for potentially measuring how long neural information is likely to be stored in each brain region&quot;. This is an interesting idea. Unfortunately, however, this interpretation is weak. It has &quot;potentially&quot; and &quot;likely&quot; that make the sentence very apologetic. Moreover, it refers to storing information, but the data corresponds to a resting-state task. Although it is possible to understand the main point, there is still some room for improvements in this definition.</p><p>11) &quot;â¦could potentially be used as a biomarker for early diagnosis of this prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder.&quot; This is an intriguing point. Have the authors tested whether it is feasible to propose a biomarker based on the intrinsic timescales in this dataset? What is the specificity and the sensitivity of this measure? If this is not feasible, please explain and discuss the reasons.</p><p>12) The gray-matter volume was nicely motivated in the Results section: &quot; We focused on GMV because theoretically, an increase in neuronal density, which is measured by GMV [25], would enhance recurrent neural network activity, and then enlarge the autocorrelation strength in the neural signals&quot;. It seems that the manuscript could be improved by incorporating some discussion on this topic.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This study used an EEG-validated fMRI measure of intrinsic timescales (IT), along with a structural imaging measure of gray-matter density to compare brain regions in subjects with ASD and typical controls. They find that subjects with ASD show lower IT in the bilateral postcentral gyri and right inferior occipital gyrus, and higher IT in the right caudate. These results correlate both with ASD symptoms, and gray matter density. These findings were replicated in two independent data sets. They also looked at the change in time scales over development in adolescents, and found that these findings correlated with symptomatic progression.</p><p>The authors ask well articulated questions and use suitable methodology. While their measure of autocorrelations is innovative, it appears to be well justified by EEG, and by the consistency of their findings. This exploratory case-control study indicates a new direction that can scale to studies in larger and more diverse ASD populations.</p><p>My major comment about the work regards the interchangeability in their discussion between timescales observed via single-neuron recordings and timescales observed in fMRI and Ecog. The autocorrelation decay function in their cited electrophysiology papers (refs 10 and 11) last no longer than 800 ms. In their Figure 1A fMRI autocorrelation function, we see the decay last up to 9 seconds. While it is interesting that both methodologies produce brain-region specific differing of autocorrelation functions, they occur on time durations differing by an order of magnitude. By using references to jointly support the investigation of timescales, the authors imply that they represent the same underlying phenomenon. If they really hypothesize that, much more work needs to be done in the Discussion section (and potentially experimentally), to support the claim. If they are agnostic as to the connection between timescales using these different methodologies, that stance also needs to be made explicit.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42256.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Atypical intrinsic neural timescale in autism.

Therefore, we have now modified the description as follows:</p><p>Discussion section</p><p>âWe investigated the intrinsic neural timescale, whose length is closely related to the functional hierarchy in the brain [Hassan, Chen and Honey, 2015; Murray et al., 2014; Cocchi et al., 2006], in high-functioning individuals with autism.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) &quot;â¦could potentially be used as a biomarker for early diagnosis of this prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder.&quot; This is an intriguing point. Have the authors tested whether it is feasible to propose a biomarker based on the intrinsic timescales in this dataset? What is the specificity and the sensitivity of this measure? If this is not feasible, please explain and discuss the reasons.</p></disp-quote><p>We admit that the original description sounds an overstatement. In fact, we cannot examine the feasibility of the claim in the current datasets that include no data collected from much younger children. Given this, we have now modified the sentence as follows:</p><p>Discussion section</p><p>âThese findings imply that such atypicality in the temporal characteristics of local neural activity may be one of the basic neuro-aetiologies of autism, which needs to be tested using data collected from much younger children with ASD in future studies.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The gray-matter volume was nicely motivated in the Results section: &quot; We focused on GMV because theoretically, an increase in neuronal density, which is measured by GMV [25], would enhance recurrent neural network activity, and then enlarge the autocorrelation strength in the neural signals&quot;. It seems that the manuscript could be improved by incorporating some discussion on this topic.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewerâs suggestion, we have now added the following discussion on this issue into the Discussion section.</p><p>Discussion section</p><p>âThe association between the intrinsic timescales and GMVs is theoretically reasonable. [â¦] Although future studies have to directly examine this hypothesis, this logic accounts for the significant correlations between the local neural dynamics and local neuroanatomical structures.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This study used an EEG-validated fMRI measure of intrinsic timescales (IT), along with a structural imaging measure of gray-matter density to compare brain regions in subjects with ASD and typical controls. They find that subjects with ASD show lower IT in the bilateral postcentral gyri and right inferior occipital gyrus, and higher IT in the right caudate. These results correlate both with ASD symptoms, and gray matter density. These findings were replicated in two independent data sets. They also looked at the change in time scales over development in adolescents, and found that these findings correlated with symptomatic progression.</p><p>The authors ask well articulated questions and use suitable methodology. While their measure of autocorrelations is innovative, it appears to be well justified by EEG, and by the consistency of their findings. This exploratory case-control study indicates a new direction that can scale to studies in larger and more diverse ASD populations.</p><p>My major comment about the work regards the interchangeability in their discussion between timescales observed via single-neuron recordings and timescales observed in fMRI and Ecog. The autocorrelation decay function in their cited electrophysiology papers (refs 10 and 11) last no longer than 800 ms. In their figure 1A fMRI autocorrelation function, we see the decay last up to 9 seconds. While it is interesting that both methodologies produce brain-region specific differing of autocorrelation functions, they occur on time durations differing by an order of magnitude. By using references to jointly support the investigation of timescales, the authors imply that they represent the same underlying phenomenon. If they really hypothesize that, much more work needs to be done in the Discussion section (and potentially experimentally), to support the claim. If they are agnostic as to the connection between timescales using these different methodologies, that stance also needs to be made explicit.</p></disp-quote><p>We have sympathy with the reviewerâs concern. The EEG-based neural timescales were significantly correlated with those based on fMRI data (Figure 1B). In addition, if we convolved hemodynamic response function to the EEG-based data, the neural timescales showed similar values compare to the fMRI-based one (Figure 1C). However, as the reviewer indicated, these observations do not necessarily mean that the same relationship should be found with neural timescales based on spike activity data.</p><p>We have explicitly stated this limitation by adding the following paragraph into the Discussion section.</p><p>Discussion section</p><p>âThese EEG-fMRI comparisons indicate that the fMRI-based neural timescales represent an aspect of local neuronal activity. [â¦]To clarify this issue, future studies have to directly compare the fMRI-based neural timescales with those based on neuronal spike activities that are collected simultaneously with fMRI data.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
