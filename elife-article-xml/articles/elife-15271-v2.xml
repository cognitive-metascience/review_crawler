The spontaneously active GABAergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a major output of the basal ganglia, provide tonic inhibition of downstream brain areas. A depolarizing 'leak' current supports this firing pattern, but its molecular basis remains poorly understood. To understand how SNr neurons maintain tonic activity, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome of individual mouse SNr neurons. We discovered that SNr neurons express the sodium leak channel, NALCN, and that SNr neurons lacking NALCN have impaired spontaneous firing. In addition, NALCN is involved in the modulation of excitability by changes in glycolysis and by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Our findings suggest that disruption of NALCN could impair the basal ganglia circuit, which may underlie the severe motor deficits in humans carrying mutations in NALCN.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15271.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15271.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15271.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Some neurons in the brain produce electrical signals (or “fire”) spontaneously, without receiving any other signals from the senses or from other neurons. This spontaneous activity has a number of important roles. For example, in a part of the brain known as the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), spontaneously active neurons frequently produce electrical signals that reduce electrical activity in other brain areas.</p><p>A current of positively charged ions constantly flows into the spontaneously active SNr neurons and enables them to fire constantly. Ions enter neurons through proteins called ion channels that are embedded in the surface of the neuron. Like all proteins, ion channels are made by “transcribing” genes to form molecules of RNA that are then “translated” to produce the basic sequence of the protein.</p><p>Lutas et al. have now used single-cell RNA sequencing to study SNr neurons from mice and investigate which ion channel the positive ion current flows through. The RNA sequences revealed that the neurons have the gene for an ion channel known as NALCN. Recordings of the firing rate of neurons in slices of mouse brain showed that SNr neurons without this channel did not fire as often as SNr neurons with the channel. In addition, neurotransmitters (chemicals that alter the ability of neurons to fire) and changes in cell metabolism had less of an effect on the firing rate of SNr neurons that lacked the NALCN channel than they do on normal neurons.</p><p>These findings may help explain why people with mutations in the NALCN gene have movement disorders, as the substantia nigra pars reticulata plays an important role in orchestrating complex movements. Future work is now needed to understand how a change in NALCN activity affects the other brain areas that SNr neurons connect to.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15271.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15271.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>spontaneous firing</kwd><kwd>basal ganglia</kwd><kwd>leak current</kwd><kwd>metabolism and excitability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS055031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lutas</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name><name><surname>Yellen</surname><given-names>Gary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1 EB016985</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lahmann</surname><given-names>Carolina</given-names></name><name><surname>Yellen</surname><given-names>Gary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 NS077633</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lutas</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Basal ganglia output neurons use the NALCN leak channel to maintain their characteristic tonic firing, and this channel is important for the modulation of firing by metabolic or receptor-mediated signals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Some neurons are capable of continuously firing action potentials in the complete absence of synaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Häusser et al., 2004</xref>). This spontaneous activity is established by the intrinsic membrane properties that set the neuronal membrane potential and support repeated firing of action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bean, 2007</xref>). Electrophysiological studies of spontaneously active neurons have frequently reported the presence of a tonic current that maintains these neurons at a more depolarized membrane potential and likely allows them to continuously fire action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atherton and Bevan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jackson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taddese and Bean, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khaliq and Bean, 2010</xref>). This current, often referred to as a 'leak' or 'background' current, has characteristics of a nonselective cation current – it is sodium-dependent and has a reversal potential close to 0 mV. However, the molecular identity of the channel(s) that carry this leak current in many spontaneously firing neurons remains an open question.</p><p>In the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), GABAergic neurons fire spontaneously at relatively high firing rates, typically 30 spikes per second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanderson et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gulley et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maurice et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deransart et al., 2003</xref>). This spontaneous firing is necessary for the tonic inhibition of downstream targets of the SNr and thus critical for the function of the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chevalier and Deniau, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hikosaka, 2007</xref>). SNr neurons have a leak current (a sodium-dependent tonic current) that maintains their membrane potential sufficiently depolarized to allow for spontaneous triggering of action potentials in the absence of any synaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atherton and Bevan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou and Lee, 2011</xref>). It has been suggested that a member of the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channel family, TRPC3, is the basis for the tonic depolarizing current in SNr neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). However, we previously found that the spontaneous firing of SNr neurons was unaffected by genetic deletion of TRPC3, arguing against this possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lutas et al., 2014</xref>). We also previously reported that the tonic depolarizing current in SNr neurons is decreased in response to metabolic inhibition, resulting in slowed firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lutas et al., 2014</xref>). Here we report our efforts to identify the nonselective cation channel (NSCC) that supports the spontaneous firing of SNr neurons and determine the molecular identity of the glycolysis-sensitive NSCC.</p><p>We used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the gene expression profile of SNr neurons and, specifically, the relative expression levels of NSCCs. We found that the sodium leak channel, NALCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2007</xref>), was the highest expressed NSCC in SNr neurons. Electrophysiological experiments using pharmacological inhibitors supported a critical function of NALCN in maintaining firing, and conditional knockout of NALCN in SNr neurons impaired firing, confirming its importance. In addition, we found that the loss of NALCN significantly impaired modulation of SNr firing by glycolytic inhibition and by muscarinic metabotropic receptor activation, indicating that NALCN was involved in the regulation of SNr neuron excitability. Recent studies have reported that NALCN is expressed by other neurons in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flourakis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldberg et al., 2012</xref>), indicating that our findings in the SNr may be more broadly applicable. Furthermore, our results identify key cellular responses that are impaired in the absence of NALCN, and may have therapeutic value as human mutations in NALCN lead to severe motor and cognitive deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoyagi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Sayed et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Köroğlu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukai et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A NSCC is responsible for the spontaneous firing of SNr neurons</title><p>A tetrodotoxin-insensitive, tonic depolarizing current is necessary for spontaneous firing of SNr neurons, and this current has been attributed to constitutive activity of a NSCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atherton and Bevan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). We previously found that inhibition of glycolysis in SNr neurons leads to a decrease in a tonic, depolarizing current and slows SNr firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lutas et al., 2014</xref>). We thus sought to identify the ion channel that carries this glycolysis-dependent tonic depolarizing current in SNr neurons. We initially used pharmacological tools that nonspecifically block multiple types of NSCCs. Flufenamic acid (FFA; 100 μM), a commonly used NSCC blocker, rapidly decreased SNr firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The effect of FFA on SNr firing was dose dependent, and at higher concentrations, FFA could even silence SNr firing (K<sub>d</sub> = 4.7 × 10<sup>–5</sup>10-5 M; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Similarly, 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane (2-APB; 100 μM), which also blocks multiple NSCCs including many TRP channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lievremont et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>), decreased SNr firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). The effect of 2-APB on SNr firing was also dose dependent and capable of silencing firing at sufficiently high concentrations (K<sub>d</sub> = 2.6 × 10<sup>–5</sup> M; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These results are consistent with earlier studies and support an important role of NSCCs in maintaining the spontaneous firing of SNr neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou and Lee, 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15271.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>NSCCs other than TRPC channels maintain the spontaneous firing of SNr neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>,<bold>D</bold>) Representative time course of SNr neuron firing rate with application of NSCC blocker flufenamic acid (FFA; 100 μM) (<bold>A</bold>) and 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane (2-APB; 100 μM) (<bold>D</bold>).

Zhou and coworkers reported that SNr neurons express TRPC3 but no other TRP channels, and that the constitutive activity of TRPC3 is necessary for the spontaneous firing of SNr neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). Surprisingly, however, we previously found that SNr neurons from mice lacking TRPC3 continue to fire spontaneously at high rates that were not significantly different from wild-type (WT) SNr neurons (data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lutas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Furthermore, the firing rate of SNr neurons lacking all seven TRPC members (TRPC1-7) was not significantly attenuated either, arguing against compensation by other TRPC channels in the TRPC3 knockout animals (data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lutas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Consistent with this, an inhibitor of TRPC channels, SKF-96365 (100 μM), did not decrease the firing rate of SNr neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that TRPC channels are not required to maintain the spontaneous firing of SNr neurons and are unlikely to provide the basis for the tonic depolarizing current.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>RNA sequencing of individual SNr neurons</title><p>To clarify which NSSC are expressed by SNr neurons, we chose an unbiased approach that took advantage of advances in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology to obtain whole transcriptome gene expression data from individual SNr neurons. This method required the isolation of GABAergic neurons that reside within the SNr from other cell types, especially the neighboring dopaminergic neurons. While currently there is no selective marker for SNr neurons, we could effectively isolate SNr neurons by a combination of anatomical localization and fluorescent marking of GABAergic neurons. We made acute coronal brain slices containing the SNr from brains of GAD1-EGFP transgenic mice, in which all GABAergic neurons are fluorescently labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Then, we dissected out the SNr regions from brain slices, dissociated this tissue to isolate individual cells, and manually collected GFP-positive neurons with a micromanipulator while observing the cells in a fluorescent microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We collected 87 GFP-positive SNr neurons, thus isolating GABAergic SNr neurons from neighboring dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and also separating them from dopamine neurons located within the SNr. To improve our ability to detect ion channel genes, which have comparatively low expression levels, we employed the SMART-seq2 method for preparing samples for RNA sequencing, which allows for reads to be made across the full sequence of gene transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Picelli et al., 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15271.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Transcriptome sequencing of individual SNr GABAergic neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (<italic>left</italic>) Drawing depicting a coronal section of the mouse brain containing the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and SNr.

Our results demonstrate that NALCN is necessary for normal spontaneous firing of SNr neurons and for the regulation of SNr excitability. The combined results of these studies are consistent with the idea that NALCN is a critical component of neuronal excitability in many rhythmically active neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ren, 2011</xref>).</p><p>NALCN also appears to mediate several modulatory influences on SNr firing. We find that it is important for regulation of SNr neuronal excitability in response to changes in glycolysis, an effect we had seen previously when investigating metabolic influences on SNr firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lutas et al., 2014</xref>). Together with our finding that the increased firing produced by muscarinic receptor activation is blunted in NALCN KO SNr neurons, these results suggest that tuning the level of NALCN activity may set both the tonic and phasic excitability of SNr neurons.</p><p>Interestingly, NALCN has also been found in insulin-releasing pancreatic beta cells, and muscarinic receptor activation can increase NALCN activity in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Swayne et al., 2009</xref>). Our finding that NALCN activity decreases when we block glycolysis in SNr neuron may also occur in beta cells. In beta cells, a decrease in NALCN activity along with an increase in ATP-sensitive potassium channel activity when glucose levels are low would work together to hyperpolarize beta cells and prevent insulin release. Therefore, the metabolic sensitivity of NALCN may be a broadly used modality to confer metabolic sensitivity to NALCN-expressing cells.</p><p>One question that arises from our results is how the activity of NALCN is decreased by the inhibition of glycolysis. A possible insight comes from the finding that metabotropic receptor signaling can modulate the activity of NALCN in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu et al., 2009</xref>) and pancreatic beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Swayne et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, this metabotropic receptor signaling does not modulate NALCN via canonical G-protein coupled signaling; rather, channel activity is regulated by phosphorylation of the channel by Src kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ren, 2011</xref>). Phosphorylation of NALCN may be the major regulator of NALCN activity, either activating or inhibiting channel activity. During inhibition of glycolysis, the drop in cytosolic [ATP] and increase in [AMP] activates AMP kinase (AMPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kahn et al., 2005</xref>), which may directly phosphorylate NALCN at a site that leads to decreased NALCN activity. An example of this possibility is the ion channel Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR), which is activated by Src kinases phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billet et al., 2015</xref>), but inhibited by AMPK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hallows et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kongsuphol et al., 2009</xref>). Alternatively, there may be crosstalk between AMPK and the ability of Src family kinases to activate NALCN (such crosstalk is seen in regulation of metabolism by the Src family kinase Fyn and AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastie et al., 2007</xref>)). An exciting direction for future studies will be to better understand how intracellular signaling pathways regulate NALCN activity in neurons.</p><p>Our findings may also have clinical relevance, as mutations in NALCN have been implicated in several human disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cochet-Bissuel et al., 2014</xref>). Recent studies have found that mutations in NALCN result in severe motor and cognitive deficits in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoyagi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Sayed et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Köroğlu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukai et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, humans carrying mutations in UNC80, a protein that is important for the function of NALCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ren, 2011</xref>), show severe deficits that mirror those observed in humans with mutations in NALCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shamseldin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stray-Pedersen et al., 2016</xref>). The SNr is a main output of the basal ganglia motor circuit and provides tonic inhibition of target areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hikosaka, 2007</xref>). Our finding that SNr neurons require NALCN for appropriate tonic firing, suggests that NALCN mutations could contribute to basal ganglia related motor disorders. For example, disruption of the normal tonic firing of SNr neurons by injection of GABA receptor agonists, leads to excessive muscle tension and dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burbaud et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, hyperactivity of the SNr is observed in Parkinsonian animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wichmann et al., 1999</xref>) and ablation of the SNr can ameliorate symptoms of Parkinson’s diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wichmann et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, understanding the function of NALCN in modulating the tonic activity of SNr neurons may lead to a more detailed mechanistic understanding of motor dysfunction in humans and potentially provide a new therapeutic target for motor disorders.</p><p>While NALCN is a major contributor to the spontaneous firing rate of SNr neurons, elimination of NALCN resulted in only a halving in the firing rates of SNr neurons. This observation is in contrast to the effects of Gd<sup>3+</sup>, which completely silenced firing of WT SNr neurons; this suggests that other Gd<sup>3+-</sup>sensitive currents, in addition to NALCN, may drive the firing of SNr neurons. We tested the possibility that other NSCCs that we found to be expressed in SNr neurons (TRPM7, TRPM2, and pannexin) may contribute to the firing rate; however, we found that TRPM7 knock-out or pharmacological inhibition of TRPM2 or pannexin were without effect on the firing rate of SNr neurons. Therefore, we were unable to identify NSCCs, other than NALCN, that are critical for spontaneous firing. One interesting possibility to explain the continued firing in the NALCN KO is that the expression of inward-current-carrying leak channels may be balanced homeostatically with outward-current-carrying leak potassium channels. In that case, loss of NALCN would lead to decreased expression of leak potassium channels and therefore offset the decreased inward current, allowing spontaneous firing to persist. While this idea is attractive, we did not find direct evidence of this possibility. In our single-cell gene expression dataset, there was no significant correlation between the expression of NALCN and the two highest expressed leak potassium channels, KCNK1 and KCNK3. Additionally, the results of our steady-state I-V recordings were inconsistent with a decrease in leak potassium current. If outward leak currents were decreasing along with inward leak currents, we would expect to observe a significant increase in the membrane resistance of SNr neurons lacking NALCN, but we did not. It remains possible that changes in the expression of other ion channels may compensate for the loss of NALCN in the knockout, as spontaneous firing is a critical function of the SNr.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The Harvard Medical Area Standing Committee on Animals approved all procedures involving animals.

The tissue was then gently triturated with fire-polished Pasteur pipettes (230 mm; Wheaton, Millville, NJ) of progressively smaller tip diameter (400, 250, 150 µm). Typically less than 10 passages were performed with each Pasteur pipette and these were performed slowly to avoid formation of bubbles. The solution contained the dissociated tissue was then diluted in 20 mL of HEPES-based ACSF with 1% FBS and poured into a sterile 140 mm petri dish (VWR). The petri dish was placed in an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan; Eclipse TE300) to detect GFP positive cells. Individual cells were collected by aspiration into unfilamented borosilicate pipettes (Warner Instruments, G150-4) pulled to have tip diameters around the size of a cell soma (10–30 µm). Pipettes were positioned using a micromanipulator (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA; MPC100) while visually monitoring with 160x magnification. Pipettes were not pre-filled with solution and slight positive pressure was maintained when entering the solution in the petri dish to prevent solution from entering the pipette.

The spontaneous firing or &quot;pacemaking&quot; properties of neurons are of interest, because knowing which ionic currents drive repetitive firing will not only help explain how these neurons code information but might also identify possible therapeutic targets, since disruptions of basal activity are associated with disease states.

The spontaneous firing or &quot;pacemaking&quot; properties of various neurons are of interest, especially those in the basal ganglia (here, the substantia nigra pars reticulata SNr) because disruptions of basal activity are associated with diseases like Parkinson's. Knowing what ionic currents drive repetitive firing will not only help explain how these cells code information but might also identify possible therapeutic targets. Here, the authors rule out some obvious candidates for what makes SNr neurons fire, and then take the more comprehensive approach of doing RNA-seq and finding high expression of the fairly recently discovered NaLCN, the sodium leak conductance channel. The data are convincing and well presented. This manuscript goes beyond previous physiological work from other labs (on other neurons), not only in showing at the RNA level that NACLN is highly expressed in SNr neurons but also in demonstrating the glycolysis sensitivity of channel function, and the susceptibility to modulation by neurotransmitters. It thus sets up NALCN as a fundamental yet tunable regulator of excitability in central neurons.</p><p>Reviewer 2: This paper addresses a very important neurobiology question: why some neurons spontaneously fire? It has been known for decades that, in many spontaneously firing neurons, a tonically active cation conductance &quot;constantly&quot; drives the membrane potential toward threshold to generate spontaneous firing. A commonly held model, although rarely tested, is that some of the non-selective TRP channels code the cation conductance. With several elegant approaches, the authors in this paper overthrow this model and establish a new paradigm. To &quot;unbiasedly&quot; identify the conductance, the authors first painstakingly obtained single cell transcriptomes of 62 identified SNr neurons (known to spontaneously fire). With this data set (which by itself is a useful resource to the community), the authors fished out all the ion channel genes with high expression in the neurons. Guided by the finding that NALCN and its associated subunits UNC79 and UNC80 are the highest expressors, the authors used pharmacological tools and a Nalcn conditional knockout to demonstrate that NALCN indeed is a key to spontaneous firing in the SNr neurons. In addition, they discovered that NALCN is required for the normal regulation of firing rates by glycolysis inhibition and by mAChR activation. Finally, the authors provide data against the TRP-based model: inhibiting or knocking out several TRP channels had no major effect on the spontaneous firing. The paper establishes the long-sought molecular identity of a conductance essential for a highly important behavior of some neurons. It also clears up a common misconception in the field. The experiments are well done and the conclusions are convincing.</p><p>Reviewer 3: This elegant paper is a continuation of ongoing research on the mechanism of spontaneous firing of the GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). First, authors developed a method to identify, isolate, and collect samples from SNr GABAergic neurons. Then, using transcriptome analysis, the determined all expressed nonselective cation channels (NSCCs) channels according to their weight in the whole transcriptome expression. Then, they functionally evaluate channels with the highest expression. One of the strongest points is that authors clearly demonstrate that controversial TRPCs channels, which previously thought to modulate SNr neuronal firing, are not involved in it. The data clearly point out sodium NaLCN leak channel as a primary mediator of the SNr neuronal tonic firing, based on intersectional pharmacology and knock down experiments. Authors evaluated a number of other highly expressed channels, but found none of them to be involved in the neuronal firing modulation. Furthermore they document regulation of NaLCN channels by glycolytic pathways and mGluRs. The paper is well written, reasonably organized and easy to read. It has outstanding scientific value and substantially contributes to the field of neuroscience, specifically to our understanding of mechanisms of spontaneous neuronal activity. The NaLCN – dependent mechanism demonstrated in this work could lead to a development of new drugs targeting NaLCN channel.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15271.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers expressed uniform enthusiasm for the work; these are included as &quot;general comments&quot;.
