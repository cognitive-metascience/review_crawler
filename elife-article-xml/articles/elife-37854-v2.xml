In addition to its well-known proinflammatory role, LPS can directly cause regression of some tumors, although the underlying mechanism has remained unknown. Here we show that secretoglobin(SCGB)3A2, a small protein predominantly secreted in airways, chaperones LPS to the cytosol through the cell surface receptor syndecan-1; this leads to pyroptotic cell death driven by caspase-11. SCGB3A2 and LPS co-treatment significantly induced pyroptosis of macrophage RAW264.7 cells and decreased cancer cell proliferation in vitro, while SCGB3A2 treatment resulted in reduced progression of xenograft tumors in mice. These data suggest a conserved function for SCGB3A2 in the innate immune system and cancer cells. These findings demonstrate a critical role for SCGB3A2 as an LPS delivery vehicle; they reveal one mechanism whereby LPS enters innate immune cells leading to pyroptosis, and they clarify the direct effect of LPS on cancer cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37854.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inflammation serves to kill invading bacteria and viruses. Certain molecules on the surface of the microbes can trigger an inflammatory cascade, and one example of such a molecule is lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cells can react to LPS by triggering a process called pyroptosis that causes the cell to burst and die. The released cell contents attract blood and lymphatic cells that in turn kill the LPS-producing bacteria. This prevents the bacteria from multiplying and spreading.</p><p>LPS was used in the very early days of medicine to treat cancer, although it has fallen out of favor because it causes severe side effects, such as a hyperinflammatory response (sepsis) that can result in death. It was not known exactly how LPS kills cancer cells, which has limited its use. Yokoyama et al. now show that a protein called SCGB3A2, which is produced by the cells that line the lung airways, binds to LPS. Tests on mouse immune cells and lung cancer cells grown in the laboratory showed that the resulting SCGB3A2-LPS complex can then bind to a cell surface protein called syndecan 1. This enables LPS to enter the cell and trigger pyroptosis and cell death.</p><p>To confirm the role of SCGB3A2 in pyroptosis, Yokoyama et al. examined tumor growth in mice that are not able to produce SCGB3A2. These mice developed more tumors than normal mice, but tumor growth was suppressed when mice were injected with SCGB3A2.</p><p>The findings presented by Yokoyama et al. could potentially lead to new types of cancer treatments, particularly for lung cancers. However, it remains to be examined whether molecules that trigger pyroptosis, like LPS, could also be used to treat cancers other than those from the lung. Further work is also needed to understand in more detail how SCGB3A2 and LPS work together to cause cancer cell death.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>secretoglobin3A2</kwd><kwd>LPS</kwd><kwd>syndecan-1</kwd><kwd>pyroptosis</kwd><kwd>non-canonical infammasome pathway</kwd><kwd>cancer cell death</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIA BC 010449</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kimura</surname><given-names>Shioko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel pathway was discovered for cellular uptake of LPS through secretory protein secretoglobin3A2 and a receptor syndecan-1, causing activation of non-canonical inflammasome pathway leading to pyroptosis of cancer cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The airway is continuously exposed to pathogens, including low levels of gram negative bacteria in the air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lundin and Checkoway, 2009</xref>). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a component of the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria and can cause inflammation in the lung. It was previously thought that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is the sole LPS-specific pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) at the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poltorak et al., 1998</xref>). However, recent studies demonstrated the presence of an TLR4-independent PRRs mechanism to sense LPS in the cytosol via an inflammatory caspase, caspase-11, in a non-canonical inflammasome pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hagar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kayagaki et al., 2013</xref>). While it is widely known that tumor metastasis is coupled with inflammation in the tumor microenvironment, in many cases, immune cells in the tumor microenvironment no longer exhibit anti-tumor effects, instead they are co-opted to promote tumor growth and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Whiteside, 2008</xref>). On the contrary, the activity of bacteria or endotoxin for anti-tumor effects has been extensively studied for decades since the first observation by W. B. Coley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lundin and Checkoway, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ribi et al., 1983</xref>). Although ‘Coley’s toxin’ is currently not used for cancer treatment because of its toxicities, accumulating evidence has revealed that his theory was correct and the notion that the enhanced host immune systems by endotoxin could attack some cancer cells has advanced to cancer immunotherapy. However, whether endotoxin has a direct function in attacking cancer cells remains controversial, while the interest in endotoxin as a cancer therapeutic agent waned, despite of many reports for favorable outcomes.</p><p>A cytokine-like small secreted protein, SCGB3A2 (secretoglobin 3A2, also known as UGRP1 and HIN-2), was previously identified that is abundantly and specifically expressed in non-ciliated airway epithelial (club) cells of the trachea, bronchus, and bronchioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Niimi et al., 2001</xref>) and revealing that SCGB3A2 functions to suppress lung inflammation and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai and Kimura, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiba et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kido et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kurotani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yoneda et al., 2016</xref>). Although specific expression of SCGB3A2 in lung epithelial cells and its role in inflammation may imply a possible important function for SCGB3A2 in the clearance of pathogens, its role in host defense, if any, has not been studied. In addition, while fibrosis is closely related to tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coussens and Werb, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Trinchieri, 2012</xref>) and SCGB3A2 functions as an anti-fibrotic agent, the role of SCGB3A2 in lung cancer development is unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SCGB3A2 inhibits LLC cell growth in vitro and in vivo</title><p>To determine whether SCGB3A2 has any influence on cancer cell growth, CCK8 (cell counting kit 8) assay was performed using murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells.

However, we noticed an unexpected phenomenon where some sources of recombinant SCGB3A2 had almost no effect on LLC cell growth inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This phenomenon was found to be associated with the level of endotoxin (LPS) contained in the various preparations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Moreover, we realized that whenever the endotoxin was removed from the preparation, the final SCGB3A2 protein yield was drastically reduced (data not shown). Because SCGB3A2 is abundantly expressed in airway epithelial cells which are exposed to various microorganisms and LPS derived from bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lundin and Checkoway, 2009</xref>), we hypothesized that the fundamental function of SCGB3A2 may be related to its binding to and sequestering of LPS. Further, while inflammation is thought to be coupled with cancer metastasis, paradoxically endotoxins or ensuing enhanced immunity may inhibit some cancer growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lundin and Checkoway, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCarthy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ribi et al., 1983</xref>). Indeed, the growth of LLC cells was strongly inhibited by small amounts of LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To test if SCGB3A2 interacts with LPS, imidazole and zinc salt staining was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rodríguez and Hardy, 2015</xref>). Crude LPS (O111:B4) barely migrated into the gel and remained near the well, due to high-molecular mass aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rodríguez and Hardy, 2015</xref>)). Pre-incubation with SCGB3A2 (human SCGB3A2 (C1); see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; unless otherwise noted, this lot was mainly used in the current studies) produced a broad diffuse band in dose dependent manner, indicating that SCGB3A2 interacted with and dramatically enhanced the electrophoretic mobility of LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 2–5, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Rough A form (Ra-LPS) and other serotypes of LPS produced the same results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To further confirm that SCGB3A2 directly binds to LPS, streptavidin pull-down assays were performed using LPS-Biotin and recombinant SCGB3A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The results clearly showed that SCGB3A2 is an LPS binding protein. The ability of SCGB3A2 to bind and disaggregate LPS micelles was further demonstrated by the dynamic light scattering (DLS) method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–1E</xref>).

This pattern of clathrin localization was similar to those previously reported using T lymphocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Samaniego et al., 2007</xref>). Upon further incubation, LLC cells appeared to have incorporated SCGB3A2 into the cells as visualized using an HaloTag (HT)-SCGB3A2 fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Clathrin expression was localized near the incorporated SCGB3A2 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that the LPS-SCGB3A2 complex enters LLC cells via binding to SDC1 followed by clathrin-dependent endocytosis (see below).

S4-A-2 shows the helix number and their relative order (2-3-1-4) similar to what is observed in 1UTG. S4-A-3 shows the relative disposition of the C-terminus (cyan), N-terminus (red-brown), disulfide bridge (yellow) and the central pocket (purple). The pocket is about half the size of the one observed in 1UTG. Note the very different disposition of the termini and the disulfide bridges in both structures. 1UTG contains two Cys per monomer whereas SCGB3A2 has only one. The disposition of 1UTG disulfide bridges restricts the dimer flexibility controlling the geometry of the pocket mouth. SCGB3A2 shows a much higher flexibility of the corresponding region suggesting a more flexible pocket. (<bold>B</bold>) 1UTG/SCGB3A2 sequence alignment obtained from the structural alignment of the two dimers. SCGB3A2 initial model was obtained by aligning the core regions of helices 1 to 4 against the structure of 1UTG. The helix motifs were obtained by analyzing the consensus predictions from several modeling methods (see Materials and methods, SCGB3A2 Modeling). The initial alignment of the predicted helical motifs was performed ignoring the placement of the charged amino acids and cysteines to lower the model bias. After the initial placement was obtained the connecting sections were built as coil sections, and the entire model relaxed using FRMD (see Materials and methods, SCGB3A2 Modeling). The perceived sequence correspondence between 1UTG and SCGB3A2 is presented. Most noticeable albeit not detected in the sequence alignment is the resulting spatial arrangement of SCGB3A2 Cys at the end of the model refinement, placing the cysteins from the monomers in the dimer in a perfect arrangement to satisfy the constraint imposed by a disulfide bridge. The overall sequence functional similarity between 1UTG and SCGB3A2 can be estimated from this alignment at 46% with a similar number of positively charged residues for both structures (11 aa per monomer if His is included) and 11 negatively charged residues per monomer for SCGB3A2 (12 for 1UTG) which may help explain the high propensity of SCGB3A2 to interacting with negatively charged motifs. (<bold>C</bold>) General view of the SCGB3A2 dimer rotated 180 Deg in 90 Deg increments to emphasize the placement of the disulfide bridge. The view presented in S4-C-1 is similar to the one previously shown in S4-A-2 (<bold>D</bold>) This view presents the dimer model in a surface decomposition with the monomers in yellow and lime color and charged residues in blue (positive) and red (negative). The view presented in S4-D-1 is similar to the one previously shown in S4-C-1 and is presented for reference purposes. The model is rotated 180 Deg to expose to faces A and B (Image S4-D-2 and S4-D-3). The anterior (Face A) is dominated by a cluster of positive residues involving G1 (N-termini), R6, K61 and possibly H69 flanking the mouth of the pocket. The posterior orientation (Face B) is dominated by a cluster formed by residues K46, K47, D50, and E51 flanked by D18, D19, K32, and H40. (<bold>E</bold>) The relative disposition of the positively charged residues in Face A (Image S4-D-2) corresponds well with a motif capable of a strong interaction with both Heparan and/or LPS showing an ideal separation between the charged motifs of 3.3 Å (<bold>D1</bold>) and 12.5 Å (<bold>D2</bold>) (see Materials and methods, SCGB3A2 Modeling) (<bold>F</bold>) A model of a tetramer was explored by rolling a rigid dimer over a second one followed by distance optimization and refinement of the most promising geometries. Putative models for a tetramer were built from the resulting geometries. The most promising arrangements were the result of the mutual avoidance of charges as expected from the highly charged surface of the dimer. The most promising arrangement obtained resulted from the screw rotation of a dimer respect of another with the two interacting by the posterior side of each dimer (Face B, Image S4-D-3). This arrangement resulted in the approximate interleaving on charges as indicated by the arrows in S4-F-1 and observed in the 90 Deg rotated view of Face B (S4-F-2). S4-F-3 presents a semi-translucent overlapping of S-F-2 and S-F-1 (after removal of the annotation) emphasizing the interleaving of the charged residues. The tetramer motif places the two Face A from each dimer far apart minimizing the interaction between the surface positively residues in both dimers. This model suggests the tetrameric form may be capable of simultaneous binding of two negatively charged motifs (i.e. Heparin and LPS).

It’s possible that SCGB3A2 simply enhances TLR4 priming canonical signals via SDC1 binding, transferring LPS to TLR4. To address this possibility, LLC cells stably expressing sh-TLR4 (LLC-sh-TLR4) were established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>), and SCGB3A2 binding and uptake were compared with those of LLC-sh-Control and LLC-sh-SDC1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>).

These data, together with data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>, suggest that SCGB3A2 is important for LPS uptake and that SDC1, not TLR4, is required for SCGB3A2-LPS incorporation.</p><p>To confirm the cytosolic localization of LPS, LLC cells were visualized with Alexa-labeled LPS (LPS<sub>A594</sub>), anti-EEA1 (early endosomes marker) and anti-Lamp1 (lysosomal marker) antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). At an early time point, most of the LPS staining was co-localized with EEA1, which was clearly enhanced when cells were co-incubated with SCGB3A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). At a later time point, however, some of the LPS staining did not overlap with either EEA1 or LAMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). With SDC1 staining depicting the plasma membrane, LPS staining was clearly visible inside the membrane, which differed from the EEA1 distribution pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

Moreover, macrophage are key players both for lung homeostasis and the tumor microenvironment. Hence, the effect of SCGB3A2 on mouse macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells, which express SDC1 on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>), was next examined. Co-incubation of RAW264.7 cells with SCGB3A2 + LPS clearly enhanced expression of caspase-11 and NLRP3, followed by IL-1β up-regulation and maturation, while SCGB3A2 or LPS alone did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Heparin co-incubation abrogated caspase-11/NLRP3/IL-1β expression by SCGB3A2 + LPS. SCGB3A2 enhanced IL-1β secretion from RAW264.7 cells, which was inhibited by the addition of heparin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>). A lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay showed that RAW264.7 cells exhibited greater cytotoxicity by SCGB3A2 + LPS compared to the individual treatments, demonstrating the critical role of SCGB3A2 as an LPS delivery molecule to macrophage cells as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>).</p><p>In LLC cells under SCGB3A2 + LPS, caspase-11 expression was upregulated in a diffused distribution pattern in the entire area and showed specific foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Importantly, the caspase-11 foci overlapped with incorporated LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). The expression of NLRP3 was also clearly up-regulated by LPS +SCGB3A2 and accumulated around the caspase-11 foci. We hypothesized that the incorporated LPS triggers formation of caspase-11 foci in LLC cells. As expected, when LPS was introduced into LLC cells using a DNA transfection reagent, LLC cells showed increased intracellular LPS signals and caspase-11 foci, overlapped with LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>), confirming that the formation of caspase-11 foci is mediated by LPS introduction into the cytosol of LLC cells. We could not detect clear foci of caspase-1 in LLC cells, unlike the case of macrophages as previously reported (data not shown). Caspase-11 foci formation and NLRP3 upregulation driven by LPS + SCGB3A2 were also observed in RAW264.7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4D</xref>).

LLC cells had strong focal staining of SCGB3A2-HT and LPS<sub>A448</sub> at the corresponding locations to each other, while Dynasore potently inhibited the incorporation of SCGB3A2 and LPS into the cytosol of LLC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>) and abrogated the activation of caspase-11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>).

Furthermore, when LLC-sh-casp-11 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5B</xref>) were subjected to the intravenous metastasis model with or without SCGB3A2 administration, they did not show any significantly different numbers of lung tumors after SCGB3A2 administration, in sharp contrast to the results with control LLC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>).

In vivo sensitivity of LLC-sh-SDC1 cells to SCGB3A2-mediated inhibition of metastasis was next analyzed. Tumor numbers in mice that received LLC-sh-SDC1 cells and SCGB3A2 were not significantly different from those that received LLC-sh-SDC1 cells and PBS, while tumor numbers with LLC-sh-Control cells were significantly reduced by SCGB3A2 co-injection, similar to that observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>).

This work takes a significant step forward to elucidate and describe a new pathway impacted by SCGB3A2 functioning as a tumor suppressor protein. Previously we showed that SCGB3A2 functions as an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic agent in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai and Kimura, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiba et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kido et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kurotani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yoneda et al., 2016</xref>). Because SCGB3A2 is mainly secreted by club cells in lung airways, it is reasonable to assume that a primary function of SCGB3A2 is to protect the hosts from pathogens and pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as LPS. The current study demonstrated that SCGB3A2 binds to and facilitates delivery of LPS into the cytosolic compartment through specific binding with SDC1, resulting in cell death via an inflammatory pathway leading to pyroptosis. This is commonly seen in the macrophage cell line RAW264.7, suggesting a possible conserved role for SCGB3A2 in host defense and enhancing the immune response through the non-canonical inflammasome pathway of pyroptosis. Notably, in the case of LLC cells, the uptake of SCGB3A2-sequestered small amount of LPS triggers inflammatory cell death, probably because of the abundant SDC1 expression on their cell surface. It is noteworthy that caspase-11 and human caspase-4/5 are specific to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kayagaki et al., 2015</xref>), while the SCGB superfamily of proteins, including SCGB3A2, have also evolved in mammalian lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jackson et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting the co-emergent evolution as an ‘input-output’ for defense from invading pathogens.</p><p>SDC1 localization to uropods is functionally important as uropods accumulate growth factors and connect them at cell-to-cell contact points or junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Børset et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2003</xref>). Others demonstrated that the SDC1-specific HS sequence is important for targeting SDC1 to uropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Børset et al., 2000</xref>). Our results that heparin treatment dramatically reduces SCGB3A2 and LPS binding and their incorporation into cells, as well as caspase-11 and NLRP3 induction suggest that SCGB3A2 appears to interact with the HS moiety of SDC1, which is concentrated in the membrane uropods.</p><p>Recently, it was reported that bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) deliver LPS into the host cell cytosol via clathrin mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vanaja et al., 2016</xref>). OMV is expected to work as a platform vaccine technology because of the potential to deliver small antigens and to modulate the immune system, however, it is highly toxic due to contamination with a large amount of LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acevedo et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) are reported to have important function for interaction with cytosolic OMV and activation of caspase-11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meunier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Santos et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that SCGB3A2 is incorporated into cytosol via a clathrin-mediated uptake mechanism, and that SCGB3A2 is a potent LPS disaggregation protein. Hence, SCGB3A2 might be an attractive protein which has a key function similar to OMV, but without any significant toxicity because of its natural occurrence and abundance in lung. It is also interesting to speculate that SCGB3A2 could liberate LPS from OMV to gain access to cell cytosols either from early endosome or from extra cellular spaces, collaborating with other host proteins such as GBPs. Whether this is the case requires further studies.</p><p>It was reported that the non-canonical inflammasome pathway governed by caspase-4/caspase-11, intrinsic to intestinal epithelial cells, plays a critical role in antimicrobial defense, causing pyroptotic cell death and shedding of infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knodler et al., 2014</xref>). These events could limit pathogen colonization of the intestinal epithelium. Likewise, it’s conceivable that lung airway epithelial cells have an intrinsic non-canonical inflammasome pathway for antimicrobial defense, through the SCGB3A2 and SDC1 interaction. Moreover, the present results suggest that this non-canonical inflammasome pathway is retained in some cancer cells and this property could be used for cancer treatment. Importantly, it was reported that newborn <italic>Sdc1(-/-)</italic> mouse lungs show marked resistance against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2001</xref>). This study was extended to show the biological function of SDC1 in lung epithelial cells from a simple cell membrane receptor for growth factors and chemokines to that of modulating microbial pathogenesis and host defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2001</xref>). The role of SCGB3A2 as a chaperon to deliver LPS to cell cytosols may initially be established to protect host cells from infection, while this mechanism may have evolved to protect host from cancer development by activation of the non-canonical inflammasome signaling pathway. Anti-tumor effects of endotoxin/LPS has been known for decades while the effects are still controversial; one reason is because the effects vary depending on different cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lundin and Checkoway, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ribi et al., 1983</xref>). Our results could provide one of the reasons for the various sensitivities of different cancer cells to endotoxin.</p><p>Of note is that the levels of SDC1 expression differ depending on cancer types and are strikingly dysregulated in many cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Teng et al., 2012</xref>). Because loss of membranous SDC1 increases the mobility of cancer cells, resulting in enhancement of metastasis, in general, loss or weak expression of SDC1 in tumors is thought to be associated with unfavorable outcomes. In lung cancer patients, high serum levels of shed SDC1 and bFGF were associated with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Joensuu et al., 2002</xref>). Some reports also found cytoplasmic or nuclear localization patterns of SDC/HS in less differentiated malignant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burbach et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miyake et al., 2014</xref>), however the underlying mechanism for this correlation is largely unknown. Cancer cells are notorious for changing/adapting in order to survive, such as acquisition of the resistance to chemotherapeutic reagents. In addition to the loss of contact with extracellular matrix, the various expression patterns (reduced, shed, or subcellular) of SDC1 in many malignant cancer cells might suggest that this could be one of their acquired properties; by losing the expression of SDC1 on their cell surface, they will become refractory to the microorganism/LPS triggering non-canonical inflammasome pathway, thus avoiding their own death. Further studies will be required, particularly regarding which cancer cell types possess the machinery and/or express the necessary genes and protein expression patterns that permit response via the non-canonical inflammasome pathway. Collectively, these findings could be utilized for the recognition of the importance of the inflammasome activation of cancer cells and the innate immune system for cancer targeting and treatment. The currently available cancer immunotherapy is mainly targeted to the host immune cells, whereas our study shows the possibility to directly target the activation of non-canonical inflammasome pathway of cancer cells. Our findings may provide the new clue for the understanding of many cancers that are refractory to cancer immunotherapy mediated by immune cells. Combination of the cancer immunotherapy and the cancer cell self-destructive therapy could greatly advance the treatment of cancer patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>Or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional<break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(M. musculus)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Scgb3a2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (C57BL/6N background)</td><td valign="top">In house</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kido et al., 2014</xref></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(M. musculus)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Scgb3a2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> (C57BL/6N background)</td><td valign="top">In house</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kido et al., 2014</xref></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(M. musculus)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Ccsp-Cre;LSL-K-rasG12D</italic> <break/>(mixed background)</td><td valign="top">Francesco <break/>DeMayo (Baylor College of Medicine, now NIEHS)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moghaddam et al., 2009</xref></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (M. musculus)</td><td valign="top">LLC-Mhi</td><td valign="top">Glenn Merlino (NCI)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Highly metastatic, MAP test <break/>negative</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (M. musculus)</td><td valign="top">B16F10</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">CRL-6475</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (M. musculus)</td><td valign="top">RAW264.7 <break/></td><td valign="top">Raymond Donnelly (FDA)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">MAP test negative, authenticated <break/>by STR</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (human)</td><td valign="top">ARH-77 <break/>ARH-77-mSDC1</td><td valign="top">Ralph Sanderson (The University of Alabama at Birmingham)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">MAP test <break/>negative, authenticated by STR</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">mouse SCGB3A2</td><td valign="top">NCI Protein Expression Core</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kurotani et al., 2008</xref></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">mouse SCGB3A2</td><td valign="top">Hölzel Diagnostics</td><td valign="top">CSB-BP846028MO</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">mouse SCGB3A2</td><td valign="top">CosmoBio USA</td><td valign="top">CSB-EP846028MO</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">human SCGB3A2</td><td valign="top">In house (APCBio Innovations)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2014</xref></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-mouse <break/>SCGB3A2 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">E.

The missing sections connecting the helical motifs were modeled as loops to the sole purpose of connecting the helices in an initial workable model. The model was then refined using Feedback Restrain Molecular Dynamics (FRMD). FRMD is based on a self-consistent procedure to bias molecular dynamics trajectories towards a refined conformation using experimental information from multiple sources including X-ray diffraction or NMR data when available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cachau, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cachau et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">González-Sapienza and Cachau, 2003</xref>). The procedure is conceptually similar to a reversed molecular replacement protocol when using X-ray data, with the additional advantage that only those regions of the molecule in agreement with the crystallographic data are affected by the crystallographic constrain, as weighted by the FRMD protocol thus preserving the structural homology when available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cachau et al., 1994</xref>). FRMD was implemented in QMRx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fadel et al., 2015</xref>) using X-plor-NIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schwieters et al., 2003</xref>) to compute the crystallographic restrains and GROMACS 5.1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>) to drive the molecular dynamics (MD) calculations using the Amber ff99sb-ildn force field for all MD calculations. All calculations were performed using a time step of 2 fs. All bonds were constrained for all MD calculations. The leapfrog algorithm was used for integration using a velocity rescaling thermostat (Noose-Hover) with a 0.1 ps coupling constant. Electrostatic forces were computed using a distance criteria, and a cutoff of 10 Å was used for van der Waals interactions. No periodic boundary conditions were used aside from the periodicity resulting from the X-ray constrains. The system was freely equilibrated at T = 300 K for 5 ns without constrains, the purpose of this short run was to relax the initial model without losing the original shape of the model. The model was then fully relaxed using FRMD with X-ray restrains as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cachau et al., 1994</xref>) and Fcalc values computed for PDB ID: 1UTG in-lieu of experimental values not deposited for this entry in the Protein Data Bank, and limited to a 6 Å resolution cutoff. The nature of the FRMD procedure restricts the value of energy-based monitors. The convergence of the model was monitored using a crystallographic R factor and RMSD (root mean square deviation) against the reference structure for homologous residues (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The trajectory converges to the structure shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> after 350 ns with an R value of 9.3 (6 Å) and RMSD 3.2 Å. The MD trajectory was continued for another 350 ns without noticeable changes in the structure. The dimer structure was used to explore possible tetrameric arrangements by rolling a dimer against another using GROMACS and the AMBER force field to probe the interaction. A favorable arrangement was detected as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F</xref>. The number and placement of Cys in 1UTG and SCGB3A2 are different. Thus, SCGB3A2 was modeled replacing Cys 48 by Ala to avoid the possible bias that could have resulted from imposing a disulfide bond during the MD calculation. Ala 48 was then replaced back to Cys in the final dimer model where the two Cys S atoms appear at less than 2.5A from each other suggesting a proper placement of the Cys 48 in the dimer. FMRD can be used to estimate the data lost during the modeling procedure by reversing the refinement procedure that is 1UTG was modeled from the final model of SCGB3A2 using an identical protocol as previously used to model SCGB3A2 from 1UTG. The structure of 1UTG thus modeled agrees with the experimental one with an RMSD 3.5 Å (backbone atoms).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>DLS</title><p>Dynamic light scattering analysis (DLS) was performed using DynaPro Nanostar (Wyatt).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Secretoglobin 3A2 promotes cellular uptake of LPS through syndecan-1 leading to pyroptotic cell death&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michel Nussenzweig as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Seth L Masters (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Whereas all of the essential revisions must be addressed, we realize that the Essential Revision comment is a considerable request, but we urge you to consider addressing this one as it is an important one.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper describes a novel concept in which the secretoglobin SCGB3A2 binds LPS and the cell surface receptor syndecan-1 (SDC1). This allows LPS entry into cancer cells. This then activates pyroptosis and kills cancer cells via the non-canonical inflammasome, independent of TLR4.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>a) In this paper an unbiased approach was taken, relating to endotoxin contamination of SCGB3A2 protein preparations. This was followed by selected screening for the receptors mediating entry into the cell. This led to identification of SDC1 receptor as the receptor that facilitates LPS entry into cells.</p><p>b) The authors use both biochemical and genetic approaches to conclude that SCGB3A2 binds to LPS, facilitating LPS uptake through the SDC1 receptor, leading to caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis.</p><p>c) The authors data have relevance for our understanding of the mechanism of entry of LPS into cells, and for the normal function of secretoglobin family 3A member 2 (SCGB3A2). These data also show that this pathway may trigger pyroptosis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main claim, that this pathway triggers pyroptosis, remains unproven at the genetic level. Although the authors indicate that LLC cells undergo pyroptosis following treatment with LPS and SCGB3A2 (Figure 5), the induction of cell death is low (Figure 5B and C). In addition, there is no evidence provided that supports the conclusion that death is caspase-11-dependent cell death (Figure 6F); this is a critical issue. Are <italic>Casp11</italic> KO or <italic>Gsdmd</italic> KO LLC gRNA cells indeed resistant to LPS-induced cell death? Genetic deletion or depletion of caspase-4/5 or caspase-11 needs to be performed to confirm that the effect observed is pyroptosis due to LPS triggering the non-canonical inflammasome. The authors should also make an effort to assess whether inhibiting caspase-11 activation prevent pyroptosis and cell death. Finally, the authors should show that inhibition of clathrin mediated endocytosis (by Dynasore) inhibits killing of LLC. These experiments would add much-needed support to the overall premise outlined by the authors. As a side note, more standard assays for pyroptosis (such as LDH release) should be done.</p><p>2) Does LPS given on its own suppress tumor growth in <italic>Scgb3a2(-/-)</italic> mice? How much of the tumor suppressive effect in Figure 1 is due to the LPS in the recombinant protein? For example, if SCGB3A2 suppresses tumors in mice how do SDC1 low tumors behave? Does knocking down or CRISPRing out SDC1 from LLC rescue them from LPS toxicity in vivo? The authors should CRISPR out TLR4 and SDC1 from LLC cells engraft them into their mouse model measure tumor load with and without LPS+SMGB3A2.</p><p>3) The authors concluded that NLRP3 mediates pyroptosis downstream of caspase-11 (Figure 6F). However, this contradicts the field's consensus that NLRP3 is dispensable for pyroptosis in non-canonical inflammasome signaling (Sharma and Kanneganti, 2016). This study does not address this contradiction. The authors need to address this discrepancy or they may wish to simply remove discussion of NLRP3, as it is highly unlikely that NLRP3 is involved in their system.</p><p>4) The binding of LPS-SCGB3A2 was examined by agarose gel separation/reverse staining and DLS assay; the shift of LPS aggregate to lower sizes was shown (Figure 2B, C, and D). Given these findings, the authors concluded that LPS binds to SCGB3A. However, these shifts do not directly support the binding of LPS to SCGB3A2. For example, they may imply that SCGB3A has some LPS dissolution activity. The LPS-SCGB3A2 binding study should be re-examined by standard assays such as Surface Plasmon Resonance analysis and/or biotin-LPS pulldown. As a side note, the presented DLS assay is missing a SCGB3A alone control (Figure 2D).</p><p>5) In the Materials and methods section, the procedure for recombinant SCGB3A protein preparation was not disclosed. This is of particular relevance as the authors suggest the recombinant SCGB3A was a source of contaminant endotoxin. In addition, the genetic background of the <italic>Scgb3a2</italic> KO mice was not listed. Were littermate controls used in in vivo studies? These important issues must be addressed.</p><p>6) Although LLC may not express high levels of IL-1β, they may express IL-18 which would be released if the NLRP3 inflammasome is engaged downstream of caspase-4/5/11. Can the authors confirm that the effect of SCGB3A2 in vivo is related to the pyroptosis of LLC cells, and not their production of IL-1β or IL-18?</p><p>7) Even in an LPS/endotoxin free condition, <italic>Scgb3a2</italic> KO mice exhibited profound LLC cell survival (Figure 1F, G, H, I). This clearly indicates that SCGB3A2 suppresses LLC cell proliferations beyond LPS-binding. This raises the question of whether SCGB3A requires LPS for its function (Figure 6F). If the authors mean to insist that microbiota source-derived LPS contributes to the phenomenon, a germ-free condition would have to be employed as a control. This issue needs to be addressed. In addition, to convince readers of anti-lung cancer function of SCGB3A and caspase-11, a more clinically relevant model such as <italic>LSL-K-rasG12D</italic> mice should be examined. Does deficiency of <italic>Scgb3a2</italic> or <italic>Casp11</italic> genes protect <italic>K-ras</italic> mutant mice? This could be immensely important for the relevance of the proposed mechanism.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37854.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main claim, that this pathway triggers pyroptosis, remains unproven at the genetic level.

These in vivo results are now shown in Figure 4N. SCGB3A2 administration reduced the number of lung tumors when control LLC cells were used while the tumor numbers remained the same with or without SCGB3A2 administration when sh-casp-11-LLC cells were used. (2) We examined the effect of the inhibition of casp-11 activation using chemical compound “Wedelolactone”(Kobori et al., 2004) on LDH activity. LDH activity itself was significantly reduced by inhibition of <italic>Casp11</italic> signaling in LLC cells while no effect of LPS＋SCGB3A2 on LDH activity was observed (Figure 4M). (3) As suggested by the reviewer, we used Dynasore to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and confirmed the importance of clathrin for LPS/SCGB3A2 endocytosis (Figure 4K), Casp-11 activation (Figure 4L), and LDH cytotoxicity activity (Figure 4M).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Does LPS given on its own suppress tumor growth in Scgb3a2(-/-) mice?

The results, now shown in Figure 2F, clearly indicates that SCGB3A2 has much more important function than LPS alone. We have already demonstrated that sh-SDC1-LLC cells have reduced effects as compared with control cells when treated with SCGB3A2+LPS in vitro and with SCGB3A2 in vivo as shown in Figure 6A-D.</p><p>We made several attempts to establish sh-TLR4/SDC1-LLC cells. However, we were not able to obtain cells with both genes knocked down at the same time, at least in our system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors concluded that NLRP3 mediates pyroptosis downstream of caspase-11 (Figure 6F).

We decided to remove the discussion on NLRP3, and changed our model for the SGB3A2-LPS-SDC1 pathway as shown in Figure 6G in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The binding of LPS-SCGB3A2 was examined by agarose gel separation/reverse staining and DLS assay; the shift of LPS aggregate to lower sizes was shown (Figure 2B, C, and D).

The result is now shown in Figure 2D in the revision.</p><p>We also added SCGB3A2 alone to the DLS assay graph in the revision (Figure 2E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the Materials and methods section, the procedure for recombinant SCGB3A protein preparation was not disclosed. This is of particular relevance as the authors suggest the recombinant SCGB3A was a source of contaminant endotoxin. In addition, the genetic background of the Scgb3a2 KO mice was not listed.

These important issues must be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>The purification method of recombinant human SCGB3A2 that we mainly used in this manuscript and that we will keep using for future studies has already been described (Cai et al., 2014). The information was added in the Materials and methods, Key resources table.</p><p>As for <italic>Scgb3a2(-/-)</italic> mice, they were backcrossed 10 times to C57BL/6N and the litter mates were used as controls. This is now stated in Materials and methods subsection “LLC cells mouse metastasis model”, and added in the Key resources table.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Although LLC may not express high levels of IL-1β, they may express IL-18 which would be released if the NLRP3 inflammasome is engaged downstream of caspase-4/5/11. Can the authors confirm that the effect of SCGB3A2 in vivo is related to the pyroptosis of LLC cells, and not their production of IL-1β or IL-18?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed IL-18 and IL-1β ELISA assays twice. In both cases, their levels were too low to be detected. Moreover, we showed that mRNA levels for IL18 in LLC cells was lower than that of B16F10 cells (Figure 6E). We believe that these results suggest that IL-18 is not critical for the LLC cells growth inhibition by SCGB3A2 in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Even in an LPS/endotoxin free condition, Scgb3a2 KO mice exhibited profound LLC cell survival (Figure 1F, G, H, I). This clearly indicates that SCGB3A2 suppresses LLC cell proliferations beyond LPS-binding. This raises the question of whether SCGB3A requires LPS for its function (Figure 6F). If the authors mean to insist that microbiota source-derived LPS contributes to the phenomenon, a germ-free condition would have to be employed as a control. This issue needs to be addressed. In addition, to convince readers of anti-lung cancer function of SCGB3A and caspase-11, a more clinically relevant model such as LSL-K-rasG12D mice should be examined. Does deficiency of Scgb3a2 or Casp11 genes protect K-ras mutant mice? This could be immensely important for the relevance of the proposed mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we do not have access to a germ-free facility. We carried out in vivo metastasis model experiments using the amount of LPS that is found in various recombinant SCGB3A2 preparations as described in Supplementary file 1 without co-administration of SCGB3A2. We show in the revised Figure 2F and G that LPS alone, regardless of the amount used, did not show much effect in terms of lung tumor numbers as compared with mice administered SCGB3A2. More importantly, our in vitro results suggest that SCGB3A2 is an LPS binding protein and SCGB3A2+LPS upregulates Casp-11/NLRP3 expression. These results indicate that SCGB3A2 causes non-canonical inflammasome activation of LLC cells.</p><p>We also carried out lung carcinogenesis study using <italic>CCSP-Cre;LSL-KrasG12D</italic> mice that specifically express mutated <italic>Kras</italic> gene in lung. These mice were crossed with <italic>Scgb3a2(fl/fl)</italic> mice to produce <italic>Ccsp-Cre;LSL-K-rasG12D;Scgb3a2(fl/fl)</italic> andlittermate <italic>Ccsp-Cre;LSL-K-rasG12D;Scgb3(fl/+)</italic> mice. All these mice developed lung cancer by 4 months old. The survival of <italic>Ccsp-Cre;LSL-K-rasG12D;Scgb3a2(fl/fl)</italic> mice was significantly shorter than <italic>Ccsp-Cre;LSL-K-rasG12D;Scgb3(fl/+)</italic> mice. The results again indicate that SCGB3A2 is important to kill cancer cells. The new results were added to Figure 6F. Accordingly, the Results, and Materials and methods sections are modified. Also, Mitsuhiro Yoneda who carried out the lung carcinogenesis study was added as a co-author in the revised manuscript.</p><p>References</p><p>Sharma D., and Kanneganti, T.D.
