control of development is passed from exclusively maternal gene products to those encoded by the embryonic genome in a process referred to as the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). We show that the RNA-binding protein, ME31B, binds to and represses the expression of thousands of maternal mRNAs during the <italic>Drosophila</italic> MZT. However, ME31B carries out repression in different ways during different phases of the MZT. Early, it represses translation while, later, its binding leads to mRNA destruction, most likely as a consequence of translational repression in the context of robust mRNA decay. In a process dependent on the PNG kinase, levels of ME31B and its partners, Cup and Trailer Hitch (TRAL), decrease by over 10-fold during the MZT, leading to a change in the composition of mRNA–protein complexes. We propose that ME31B is a global repressor whose regulatory impact changes based on its biological context.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>maternal-to-zygotic transition</kwd><kwd>ME31B/DDX6</kwd><kwd>mRNA decay</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smibert</surname><given-names>Craig A</given-names></name><name><surname>Rissland</surname><given-names>Olivia S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lipshitz</surname><given-names>Howard D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ME31B is a general repressor of gene expression in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> early embryo, repressing translation before the maternal-to-zygotic transition and stimulating mRNA decay after activation of the zygotic genome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A connection between translational regulation and mRNA degradation is a central principle of post-transcriptional regulation. Regulation of both processes relies upon the 5′ cap and 3′ poly(A) tail together with associated proteins: eIF4E (which binds the cap), PABP (which binds the 3′ tail), and the translation initiation factor eIF4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gallie, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Decker and Parker, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caponigro and Parker, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwartz and Parker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kahvejian et al., 2005</xref>). Their connection, however, extends far beyond merely using the same factors. Across different regulatory pathways and biological contexts, a recurring theme is that translational repression precedes and likely causes mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Radhakrishnan and Green, 2016</xref>). For instance, some regulatory factors, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), repress translation of their targets before initiating decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bazzini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Béthune et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Djuranovic et al., 2012</xref>), and, in other cases, broadly blocking translation initiation stimulates mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schwartz and Parker, 1999</xref>). Nonetheless, much about the link between translational repression and mRNA decay remains unknown.</p><p>A conserved DEAD-box helicase has emerged as a central player in both processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nakamura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu and Rana, 2006</xref>). Known as ME31B (in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), Dhh1 (in yeast), and DDX6 (in vertebrates), this helicase both represses translation and stimulates mRNA decay. For instance, in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, ME31B represses translation via a factor called Cup, which interacts with ME31B through an adaptor protein called Trailer Hitch (TRAL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nakamura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tritschler et al., 2008</xref>). Because Cup directly binds eIF4E at the same site as eIF4G, the Cup–TRAL–ME31B complex disrupts the eIF4E–eIF4G interaction and inhibits translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilhelm et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nakamura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kinkelin et al., 2012</xref>). Although less understood mechanistically, orthologs also repress translation in yeast, <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Minshall et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu and Rana, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mair et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boag et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sweet et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>ME31B/DDX6/Dhh1 has been linked to several different mRNA decay pathways. In yeast, Dhh1p is critical for decay of mRNAs with suboptimal codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>). In metazoa, ME31B/DDX6 is important for miRNA-mediated decay where ME31B is thought to be recruited through its interaction with CNOT1, a major component of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu and Rana, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mathys et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rouya et al., 2014</xref>). Once bound, ME31B, as well as its orthologs, then links the decapping and deadenylation machinery. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> ME31B does so through a set of conserved interactions with two additional adaptor proteins, Enhancer of decapping 3 (EDC3) and HPat (also known as Patr-1 or Pat1), which in turn interact with the decapping complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kshirsagar and Parker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jonas and Izaurralde, 2013</xref>). In addition to directly interacting with Cup, TRAL is also able to bind DCP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wilhelm et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tritschler et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">2009</xref>), and so, when Cup expression or binding is reduced, the binding of TRAL to ME31B may also trigger mRNA decay.</p><p>The early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo and <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte have provided powerful biochemical and genetic contexts to dissect the molecular mechanisms of translational repression for two reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castagnetti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Minshall and Standart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jeske et al., 2011</xref>). First, they have robust translational control but lack mRNA decapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gillian-Daniel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Minshall et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eichhorn et al., 2016</xref>). Second, both contexts have little or no transcription, and so post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA translation, stability, and sub-cellular localization plays a particularly important role in coordinating gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Varnum and Wormington, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braat et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nakamura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim and Richter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laver et al., 2015b2015b</xref>).</p><p>Many critical developmental events, such as the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), occur during early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis. The MZT marks the clearance of maternally deposited mRNAs and the initiation of zygotic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, RNA binding proteins, such as Smaug (SMG) and Brain Tumor (BRAT), participate in clearance of maternal mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gerber et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tadros et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laver et al., 2015a</xref>). The tightly controlled expression of each of these proteins depends upon developmental events such as egg activation—which stimulates the Pan gu (PNG) kinase—and zygotic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tadros et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vardy and Orr-Weaver, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benoit et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luo et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>ME31B, TRAL, and Cup were originally identified because of their essential developmental functions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis and embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keyes and Spradling, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nakamura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilhelm et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nakamura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wilhelm et al., 2005</xref>). One of their key targets is <italic>oskar</italic> (<italic>osk</italic>) mRNA, which is transported from nurse cells to the posterior pole of the oocyte in a translationally repressed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nakamura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilhelm et al., 2003</xref>). However, the extent to which this complex regulates translation more broadly in the oocyte and early embryo remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we sought to understand translational repression in the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo on a transcriptome-wide scale. We found that Cup, TRAL, and ME31B bind nearly all expressed transcripts in a complex that also contains eIF4E and PABP. Prior to zygotic genome activation, ME31B binding is associated with translational repression. During the MZT, the abundance of Cup, TRAL, and ME31B falls, and binding of the remaining ME31B to mRNAs instead triggers their destruction. We propose that ME31B is a general regulatory factor whose repressive function can manifest differently depending on its biological context.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PABP interacts with ME31B, TRAL, and Cup in the early embryo</title><p>Because PABP and eIF4G are deeply connected with both mRNA translation and stability, we first analyzed the proteins present in PABP or eIF4G immunoprecipitates by tandem mass spectrometry.

As expected, PABP and eIF4G co-immunoprecipitated with each other and eIF4E in S2 cells, but neither immunoprecipitate contained detectable ME31B and TRAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; Cup is not abundant in S2 cells). In contrast, immunoblot analysis of 0–1 hr embryos detected stable association of PABP with eIF4E, Cup, TRAL, and ME31B. Because the interaction between ME31B and PABP in the early embryo was sensitive to RNase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), it is likely to be indirect. Despite the fact that little eIF4G was detected in the PABP immunoprecipitates from early embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), as in S2 cells, embryonic eIF4G complexes contained eIF4E and PABP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation/western blot experiments gave similar results. In S2 cells, as expected, ME31B failed to interact with PABP, eIF4E, and eIF4G, although the co-immunoprecipitates did contain known interacting proteins, such as EDC3 and HPat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To probe embryonic ME31B interactions in 0–1 hr embryos, we used a previously developed <italic>eGFP-ME31B</italic> trap line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buszczak et al., 2007</xref>) and found that, consistent with the PABP co-immunoprecipitations, ME31B interacted with Cup, TRAL, PABP, and eIF4E, although not eIF4G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>eIF4E specifically recognizes the 7-methylguanosine cap of mRNAs. We took advantage of the specific binding of eIF4E to the cap analog 7-methyl-GDP (m<sup>7</sup>GDP) to test whether the eIF4E, Cup, TRAL, and ME31B can assemble through protein-protein interactions. To assess non-specific binding, we also analyzed the proteins bound to agarose beads. When the cap analog was incubated with S2 lysates, eIF4E, eIF4G, and PABP all bound selectively, but neither TRAL nor ME31B was enriched in the bound fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), presumably because of the relatively low expression of Cup in these cells. In contrast, when this experiment was carried out in 0–1 hr embryo lysates, Cup, TRAL, and ME31B bound m<sup>7</sup>GDP in addition to eIF4E, PABP, and eIF4G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), consistent with the hypothesis that protein-protein interactions are sufficient to drive assembly of the eIF4E–Cup–TRAL–ME31B complex in the early embryo.</p><p>Together, our data indicate that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> early embryo possesses two distinct complexes containing eIF4E and PABP: one that contains eIF4G, and another that contains ME31B, TRAL, and Cup but not eIF4G.

One such example was <italic>nos</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>, pink dot). Despite being a known ME31B target in the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jeske et al., 2011</xref>), its binding at 0–1 hr, as noted above, was near the median of all genes. On the other hand, <italic>nos</italic> was one of the most poorly translated transcripts with over 30-fold lower translation relative to other genes with comparable ME31B binding.

In contrast, although in wild-type embryos hundreds of transcripts were degraded between 0–1 hr and 2–3 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), in <italic>png<sup>50</sup></italic> mutant embryos the RNA abundances between these two time points were nearly identical (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = 0.96 vs. <italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = 0.66 in wild-type embryos), and we observed no evidence of any mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we have shown that during the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> MZT, ME31B exists in complexes that also contain eIF4E, Cup, TRAL, and PABP. This complex is likely to be specific to oocytes and early embryos where it represses the translation of many transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). The first five hours of embryogenesis coincide with three important changes for the Cup–TRAL–ME31B-containing complex: a sharp reduction in the levels of Cup, TRAL, and ME31B protein and transcripts; a change in the transcripts bound by ME31B; and a change in the impact of ME31B-mediated regulation from repressing translation to destabilizing mRNA, which occurs most likely as the result of repressing translation in the context of robust mRNA decay.</p><p>The changes in Cup, TRAL, and ME31B protein abundance may explain the transcriptome-wide alterations in ME31B binding during the MZT. In the early embryo, these proteins are highly abundant, and a recent study estimated their concentrations as 4, 15, and 7 μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Götze et al., 2017</xref>). Their direct, protein-protein interactions appear sufficient to drive assembly on 5′ caps. At this stage, although <italic>trans</italic>-factors or additional mRNA sequences likely stabilize the complex on some transcripts, they are dispensable for its formation. We propose that the reductions in Cup, TRAL, and ME31B levels lead to a different regime where <italic>trans</italic>-factors are required for stable ME31B binding, as is seen elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mathys et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rouya et al., 2014</xref>). Of the three proteins, the loss of Cup has a particularly dramatic effect because stable interactions between the 5′ cap and ME31B likely require the Cup–eIF4E interaction.</p><p>Although Cup, TRAL, and ME31B have been implicated in regulating a small number of transcripts in oogenesis and embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilhelm et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clouse et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broyer et al., 2017</xref>), our data indicate that they play a much broader role. ME31B binds transcripts from nearly all of the maternally deposited genes. Its binding negatively correlates with translation in the early embryo, and we speculate that this relationship is a causative one. How, then, might ME31B repress translation in the early embryo? Orthologs of ME31B have been found to inhibit both translation initiation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nissan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sweet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>). However, given the high abundance of Cup, which blocks the eIF4E–eIF4G interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kinkelin et al., 2012</xref>), we hypothesize that, at this time point, ME31B predominantly represses translation initiation by Cup-mediated disruption of the eIF4F complex.</p><p>Within a few hours of egg laying, the impact of ME31B upon its targets appears to switch from translational repression to mRNA destabilization. Given the tight relationship between translational repression and mRNA decay seen in most contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Radhakrishnan and Green, 2016</xref>), one possible explanation is that at later time points repressed transcripts are quickly degraded and fail to persist long enough to give a translational repression ‘signal’. Thus a critical issue may be to understand why ME31B binding fails to stimulate mRNA decapping in the early embryo. There are two, non-mutually exclusive possibilities. In the first, the decapping enzyme (or other related proteins) is inactive or expressed only at low levels in the early embryo. Indeed, such a model was originally proposed when the decoupling of deadenylation and decapping in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes was first observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gillian-Daniel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>). Consistent with this view, one study found that Dcp1a levels are low in mouse oogenesis, only increasing during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flemr et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>An alternative model invokes factors that stabilize ME31B-bound transcripts in the early embryo so that, during the MZT, their inactivation enables clearance of maternal transcripts. One obvious candidate is Cup. Support for such a role for Cup comes from several observations. When Cup was tethered to reporter transcripts in S2 cells, it simultaneously repressed translation and stabilized deadenylated intermediates, possibly by stabilizing eIF4E binding and so sterically interfering with access of the decapping enzyme to the 5′ cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Igreja and Izaurralde, 2011</xref>). Moreover, in several organisms, including <italic>Drosophila</italic>, loss of ME31B and Cup have, intriguingly, been linked with decreased, rather than increased, levels of targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mair et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boag et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broyer et al., 2017</xref>). We thus favor a model whereby ME31B initially represses translation through Cup, and then, only after Cup is destroyed, the major impact of ME31B is at the level of mRNA decay.</p><p>One implication of our model is that the reduction in Cup levels is required for the clearance of maternally deposited transcripts, and that the timing of this elimination is critical for embryogenesis. Consistent with such a model, in <italic>png<sup>50</sup></italic> mutants, where Cup, TRAL, and ME31B persist, maternal transcripts were not destroyed, although ME31B binding still appeared to repress translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, loss of PNG activity at the oocyte-to-embryo transition has pleiotropic effects, including a failure to induce SMG expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tadros et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kronja et al., 2014b</xref>), and so this result, while supportive, does not provide definitive evidence. In the future, disentangling the reductions in Cup levels and the ability of ME31B to repress translation after the MZT will be important.</p><p>Cup itself is restricted to <italic>Drosophilidae</italic>, but a central role for ME31B in embryogenesis may be evolutionarily conserved. Related complexes have been found in <italic>X. laevis</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ladomery et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boag et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mair et al., 2010</xref>). Regulation of ME31B protein and RNA levels is also conserved in other invertebrates as well as in vertebrates. We, therefore, re-examined previously published datasets from early zebrafish development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bazzini et al., 2012</xref>) and found that transcripts encoding zebrafish ME31B (DDX6) decreased during the MZT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The clearance of DDX6 transcripts was dependent on Dicer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that, in zebrafish, regulation of DDX6 mRNA is likely to be mediated by miR-430, the major miRNA at that developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giraldez et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, previous work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> demonstrated that the protein abundances of ME31B and TRAL orthologs decrease significantly at the 4 cell stage, which coincides with the activation of zygotic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boag et al., 2005</xref>). Likewise, <italic>Xenopus</italic> ME31B protein decreases during the MZT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ladomery et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peshkin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Finally, although less dramatic than the shift seen for ME31B-containing complexes, those containing PABP (but not ME31B) also change during the MZT. In the early embryo, transcripts in this complex bind more PABP with increasing tail length. However, this relationship is lost by the end of the MZT. These results echo our observations that, in most cell types, including <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, and human HEK293 cells, poly(A)-tail length has little influence on PABP binding (Rissland <italic>et al</italic>., in revision). Although the direct mechanisms underlying this shift are unknown, we speculate that the changes in how PABP binds poly(A) tails is a proximal cause for the decoupling of poly(A)-tail length and translational efficiency at the end of the MZT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eichhorn et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>S2 cells were purchased from Life Technologies, verified upon shipment to be mycoplasma free.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;ME31B globally represses maternal mRNAs by two distinct mechanisms during the <italic>Drosophila</italic> maternal-to-zygotic transition&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Jeff Coller (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter to help us evaluate the feasibility of revisions on this manuscript.</p><p>We have received comments from three experts in the field all of whom found this study reporting on the changing nature of mRNP composition over the course of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> MZT to be of broad interest and to reveal some novel insights into developmental regulation of gene expression. Despite broad enthusiasm there are a number of critical issues that require work in order for this study to be appropriate for publication at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The first critical issue concerns the statistical approaches used in assessing correlations among diverse normalized datasets, as detailed by reviewer #2. The correlations that the authors report are at the heart of the manuscript and must be critically evaluated using alternative statistical approaches that avoid the &quot;common denominator input&quot; that can lead to spurious correlations. This may be as simple as comparing the correlations of the RIP RPKMs for Me31b and Pabp directly (without &quot;input&quot; division). If they are binding the same targets, these RPKMs should be positively correlated.</p><p>2) The second point, assuming that the correlations stand up to the new statistical analysis, is that the conclusions of the study rely very strongly on correlative data. The conclusions of the manuscript, that changes in mRNP composition due to changing protein levels lead to changes in the form of regulation, would be substantially bolstered by validating changes in Me31b and pAbp binding, and mRNA abundance by qPCR for other mRNA (not just <italic>Act5c</italic>), and evidence for translational repression by western blot analysis for several proteins.</p><p>3) The conclusions would also be strengthened by repeating the high throughput analyses in the <italic>png Drosophila</italic> background. The prediction is that the observed changes in &quot;mechanism&quot; of regulation would no longer be observed, since the critical proteins are no longer down regulated.</p><p>4) Finally, even if the correlations hold, and the <italic>png</italic> experiment yields the predicted result, the overall discussion of &quot;mechanism&quot; needs to be substantially rewritten. The manuscript argues that the change in mRNP composition leads to a change in &quot;mechanism&quot; of regulation, but fails to acknowledge that what might have changed during the MZT is simply the induction of the mRNA degradation pathway which then erases the signature of translational control during the late phases of the MZT. This more measured discussion of the data would be easily reconciled with considerable literature in this area and should be entertained as a possibility. While it is true that the authors following changes in protein levels of ME31B, Cup and Tral, what they follow is the activities of mRNAs that associate with these proteins. It is not clear that there is not enough protein even at the end of the MZT to achieve the same type and level of regulation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript &quot;ME31B globally represses maternal mRNAs by two distinct mechanisms during the <italic>Drosophila</italic> maternal-to-zygotic transition&quot;, Rissland's group performs immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting or RNA-Seq to demonstrate that, in the early embryo, ME31B forms complex with Cup, TRAL to repress translation. During MZT, this complex dissociates and ME31B promotes mRNA degradation.</p><p>This is an interesting study to explore how maternal mRNAs are repressed and cleared by distinct mechanisms which are conducted by ME31B. There are some concerns for the authors to strengthen the importance of this study:</p><p>There are two main concepts of this manuscript. First, in the early embryo, ME31B-Cup-TRAL complex represses translation of target RNAs. The authors show the negative correlation between ME31B binding and TE in 0-1 hr embryo, while the correlation becomes weaker at 3-4 hr embryo. Second, during MZT, ME31B-Cup-TRAL complex dissociate and the association of ME31B with transcripts triggers mRNA degradation. It will be more convincing if the authors can show the translation of some ME31B targets are actually repressed in early embryo by performing Western blotting and mRNA are degraded during MZT by performing Northern blotting.</p><p>RIP experiments indicate that most of transcripts expressed during embryogenesis are bound by ME31B or PABP. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the authors show that, ME31B bound transcripts at 0-1 hr embryo is weakly correlated with those at MZT (2-3, 3-4 and 4-5 hr). However, the percent <italic>Act5C</italic> IP'ed by ME31B decreases from 42,000 fold to 4 fold, and the percent <italic>Act5C</italic> IP'ed by control IgG increases in the later time points (By comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consider both the level of ME31B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and the enrichment of benchmark <italic>Act5C</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) dramatically decrease after 2-3 hr of developmental stage, how many transcripts are really bound by ME31B in the later time courses? Can authors provide RIP-Seq data from control antibody or show the enrichment of ME31B IP relative to control antibody for few more examples (besides of <italic>Act5C</italic>) over different time points.

They performed RIP-seq analysis of PABP and ME31B protein and report on the changing nature of several correlations between occupancy of these proteins and other features of the transcriptome (polyA length, translation efficiency, and changes in RNA levels. They put forth that their data fit with a model in which ME31B mRNP remodeling changes the function of this RBP from a translational repressor to that of an mRNA decay enhancer. The coIP experiments and western blot analyses are solid and the evidence for mRNP remodeling is strong. The results are also very interesting and timely in that they address how the role of this protein might change during the MZT. However, I have significant doubts about the statistical approaches used in assessing correlations among diverse normalized datasets. These doubts could potentially be eased through alternative statistical analyses in consultation with a statistician and additional experiments. I also have other concerns about the nature or RIP-seq, as discussed below:</p><p>1) RIP-seq analysis has gone out of fashion, so to speak, largely because of concerns that interactions between proteins and RNA become jumbled during immunoprecipitation (i.e. non-specific noise). RBPs could release from one mRNA and bind another. Some mRNAs not bound by the protein targeted could be precipitated through base-pairing interactions with bonafide bound mRNAs, etc. This is why ClIP has become a more standard approach, allowing more stringent digestion of RNA and washes, etc. Thus the authors’ RIP-seq results may be subject to this problem. This is especially troublesome since ME31B appears to be bound somewhat ubiquitously. One way to address this would be to mix <italic>C. elegans</italic> extracts (or those from some other species) into their IPs (from eGFP tagged ME31B.

First, RPKM data are compositional (they add up to a constant). Compositional data, being relative levels akin to% 's, have different properties from absolute data and need to be handled differently for correlation analysis (see http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004075#pcbi.1004075.ref004 for one example). In particular, this can lead to the appearance of spurious correlations. The authors should re-evaluate their data using methods developed for compositional data analysis (e.g. see http://www.compositionaldata.com), or (preferably) consult a biostatistician on the issue.</p><p>3) The authors introduce a metric they call &quot;occupancy&quot;. This divides the FPKM of IP RNA by that of input RNA. This has an unfortunate propensity to produce potentially spurious correlations. This is well documented in the statistics literature, but not always appreciated by biologists. To explain this, if one draws two sets of random data from a normal distribution (rnorm in R) and plots them against each other, there's no correlation. However, if one then takes a third random dataset and divides each of the first two by it, a positive correlation is seen. The reason behind this is that both of the datasets now have a common denominator, and that common denominator drives the correlation. In this case, the authors data are roughly log-normal, so the following R-code would show the spurious relationship:x1 = rnorm(10000, 5, 1) # analogous to ME31B RIP FPKMsx2 = rnorm(10000, 5, 1) # analogous to PABP RIP FPKMsy = rnorm(10000, 5, 1) # analogous to Input FPKMs.cor.test(x1, x2, method=c(&quot;spearman&quot;)) # will return no correlationplot(x1,x2) # same visuallycor.test(x1-y, x2-y, method=c(&quot;spearman&quot;)) # will return a big positive correlation of rho = 0.48, P &lt; 2.2e^-16.plot(x1-y,x2-y) # same visually</p><p>Here I used x1-y to represent the Log(X1/Y) because the data are log-normal log(X1) – log(Y) = log(X1/Y).</p><p>So the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> (positive correlation between PABP occupancy and ME31B occupancy) could be spurious – coming from the common denominator input for both occupancies. The fact that this is not seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> suggests there are differences between the Embryo and S2 cell datasets, but it's very hard to interpret with this confounding denominator issue. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> shows decreased correlations over time, but these could be largely driven by lower correlations between input RNA-seq FPKMs (denominators) over time. Many results in the paper rely on this kind of analysis (occupancy vs. something else, where both are divided by mRNA levels (e.g. TE)). This potentially affects <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, and 7. A biostatistician should be consulted to help sort out the best way to handle this. In addition, it would help to validate the RIP data (assuming it's clean see point 1) via northern blot or qRT-PCR for more genes than <italic>Act5C</italic>.</p><p>4) Somewhat / potentially minor question and comment. The IP data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> are interesting in that there is a second isoform of eIF4G that is abundant in S2 cells and present in the embryo lysate, but does not IP. What is this isoform and why is it not part of the eIF4G complex with PABP and eIF4E in embryos?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Wang et al. here explore the role of the RNA binding protein ME31B during the Zebrafish maternal to zygotic transition (MZT). They show that in early embryos, ME31B, along with Cup and Tral, associate with PABP, but not eIF4G, suggesting the presence of a complex that inhibits the closed loop interaction (consistent with much earlier work). Over the time course of the MZT, they see that the levels of ME31B, Cup and Tral substantially decline, and their pull-down by IP with PABP similarly declines. With these ideas in place, they explore by RIP-seq, RNA-seq and ribosome profiling how these changes in protein amounts and interactions correlate with mRNA levels and translational efficiency (and gathering some already published data from the literature). First, they find by RIP-seq that in early embryos PABP and ME31B bind similar sets of mRNAs (or at least enrich mRNAs in a correlated way), but that these binding interactions become de-correlated during development. They show that at early time points, there is strong (negative) correlation between ME31B binding and TE (and polyA tail length), while this correlation disappears beyond these early time points. They show that changes in mRNA levels do not correlate with ME31B binding at early time points, but that this (negative) correlation increases at the later time points. Thus these trends for changes in mRNA levels and for translational efficiency are seemingly mirror images of one another. These data together are interesting and well presented and the coincidence in timing of changes in protein levels and in effects on output (mRNA and TE) is intriguing. These data also fit nicely with earlier studies characterizing the correlations between polyA tail length and TE during this same developmental period (an early correlation that is seemingly lost at later time points). However, importantly, these relationships are all at this stage simply correlative, and are not established as causal. The authors do explore the effects of two different factors on the trends they observe, and they nicely show the PNG kinase is critical for the loss of the ME31B, Cup, Tral proteins, but that SMG is not. But they do not connect directly the proteins that are the focus of the study, ME31B, Cup and Tral, to the phenomena that they describe through genetic approaches, as would be required to establish causality.</p><p>As a final but substantive point, I find the conclusions that the authors reach to be very much overstated for the type of data they have gathered. What is presented in this study, and in many previous studies of this nature, is a set of correlations that change during this time course of development. There are interesting events being explored and the data gathered are impressive. But the observation of such correlations does not permit strong statements of mechanism that depend on mutational analyses and careful ordering of events. As acknowledged by the authors in their Introduction, there are <italic>many</italic> changes happening during the MZT, including the activation of mRNA decay pathways that are silenced in the early embryo. Given that translation and mRNA decay are tightly coupled in so many systems, it seems at a minimum that these dependencies would be discussed as a possible (and indeed likely) explanation for what is observed in this system. And, since this possibility can't be eliminated by the analysis here, then it should be offered throughout as an alternative to the one preferred by the authors which is that the &quot;mechanism&quot; has changed from one of translational repression to one of mRNA decay during the MZT. Stated more clearly, if the decay machinery wasn't expressed early in the time course, then all that will be observed is translational repression, but if they are coupled later in the time course (as in much of biology), then the mRNA decay that happens will eliminate the signature of the translational repression. In the absence of mutations that separate these events, these alternative explanations must be offered as equally likely. In terms of simplicity, it seems easier to argue that translational repression is common throughout development, but that the increasing levels of decay machinery is a critical change that triggers the apparent change in &quot;mechanism&quot;. The problem for the authors is that they see changes in protein levels (ME31B, Cup and Tral), but fundamentally, despite these changes, they are following the activities of mRNAs that still associate with these proteins.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27891.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We have received comments from three experts in the field all of whom found this study reporting on the changing nature of mRNP composition over the course of the Drosophila MZT to be of broad interest and to reveal some novel insights into developmental regulation of gene expression. Despite broad enthusiasm there are a number of critical issues that require work in order for this study to be appropriate for publication at eLife.</p><p>1) The first critical issue concerns the statistical approaches used in assessing correlations among diverse normalized datasets, as detailed by reviewer #2. The correlations that the authors report are at the heart of the manuscript and must be critically evaluated using alternative statistical approaches that avoid the &quot;common denominator input&quot; that can lead to spurious correlations. This may be as simple as comparing the correlations of the RIP RPKMs for Me31b and Pabp directly (without &quot;input&quot; division). If they are binding the same targets, these RPKMs should be positively correlated.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers, especially reviewer 2, for raising this issue. The reviewers are correct that dividing by a common denominator can introduce spurious correlations into datasets. However, this is not the case with our datasets. When we compared the RIP FPKMs for ME31B and PABP (that is, without input normalization), we observed higher correlations than with the input-normalized occupancies. For instance, in 0–1 hr embryos, the correlation between the RIP FPKMs in 0.94, while the correlation between occupancies is 0.62. Thus, we conclude that the division by a common denominator does not drive these correlations, but instead corrects for the impact of RNA abundance on the RIP FPKMs. We have included a more detailed discussion of this analysis in the paper and added the scatter plots to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>We have also compared our binding values from the RIP-seq to those determined using RIP followed by RT-qPCR for five transcripts that span a range of occupancies. The results of seq versus RT-qPCR based methods are in accordance, and these data have now been included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). These analyses also revealed that even some of the lowliest bound transcripts (such as <italic>smg</italic>) are still enriched in ME31B and PABP immunoprecipitations across this developmental window (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The second point, assuming that the correlations stand up to the new statistical analysis, is that the conclusions of the study rely very strongly on correlative data. The conclusions of the manuscript, that changes in mRNP composition due to changing protein levels lead to changes in the form of regulation, would be substantially bolstered by validating changes in Me31b and pAbp binding, and mRNA abundance by qPCR for other mRNA (not just Act5c), and evidence for translational repression by western blot analysis for several proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We very much appreciate this suggestion, and, as anticipated by the reviewers, including additional examples strengthened our results. We identified target genes with (1) high ME31B binding at 0–1 hr, (2) low translational efficiency at 0–1 hr, and (3) antibodies available. These include <italic>GNU, Ana2</italic>, and <italic>Veli</italic>. We analyzed their protein expression and total RNA levels, as well as ME31B/PABP binding, over the first five hours of development in wild-type embryos. Each of these proteins did not increase or, in fact, decreased over the first three hours of embryogenesis, and their corresponding transcript levels decreased at 2–3 hr. Thus, these results are consistent with our model where the impact of ME31B changes from repressing translation to stimulating mRNA decay during the MZT.</p><p>As a control, we also analyzed <italic>SMG</italic>, whose transcript has low ME31B binding and high translational efficiency at 0–1 hr. Consistent with our transcriptome-wide analysis, SMG protein increases from 0–1 hr to 1–2 hr. Interestingly, ME31B binding to <italic>smg</italic> also increases over the first three hours of embryogenesis, and, in line with ME31B stimulating mRNA decay later, <italic>smg</italic> transcript levels decrease at 3–4 hr.</p><p>We have described these new results in the main text and have included these data in supplemental figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The conclusions would also be strengthened by repeating the high throughput analyses in the png Drosophila background. The prediction is that the observed changes in &quot;mechanism&quot; of regulation would no longer be observed, since the critical proteins are no longer down regulated.</p></disp-quote><p>Like the reviewers, we had also hypothesized that this might be the case. Accordingly, we have performed RNA sequencing and ME31B RIP-seq in <italic>png</italic> mutant embryos. ME31B occupancy still negatively correlated, albeit weakly, with translational efficiency in 0–1 hr <italic>png</italic> mutant embryos (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = –0.25), which is similar to the results we see in wild-type embryos (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = –0.29). These data suggest that Cup–Tral–ME31B complex is still able to repress translation.</p><p>In contrast, when we compared RNA abundance between 0–1 hr and 2–3 hr embryos in wild-type and <italic>png</italic> mutants, we observed no mRNA decay. In wild-type embryos, many transcripts have been degraded by this point, as has been described by other groups. However, there is no evidence of mRNA destabilization in the <italic>png</italic> mutant embryos at the same stage, an observation that is consistent with our model. We have included these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Finally, even if the correlations hold, and the png experiment yields the predicted result, the overall discussion of &quot;mechanism&quot; needs to be substantially rewritten. The manuscript argues that the change in mRNP composition leads to a change in &quot;mechanism&quot; of regulation, but fails to acknowledge that what might have changed during the MZT is simply the induction of the mRNA degradation pathway which then erases the signature of translational control during the late phases of the MZT. This more measured discussion of the data would be easily reconciled with considerable literature in this area and should be entertained as a possibility. While it is true that the authors following changes in protein levels of ME31B, Cup and Tral, what they follow is the activities of mRNAs that associate with these proteins. It is not clear that there is not enough protein even at the end of the MZT to achieve the same type and level of regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this general point about our Discussion, and we have rewritten it to address their concerns.</p><p>In regards to ME31B proteins levels, we do note that, based on recent estimates of protein concentrations from the Wahle group (Götze, et al. 2017), ME31B is present at 7 μM in the early embryo, and so, even a 10– to 20–fold decrease in abundance during the MZT would still lead to ME31B concentrations in line with those observed in yeast and S2 cells, where its ability to repress gene expression has been well-established.</p><p>Below are our responses to specific comments from each reviewer:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] This is an interesting study to explore how maternal mRNAs are repressed and cleared by distinct mechanisms which are conducted by ME31B. There are some concerns for the authors to strengthen the importance of this study:</p><p>There are two main concepts of this manuscript. First, in the early embryo, ME31B-Cup-TRAL complex represses translation of target RNAs. The authors show the negative correlation between ME31B binding and TE in 0-1 hr embryo, while the correlation becomes weaker at 3-4 hr embryo. Second, during MZT, ME31B-Cup-TRAL complex dissociate and the association of ME31B with transcripts triggers mRNA degradation. It will be more convincing if the authors can show the translation of some ME31B targets are actually repressed in early embryo by performing Western blotting and mRNA are degraded during MZT by performing Northern blotting.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

This potentially affects <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, and 7. A biostatistician should be consulted to help sort out the best way to handle this. In addition, it would help to validate the RIP data (assuming it's clean see point 1) via northern blot or qRT-PCR for more genes than Act5C.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this feedback and have addressed this point above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Somewhat / potentially minor question and comment. The IP data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> are interesting in that there is a second isoform of eIF4G that is abundant in S2 cells and present in the embryo lysate, but does not IP. What is this isoform and why is it not part of the eIF4G complex with PABP and eIF4E in embryos?</p></disp-quote><p>Like the reviewer, we also noticed the second isoform of eIF4G. Currently, we do not know the differences between the two isoforms, but we agree that this will be an interesting direction for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] However, importantly, these relationships are all at this stage simply correlative, and are not established as causal. The authors do explore the effects of two different factors on the trends they observe, and they nicely show the PNG kinase is critical for the loss of the ME31B, Cup, Tral proteins, but that SMG is not. But they do not connect directly the proteins that are the focus of the study, ME31B, Cup and Tral, to the phenomena that they describe through genetic approaches, as would be required to establish causality.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We agree that, with our current approaches, we cannot determine causality, and so we have rewritten the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As a final but substantive point, I find the conclusions that the authors reach to be very much overstated for the type of data they have gathered. What is presented in this study, and in many previous studies of this nature, is a set of correlations that change during this time course of development. There are interesting events being explored and the data gathered are impressive. But the observation of such correlations does not permit strong statements of mechanism that depend on mutational analyses and careful ordering of events. As acknowledged by the authors in their Introduction, there are many changes happening during the MZT, including the activation of mRNA decay pathways that are silenced in the early embryo. Given that translation and mRNA decay are tightly coupled in so many systems, it seems at a minimum that these dependencies would be discussed as a possible (and indeed likely) explanation for what is observed in this system. And, since this possibility can't be eliminated by the analysis here, then it should be offered throughout as an alternative to the one preferred by the authors which is that the &quot;mechanism&quot; has changed from one of translational repression to one of mRNA decay during the MZT. Stated more clearly, if the decay machinery wasn't expressed early in the time course, then all that will be observed is translational repression, but if they are coupled later in the time course (as in much of biology), then the mRNA decay that happens will eliminate the signature of the translational repression. In the absence of mutations that separate these events, these alternative explanations must be offered as equally likely. In terms of simplicity, it seems easier to argue that translational repression is common throughout development, but that the increasing levels of decay machinery is a critical change that triggers the apparent change in &quot;mechanism&quot;. The problem for the authors is that they see changes in protein levels (ME31B, Cup and Tral), but fundamentally, despite these changes, they are following the activities of mRNAs that still associate with these proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point and apologize for not having dissected the different possibilities more carefully in our original submission. Although we still favor a model where Cup is important for blocking mRNA decapping in early embryos (and thus its loss enable clearance of maternal transcripts), we have no direct evidence to support this interpretation and so we have rewritten our discussion to make clear that this is just one view, among several possible models.</p><p>Similarly, the reviewer is correct that using “mechanism” overstates our conclusions, which rest on genetic evidence and temporal co-incidence. Accordingly, we have edited our manuscript to make clear that, currently, we cannot determine whether the lack of translational repression after 2–3 hr is because those transcripts are degraded (the most simple explanation) or because ME31B, mechanistically, does not repress translation. Like the reviewer, we believe that directly and rigorously dissecting the relationship between translational repression and mRNA decay during the MZT will be an important step in the future.</p></body></sub-article></article>
