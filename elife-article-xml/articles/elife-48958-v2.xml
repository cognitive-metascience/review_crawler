To propagate they shed large parts of their body; to replace these lost tissues they regenerate proglottids (segments) as part of normal homeostasis. Their remarkable growth and regeneration are fueled by adult somatic stem cells that have yet to be characterized molecularly. Using the rat intestinal tapeworm, <italic>Hymenolepis diminuta</italic>, we find that regenerative potential is regionally limited to the neck, where head-dependent extrinsic signals create a permissive microenvironment for stem cell-driven regeneration. Using transcriptomic analyses and RNA interference, we characterize and functionally validate regulators of tapeworm growth and regeneration. We find no evidence that stem cells are restricted to the regeneration-competent neck. Instead, lethally irradiated tapeworms can be rescued when cells from either regeneration-competent or regeneration-incompetent regions are transplanted into the neck. Together, the head and neck tissues provide extrinsic cues that regulate stem cells, enabling region-specific regeneration in this parasite.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48958.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many worms have remarkable abilities to regrow and repair their bodies.

These parasites are well known for their ability to reach enormous lengths. For example, humans infected with the broad or fish tapeworm, <italic>Diphyllobothrium latum</italic>, harbor parasites that average 6 m in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Craig and Ito, 2007</xref>). It is less commonly appreciated that tapeworms can regenerate to accommodate their multi-host life cycle. Adult tapeworms in their host intestines develop proglottids (segments) that are gravid with embryos. Tapeworms pinch off the posterior and gravid sections of their body, which exit with the host excrement, to be eaten by a suitable intermediate host that supports larval tapeworm development. Despite losing large body sections, the tapeworm does not progressively shorten; instead, it regenerates proglottids, allowing the worms to maintain an equilibrium length. Despite this remarkable biology, tapeworms are an unexplored animal model in the study of regenerative behaviors.</p><p>Up to the 1980s the rat intestinal tapeworm, <italic>Hymenolepis diminuta</italic>, had been a favorite model organism among parasitologists. <italic>H. diminuta</italic> grows rapidly–within the first 15 days of infection, it produces up to 2200 proglottids, increases in length by up to 3400 times, and weight by up to 1.8 million times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roberts, 1980</xref>)–and is easily propagated in the laboratory. Foundational work on their biochemistry, ultrastructure, and developmental biology enriched our understanding of these tapeworms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arai, 1980</xref>). However, with the dawn of the molecular age and the rise of genetic model organisms, <italic>H. diminuta</italic> was essentially left behind. Here, we show that <italic>H. diminuta</italic> is an excellent, tractable model for the study of stem cells and regeneration, with the power to inform us about parasite physiology.</p><p>As an obligate endoparasite, adult <italic>H. diminuta</italic> will expire once its host rat dies. However, the lifespan of <italic>H. diminuta</italic> can be greatly increased via regeneration. A single adult tapeworm can be serially amputated and transplanted into a new host intestine, where the fragment can regenerate into a mature tapeworm even after 13 rounds of amputation over 14 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Read, 1967</xref>). These observations have led to speculation that <italic>H. diminuta</italic> may be inherently immortal. This situation is reminiscent of the free-living cousins of tapeworms: freshwater planarians like <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic>, which reproduce indefinitely by fission, and can regenerate their whole body from tiny fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Planarian immortality and regeneration are enabled by adult somatic stem cells called neoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reddien, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baguñà, 2012</xref>). These stem cells are the only dividing undifferentiated cells within the soma. Like planarians, <italic>H. diminuta</italic> maintains a population of neoblast-like adult somatic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roberts, 1980</xref>) that are likely responsible for their growth and regenerative ability. Recently, stem cells of multiple species of parasitic flatworms have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koziol et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koziol et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koziol et al., 2010</xref>). Stem cells play crucial roles in parasite development, transmission, homeostasis, and even disease. For example, stem cells enable prolific reproduction and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins, 2017</xref>), mediate host-parasite interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2016</xref>), and allow metastatic parasite transmission in host tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brehm and Koziol, 2014</xref>). How stem cells may regulate regeneration in parasites such as tapeworms is largely unexplored and the subject of this study.</p><p>We use <italic>H. diminuta,</italic> to investigate the molecular basis of tapeworm regeneration. We have established and refined experimental tools such as transcriptomics, in vitro parasite culture, whole-mount and fluorescent RNA in situ hybridization (WISH and FISH), cycling-cell tracing with thymidine analogs, RNA interference (RNAi), and cell transplantation, all described in this work. We determine that the ability to regenerate is regionally limited to the neck of adult <italic>H. diminuta</italic>. However, regeneration from the neck is finite without signals from the tapeworm head. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we identify and characterize various markers of the somatic cycling-cell population, which includes tapeworm stem cells. Using RNAi, we functionally validate molecular regulators of growth and regeneration. However, our analyses failed to uncover a neck-specific stem cell population that explains the regional regenerative ability displayed by <italic>H. diminuta.</italic> Instead, we show that cells from both regeneration-competent and regeneration-incompetent regions of <italic>H. diminuta</italic> have stem cell ability and can restore viability to lethally irradiated tapeworms. Our results show that extrinsic signals present in the tapeworm neck, rather than specialized stem cells, confer region-specific regenerative ability in this tapeworm.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The anatomy of adult <italic>H. diminuta</italic> consists of a head with four suckers, an unsegmented neck, and a body with thousands of proglottids/segments that grow and mature in an anterior-to-posterior direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roberts, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rozario and Newmark, 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). What regions of the tapeworm body are competent to regenerate? In order to test regeneration competency, it is necessary to grow tapeworms in vitro instead of in the intestine, where the suckers are required to maintain parasites in vivo. We established <italic>H. diminuta</italic> in vitro culture conditions modified from Schiller's method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schiller, 1965</xref>) and tested the regeneration competence of 1 cm amputated fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–c</xref>). The anterior-most fragments (head+neck+body) were competent to regenerate, confirming in vivo observations using amputation and transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Read, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodchild, 1958</xref>). Anterior fragments that were first decapitated (neck+body) were also competent to regenerate. In contrast, ‘body only’ fragments failed to regenerate proglottids. All amputated fragments could grow in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), differentiate mature reproductive structures, and mate. Despite the failure to regenerate, ‘body only’ fragments could grow because each existing proglottid increased in length as it progressively matured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). However, only fragments that retained the neck were able to regenerate new proglottids over time. The neck of 6-day-old tapeworms used in this study is typically 2–3 mm long when observed after DAPI staining and widefield fluorescent microscopy. By amputating 2 mm ‘neck only’ fragments, we find that the neck is sufficient to regenerate an average of 383 proglottids (SD = 138, N = 4, n = 20) after 12 days in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). In no case did we observe head regeneration. Furthermore, amputated heads alone could not regenerate in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>) nor in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Read, 1967</xref>). Thus, neither the head nor body can regenerate proglottids, but the neck is both necessary and sufficient for proglottid-specific regeneration in <italic>H. diminuta</italic>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48958.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Regeneration competence of <italic>H. diminuta</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of <italic>H. diminuta</italic> adults.

Using in vitro culture, we confirmed that anterior fragments of <italic>H. diminuta</italic> can regenerate after at least four rounds of serial amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f–g</xref>). Decapitated (-head) fragments regenerated proglottids after the first amputation; however, re-amputation abrogated regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f–g</xref>). After decapitation, a definitive neck could not be maintained and eventually, the whole tissue was comprised of proglottids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Without the head, proglottid regeneration from the neck is finite. Thus, while the neck is necessary and sufficient for proglottid regeneration, the head is required to maintain an unsegmented neck and for persistent regeneration.</p><p>If signals from the head regulate regeneration, is regenerative potential asymmetric across the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis of the neck? We subdivided the neck into three 1 mm fragments and found that the most-anterior neck fragments regenerated more proglottids than the middle or posterior neck fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h–i</xref>). Thus, regeneration potential is asymmetric across the neck A-P axis with a strong anterior bias.</p><p>Since the neck is the only region competent to regenerate, are stem cells preferentially confined to the neck? In lieu of specific molecular markers for stem cells, we examined the distribution of all cycling cells in adult tapeworms. In flatworms, it has been repeatedly shown that the only proliferative somatic cells are undifferentiated cells with stem cell morphology and/or function; these cells have been termed neoblasts, adult somatic stem cells, or germinative cells, depending on the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koziol et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baguñà et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ladurner et al., 2000</xref>). In <italic>H. diminuta,</italic> proliferation does not occur in regions comprised solely of differentiated cells (muscle and tegument/parasite skin at the animal edge) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolla and Roberts, 1971</xref>). Instead, proliferation is only detected in regions where undifferentiated cells with the typical morphology of stem cells can be distinguished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolla and Roberts, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sulgostowska, 1972</xref>). Thus, cycling somatic cells in <italic>H. diminuta</italic> would not include differentiated cells, but would include stem cells and any dividing progeny. To label cycling cells, we used two methods: (i) uptake of the thymidine analog F-<italic>ara</italic>-EdU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Neef and Luedtke, 2011</xref>) to mark cells in S-phase and (ii) FISH to detect cell cycle-regulated transcripts, such as the replication licensing factor <italic>minichromosome maintenance complex component 2</italic> (<italic>mcm2</italic>) and <italic>histone h2b</italic> (<italic>h2b</italic>), which are conserved cycling-cell markers in free-living and parasitic flatworms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Solana et al., 2012</xref>). We detected cycling somatic cells throughout the tapeworm body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–b</xref>). Contrary to previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolla and Roberts, 1971</xref>), we also detected cycling cells in the head, though in small numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The scarcity of these cells may be the reason they were originally missed. Taken together, cycling cells are present in all regions, regardless of regeneration competence.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48958.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cycling somatic cells are distributed throughout the tapeworm body and are irradiation sensitive.</title><p>(<bold>a-b</bold>) Maximum-intensity projections of confocal sections showing distribution of cycling cells by 2 hr uptake of F-<italic>ara</italic>-EdU (<bold>a</bold>) or FISH for <italic>mcm2</italic> (<bold>b</bold>).

The blood fluke <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> cannot regenerate after amputation, though it does employ adult somatic stem cells in other ways, such as to repair injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins and Collins, 2016</xref>) and maintain its tegument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wendt et al., 2018</xref>). Prior to this study, the regenerative ability of tapeworms had never been tested comprehensively. Although it was known that anterior fragments containing the head, neck, and immature proglottids could regenerate into fully mature tapeworms once transplanted into a rat intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Read, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodchild, 1958</xref>), fragments lacking heads could not be tested for regenerative ability using transplantation. Attempts were made to suture <italic>H. diminuta</italic> fragments with mutilated or removed heads into a rat intestine but these fragments were invariably flushed out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodchild, 1958</xref>). Here we employ a robust in vitro culture system that allowed us to test regeneration of any amputated <italic>H. diminuta</italic> fragment for the first time. We show that the neck is both necessary and sufficient for proglottid regeneration, though this regenerative ability is ultimately finite without regulatory signals that depend on the presence of the head. <italic>H. diminuta</italic> is an intriguing model to discover signals that both drive and limit regenerative ability.</p><p>During homeostasis, the neck of <italic>H. diminuta</italic> serves as a ‘growth zone’ from which proglottids are thought to bud one at a time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lumsden and Specian, 1980</xref>), thus, it makes intuitive sense that this tissue would retain the ability to regenerate proglottids post-amputation. Furthermore, cells with the typical morphology of stem cells reside in the neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolla and Roberts, 1971</xref>). However, we find that cycling cells are present in all regions regardless of regenerative competence. Thus, it was necessary to embark on a more thorough characterization of tapeworm cycling cells to understand how <italic>H. diminuta</italic> may regulate stem cells and enable proglottid regeneration.</p><p>We depleted cycling cells in <italic>H. diminuta</italic> using irradiation and employed RNA-seq to uncover potential stem cell regulators in an unbiased fashion. Though irradiation may have secondary effects beyond stem cell depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Solana et al., 2012</xref>), this approach allowed us to generate an initial list of candidate tapeworm stem cell genes. Using dFISH, we were able to verify 38 transcripts that were expressed at least partially in cycling cells, providing the first molecular characterization of this population in <italic>H. diminuta</italic>.</p><p>Adult somatic stem cells in free-living flatworms have already been well described molecularly, and share many conserved regulators. However, parasitic flatworms have lost some stem cell genes (e.g. <italic>piwi</italic>, <italic>vasa</italic>, and <italic>tudor</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsai et al., 2013</xref>) but retained others (e.g. <italic>argonaute</italic>, <italic>fgfr</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koziol et al., 2014</xref>). How do the cycling-cell transcripts we identified in <italic>H. diminuta</italic> compare to stem cells in free-living planarians? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fincher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Plass et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Labbé et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rozanski et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). Of 38 verified tapeworm cycling-cell transcripts, 28 had putative planarian homologs (tblasx E-value &lt;10<sup>−10</sup>) though not all were reciprocal blast hits. 16 of these planarian transcripts were designated as cluster-defining genes in the Fincher et al. single-cell sequencing dataset and 6/16 are neoblast cluster-defining genes. Plass et al. also performed single-cell sequencing of planarians but most of the putative planarian homologs of tapeworm cycling-cell transcripts that we identified were not found in their dataset. However, 8/28 transcripts showed enriched expression in neoblast clusters. We also compared the expression of these planarian transcripts in RNA-seq of three cell populations sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS): 1) X1 (neoblasts in G2/M), 2) X2 (G1 neoblasts and progenitors), and 3) Xins (differentiated cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Labbé et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rozanski et al., 2019</xref>). We find that 22/28 putative planarian homologs of tapeworm cycling-cell transcripts show enriched expression in either the X1 or X2 populations, which contain neoblasts. Thus, despite &gt;500 million years of separation between free-living and parasitic flatworm evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Laumer et al., 2015</xref>), tapeworm cycling-cell transcripts have conserved signatures with planarian neoblasts.</p><p>In multiple species of flatworms, stem cells have been shown to be transcriptionally heterogenous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Solana et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fincher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). For example, in larvae of the tapeworm <italic>Echinococcus multilocularis</italic>, many putative stem cell markers show limited overlapping gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koziol et al., 2014</xref>). In keeping with these findings, we observe transcriptional heterogeneity within the cycling-cell population of <italic>H. diminuta</italic>. Additionally, we identified 23 transcripts, including <italic>zmym3</italic> and <italic>pogzl</italic>, that label all cycling cells. Importantly, we were able to use RNAi to functionally verify that cycling-cell genes like <italic>zmym3</italic> and <italic>pogzl</italic> are critical for stem cell maintenance and that inhibition of these genes leads to impaired growth and regeneration. Both <italic>zmym3</italic> and <italic>pogzl</italic> are neoblast cluster-defining genes in planarians (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>) suggesting that their functions in stem cell regulation may be conserved across the two species. In fact, the planarian homolog of tapeworm <italic>pogzl</italic>, <italic>factor initiating regeneration 1</italic> (<italic>fir1</italic>), was recently shown to be expressed in planarian neoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han, 2018</xref>). RNAi of <italic>fir1</italic> resulted in decreased cell division after amputation and failure to regenerate blastemas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han, 2018</xref>). On the other hand, the function of <italic>zmym3</italic> in regeneration is not known, but in other systems, <italic>zmym3</italic> regulates cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hu et al., 2017</xref>) and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leung et al., 2017</xref>), two essential functions for stem cells. Coincidentally, both <italic>zmym3</italic> and <italic>pogzl</italic> are Zn finger proteins with predicted DNA-binding activity and could function as transcriptional regulators of stem cells. Thus, it would be interesting to further understand the mechanism of action of <italic>zmym3</italic> and <italic>pogzl</italic> in stem cells of parasitic and free-living flatworms.</p><p>In this study, we showed the first use of RNAi in <italic>H. diminuta</italic>. RNAi has been demonstrated previously in other tapeworm species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pierson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mizukami et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spiliotis et al., 2010</xref>), though it has not been widely adopted for studying tapeworm biology due to technical challenges like poor knockdown efficacy, inefficient penetrance, and the difficulty of in vitro culture. Taking advantage of the robust in vitro culture of <italic>H. diminuta</italic>, our RNAi scheme can be expanded to ascertain functions for many parasitic flatworm genes that thus far have been refractory to functional analyses.</p><p>Our screening strategy allowed us to verify genes with enriched expression in some or all cycling cells; however, none of these genes were expressed exclusively in the neck. Since we had observed that regenerative ability was anteriorly biased across the neck, we attempted to leverage this observation and query whether a subpopulation of pluripotent cycling cells may be asymmetrically distributed across the neck and would be identifiable by RNA-seq. Through A-P transcriptional profiling of the neck, we identified 461 anterior-enriched transcripts, but the vast majority of them were neither irradiation-sensitive nor detected in cycling cells by dFISH. Thus, a subpopulation of neck-resident pluripotent stem cells, seems unlikely to explain the region-specific regenerative ability of tapeworms. Nonetheless, our study does not exclude the existence of a subpopulation of pluripotent stem cells that may be stably maintained in the adult. Future studies using single-cell RNA sequencing are likely to provide a thorough characterization of adult somatic stem cells in <italic>H. diminuta</italic>, as has been the case for planarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fincher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Plass et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Is the neck competent to regenerate because of a unique stem cell population that has yet to be identified, or because of signals extrinsic to stem cells that make the neck permissive for regeneration? Tapeworms exposed to a lethal dose of irradiation prior to amputation are not competent to regenerate and will eventually degenerate and die. However, transplantation of cells from wild-type donors into the necks of irradiated tapeworms rescued lethality and regeneration. This rescue ability is severely compromised if donor worms are first depleted of cycling cells using drug treatment with HU, suggesting that some or all cycling cells have stem cell ability. Interestingly, stem cell ability is not restricted to cells from regeneration-competent regions: cells from posterior tissues that do not regenerate proglottids are still able to rescue regeneration when transplanted into the neck. These data strongly suggest that the microenvironment within the neck confers regenerative ability to this region.</p><p>The interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic stem cell regulatory signals has been shown to play important roles in regeneration. Head regeneration was induced in three naturally regeneration-deficient planarian species by manipulating the gradient of Wnt signaling by RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sikes and Newmark, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Umesono et al., 2013</xref>). These planarians maintain pluripotent stem cells but do not normally regenerate heads from posterior tissues due to inappropriately high levels of Wnt signaling, which inhibit anterior regeneration. As in planarians, gradients of Wnt signaling delineate A-P polarity in tapeworms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koziol et al., 2016</xref>). Our transcriptional profiling of the neck A-P axis has already revealed hundreds of candidate genes with polarized expression profiles. Future experiments will help clarify how Wnt signaling and other A-P axis regulation in the neck impacts tapeworm regeneration.</p><p>Several plausible models can explain region-specific regeneration in <italic>H. diminuta</italic>. Head-dependent signals may create gradients across the neck that inhibit proglottidization and are necessary to maintain the neck as an unsegmented tissue. Proglottids can only form once the inhibitory signals are sufficiently diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). In this model, the neck is competent to regenerate because of its juxtaposition to the head. After decapitation, the head-dependent signals eventually dissipate and segmentation signals dominate at the expense of the neck. The cellular source of the head-dependent signals and their molecular identity will be exciting avenues for future research.</p><p>In addition to its function in maintaining the neck, the head may also play a role in stem cell regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). The head may regulate a niche (directly or indirectly) that is necessary for the maintenance of pluripotency in the neck. In this model, stem cells are collectively pluripotent only when they receive head-dependent niche signals, thus limiting regenerative potential to the neck. Alternatively, stem cells may depend on a local niche that is independent of the head. In this model, stem cells have the capacity to form all cell lineages from any amputated fragment; however, the extrinsic signals that activate proglottid formation are restricted to the posterior neck region. Identifying the stem cell niche and its relationship to the head and neck microenvironment will provide crucial insights into our understanding of tapeworm regeneration.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study shows that <italic>H. diminuta</italic> is a powerful developmental model for understanding intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of stem cells and regeneration. The regionally limited regenerative biology of <italic>H. diminuta</italic> and the technical advances put forth in this work show that we can exploit this tapeworm to understand the complexities of stem cell regulation in parasites. We defined heterogenous stem cells that are collectively pluripotent but that require extrinsic head-dependent signals to enable persistent proglottid regeneration. Understanding how the stem cell niche we describe is regulated may have broad implications for elucidating stem cell biology in parasitic flatworms, as well as other regenerative animals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, (<italic>Hymenolepis diminuta</italic>)</td><td>BioSample accession SAMN11958994</td><td valign="top">Carolina Biologicals</td><td valign="top">Cat# 132232</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-Oregon Green 488-HRP antibody (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">A21253</td><td valign="top">IF(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-DIG-AP (sheep polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat# 11093274910</td><td valign="top">IF(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-DIG-POD (sheep polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 11207733910</td><td valign="top">IF(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-DNP-HRP (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Vector Laboratories</td><td valign="top">Cat#: MB-0603</td><td valign="top">IF(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-acetylated α-tubulin (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz</td><td valign="top">Cat#: sc-23950</td><td valign="top">IF(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">PCR primers</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1E</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (<italic>Hymenolepis diminuta</italic>)</td><td valign="top">DDB/ENA/Genbank</td><td valign="top">GHNR01000000</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">Sequence Read Archives for transcriptome assembly</td><td valign="top">DDB/ENA/Genbank</td><td valign="top">PRJNA546290</td><td valign="top">SRX6045715- SRX6045719</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">Sequence Read Archives for differential gene expression</td><td valign="top">DDB/ENA/Genbank</td><td valign="top">PRJNA546293</td><td valign="top">SRX6064929- SRX6064933</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">Plasmid- pJC53.2</td><td valign="top">Addgene</td><td valign="top">26536</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">F-<italic>ara</italic>-EdU</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">T511293</td><td valign="top">0.1 μM (in 1% final DMSO concentration)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Oregon green 488-azide</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">O10180</td><td valign="top">100 μM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Hydroxyurea</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat#: H8627</td><td valign="top">50 mM</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal care and use</title><p>Infective <italic>H. diminuta</italic> cysts were obtained from Carolina Biological (132232).

The map-based assembly was performed using TopHat2 with the 2014 <italic>H. diminuta</italic> draft genome courtesy of Matt Berriman (Wellcome Sanger Institute, UK). 15,859 transcripts were assembled using TopHat. De novo assembly was performed using Velvet/Oases and resulted in 144,682 transcripts. There were 11,275 predicted Maker transcripts and 73.2% matched (&gt;95% along the length) to the TopHat transcripts.

The cell pellet was washed in CMF HBSS and passed through cell strainers at 100 μm, 40 μm, 20 μm, and 10 μm (Falcon and Sysmex) with one spin and wash in between. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 200–400 μL WH4 with 0.05% BSA. Cell injections were performed using the Cell Tram Oil four injection system (Eppendorf) into the necks of irradiated worms. For + /- HU donors, cell concentrations were measured using a hemocytometer and normalized (to ~10<sup>8</sup> cells/mL) to ensure equal numbers of cells were injected. For all rescue experiments, cells were injected into irradiated hosts on the same day that the hosts were irradiated.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Yukiko M Yamashita as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Peter W Reddien (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This work is the first comprehensive study to analyze regeneration of tapeworm <italic>H. diminuta</italic> at a molecular level and establishes it as a model system to study striking regeneration capacity. Accordingly, all reviewers agreed that this study represents an important advancement in the field of regenerative biology. Essentially all comments raised by reviewers are technical ones and are straightforward to address.</p><p>Therefore, we would like to invite you to submit a revised version that addresses the reviewers' comments below. We look forward to receiving the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This work establishes tapeworm (<italic>H. diminuta</italic>) as a model system for molecular studies on stem cell-based tissue homeostasis. Given their capacity to live for extremely long (if not infinite), understanding the underlying mechanisms of their regeneration will be of significant interest and importance. The most important conclusion from this paper is that regenerative capacity is confined within neck, but it requires head (likely as the 'niche') to maintain long-term regeneration. Head is only the niche, but does not have stem cells on its own. And this niche appears to play a dominant role as all regions (including body) appear to contain 'proliferative' cells.</p><p>Experiments are conducted to a highest standard, and this study represents a major advance in the field by establishing tapeworm as a stem cell model system. My comments are mostly about writing: I felt that the writing/data presentation can be improved such that general readers (who are interested in stem cells but are not familiar with tapeworm anatomy – which are the majority of readers).</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>- The fourth paragraph of the Results states that the only proliferative somatic cells are undifferentiated in tapeworm, citing Bolla and Roberts, 1971 and Sulgostowska, 1972. But these references are from the 70s, and I am not sure (or more in general, readers will wonder) what kind of methods in the 70s could provide such a conclusion at the accuracy of today's standard. Also, if old studies are that conclusive, this study would sound like not providing much of new insights. Maybe a bit more of elaboration (what was done before, and how it compares to the present study, in providing more accurate information) would be helpful.</p><p>- Figure 1B: the lack of regeneration with 'body only' is not obvious due to different scales used between day 0 vs. day 9.</p><p>- Figure 2 used irradiation to deplete proliferating cells, which the authors assumed to eliminate stem cells. Whereas I agree that this method has been successfully used to identify neoblast-specific genes in planaria, the formal possibility remains that irradiation induce transient quiescence of stem cells. If so, this experiment will be only identifying 'proliferation-associated' genes, instead of 'stem cell specific genes'. In case of planaria, the use of 'lethal dose' (i.e. no stem cells are left indeed) excluded such a possibility. I am guessing 200 Gy for tapeworm is the same treatment, but it is not explained in the paragraph where this experiment is explained (Results, fifth paragraph). Clarification might help here.</p><p>- Figure 3 explains proliferating cells are in neck parenchyma. Abstract/Introduction primed me/readers to think that stem cells are not limited to neck region and are present everywhere. However, in this figure, the authors' description focuses on neck area (starting in the sixth paragraph of the Results, they provide detailed location of cycling cells within the neck region, without mentioning the other area of the worm-like body), which inevitably made me wonder whether other regions also exhibit similar expression patterns or not, and I was quite confused going through the explanation around here. I wonder these questions might not occur to authors, because the images may be self-explanatory to them. But those who are not familiar to tapeworm anatomy cannot quite tell where the neck is/where the body starts in the presented images (labelling those regions in the panels will greatly help).</p><p>- Results, ninth paragraph: Reduction in <italic>mcm2</italic> is used to conclude that cell populations are gone after RNAi of <italic>h2b</italic> etc. However, as <italic>mcm2</italic> itself is a cell proliferation gene, it is still possible that the cell population still exists while reducing the expression of <italic>mcm2</italic>. Here I am not asking to do additional experiments to distinguish these possibilities (cell population is gone vs. proliferation is diminished). I am simply pointing out a flaw in interpretation so that they can adjust their statement.</p><p>- Figure 5-6 conclude that stem cells are not limited to the neck region. This is based on the lack of any transcripts that are differentially expressed between posterior vs. anterior regions, and the fact that cells from any regions can rescue lethally irradiated animals. Based on these data, the authors propose that head/neck serves to provide extrinsic signals to maintain stem cells, yet there are no intrinsic differences among stem cells. They also nicely show that cycling cells contain the stem cell population (by HU-induced depletion of cycling cells). Whereas the data are striking and clear, the explanation seems to be somewhat confusing (or indicating something is missing). ---upon reading the Discussion, I see that most of the issues (below) are indeed discussed well, but as I read through the result section, the description went on without addressing some major question. It might be helpful to slip in a few sentences also in Result section to prepare readers (instead of making them hang up with their questions). One major issue was: how signal from the head regulates the stem cells, which seems to be everywhere in the body, yet no differential transcripts were found (again, the discussion in the Discussion section was excellent, but none of which were primed in the Results section, so I had to keep reading suspended. Just 'see Discussion' might greatly help the reading).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper presents the most comprehensive study of cestode regeneration to date and includes a description of a robust in vitro culture for <italic>Hymenolepis diminuta</italic> that facilitates the use of growth/anatomical bioassays, and powerful techniques like irradiation, cell transplantation and RNAi. Using this in combination with RNAseq, the authors present a fascinating picture of the regenerative capacity of <italic>H. diminuta</italic>, showing that cycling cells from multiple regions of the worm can rescue regeneration in irradiated animals. The RNAseq data also adds valuable resources to the broader flatworm stem cell research community.</p><p>This review raises only minor points for clarification and suggests some experimental questions that may warrant consideration/discussion.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Results, first paragraph: The author should clarify their definition of 'regeneration', especially in the context of planarian 'regeneration'. For example, a head neck and body segment would still constitute a worm with fewer proglottids – so would 'regeneration' in the normal definition be the right word here?</p><p>Results, first paragraph: Clarification on the difference between growth and regeneration, and what is actually happening to cause the increase in length, if not regeneration.</p><p>Results, first paragraph: Could authors clarify what region of the neck these '2mm &quot;neck only&quot; fragments' came from?</p><p>Would it be more correct to refer to <italic>mcm2</italic> and <italic>h2b</italic> as 'proliferative cell markers', rather than 'stem cell markers'?</p><p>Results, fourth paragraph: EdU labelling would be visible when positive, even if only a few cells were labelled – could the authors propose alternative hypotheses for new observation of presence of cycling cells in head?</p><p>Results, eighth paragraph: Could authors refer to Figure 4B when highlighting the thin and frail worms resulting from the RNAi experiments.</p><p>Results, ninth paragraph: Loss of <italic>mcm2</italic> transcript might mean that there are no cycling cells present, but is it possible that the stem cells are still there in a quiescent state?</p><p>Results, eleventh paragraph: Should 'gene' be replaced by 'transcript' when discussing RNAseq and ISH?</p><p>Clarification of what &quot;subset of cells within neck parenchyma&quot; means.

The authors developed the parasitic tapeworm <italic>H. diminuta</italic> as a modern molecular genetic system in an impressive technical advance promoted by an in vitro culture system. The authors found that the neck region of the tapeworm was necessary and sufficient for regeneration of proglottids, but that a head could not be regenerated and was necessary for serial rounds of regeneration. Dividing cells, however, were present in all regions of the body. The authors developed a transplantation procedure that showed cycling cells from multiple regions of the body were capable of rescuing lethally irradiated hosts when transplanted into the neck, indicating that the neck harbors a permissive environment for stem cell proliferation. The novelty in the work involves the comprehensive testing of the regenerative ability of tapeworms, the molecular description of the <italic>H. diminuta</italic> cycling cell population, and in the discovery of the existence of essential proliferating cell-extrinsic anterior cues required for stem cell-driven regeneration.</p><p>Results, first paragraph: Please clarify the description of growth without proglottid formation.

Also, if old studies are that conclusive, this study would sound like not providing much of new insights. Maybe a bit more of elaboration (what was done before, and how it compares to the present study, in providing more accurate information) would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a more thorough description as suggested.</p><p>“In flatworms, it has been repeatedly shown that the only proliferative cells are undifferentiated cells with stem cell morphology and/or function; these cells have been termed neoblasts, adult somatic stem cells, or germinative cells, depending on the organism (Collins et al., 2013; Koziol et al., 2014; Baguñà, Salo and Auladell, 1989; Ladurner, Rieger and Baguñà, 2000).

At day 0, the proglottids in the amputated “body only” fragments are small and immature but with time, they grow in size and become reproductively mature. Additionally, since there is no regeneration, they do not add new (and small) proglottids.

Whereas I agree that this method has been successfully used to identify neoblast-specific genes in planaria, the formal possibility remains that irradiation induce transient quiescence of stem cells. If so, this experiment will be only identifying 'proliferation-associated' genes, instead of 'stem cell specific genes'. In case of planaria, the use of 'lethal dose' (i.e. no stem cells are left indeed) excluded such a possibility. I am guessing 200 Gy for tapeworm is the same treatment, but it is not explained in the paragraph where this experiment is explained (Results, fifth paragraph). Clarification might help here.</p></disp-quote><p>200 Gy is a lethal dose of irradiation. 100% of 5 mm anterior fragments amputated from worms exposed to 200 Gy x-irradiation will degenerate after 1 month with no detectable proglottids.

This dosage is lethal; all fragments from worms exposed to 200 Gy x-irradiation degenerated after 1 month (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 3 explains proliferating cells are in neck parenchyma. Abstract/Introduction primed me/readers to think that stem cells are not limited to neck region and are present everywhere. However, in this figure, the authors' description focuses on neck area (starting in the sixth paragraph of the Results, they provide detailed location of cycling cells within the neck region, without mentioning the other area of the worm-like body), which inevitably made me wonder whether other regions also exhibit similar expression patterns or not, and I was quite confused going through the explanation around here. I wonder these questions might not occur to authors, because the images may be self-explanatory to them. But those who are not familiar to tapeworm anatomy cannot quite tell where the neck is/where the body starts in the presented images (labelling those regions in the panels will greatly help).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added annotations to Figure 3B to help highlight that only a portion of the neck is shown.

Here I am not asking to do additional experiments to distinguish these possibilities (cell population is gone vs. proliferation is diminished). I am simply pointing out a flaw in interpretation so that they can adjust their statement.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adjusted the description to more accurately describe our observations.</p><p>“Are these RNAi-induced failures in growth and regeneration due to defects in the cycling-cell population?

This is based on the lack of any transcripts that are differentially expressed between posterior vs. anterior regions, and the fact that cells from any regions can rescue lethally irradiated animals. Based on these data, the authors propose that head/neck serves to provide extrinsic signals to maintain stem cells, yet there are no intrinsic differences among stem cells. They also nicely show that cycling cells contain the stem cell population (by HU-induced depletion of cycling cells). Whereas the data are striking and clear, the explanation seems to be somewhat confusing (or indicating something is missing). ---upon reading the Discussion, I see that most of the issues (below) are indeed discussed well, but as I read through the Results section, the description went on without addressing some major question. It might be helpful to slip in a few sentences also in Results section to prepare readers (instead of making them hang up with their questions). One major issue was: how signal from the head regulates the stem cells, which seems to be everywhere in the body, yet no differential transcripts were found (again, the discussion in the Discussion section was excellent, but none of which were primed in the Results section, so I had to keep reading suspended. Just 'see Discussion' might greatly help the reading).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a more thorough description in the Results section:</p><p>“With this functional assay in hand, we examined the rescue ability of cells from anterior donor tissues (including the regeneration-competent neck) compared to donor tissues from the most posterior termini of 6 day-old tapeworms (which are regeneration incompetent and exclusively comprised of proglottids).

This applies to a broad range of biological levels including regeneration of the whole body, individual anatomical structures, internal organs, tissues and cells.

[…] Thus, despite &gt;500 million years of separation between free-living and parasitic flatworm evolution (Laumer, Hejnol and Giribet, 2015), tapeworm cycling-cell transcripts have conserved signatures with planarian neoblasts.”</p><p>In refence to the potential molecular functions of <italic>zmym3</italic> and <italic>pogzl</italic>, we have added text to the Discussion.</p><p>“Both <italic>zmym3</italic> and <italic>pogzl</italic> are neoblast cluster-defining genes in planarians (Supplementary file 1C) suggesting that their functions in stem cell regulation may be conserved across the two species.

However, we were able to do pulse-chase experiments and use antibody staining as well as anatomical location to identify differentiated cells: anti-acetylated α- tubulin antibodies label flame cells of the protonephridial system and the edge-most nuclei are differentiated muscle and tegument. We were able to pulse amputated posterior fragments of proglottids alone (2mm) and perform 1 hr F-<italic>ara</italic>-EdU pulse followed by a 3 days chase and found that posterior cycling cells could chase into muscle/tegument and flame cells.

Thus, the cycling cells from tapeworm posteriors show hallmarks of stem cell activity, despite the fact that this tissue is not competent to regenerate.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
