its levels are tightly regulated by ubiquitylation and degradation, but mechanisms that drive this degradation, particularly in solid tumors, remain to be established. We show here in prostate cancer cells that increased NOXA, mediated by kinase inhibitor activation of an integrated stress response, drives the degradation of MCL1, and identify the mitochondria-associated ubiquitin ligase MARCH5 as the primary mediator of this NOXA-dependent MCL1 degradation. Therapies that enhance MARCH5-mediated MCL1 degradation markedly enhance apoptosis in response to a BH3 mimetic agent targeting BCLXL, which may provide for a broadly effective therapy in solid tumors. Conversely, increased MCL1 in response to MARCH5 loss does not strongly sensitize to BH3 mimetic drugs targeting MCL1, but instead also sensitizes to BCLXL inhibition, revealing a codependence between MARCH5 and MCL1 that may also be exploited in tumors with <italic>MARCH5</italic> genomic loss.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MARCH5</kwd><kwd>MCL1</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>NOXA</kwd><kwd>integrated stress response</kwd><kwd>BCLXL</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 CA163227</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balk</surname><given-names>Steven P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000090</institution-id><institution>Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-16-1-0431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balk</surname><given-names>Steven P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>JSPS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20K09518</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arai</surname><given-names>Seiji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000090</institution-id><institution>Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-18-1-0379</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balk</surname><given-names>Steven P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50CA090381</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balk</surname><given-names>Steven P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>MARCH5 mediates a pathway driving MCL1 degradation in response to cellular stress, which sensitizes to BH3 mimetic drugs targeting BCLXL and provides a broadly effective therapeutic strategy for solid tumors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Androgen deprivation therapy to suppress activity of the androgen receptor (AR) is the standard treatment for metastatic prostate cancer (PCa), but tumors invariably recur (castration-resistant prostate cancer, CRPC). The majority will initially respond to agents that further suppress AR, but most men relapse within 1–2 years and these relapses appear to be driven by multiple AR dependent and independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Watson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>), which may include increased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. The anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins (including BCL2, BCLXL, and MCL1) act by neutralizing BAX and BAK, and by inhibiting the BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins that can activate BAX/BAK (primarily BIM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Montero and Letai, 2018</xref>). These interactions are mediated by the BH3 domain, and BH3-mimetic drugs can enhance apoptosis by mimicking the activity of BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins and thereby antagonizing the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Knight et al., 2019</xref>). ABT-737 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oltersdorf et al., 2005</xref>) and ABT-263 (navitoclax, orally bioavailable analogue of ABT-737) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tse et al., 2008</xref>) are BH3-mimetics that directly bind to BCL2, BCLXL, and BCLW (but not MCL1), which blocks their binding to pro-apoptotic BH3 only proteins such as BIM and their ability to neutralize BAX/BAK. Navitoclax has single-agent activity in hematological malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>), but causes thrombocytopenia due to BCLXL inhibition. A BCL2-specific agent that spares platelets (ABT-199, venetoclax) is similarly active and is now FDA approved for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roberts et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, most solid tumors are resistant to these agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faber et al., 2015</xref>), which appears to reflect an important role for MCL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van Delft et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Konopleva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Santer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williams et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, preclinical studies indicate that navitoclax may be efficacious in solid tumors when used in combination with other agents acting through a variety of mechanisms, including by decreasing MCL1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leverson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Modugno et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arai et al., 2018</xref>). BH3 mimetics that target MCL1 (including AMG176, S63845 and AZD5991) are now becoming available and may have single agent activity in a subset of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kotschy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashkenazi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Letai, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tron et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caenepeel et al., 2018</xref>), but efficacy in most solid tumors will likely still require combination therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kotschy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merino et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, the toxicities associated with direct MCL1 antagonists, alone or in combination therapies, remain to be determined.</p><p>We reported previously that navitoclax (acting through BCLXL blockade), in combination with several kinase inhibitors (erlotinib, lapatinib, cabozantinib, sorafenib) could induce rapid and marked apoptotic responses in PCa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arai et al., 2018</xref>). This response was preceded by a dramatic increase in MCL1 degradation, and we confirmed that navitoclax could drive apoptotic responses in vitro and in vivo in PCa cell that were depleted of MCL1 by RNAi or CRISPR. Significantly, the enhanced MCL1 degradation in response to kinase inhibitors was not mediated by well-established mechanisms including through GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation (and the downstream ubiquitin ligases βTrCP or Fbw7), or by the ubiquitin ligase HUWE1/MULE that has been reported to mediate both basal MCL1 degradation and MCL1 degradation in response to DNA damage and NOXA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gomez-Bougie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guikema et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Warr et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we found that treatment with kinase inhibitors initiates an integrated stress response (ISR) leading to increased ATF4 protein and subsequent increased transcription of NOXA, and that the enhanced degradation of MCL1 was NOXA-dependent. We further identified the mitochondria-associated ubiquitin ligase MARCH5 as the mediator of this stress-induced and NOXA-dependent MCL1 degradation. MARCH5 is a RING-finger E3 ligase with an established function in mediating the ubiquitylation and degradation of several proteins that regulate mitochondrial fission and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yonashiro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cherok et al., 2017</xref>). MARCH5 depletion both abrogated the decrease in MCL1 in response to cellular stress and substantially increased basal MCL1 in multiple epithelial cancer cell lines, indicating that MARCH5 makes a major contribution to regulating MCL1 levels under basal conditions and in responses to cellular stress. Significantly, while the MARCH5 mediated degradation of MCL1 markedly sensitized tumor cells to BCLXL inhibition, MARCH5 depletion, which occurs in ~5% of PCa, also sensitized to BCLXL inhibition despite increased MCL1, revealing a codependency between MCL1 and MARCH5. Together these results reveal therapeutic opportunities for the use of agents targeting BCLXL in solid tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NOXA upregulation mediates increased MCL1 degradation in PCa cells</title><p>As we reported previously, multiple kinase inhibitors including the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib could rapidly (within 4 hr) and markedly enhance the proteasome-dependent degradation of MCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Moreover, we found that this occurred by a mechanism that was independent of the ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 (MULE) and of ubiquitin ligases downstream of GSK3β (βTRCP, FBW7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arai et al., 2018</xref>). BIM and NOXA are the primary BH3-only proteins that bind MCL1, and can increase or decrease its stability, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Warr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Willis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Czabotar et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with our previous results, 4 hr treatment with erlotinib did not decrease BIM, indicating that loss of BIM is not a basis for the marked decrease in MCL1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, NOXA expression was increased by erlotinib, suggesting this may drive the increased MCL1 degradation. Indeed, depleting NOXA with three different siRNA suppressed this decrease in MCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, more complete depletion of NOXA with the pooled siRNAs prevented the erlotinib-mediated MCL1 reduction, indicating a NOXA-dependent mechanism for decreasing MCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, while depletion of BIM by siRNA caused a decrease in basal MCL1, it did not prevent the further decrease in MCL1 in response to erlotinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>EGFR inhibition decreases MCL1 via NOXA-dependent mechanism.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) LNCaP cells were treated with EGFR inhibitor erlotinib (10 μM) for 3 hr, followed by immunoblotting.

Actinomycin D similarly decreased basal MCL1 protein expression through transcriptional repression, but importantly prevented the erlotinib-mediated MCL1 reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>BH3-mimetic agents that occlude the BH3 binding site of MCL1, and would therefore prevent binding of BIM and NOXA, have recently been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kotschy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tron et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caenepeel et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether one such agent (S63845), by competing with NOXA for binding to MCL1, could prevent the erlotinib-mediated decrease in MCL1. Significantly, S63845 increased basal MCL1 expression and prevented the erlotinib-mediated decrease in MCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Together, these data show that erlotinib induces transcriptional upregulation of NOXA, and indicate that this increase in NOXA is directly enhancing MCL1 degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>NOXA upregulation is mediated by the integrated stress response</title><p>To determine how erlotinib was increasing NOXA transcription we first focused on p53, as NOXA is a major transcriptional target of p53.

The alternative p53-independent pathway that may increase NOXA transcription is the integrated stress response (ISR), which can be triggered by factors including hypoxia, glucose or amino acid depletion, genotoxic stress, and the endoplasmic reticulum stress/unfolded protein response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>). These stresses activate kinases including PERK (in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress), GCN2 (in response to amino acid starvation), and PKR (in response dsRNA and additional cellular stresses), which converge on phosphorylation of eIF2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guikema et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armstrong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albershardt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2009</xref>).

Nonetheless, an increase in NOXA protein was observed after 60–90 min of erlotinib treatment, and this rapid time course coincided with the increase in ATF4 and decrease in MCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Moreover, treatment with an ISR inhibitor (ISRIB), which suppresses the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>), decreased basal ATF4 and suppressed the erlotinib-mediated increase in ATF4 and NOXA, providing further evidence for this pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Consistent with these findings, ISRIB suppressed the erlotinib-mediated increase in NOXA mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), while MCL1 mRNA was unaffected by these treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that activation of the ISR by erlotinib drives the rapid induction of NOXA, which then promotes MCL1 degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MARCH5 mediates kinase inhibitor/NOXA-dependent MCL1 degradation</title><p>We next sought to identify E3 ligases that contribute to kinase inhibitor-mediated and NOXA-dependent MCL1 degradation.

To determine the role of cullin-dependent E3 ligases in MCL1 degradation in response to tyrosine kinase inhibition, we examined whether NEDD8 inhibition could prevent the effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Treatment with NEDD8 inhibitor MLN4924 increased p27 (a known target of cullin-dependent E3 ligase CUL4), but did not increase MCL1 or block the effects of erlotinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Indeed, MLN4924 moderately decreased MCL1 protein, which may be due to an increase in NOXA, whose degradation is mediated by a cullin-dependent E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). MLN4924 similarly failed to prevent the decrease in MCL1 in response to lapatinib (EGFR/ERBB2 inhibitor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that a cullin-independent mechanism is driving the increased MCL1 degradation.</p><p>We then hypothesized that a cullin-independent E3 ligase that localizes to mitochondria, where MCL1 is mainly located, may promote MCL1 degradation in response to tyrosine kinase inhibition. To assess this hypothesis, we first examined the well-known mitochondria-associated cullin-independent E3 ligase PARKIN, which has been implicated as a ubiquitin ligase for MCL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carroll et al., 2014</xref>). However, while PARKIN depletion increased its target protein p62, it did not increase MCL1 or block the effect of erlotinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). MARCH5 is another mitochondria-associated cullin-independent E3 ligase that has been implicated as a regulator of MCL1 (37,47).

In contrast, MARCH5 depletion did not prevent MCL1 loss in cells treated with dinaciclib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which decreases MCL1 mRNA through inhibition of CDK9 and subsequent decrease in MCL1 transcription. To confirm these findings, we then used CRISPR/CAS9 to delete MARCH5. Consistent with the RNAi results, there was a marked increase of MCL1 expression, as well of the MARCH5 substrate MiD49, in each of three MARCH5 depleted lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Moreover, erlotinib no longer decreased MCL1 in these MARCH5 depleted lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

MARCH5 depletion did not increase, but instead decreased NOXA mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating this increase in NOXA protein is through a post-transcriptional mechanism. One plausible mechanism is through increased binding to MCL1, as a previous study found that MCL1 could protect NOXA from proteasome-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Craxton et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with this mechanism, the increased levels of NOXA and of BIM in MARCH5 depleted cells coincided with increased binding of these proteins to MCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). To further assess this mechanism, we treated cells with an MCL1-targeted BH3 mimetic agent, S63845, to interfere with BH3 domain-mediated interactions with MCL1. Significantly, S63845 decreased both NOXA and BIM in the MARCH5-depleted cells, consistent with them being stabilized by MCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Of note, S63845 increased MCL1 in both the control and MARCH5 depleted cells, indicating that additional ubiquitin ligases may partially compensate for MARCH5 loss in driving basal MCL1 degradation.</p><p>We also examined the effects on NOXA and BIM of depleting or overexpressing MCL1. Cells with CRISPR-mediated MCL1 depletion had markedly reduced NOXA and BIM, providing further evidence that MCL1 protects both from degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Conversely, NOXA and BIM were increased in cells that overexpress ectopic MCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). However, while MCL1 levels were comparable in cells overexpressing ectopic MCL1 and in MARCH5-depleted cells, the increases in NOXA and BIM were greater in the latter MARCH5-depleted cells. One explanation for this difference with respect to NOXA (and possibly BIM) is that the MARCH5-mediated ubiquitylation of MCL1 in MCL1-NOXA complexes may drive degradation of the complex, or be coupled to the degradation of NOXA mediated by a distinct ubiquitin ligase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>EGFR inhibition does not alter MARCH5 expression or activity</title><p>The above findings indicated that increased NOXA in response to erlotinib was driving the MARCH5-mediated ubiquitylation and degradation of MCL1. Consistent with this conclusion, we found by coimmunoprecipitation that erlotinib treatment, in combination with proteasome inhibition, enhanced the interaction between MARCH5 and MCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Importantly, phosphorylation of BIM and NOXA can modulate their interaction with MCL1, suggesting that kinase inhibitors may further be enhancing MCL1 ubiquitylation and degradation through effects on phosphorylation of BIM, NOXA, or MCL1 that modulate NOXA/BIM-MCL1 interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ewings et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conage-Pough and Boise, 2018</xref>).

Finally, MARCH5 depletion did not clearly alter the fraction of MCL1 associated with mitochondria.</p><p>As MARCH5 may be activated by mitochondrial stress, we also asked whether tyrosine kinase inhibition had acute effects on mitochondria that may alter MARCH5 function.

Neither erlotinib nor lapatinib changed maximal oxygen consumption rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>), suggesting that EGFR inhibition is not promoting functional damage to mitochondrial regarding ATP production. Intriguingly, erlotinib and lapatinib increased basal oxygen consumption (ATP linked respiration) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,I</xref>), indicating a shift from fermentation to increased oxidative phosphorylation. The precise basis for this metabolic adaptation, and whether it is linked to activation of a stress response, is not clear.

Actinonin is an inhibitor of the human mitochondrial peptide deformylase that blocks mitochondrial protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Escobar-Alvarez et al., 2010</xref>). Four-hour treatment with actinonin decreased MCL1 in LNCaP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Finally, as expected and consistent with a previous study of gamitrinib-TPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karpel-Massler et al., 2017</xref>), MCL1 degradation by actinonin in combination with BCLXL/BCL2 inhibition by ABT-263 caused dramatic apoptosis in LNCaP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that mitochondrial stress, similarly to kinase inhibitors, increases MCL1 degradation primarily through ISR-mediated activation and NOXA-dependent MARCH5-mediated ubiquitylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>MARCH5 genomic loss in PCa</title><p>Consistent with its antiapoptotic and hence oncogenic function, the <italic>MCL1</italic> gene is frequently amplified in multiple cancers (~10% in the largest reported PCa dataset) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

One factor contributing to the lack of efficacy at lower concentrations may be that the BIM and NOXA that is displaced from MCL1 by S63845 and AZD5991 appears to undergo rapid degradation, as their levels in the treated MARCH5 depleted or MCL1 overexpressing cells were not markedly higher than in the parental control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>). Another factor may be that the high levels of NOXA and BIM in the MARCH5 depleted cells and MCL1 overexpressing cells are effectively competing with BAK for MCL1 binding, so that these cells are less dependent on MCL1 (and more dependent on other anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins) to buffer BAK. However, arguing against this latter mechanism, by coimmunoprecipitation we found that MCL1 was binding increased levels of BAK, as well as NOXA and BIM, in the MARCH5 depleted cells and the MCL1 overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Alternatively, as MCL1 has a preference for binding BAK versus BAX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Llambi et al., 2011</xref>), it is possible that the increased levels of MCL1 are adequate to neutralize BAK even at drug concentrations up to 10 μM, and that the effects at 20 μM are on-target. In support of this latter mechanism, we found that BAK was not increased in the <italic>MARCH5</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), which may allow the high levels of MCL1 to effectively buffer BAK despite treatment with S63845 or AZD5991.</p><p>In contrast to BAK, in the unactivated state BAX is localized primarily in the cytoplasm and may be buffered mostly by BCLXL and BCL2. Significantly, BAX protein expression was decreased in the <italic>MARCH5</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). The decrease in BAX after <italic>MARCH5</italic> loss (as well as the decrease in PUMA) suggested that the <italic>MARCH5</italic> knockout cells may have decreased capacity to buffer BAX and be very sensitive to acute increases in free BAX, and hence be more dependent on BCL2 or BCLXL. Therefore, we assessed responses to the BCL2/BCLXL antagonist ABT-263 (navitoclax). Significantly, ABT-263 treatment caused a marked apoptotic response specifically in the <italic>MARCH5</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). As we reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arai et al., 2018</xref>), ABT-263 could induce apoptosis in control parental cells in combination with S63845, but the addition of S63845 only minimally enhanced apoptosis in the ABT-263 treated <italic>MARCH5</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). The BCL2-specific antagonist ABT-199 (venetoclax) was not effective, indicating that the efficacy of ABT-263 is due to BCLXL inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>).</p><p>Of note, a previous study similarly found that <italic>MARCH5</italic> knockdown could increase MCL1 and sensitize to BCLXL inhibition, and suggested that increased NOXA was suppressing the antiapoptotic activity of MCL1 (47). While this increased NOXA may be a factor, our data indicate that the increased MCL1 in <italic>MARCH5</italic> knockdown cells is sequestering substantial levels of both BAK and BIM (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). To explore other mechanisms, we examined the Avana CRISPR screen dataset through the Broad DepMap site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org">https://depmap.org</ext-link>) to identify cell lines that were dependent on <italic>MARCH5</italic> and genes that have most similar patterns of dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meyers et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, the gene that was most co-dependent with <italic>MARCH5</italic> was <italic>MCL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J,K</xref>). Conversely, the gene most co-dependent with MCL1 was MARCH5. This strong co-dependency was also observed in screens with another CRISPR library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B,C</xref>). Based on these results and our data, we suggest that MARCH5, while acting as a ubiquitin ligase for NOXA-liganded MCL1, may also have a distinct function in conjunction with MCL1 to suppress mitochondrial membrane permeabilization by BAX.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We reported previously that treatment with several kinase inhibitors could markedly increase MCL1 degradation, and that this increase was not mediated by well-established MCL1 ubiquitin ligases including βTRCP, FBW7, HUWE1 (22). In this study we initially found that erlotinib treatment rapidly increased expression of NOXA, and that the increased MCL1 degradation was NOXA-dependent. We subsequently found that the increase in NOXA was driven by ISR activation, with subsequent increase in ATF4 protein and NOXA transcription. Previous studies have shown that NOXA binding can increase the degradation of MCL1 (39), and have implicated the ubiquitin ligases HUWE1 or PARKIN in this degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gomez-Bougie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Warr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carroll et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we identified the mitochondria-associated ubiquitin ligase MARCH5 as the primary mediator of this kinase inhibitor initiated NOXA-dependent MCL1 degradation. Significantly, MARCH5 depletion both abrogated the decrease in MCL1 in response to erlotinib and substantially increased basal MCL1 in multiple prostate, breast, and lung cancer cell lines, indicating that MARCH5 makes a major contribution to regulating basal levels of MCL1. The physiological significance of <italic>MARCH5</italic> as a tumor suppressor gene through regulation of MCL1 is further supported by its genomic loss in a subset of cancers. Importantly, MARCH5 depleted cells, which have increased levels of both MCL1 and NOXA, have increased sensitivity to MCL1 antagonists (although at high concentrations that may have off-target effects) and to the BH3 mimetic drug navitoclax (due to targeting BCLXL), suggesting therapeutic approaches for MARCH5-deficient tumors.</p><p>The ISR with increased translation of ATF4 can be driven by multiple stimuli that converge on phosphorylation of eIF2α, with subsequent increased translation of ATF4 and increased expression of many genes that can contribute to resolving metabolic stress or driving apoptosis. Importantly, the precise downstream consequences of ISR activation are context dependent, but apoptosis is usually induced after prolonged stress and mediated by ATF4 induction of CHOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corazzari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iurlaro and Muñoz-Pinedo, 2016</xref>). However, ATF4 has been reported to directly upregulate the <italic>PMAIP1</italic> gene (encoding NOXA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armstrong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), which would be consistent with the rapid time course of NOXA induction that correlated with increased ATF4. The prominence of this ATF4 induction of NOXA in response to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors may reflect interactions between multiple pathways downstream of these receptors. However, as these kinase inhibitors are ATP analogues, we cannot rule out off target effects on some ATP-dependent processes. Indeed, treatment with erlotinib or lapatinib rapidly increased basal oxygen consumption, indicating a shift from fermentation to oxidative phosphorylation to increase ATP synthesis, and a metabolic stress that may contribute to ISR activation. Moreover, ISR stimulation in this case appears to be mediated by both PERK and GCN2, consistent with a broad metabolic stress affecting several cellular processes.</p><p>NOXA binding to MCL1 appears to stabilize a conformation that can drive its interaction with ubiquitin ligases including HUWE1 and, as shown in this study, with MARCH5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gomez-Bougie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guikema et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Song et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, the finding that MARCH5 depletion prevented the degradation of MCL1 in response to NOXA induction indicates that MARCH5 is the major ubiquitin ligase mediating NOXA-induced MCL1 degradation. We further found that MARCH5 depletion increased MCL1 in multiple cell lines, indicating that MARCH5 plays a substantial role in regulating MCL1 under basal conditions, although this may still be NOXA-dependent and could reflect constitutive levels of stress in tumor cells. This latter result is consistent with previous data from two groups showing that that MARCH5 depletion can increase MCL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cherok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Subramanian et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, and consistent with the latter study, we found that MARCH5 depletion was associated with an increase in NOXA. This increase in NOXA was not due to increased p53-mediated transcription. Instead, it reflects NOXA stabilization by MCL1 binding, as NOXA levels decreased rapidly when NOXA was competed off with an MCL1 antagonist. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that MARCH5 also indirectly regulates NOXA levels by coupling the degradation of MCL1 in MCL1-NOXA complexes to the degradation of NOXA. Finally, a very recent study found that MARCH5 is a major mediator of MCL1 and NOXA degradation in response to taxane-mediated mitotic arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haschka et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>As MARCH5 is located on the mitochondrial outer membrane, we further asked whether its degradation of MCL1 might be enhanced by drugs that perturb mitochondrial function. Indeed, we found that all three agents examined (actinonin, gamitrinib-TPP, and CPI-613) caused a MARCH5-dependent increase in MCL1 degradation. However, this did not appear to reflect a direct effect on MARCH5. It was instead associated with a stress response, with increased ATF4 and NOXA, similarly to the response to kinase inhibitors. These findings are consistent with a previous study of gamitrinib-TPP that found this agent could activate a stress response with an increase in NOXA and decrease in MCL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karpel-Massler et al., 2017</xref>). Further studies are needed to determine whether MARCH5-mediated degradation of MCL1 can be enhanced by additional agents that alter mitochondrial function through alternative mechanisms.</p><p>MCL1 is an inhibitor of apoptosis that acts by neutralizing BAK/BAX and by sequestering activators of BAK/BAX such as BIM, and by also sequestering the less potent activators NOXA and PUMA. Therefore, we anticipated that cells expressing high levels of MCL1 due to MARCH5 depletion or overexpression of ectopic MCL1 would have increased dependence on MCL1 to neutralize BAK/BAX and sequester BIM, NOXA, and PUMA. Indeed, we confirmed that MCL1 was binding increased levels of these proteins in MARCH5 knockout and MCL1 overexpressing cells, and that MCL1 antagonists could induce apoptosis in the MARCH5 knockout and MCL1 overexpressing cells, but not the control cells. However, while the apparent release of BIM and NOXA from MCL1 and their subsequent degradation were observed at relatively low concentrations of S63845 or AZD5991, the induction of apoptosis required ~20 μM of these drugs. This requirement for higher drug levels may reflect the very high levels of MCL1 and its subsequent persistent engagement of BAK, despite treatment with MCL1 antagonists.</p><p>The MARCH5 knockout cells also underwent apoptosis in response to BCLXL antagonism with ABT-263, while apoptosis in the parental cells required antagonism of both BCLXL and MCL1. A previous study similarly found that MARCH5 depletion could sensitize to ABT-263, and suggested it may be due to high levels of NOXA that are antagonizing the antiapoptotic functions of MCL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Subramanian et al., 2016</xref>). However, we found that MCL1 in MARCH5 knockout cells was binding increased BAK and BIM, as well NOXA. Alternatively, as suggested by our data, there may be a codependency between MARCH5 and MCL1 for buffering of BAX, so that BCLXL in the MARCH5 knockout cells becomes critical to suppress the activity of BAX.</p><p>While more studies are clearly needed to further define how <italic>MARCH5</italic> loss (or <italic>MCL1</italic> amplification) alters responsiveness to BH3 mimetics, this study indicates that <italic>MARCH5</italic> loss, which appears to be relatively common in PCa, confers vulnerabilities to BH3 mimetic drugs. However, challenges to exploiting these vulnerabilities include thrombocytopenia caused by BCLXL inhibition, and the possible requirement for high concentrations of MCL1 antagonists, whose toxicity profile remains to be established. Importantly, the available MCL1 antagonists are all noncovalent and stabilize MCL1, which may limit their ability to abrogate MCL1 interaction with BAK. Therefore, it is possible that antagonists that drive MCL1 degradation, possibly by mimicking the NOXA BH3 domain, might be more potent and effective. Finally, approaches that selectively cause robust ISR activation in tumor cells, with increased NOXA and MCL1 degradation, may create an exploitable therapeutic window for BCLXL antagonists.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Key resources</title><p>Key resources are listed in Key Resources Table (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>LNCaP, C4-2, PC3 and RV1 cells were cultured in RPM1640 medium (#MT10040CV, Fisher Scientific) with 10% FBS (#26140079, Fisher Scientific) and penicillin-streptomycin (100 IU/ml) (#15140122, Fisher Scientific).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Maureen Murphy as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work shows that MCL1 levels are reduced by treatment of PrCA cells with EGFR inhibitors in NOXA-dependent manner that requires the integrated stress response. Degradation of MCL1 in response to EGFRi was dependent on the MARCH5 E3 Ub ligase. Similarly, actinonin treatment to induce mitochondrial stress decreased MCL1. The authors also show that MARCH5 is lost in ~ 5% of primary PrCA and associated with poor prognosis and that MARCH5 loss and MCL1 amplification detected in ~ 10% of PrCAs appeared mutually exclusive. Finally, MARCH5 and MCL1 modulation made cells more dependent on BCLXL for survival. Overall, whereas the reviewers agreed that while the work is experimentally robust and supports the conclusions made, a number of concerns need to be addressed before the manuscript can be considered further.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please address the following critical points:</p><p>1) The novelty of the work was called into question given recent publications in the field showing MCL1 degradation by MARCH5 in a NOXA-dependent manner. Reviewers considered the induction of MARCH5 by EGFR inhibition to be the most novel aspect of the work and the authors are asked to address all of the questions raised by reviewers to expand and enhance this aspect of the work, and also to remove other data not related to how EGFR inhibition modulates NOXA, MCL1, MARCH5 and the ISR.</p><p>2) Please address the question of how EGFRi activates the ISR. Is this through PERK, GCN2 or ATF4 by some other mechanism?</p><p>3) New experiments should also include key data with additional cell lines as suggested by reviewer #2.</p><p>4) Please consider revising the title of the paper and its Abstract to reflect stronger focus on the EGFR inhibitor aspect of the studies. Please refer to comments by reviewer #3 in this regard.</p><p>5) Please also consider rewording the manuscript to make it clearer to the reader what is novel, what the key findings are and to remove those aspects found confusing by reviewers.</p><p>Without additional experiments addressing more novel aspects of the work, the manuscript will not be favorably reviewed in revisions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This work by Arai et al., shows that MCL1 levels are reduced by treatment of PrCA cells with EGFR inhibitor erlotinib in a manner dependent on its interaction with NOXA that is transcriptionally induced by erlotinib in an ATF4-dependent manner as part of the integrated stress response, and not via p53. They further show that the degradation of MCL1 in response to erlotinib and NOXA induction is dependent on the MARCH5 E3 Ub ligase, and not on other E3 UBLs previously implicated in MCL1 degradation, such as HUWE1, or by other mitochondrial UBLs such as PARKIN. This effect was specific to treatment of cells with certain kinase inhibitors and not other stresses, and was accompanied by increased levels of MCL1 and other MARCH5 targets. MARCH5 depletion also increased levels of NOXA and BIM that were protected from degradation by interaction with MCL1. Similar mechanisms operated in cells in response to mitochondrial stress inducers like actinonin. Decreased MCL1 induced by erlotinib or actinonin synergized with BH3 mimetics to induce apoptosis. Finally, the authors show that MARCH5 is lost in ~ 5% of primary PrCA and associated with poor prognosis and interestingly that MARCH5 loss and MCL1 amplification detected in ~ 10% of PrCAs may be mutually exclusive and MARCH5 and MCL1 appeared to be co-dependent in CRISPR library screens from the Broad possibly via buffering BAX and making cells more dependent on BCLXL for survival.</p><p>The quality of the data presented is strong, well controlled and overall is convincing. The major concern is with the extent to which this work moves the field forward. Novel aspects of the current work depend on showing activation of MARCH5 and NOXA by the ISR but ATF4-mediated induction of NOXA was previously shown. It is noted that a recent publication in Cell Death and Differentiation has shown that MCL1 degradation is mediated by MARCH5 in a NOXA dependent manner in response to anti-mitotics</p><p>(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32015503) and that MARCH5 regulation of MCL1 has been reported previously in other studies also:</p><p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27932492,</p><p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26910119</p><p>The work also leaves key questions unanswered such as how EGFRi increases the MARCH5 -MCL1 interaction while simultaneously increasing the MCL1NOXA interaction?

The manuscript also contains a lot of speculation on various issues that detracts from its major conclusions (for example, high concentrations of inhibitors).

However, while the ATF4 induction of NOXA has been described previously (which we reference), the acute effects of ISR and ATF4 are generally to increase chaperone and related proteins to resolve stress, with NOXA induction being described as a late event after prolonged stress. In contrast, we found that the induction of NOXA was acute and dramatic, which we believe is a novel finding and indicates that activation of the ISR in some contexts may acutely activate apoptotic versus cell survival pathways. We speculate that this may reflect effects on pathways that intersect with the ISR and modulate the function of ATF4, which is an area for further studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is noted that a recent publication in Cell Death and Differentiation has shown that MCL1 degradation is mediated by MARCH5 in a NOXA dependent manner in response to anti-mitotics</p><p>(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32015503) and that MARCH5 regulation of MCL1 has been reported previously in other studies also:</p><p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27932492,</p><p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26910119</p></disp-quote><p>We cited in the manuscript the latter two references noted above. The first was focused on mitochondrial dynamics and noted that MCL1 was increased in response to MARCH5 depletion (Reference 27932492, Novel Regulatory Roles of Mff and Drp1 in E3 Ubiquitin Ligase MARCH5-dependent Degradation of MiD49 and Mcl1 and Control of Mitochondrial Dynamics). The second study found that MARCH5 depletion could increase both NOXA and MCL1 and sensitize to ABT-737, targeting BCLXL (Reference 26910119, Inhibition of MARCH5 Ubiquitin Ligase Abrogates MCL1-dependent Resistance to BH3 Mimetics via NOXA). It should also be noted that previous studies that we cited have shown that NOXA can bind to MCL1 and enhance MCL1 degradation, and suggest that this is by some mechanism coupled to the degradation of NOXA. Our results are certainly consistent with these previous findings, but are distinct as they establish MARCH5 as the primary ubiquitin ligase regulating MCL1 levels in response to cellular stress. This is significant as multiple ubiquitin ligases have been reported to mediate the degradation of MCL1, but it appears that they each may function to regulate MCL1 in specific contexts or in response to particular perturbations. Related to this theme, the first reference noted above by the reviewer (Reference 32015503, MARCH5-dependent Degradation of MCL1/NOXA Complexes Defines Susceptibility to Antimitotic Drug Treatment) indicates that MARCH5 is a major mediator of MCL1 degradation during mitotic arrest. This study came out subsequent to our submission, and we now cite it in the revised manuscript as a second context in which MARCH5 functions as a major regulator of MCL1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The work also leaves key questions unanswered such as how EGFRi increases the MARCH5 -MCL1 interaction while simultaneously increasing the MCL1NOXA interaction? Is this happening at the mitochondria? The authors would do well to perform cell staining for mitochondria and additional assays to assess how MARCH5 is affecting mitochondrial function, especially since MARCH5 has also been implicated in mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy which is not addressed here as a means to explaining how MARCH5 may affect tumor cell sensitivity to BH3 mimetics etc. Given that MCL1 itself affects mitochondrial respiration, these analyses are important.</p></disp-quote><p>We are in complete agreement with the reviewer that mitochondrial dynamics may modulate the interaction between MARCH5 and MCL1. To address this issue we carried out a series of studies (shown in Figure 4) to address whether erlotinib altered MARCH5 expression, phosphorylation, or activity (based on levels of the MARCH5 substrate MiD49), whether it altered mitochondrial association of MARCH5 or MCL1, and whether it altered mitochondrial function. As shown in Figure 4, we could not detect any alterations in MARCH5, but did find that erlotinib (and lapatinib) caused an increase in basal oxygen consumption (Figure 4G, I). Therefore, we carried out parallel studies to determine whether directly perturbing mitochondrial function would drive MARC5 dependent degradation of MCL1. As shown in Figure 5, we found that three different mitochondrial targeted drugs rapidly decreased MCL1. However, similarly to the effect of erlotinib, this was mediated by ISR activation and increased NOXA. Based on these findings, we conclude that MARCH5 is not being altered by erlotinib or ISR activation, and that its increased degradation of MCL1 is being driven by increased NOXA binding to MCL1. Importantly, NOXA binding to MCL1 appears to stabilize a conformational of MCL1 that has been reported to enhance binding to HUWE1, and we hypothesize that this conformational change is the basis for the increased interaction with MARCH5 (which our study indicates to be the major ubiquitin ligase recognizing this conformation).</p><p>While we believe that the above explanation partially addressed the reviewer’s comments (explains the basis for increased MCL1 binding to MARCH5), we agree that there is a broader question of how MARCH5 affects tumor cell sensitivity to BH3 mimetics, and to apoptosis in general. MARCH5 regulation of MCL1 is certainly one factor, but given the established role of MARCH5 in mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy, it is likely that MARCH5 has additional roles in apoptosis. Indeed, it is highly significant that MARCH5 depletion, although causing an increase in MCL1, sensitizes tumor cells to BCLXL inhibition. We suggest in that this reflects a distinct function of MARCH5 (or possibly MARCH5 associated with MCL1) in preventing mitochondrial accumulation of BAX. We are pursuing this area, which we believe will yield additional novel and significant insights, but this is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript investigates the mechanistic basis for egfr inhibition dependent MCL1 degradation, finding that EGFR inhibition upregulates the BH3-only protein NOXA dependent on the integrated stress response (ISR), this in turn leads to MCL1 degradation dependent on the mitochondrial E3 ligase March5.

We had shown in the supplemental data that MARCH5 depletion increases MCL1 in multiple cell lines (Figure 3—figure supplement 1G-L). We also showed the MARCH5 dependency for MCL1 degradation in response to erlotinib in PC3 cells as well as in LNCaP cells.

Our approach was to directly assess for effects on MARCH5 in Figure 4 (expression, phosphorylation, and activity), and to determine whether perturbing mitochondrial dynamics with mitochondrial-targeting agents would similarly enhance MCL1 degradation (Figure 5). We found that these latter agents did indeed drive MARCH5 dependent MCL1 degradation, but it was due to induction of an ISR rather than through a direct effect on MARCH5. Of note, while ISR activation through PERK reflects ER stress, the ISR can be activated by other mechanisms and there are increasing data linking mitochondrial stress to the ISR. Based on these considerations, we believe that the mitochondrial-targeting agent data do provide significant insight and should be retained.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript also contains a lot of speculation on various issues that detracts from its major conclusions (for example, high concentrations of inhibitors).

As noted by the reviewer, we did cite and discuss this study in the Results and Discussion sections, as its findings were significant and clearly related to our study.

Therefore, while the title suggested by the reviewer would encompass our findings, we would be concerned that it would suggest that the major focus is on EGFR inhibitors.

Alterations in ATP binding and metabolic shifts as above could in principal have effects on ATP dependent processes in the ER or cytosol. To further address the mechanism, and in particular whether the ISR is being activated through PERK or GCN2, we used siRNA targeting PERK or GCN2, or both in combination, and determined whether these treatments impaired the downregulation of MCL1 in response to erlotinib. As shown in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1, siRNA targeting PERK or GCN2 did not prevent the erlotinib-mediated decrease in MCL1, but the combined siRNA did prevent the decrease in MCL1. Based on these data, in the revised text we now suggest that erlotinib is impacting ATP dependent functions in both the ER and cytosol.</p></body></sub-article></article>
