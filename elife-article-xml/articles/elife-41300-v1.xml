The raw sequencing data had been inadvertently mapped onto the wrong strand. We corrected the mapping and deposited the corrected file on GEO (GSE76444_TotalmRNA_counts_raw_txt.gz). The numbers presented in the Venn diagrams in Figure 1D and the total RNAseq hits list in Supplementary File 3 were corrected. The analyses of the total RNAseq data in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D-1G were performed with the new hit list and amended. We have updated the text relating to Figure 1D to”mRNAs that were upregulated upon glucose starvation, as determined by total RNA-Seq, were by and large not enriched in the corresponding fraction of the P-body components. Less than 16% overlap was observed between mRNAs generally upregulated in stress response and those pulled down by P-body components (Figure 1D). This exclusive enrichment was less pronounced for the hyperosmotic stresses. The new Figure 1, Figure 1—figure Supplement 1 and Supplementary file 3 are provided with this correction. The corrections do not change any of the conclusions of the manuscript. We apologize for the mistake.</p><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-41300-supp3-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><p>The corrected Figure 1 is shown here:</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-41300-fig1-v1"/></fig><p>The originally published Figure 1 is also shown for reference:</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41300-fig2-v1"/></fig><p>The corrected Figure 1—figure supplement 1 is shown here:</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-41300-fig3-v1"/></fig><p>The originally published Figure 1—figure supplement 1 is also shown for reference:</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41300-fig4-v1"/></fig><p>The article has been corrected accordingly.</p></body></article>
