We performed CRISPR-Cas9 screens in a leukemia cell line to identify perturbations that enhance natural killer effector functions. Our screens defined critical components of the tumor-immune synapse and highlighted the importance of cancer cell interferon-γ signaling in modulating NK activity. Surprisingly, disrupting the ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor DCAF15 strongly sensitized cancer cells to NK-mediated clearance. DCAF15 disruption induced an inflamed state in leukemic cells, including increased expression of lymphocyte costimulatory molecules. Proteomic and biochemical analysis revealed that cohesin complex members were endogenous client substrates of DCAF15. Genetic disruption of DCAF15 was phenocopied by treatment with indisulam, an anticancer drug that functions through DCAF15 engagement. In AML patients, reduced DCAF15 expression was associated with improved survival. These findings suggest that DCAF15 inhibition may have useful immunomodulatory properties in the treatment of myeloid neoplasms.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47362.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human immune system can recognize and kill cancer cells growing in the body.

Treatment with ‘checkpoint inhibitors,’ antibodies targeting PD1, PD-L1, or CTLA4, lead to durable responses across a wide range of indications, but only in a subset of patients. Treatment response is positively correlated with tumor mutational burden and infiltration of CD8+ effector T cells, which recognize tumor cells via peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules, suggesting that checkpoint inhibitors work best at clearing highly immunogenic cancers with repressed T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Snyder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tumeh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mariathasan et al., 2018</xref>). Substantial efforts are being made to extend the benefits of immunotherapy to additional patients, including combining checkpoint inhibitors with other therapies, drugging additional lymphocyte-suppressive pathways, and boosting the activity of other arms of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galon and Bruni, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Resistance to therapy has long been a major problem in cancer treatment. Drugs targeting tumor growth pathways can profoundly reduce tumor burden, but resistance invariably arises, driven by the substantial genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity present within human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Easwaran et al., 2014</xref>). Recent clinical and experimental data have similarly highlighted the ability of cancer cells to escape checkpoint inhibitor-induced immune control. B2M and JAK1/2 mutations have been identified in melanoma patients with acquired resistance to checkpoint inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zaretsky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sade-Feldman et al., 2017</xref>). These mutations impair recognition of the tumor by the adaptive immune system, either by directly disrupting antigen presentation or by rendering the cells insensitive to IFNγ, an important inducer of MHC-I expression. Functional genetic screens using T cell-cancer cell cocultures have highlighted similar mechanisms of resistance in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kearney et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manguso et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Patel et al., 2017</xref>). Even treatment-naïve tumors can be highly immuno-edited, presenting with IFNγ pathway mutations, reduced MHC-I expression and loss of the peptide sequences that can serve as antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rodig et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McGranahan et al., 2017</xref>). Together, these findings highlight a critical need for therapies that can either increase MHC expression or work in a MHC-independent fashion.</p><p>Anti-tumor immunity is not solely mediated by the adaptive immune compartment. Innate immune cells, most notably natural killer (NK) cells, can have both direct tumoricidal activity and also help to fully elaborate long-lasting anti-tumor responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marcus et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moynihan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lopez-Soto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiossone et al., 2018</xref>). NK cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes capable of mounting rapid responses to damaged, infected, or stressed cells, including cancer cells. T and NK cells share effector functions, releasing cytokines and exocytosing lytic granules upon activation to kill target cells. However, NK activation status is controlled by the integrated signals from germline-encoded NK-activating and -inhibiting receptors (aNKRs/iNKRs). Generally, iNKR ligands are expressed by normal and healthy cells, whereas aNKR ligands are upregulated after DNA damage or viral insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiossone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ljunggren and Malmberg, 2007</xref>). MHC-I molecules provide a potent inhibitory signal sensed by NK cells, enabling the innate immune system to respond productively to MHC-deficient cells. As a result, there is considerable interest in amplifying NK responses to cancers, as well as developing NK-based cell therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lopez-Soto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiossone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ljunggren and Malmberg, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Here, we performed genetic screens in an MHC-deficient leukemic cell line to systematically identify modulators of NK-mediated anti-cancer immunity. These screens, unexpectedly, revealed the potential therapeutic utility of targeting the cullin4-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4) substrate adaptor DCAF15 in myeloid malignancies. Disruption of DCAF15 strongly sensitized cancer cells to NK-mediated killing, resulting from increased cancer cell expression of lymphocyte costimulatory molecules. Proteomic experiments revealed that DCAF15 interacted with and promoted the ubiqitination of the cohesin complex members. Treatment with indisulam, an anticancer drug that modulates DCAF15 function, reduced interaction with cohesin members and mimicked DCAF15 loss-of-function immunophenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A genome-scale CRISPR screen identifies modulators of NK effector functions</title><p>We performed genome-scale CRISPR screens in K562 cells to identify perturbations that modulate NK-92-mediated killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

IL-2 was removed during the co-culture to promote the eventual death of NK-92 cells, allowing the collection of genomic DNA preparations undiluted by effector cell DNA.

Seven days post-infection, cells were either grown normally or challenged with NK-92 cells at a 1:1 or 2.5:1 E:T ratio, reducing K562 cell counts 19-fold or 43-fold, respectively, by the end of the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Deep sequencing was used to compare changes in sgRNA abundance between the challenged and unchallenged state after 8 days of co-culture, and genes were ranked using the MAGeCK software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2014</xref>). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) There was good agreement between the results from screens performed at the different E:T ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The screen revealed two broad classes of ‘hits’— sgRNAs targeting components of the tumor-immune synapse or components of the IFNγ signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). Disruption of ICAM1 was the top-ranked NK-92 evasion mechanism, scoring many orders of magnitude stronger than any other gene—an observation consistent with the critical role of ICAM1-LFA1 interactions in establishing initial target-lymphocyte adhesion and polarizing cytotoxic granules towards the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marcus et al., 2014</xref>). Single guide RNAs targeting multiple other tumor-immune synapse components were also enriched after NK-92 challenge, including NCR3LG1 (#26-ranked gene by MaGeCK score), the activating ligand for NKP30 on NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandt et al., 2009</xref>); CD58 (#37), an adhesion molecule that binds CD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Selvaraj et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rölle et al., 2016</xref>); and CD84 (#80), a SLAM-related receptor that binds homotypically to promote activation and cytokine secretion in lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Veillette, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Other than NECTIN2, sgRNAs targeting NK-inhibitory surface proteins did not score prominently as NK-sensitization mechanisms, consistent with the weak MHC-I expression on K562 cells and the limited repertoire of NK inhibitory receptors expressed on NK-92 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maki et al., 2001</xref>). NECTIN2 transmits both stimulatory or inhibitory signals to NK cells, depending on whether it is bound to DNAM1 (CD226) or TIGIT, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stanietsky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bottino, 2003</xref>).</p><p>After ICAM1, the top 10 highest scoring NK-92 evasion mechanisms were dominated by sgRNAs targeting the proximal components of the IFNγ signaling pathway, including STAT1, JAK1, IFNGR2, JAK2 and INFGR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Consistent with the importance of cancer cell IFNγ signaling, sgRNAs targeting negative regulators of the interferon response were strongly depleted after NK-92 challenge. Disruption of the protein tyrosine phosphatases PTPN2 and PTPN1 were the #2 and #5 ranked NK-92 -sensitizing mechanisms, respectively. Presumably, these proteins suppress IFNγ-induced immunomodulation by dephosphorylating STAT and JAK proteins, as has been reported in CRISPR screens using T-cell coculture systems or syngeneic tumor models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manguso et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that our in vitro functional genomics screens effectively revealed known components of physiologically-relevant immune synapse and cytokine pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Prospective identification of novel genes affecting sensitization to NK cells</title><p>Mechanisms of NK-92 sensitization identified in the screen were diverse, revealing many strongly-scoring genes not previously linked to either interferon signaling or NK cell biology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Most surprisingly, the top-ranked mechanism for promoting NK-92 mediated clearance was disruption of DCAF15, an uncharacterized substrate adaptor for CRL4 ubiquitin E3 ligases. DCAF15 is a member of the large family of DDB1 and Cul4-associated factors (DCAFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jin et al., 2006</xref>). CRL4 complexes enable cells to mark proteins for proteosomal degradation, helping regulate intracellular protein homeostasis. As substrate adaptors for CRL4, DCAF proteins provide specificity to the complex, determining which client proteins are ubiquitinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jackson and Xiong, 2009</xref>).

DCAF15 KO cells showed a 17 ± 8% increased ability to trigger NK-92 cells and were approximately twice as sensitive to CD80 antagonism compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>). Following CD80 antagonism, degranulation triggered by DCAF15 KO was not significantly different from untreated control cells. Taken together, these results indicate that DCAF15 disruption in K562 cells induces an APC-like immunophenotype conducive to promoting lymphocyte responses, with higher CD80 expression especially important for increased NK-92 cell triggering.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The anti-leukemia drug indisulam inhibits DCAF15 function</title><p>Aryl sulfonamide drugs have demonstrated promising anti-cancer properties in hematological malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assi et al., 2018</xref>).

We confirmed the interaction between DCAF15-BioID and endogenous SMC1 and 3 by streptavidin-pulldown followed by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). To determine whether this association with cohesin was a generic feature of CRL4 complexes or specific to the CRL4 loaded with DCAF15, we examined the interaction partners of a different substrate adaptor. DCAF16 is a nuclear-localized CUL4 substrate adaptor, which, like DCAF15, interacts with DDB1 despite lacking a canonical WD40 docking domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jin et al., 2006</xref>). When stably expressed in K562 cells, DCAF16-BioID fusions accumulated similarly to DCAF15-BioID, interacted with DDB1 but did not biotinylate SMC proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). As low concentrations of indisulam phenocopy certain aspects of DCAF15 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we asked whether indisulam treatment would alter the interaction of DCAF15 with cohesin. DCAF15-BioID cells were pre-treated with indisulam for 72 hr prior to biotin and MG132 addition. This treatment regime lead to substantial indisulam-dependent biotinylation of RBM39 and reduced recovery of biotinylated SMC proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>To test whether DCAF15 promoted SMC1 ubiquitination, we co-transfected 293 T cells with his-tagged ubiquitin, DCAF15 and SMC1A, and purified ubiquitinated species under denaturing conditions by nickel affinity chromatography.

We performed CRISPR-Cas9 screens using NK-92:K562 co-cultures to uncover perturbations that enhance natural killer mediated anti-cancer immunity. We discovered and characterized how disruption of DCAF15 or PTPN2 sensitizes a variety of cancer cell types to both NK-92 and primary NK cells. In addition, the screens clearly identified known lymphocyte adhesion factors and aNKR/iNKR ligands, such as ICAM1, NCR3LG1, CD58, CD84 and NECTIN2. Performing additional genetic screens on diverse cancer cell lines and natural killer subtypes will enable a more complete understanding of the relative importance of various aNKRs and iNKRs and should identify novel immunotherapeutic targets.</p><p>There was a strong IFNγ signature within our NK-92:K562 screens. We determined that disruption of PTPN2, a negative regulator of IFNγ signaling, consistently enhanced NK cell sensitivity. Interestingly, preventing cancer cell IFNγ signaling had a much more variable effect than removing negative feedback on the pathway, promoting resistance or sensitization to NK cells in target and effector cell dependent manner. This variability likely reflects the complexity of cancer cell IFNγ signaling, which can include MHC upregulation, growth suppression and immunomodulation.</p><p>In K562 cells, PTPN2 KO rendered IFNγ treatment growth suppressive, likely through the induction of apoptosis, while also enhancing the immunomodulatory effects of the cytokine. The immunophenotypic changes include enhanced MHC-I expression, which likely inhibits full activation of NK cell cytotoxicity, especially in primary NK cells that express a broader KIR repertoire than NK-92 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maki et al., 2001</xref>). PTPN2 disruption has previously been shown to enhance activated T-cell mediated killing, as well as potentiate the effect of immunotherapy in syngeneic tumor models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manguso et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luo et al., 2018</xref>). These data suggest that targeting PTPN2 may be a generalizable strategy to sensitize tumor cells to multiple arms of the immune system.</p><p>The importance of the cancer cell IFNγ response prompted us to systemically identify perturbations that modulated IFNγ signaling, as read out by cytokine-induced MHC-I upregulation. As expected, this screen clearly delineated the proximal components of the IFNγ-JAK-STAT pathway, as well as the antigen processing/presentation machinery. Surprisingly, disruption of DCAF15, a poorly characterized substrate adaptor for the CRL4 E3 ligase, was a top scoring hit in both the MHC-I and NK screens. We therefore focused our efforts on understanding the role of DCAF15 in this context. We determined that DCAF15 KO cells did not have a grossly dysregulated response to IFNγ, but scored in the MHC-I screen due to higher unstimulated levels of MHC-I. This change reflected a broader phenotypic switch in DCAF15 KO cells reminiscent of APC activation, including the upregulation of a variety of co-stimulatory and antigen-presenting molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Higher CD80 levels in DCAF15 KO cells were especially important for increasing NK-92 cell triggering. Cross-talk between APCs and NK cells is a well-established phenomenon that mutually regulates both cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferlazzo and Münz, 2004</xref>). These interactions, which often occur at sites of inflammation or secondary lymphoid organs, can promote APC maturation or lysis in a context-dependent fashion. Further work is needed to determine whether DCAF15 plays a role in the activation of APCs and their interactions with NK cells.</p><p>Our data suggest that the surface factors upregulated by DCAF15 disruption are not direct client proteins of the substrate receptor, but rather represent events secondary to altered turnover of the normal DCAF15 client protein(s). We pioneered a novel approach to systemically purify substrates of DCAF family members, as conventional biochemical methods are poorly suited to recover the transient, low-affinity interactions between substrate adaptors and client proteins. The use of DCAF-BioID fusion proteins and proteasome inhibition protects labile substrates from degradation and robustly recovers biotinylated proteins under stringent, denaturing conditions. We anticipate this will be a generalizable strategy for discovering client proteins for the whole family of CUL4 CRL substrate receptors.</p><p>Proteomic analysis and subsequent validation experiments showed that DCAF15 loaded into CLR4 complexes, interacted with cohesin complex members SMC1 and SMC3, and promoted their ubiquitination. We were intrigued by these interactions given the similar CRISPR screening scoring pattern of DCAF15 to the cohesin factors STAG2 and HDAC8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>); the shared roles of cohesin and CRL4 E3 ligases in DNA metabolism, organization, replication and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Uhlmann, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">O'Connell and Harper, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Litwin et al., 2018</xref>); and the ability of cohesin mutations to dysregulate hematopoietic differentiation in myeloid malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mazumdar and Majeti, 2017</xref>). Rather than globally controlling SMC protein levels, we speculate that CRL4-DCAF15 complexes ubiquitinate cohesin at specific genomic sites to regulate chromatin topology or repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). In this model, disruption of either STAG2, HDAC8 or DCAF15 impair cohesin function with overlapping phenotypic consequences. Further work is needed to elaborate the control of cohesin function by DCAF15 and how this may promote APC-like differentiation.</p><p>Recently, it was discovered that aryl sulfonamide drugs including indisulam are capable of binding to DCAF15 and altering CRL-DCAF15 substrate specificity towards the splicing factor RBM39 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Uehara et al., 2017</xref>). The cytotoxic effects of indisulam were driven by splicing defects resulting from RBM39 degradation. Our studies confirmed indisulam-induced RBM39 degradation and the indisulam-dependent interaction between DCAF15 and RBM39. We also discovered indisulam-induced phenotypes attributable to inhibition of DCAF15’s normal functions. Concentrations of indisulam with limited RBM39 degradation or cytotoxicity had immunomodulatory properties that phenocopied genetic DCAF15 disruption. Biochemically, the recruitment of endogenous client proteins to CRL4-DCAF15 and subsequent ubiquitination was impaired by indisulam treatment. We also determined that AML patients with naturally occurring lower levels of DCAF15 had improved overall survival. While these clinical data are preliminary in nature, they provide a rationale for drugging DCAF15 in myeloid neoplasms, achieved through judicious dosing of existing anti-cancer sulfonamides or the development of pure DCAF15 inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>All cell lines were purchased from ATCC and were tested monthly for mycoplasma contamination.

Cells were incubated overnight in viral supernatant prior to being pooled, spun down to remove virions, and returned to spinner-flask culture (Bell-Flo Flask, Bellco Glass Inc). 24 to 48 hr post-infection, 2 μg/ml puromycin selection was started for four days. Cells were maintained in log-growth phase with a minimal representation of 500 M cells. Seven days post guide-infection, NK cell challenge was initiated. For the 2.5:1 E:T challenge, 100M K562 cells were mixed with 250M NK-92 cells in 1L of Myelocult, and split across 25 177 cm<sup>2</sup> dishes. For the 1:1 E:T challenge, 100M K562 cells were mixed with 100M NK-92 cells in 400mls of Myelocult, and split across 10 177 cm<sup>2</sup> dishes. As a control, K562 cells were continuously propagated in RPMI media. 2 days after initiating the NK-92 challenge, the co-culture was switched to RPMI media. NK-92 cells, when grown in RPMI without IL-2, are rapidly lost from the culture. Six days after the media switch, 100 M cell pellets were generated for library construction. All cell pellets were stored cryopreserved in cell-freezing media (Gibco #12648).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>MHC-I screen</title><p>Generation of K562 cells expressing the sgRNA library was performed as described above. On day 8 post-guide infection, 150 M cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml IFNγ (R and D Systems 285-IF). 24 hr later, cells were spun down, washed, and stained in 3mls of 1:200 anti-HLA ABC-APC (W6/32 clone, BioLegend) in PBS, 2% FBS for 30 min at 4°C. Approximately, 10M of the brightest 20% and dimmest 20% of cells were sorted (BD FACSAria Fusion). Cell purity was determined to be &gt;95% by re-analysis post-sorting.

Protospacer libraries were generated by a two-step PCR strategy, modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Overbeek et al. (2016)</xref>. In the first round of PCR, 150 μg of gDNA (equivalent to 15M K562 cells and 125-fold coverage of the library) was used in a 7.5 ml PCR reaction to amplify the protospacers. This reaction was performed using a 500 nM mixture of primers containing 0–9 bp staggers, to ensure base-pair diversity during Illumina sequencing (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). The reaction was performed with Phusion master mix (New England Biolabs) and 3% DMSO with the following cycling conditions: one cycle X 30 s at 98°C, 21 cycles X 15 s at 98°C, 20 s at 63°C, 15 s at 72°C, one cycle X 2 min at 72°C. In the second round of PCR, 4 μl of the initial PCR product was used as the template in a 200 μl PCR reaction to make the sample compatible with Illumina chemistry and to add unique I5 and I7 barcodes to the sample. The reaction was performed with Phusion master mix (New England Biolabs), 500 nM primers and 3% DMSO with the following cycling conditions: one cycle X 30 s at 98°C, 12 cycles X 15 s 98°C, 20 s at 60°C, 15 s at 72°C, one cycle X 2 min at 72°C. The library was size-selected first by a 1:1 SPRI bead selection (AMPure XP beads, Beckman Coulter), quantified by high-sensitivity dsDNA Qubit (ThermoFisher Scientific), and pooled. An agarose size selection step (PippinHT, Sage Science) was performed prior to sequencing on an Illumina Hiseq4000.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Screen analysis</title><p>Libraries were sequenced to a depth of ~20 million reads per condition. Reads were aligned to the sgRNA library using bowtie2. Protospacer count tables were generated from these alignments with python scripts and processed with MAGeCK. MAGeCK analysis was used to score and prioritize sgRNAs, using default settings in the algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2014</xref>). A subset of genes, mostly from highly related gene families, have more than six sgRNAs targeting them. As the MAGeCK scoring method tends to prioritize consistency of effect over magnitude of effect, genes with more than six guides targeting them were excluded from the analysis. MAGeCK scores were -log10 normalized, and values were plotted against FDR values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>NK-92 competitive co-culture assay</title><p>Cas9-expressing K562 or Daudi cells were transduced at a high MOI with a lentiviral sgRNA construct expressing the guide of interest, puromycin resistance and CMV promoter-driven expression of either a red or green fluorescent protein.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors employed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 pooled sgRNA screen to identify genes that impact the susceptibility of the K562 cell line to NK-cells in a co-culture assay. Following infection with a genome-scale single guide RNA (sgRNA) library, Cas9-expressing K562 cells were challenged with NK-cell line in vitro or left to grow without challenge. A population of leukemic cancer cells that survived the NK-cell challenge, as well as control cells, were assessed for sgRNA abundance. This analysis revealed two sets of genes, inactivation of which either significantly enhanced or diminished the sensitivity of K562 cell line to NK-cell challenge. These two gene sets were comprised of genes involved in (1) formation of tumor immune synapses or (2) IFNγ signaling pathway. The most significantly enriched target in K562 population following NK-cell challenge was ICAM1, whereas the most significantly depleted target in K562 population following NK-cell challenge was the cullin4-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4) substrate adaptor DCAF15. Further experiments confirmed that the disruption of this protein led to an increase in activating molecules such as CD80, but also inhibitory molecules such as MHC I. Since the effector cells were NK-92, the investigators saw an overall increase in NK-92 activity against the target cells, dependent on DCAF15 activity. Furthermore, the investigators presented data on novel substrates of DCAF15. They also provide first evidence between a link of DCAF15 and the cohesion complex. Ultimately, the study presented how the use of an unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 screen can lead to potential new therapies based on the discovery of unique proteins involved in immune surveillance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All experiments including the CRISPR screen have been performed with NK92 cells, which do not recapitulate all features of primary NK cells. The authors should at least include primary NK cells to investigate the functional relevance of the proposed mechanism as validation (experiments shown in Figure 3B-C, Figure 4C, 4E). NK-92 cells are very different from primary fresh or activated NK cells, and therefore modulating the expression of DCAF15 may not even be relevant in clinical settings. This would increase the validity of the suggestion that DCAF inhibition may have immunomodulatory properties. The authors claim that the DCAF15 KO phenotype is dependent on CD80 upregulation and a more APC like state of K562s, which promotes NK92 activation. This mechanism should be validated for primary NK cells. Is CD28 really expressed on human NK cells and is this mechanism then relevant? Can the authors speculate if DCAF15 may play a role in bona fide APCs for regulating NK cell activation during immune responses?</p><p>2) Authors validate that indisulam-induced CD80 upregulation can also be achieved in other cell lines in addition to K562s. It should be tested if CD80 upregulation by indisulam treatment and/or by DCAF15 KO also makes these additional cell lines (Daudi and Ku812 cells) more sensitive to NK92 killing. What about CD33? This is also a top hit and antibodies are available – can that be used as control?</p><p>3) The authors identify ICAM1 and components of the IFNγ pathway as top hits as genes whose loss promote resistance of K562s towards NK92-mediated attack. These findings contrast recent data available on bioRxiv from a similar K562 CRISPR screen performed with primary NK cells (Klein et al., 2019), where B7H6 (NCR3LG1) was found as a single dominant hit in a comparable setting. B7H6 however only scored as #26 in their screen. This may indicate differences in K562-related resistance mechanisms against the functionally restricted NK cell line NK92 in contrast to primary NK cells. This must be at least discussed and further emphasizes the necessity to validate the outcome of the study with NK92 in a primary NK cell setting.</p><p>4) PTPN2 and DCAF15 knockout results in upregulation of MHC-I (Figure 4A), but still enhances NK cell killing, which is counterintuitive and against the dogma that low MHCI promotes NK cell cytotoxicity (missing self). This discrepancy should at least be discussed in more detail. Please also include a discussion on Dufva et al., 2018, where the expected effect that loss of IFN signaling enhanced tumor cell lysis is described. NK92 cells have restricted KIR expression, this may explain the reduced sensitivity towards MHC-I-mediated inhibition. Under this NK92 specific conditions further NK-cell activating effects of IFNγ may dominate in contrast to the situation in primary NK cells. These potential differences between NK92 and primary NK cells must be validated in more depth.</p><p>5) The authors do not provide/discuss a potential mechanism of how loss of IFNγ responsiveness in their screen promotes NK cell resistance. They exclude a direct cytostatic/cytotoxic effect of IFNγ. May that be related to a suppression of the proposed APC-like state of K562, associated with lower CD80 etc. levels?

The authors should at least include primary NK cells to investigate the functional relevance of the proposed mechanism as validation (experiments shown in Figure 3B-C, Figure 4C, 4E). NK-92 cells are very different from primary fresh or activated NK cells, and therefore modulating the expression of DCAF15 may not even be relevant in clinical settings. This would increase the validity of the suggestion that DCAF inhibition may have immunomodulatory properties.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that performing experiments with human PBMC-derived NK cells is important. While NK-92 cells display hallmark functions of conventional NK cells, including the rapid production of IFNγ following stimulation and the ability to mediate cellular cytotoxicity Freud et al., 2017, it is reasonable to expect a subset of the biology discovered in NK-92 screens will be NK-92 specific. We do note that many of the strongly scoring sensitization (NECTIN2) and resistance (ICAM1, B7H6, CD58, CD84) factors we discovered using NK-92 cells have previously been shown to modulate primary NK function (see Marcus et al., 2014; Brandt et al., 2009; Selvaraj et al., 1987; Rolle et al., 2016; Martin et al., 2001; Veillette, 2006; Wang et al., 2010; Stanietsky et al., 2009; Bottino et al.,), suggesting the screening system is useful for uncovering NK biology.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s comment, we tested NK cells derived from 6 different human donors. NK cells were isolated from PBMCs by negative selection, activated by 1000U/ml IL-2 overnight and challenged in competitive co-cultures with various K562 KO cell genotypes. Poststimulation, peripheral NK cells were &gt;97% CD56+ CD3- and displayed markers of activation (CD69+ CD25+).</p><p>In this context, disruption of DCAF15 or PTPN2 promoted sensitization to primary NK cells, albeit with weaker effect compared to NK-92 cells. ICAM1 disruption promoted resistance to NK cell attack but did not confer complete protection. The effect of STAT1 disruption varied across donors, with STAT1 KO K562 cells strongly preferentially killed by primary NK cells from a subset of donors.</p><p>We also assessed the extent to which K562 DCAF15 KO cells promoted primary NK cell triggering. We found that 3 out of 6 donors exhibited significantly more degranulation when challenged by DCAF15 KO cells rather than control cells. Altogether, these findings support the relevance of DCAF15 inhibition as an immunomodulatory target.</p><p>We have revised the manuscript to incorporate the data from primary NK cells (Figure 3E-F and Figure 3—figure supplement 2). We have also explicitly stated in the manuscript which experiments were performed with NK-92 cells and which were performed with primary NK cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1b) The authors claim that the DCAF15 KO phenotype is dependent on CD80 upregulation and a more APC like state of K562s, which promotes NK92 activation. This mechanism should be validated for primary NK cells. Is CD28 really expressed on human NK cells and is this mechanism then relevant?</p></disp-quote><p>There is extensive literature support for the enhanced primary NK cell killing of cells transduced with CD80 or CD86 Townsend and Allison 1993; Chen et al., 1992; Wilson et al. 1999; Galea-Lauri et al., 1999; Chambers, Salcedo and Ljunggren, 1996; Azuma etal., 1992; Martin-Fontecha et al., 1999). In contrast, the role of CD28 in this process is controversial, with suggestions that CD28-dependent and -independent mechanisms may be involved. To address this question, we assayed the effect of CD28 agonism on NK-92 triggering in the presence of K562 target cells. The addition of CD28 agonistic antibodies to the co-cultures did not alter NK-92 degranulation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), suggesting that our observations are CD28 independent. In figure 5—figure supplement 1E of our original manuscript, we provided flow cytometry data of CD28 expression on NK-92 cells. We have since examined CD28 expression in naïve and IL-2 stimulated human PBMC-derived NK cells using two different antibodies (clones 28.2, L293). We could not detect CD28 expression using either antibody clone within the CD56+ CD3- population (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> and data not shown). Both antibodies detected CD28 expression within the CD3+ population. Consistent with these findings, analysis of RNA-seq datasets from PBMC-derived FACS-sorted immune cell subtypes (Monaco et al., 2019) suggest CD28 mRNA is weak to absent in NK cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>).</p><p>These results are consistent with the notion that NK-92 and primary NK cells are transducing CD80 stimuli through a CD28-independent mechanism. We have added CD28 immunophenotyping of NK cells to Figure 5—figure supplement 1F in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of CD28 agonism on NK-92 degranulation.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47362-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>CD28 expression in untouched PBMCs.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47362-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>RNA-seq analysis of CD28 expression in isolated peripheral blood subtypes.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47362-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1c) Can the authors speculate if DCAF15 may play a role in bona fide APCs for regulating NK cell activation during immune responses?</p></disp-quote><p>Cross-talk between dendritic cells and NK cells is a well-established phenomenon that mutually regulates both cell types (Long, 2007; Vivier et al., 2008; Ferlazzo and Munz, 2004). These interactions often occur at sites of inflammation or secondary lymphoid organs and can promote maturation or lysis of the DCs, as well as priming or activation of the NK cells. It has been reported that NK cells facilitate lysis of immature/ nonactivated DCs from inflamed tissue, while activated DCs remain protected due to increased HLA-E expression.</p><p>Given that this manuscript is the first to explore the cellular functions of DCAF15, it is difficult to articulate a precise role of the protein in regulating NK-APC interactions. Generating conditional DCAF15-knockout mouse models and DCAF15 antibodies would be greatly beneficial for further exploring these areas of biology. To see whether DCAF15 was expressed in human dendritic cells, we examined RNA-seq datasets from PBMC-derived FACS-sorted immune cell subtypes (Monaco et al., 2019). DCAF15 was broadly expressed across PBMC subtypes, including pDCs and mDCs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>). Furthermore, in an independently collected public dataset (Oon et al., 2016), we note that treatment of DCs with TLR agonists was associated with an upregulation of DCAF15 expression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig5">Author response image 5</xref>), suggesting that DCAF15 activity may be modulated during DC activation.</p><p>We have added to the discussion the potential role of DCAF15 in the activation of APCs and their interactions with NK cells.</p><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>RNA-seq analysis of DCAF15 expression in isolated peripheral blood subtypes.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47362-resp-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="respfig5"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>DCAF15 expression in human pDCs after stimulation with TLR agonists.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47362-resp-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2a) Authors validate that indisulam-induced CD80 upregulation can also be achieved in other cell lines in addition to K562s. It should be tested if CD80 upregulation by indisulam treatment and/or by DCAF15 KO also makes these additional cell lines (Daudi and Ku812 cells) more sensitive to NK92 killing.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that extending our observations on DCAF15 to other cell lines is important. Given the uncharacterized nature of DCAF15, we focused on understanding its role in K562 cells before embarking on experiments in other cellular contexts.</p><p>To address this point, we engineered Daudi cell lines with stable Cas9 expression, and then infected with them sgRNAs against DCAF15, PTPN2, STAT1 or ICAM1. Western blot, flow cytometry and RNA-seq confirmed a high level of target depletion (data added as Figure 3—figure supplement 1D-F). Consistent with our findings in K562 cells, competitive co-culture assays revealed that disruption of ICAM1 in Daudi cells was highly protective against NK-92 cell killing, whereas disruption of DCAF15 or PTPN2 enhanced killing (data added as Figure 3D).</p><p>We attempted to also extend findings to Ku812 cells. However, these cells grew poorly after Cas9 infection, so we could not proceed with further experimentation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2b) What about CD33? This is also a top hit and antibodies are available – can that be used as control?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer notes, RNA-seq analysis suggests that CD33 is transcriptionally upregulated in K562 DCAF15 KO cells (Figure 4F). CD33 is a classic myeloid antigen, with high expression in myeloid progenitors as well as tissue macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells(Crocker et al., 2001). We note that neither the published literature nor our NK-92 CRISPR screening data support the notion that expression of CD33 is an important factor modulating NK activity. We measured CD33 by flow cytometry and detected a small but reproducible increase in CD33 levels between control and DCAF15 KO K562 cells (see Author Response Image 6; 1.15-fold more CD33, P=0.024 Mann-Whitney test).</p><fig id="respfig6"><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>CD33 expression in K562 cells of indicated genotypes.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47362-resp-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors identify ICAM1 and components of the IFNγ pathway as top hits as genes whose loss promote resistance of K562s towards NK92-mediated attack. These findings contrast recent data available on bioRxiv from a similar K562 CRISPR screen performed with primary NK cells (Klein et al., 2019), where B7H6 (NCR3LG1) was found as a single dominant hit in a comparable setting. B7H6 however only scored as #26 in their screen. This may indicate differences in K562-related resistance mechanisms against the functionally restricted NK cell line NK92 in contrast to primary NK cells. This must be at least discussed and further emphasizes the necessity to validate the outcome of the study with NK92 in a primary NK cell setting.</p></disp-quote><p>Revision 1a addresses the relevance of DCAF15 KO, PTPN2 KO an ICAM1 KO in a primary NK cell setting.</p><p>Klein et al., performed a CRISPR co-culture screen with PBMC-derived NK cells and K562 cells. In their screening format, CRISPR-mutagenized K562 cells were challenged twice with NK cells, exerting a very high selective pressure against the K562 cells. Such an experimental design is only able to discover resistance factors, not sensitization factors, and likely drives differences in screening outcomes much more than the use of primary NK cells vs. NK-92 cells.</p><p>Our screens, as well as those in Klein et al., revealed that disruption of B7H6 is a strongly scoring resistance mechanism. B7H6 was the only hit recovered in the Klein et al., screen, with roughly two-thirds of the surviving cells from the CRISPR screen being B7H6-negative, and B7H6 guides enriched roughly 8-fold at the end of their screen. As the authors mention in their discussion, the absence of additional hits in the screen reflected the design of their assay, rather than the absence of other NK-resistance mechanisms in K562 cells.</p><p>We note that Klein et al., analyzed their screening data manually, without using any statistical techniques designed for the analysis of CRISPR screens. The dataset has not been made available with the manuscript, so we cannot determine for ourselves what resistance mechanisms may have gone unappreciated. We also note that Klein et al., compared sgRNA abundance in cells immediately post-sgRNA infection to cells after the second round of NK challenge. As such, changes in sgRNA abundance reflect both gene essentiality during normal cell culture as well as modulation of NK sensitivity. In our screens, we controlled for any gene dropout over time by comparing sgRNA abundance in K562 cells +/- NK92 challenge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4a) PTPN2 and DCAF15 knockout results in upregulation of MHC-I (Figure 4A), but still enhances NK cell killing, which is counterintuitive and against the dogma that low MHCI promotes NK cell cytotoxicity (missing self). This discrepancy should at least be discussed in more detail. NK92 cells have restricted KIR expression, this may explain the reduced sensitivity towards MHC-I-mediated inhibition. Under this NK92 specific conditions further NK-cell activating effects of IFNγ may dominate in contrast to the situation in primary NK cells. These potential differences between NK92 and primary NK cells must be validated in more depth.</p></disp-quote><p>In revision 1a, we observed that DCAF15 or PTPN2 promoted sensitization to primary NK cells. The effect was weaker compared to NK-92 cells, especially for DCAF15 KO cells. As the reviewer notes, NK-92 have an immunophenotype reminiscent of unlicensed NK cells (CD3- CD56-bright; CD16low/neg), with a limited KIR expression compared to primary NK cells (Maki et al., 2001). The reduced ability of NK-92 cells to transduce MHC-I inhibitory signals likely explains why we observe a more potent sensitizing effect of DCAF15 or PTPN2 disruption in that setting. We do note that the absolute level of MHC-I expression in DCAF15 KO and PTPN2 KO K562 cells remains relatively low, and that we have not characterized which MHC-I subclasses are driving the expression difference. We have added to the revised manuscript a discussion of the “MHC discrepancy.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4b) Please also include a discussion on Dufva et al., 2018, where the expected effect that loss of IFN signaling enhanced tumor cell lysis is described.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer does not cite a scientific article, but rather an abstract presented at a conference, which includes no figures or primary data. According to the Abstract, Dufva et al., used CRISPR screening to find that disruption of the IFN-JAK-STAT signaling pathway sensitizes various cancer cell lines to primary NK cell effector functions (Dufva et al., 2018). They suggest that MHC-I upregulation in response to NK cell-derived IFNγ inhibits NK activation and reduces cell lysis.</p><p>Our data in Figure 3 is consistent with the notion that target cell MHC-I expression and effector cell KIR expression are important cell surface factors regulating target cell lysis. The outcome of cancer cell IFNγ signaling is variable, and can include MHC-I upregulation, growth suppression, and/or immuno-modulation. We observe that whether cancer cell IFNγ signaling ultimately leads to reduced or enhanced NK cell lysis depends on the exact target and effector populations studied.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors do not provide/discuss a potential mechanism of how loss of IFNγ responsiveness in their screen promotes NK cell resistance. They exclude a direct cytostatic/cytotoxic effect of IFNγ. May that be related to a suppression of the proposed APC-like state of K562, associated with lower CD80 etc. levels? CD80 and other APC activation markers should be investigated e.g. on STAT1-KO (or IFNGR KO) K562 cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Initially, we studied the effect of STAT1 disruption in K562 cells when challenged with NK-92 cells. We have since examined the effect of STAT1 KO in more cellular contexts. We found that STAT1 disruption had a highly variable effect, promoting resistance or sensitization to NK cells in a target cell and effector cell-dependent manner (data added to Figure 3D-E). Rebuttal 4B describes how this variability likely arises.</p><p>We immunophenotyped K562 STAT1 KO cells before and after 24hours of IFNγ treatment. In the basal state, MHC-I, MHC-II, CD80 and CD40 and ICAM1 levels were either unchanged in STAT1 KO cells or modestly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig7">Author response image 7</xref>). Of these markers, MHC-I, CD40 and ICAM1 were increased after IFNγ stimulation in a STAT1-dependent manner. These data suggest that changes in APC activation markers are not responsible for promoting NK-92 resistance. We hypothesize that STAT1 KO K562 cells exhibited NK-92 resistance due to impaired IFNγ-induced ICAM1 upregulation and the relatively limited ability of NK-92 cells to receive MHC-I inhibitory signals.</p><p>We have added a subset of the STAT1 KO immunophenotype data to Figure 4—figure supplement 1C in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig7"><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><title>Expression of APC activation markers in STAT1 KO K562 cells.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47362-resp-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Can the RNA-seq data be exploited to speculate about the underlying mechanism of the growth inhibitory effect of PTPN2 knockout cells in contrast to WT K562 and DCAF15 KO cells in presence of IFNγ (Figure 4C)?

Do the growth inhibitory effects of PTPN2-KO in presence of IFNγ produced by NK92 account for depletion of PTPN2-KO cells in the screen? Or does PTPN2 KO similar to DCAF15 KO also contribute to an APC-like inflamed state of K562s (e.g. CD80 upregulation)?</p></disp-quote><p>IFNγ treatment is growth-suppressive in PTPN2 KO cells, but is not directly cytostatic/cytotoxic to control K562 or DCAF15 KO cells (Figure 4C). Normal K562 cells respond transcriptionally to IFNγ by dramatically upregulating antiviral genes and components of the antigen processing and presentation pathway (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). In contrast, PTPN2 KO cells were enriched for inflammation and interferon-associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms in the unstimulated state (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D). After IFNγ treatment, PTPN2 KO cells had exaggerated induction of IFNγ-responsive genes and were also enriched for apoptotic GO gene categories (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E). Thus, it appears that loss of appropriate negative feedback on IFNγ signaling may promote cell death, contributing to the observed growth inhibitory effect.</p><p>It is unclear whether the IFNγ-induced growth suppression of PTPN2 KO cells fully accounts for the sensitivity of these cells to NK cell lysis. PTPN2 KO cells are immuno-modulated in a way expected to both increase (higher ICAM1) and decrease (higher MHC-I) NK cell activation.</p><p>We have added a volcano plot showing the transcriptional response to IFNγ to Figure 4—figure supplement 1B.

We addressed this possibility in Figure 5—figure supplement 1A by measuring the expression level of a variety of other receptors implicated by the NK screen and/or in the literature to see whether they were altered in DCAF15 KO cells. In the original manuscript, we included data on ULBP2/5/6, CD58, NECTIN2, ICAM1 and IFNGR1.

Further experimentation would be needed to support such a claim. We agree that the correlation between DCAF15 expression and AML survival is not proof of enhanced NK-mediated control of AML blasts in DCAF15-low patients. In the manuscript, we simply state that “lower DCAF15 function, achieved pharmacologically or by genetic means, is associated with favorable immunophenotypes in vitro and improved outcomes in AML patients”. An intriguing observation is that AML patients receiving allogenic stem cell transplants from KIR-mismatched donors have enhanced graft vs. leukemia activity and reduced relapse (Ruggeri et al., 2002), suggesting that NK cells can have clinically meaningful activity against AML.</p></body></sub-article></article>
