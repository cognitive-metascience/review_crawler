spontaneous or action-potential evoked fusion of synaptic vesicles. At excitatory synapses, glutamatergic receptors activated by spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission are segregated. Although inhibitory synapses also transmit signals spontaneously or in response to action potentials, they differ from excitatory synapses in both structure and function. Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibitory synapses may have different organizing principles. We report picrotoxin, a GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist, blocks neurotransmission in a use-dependent manner at rat hippocampal synapses and therefore can be used to interrogate synaptic properties. Using this tool, we uncovered partial segregation of inhibitory spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission. We found up to 40% of the evoked response is mediated through GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs which are only activated by evoked neurotransmission. These data indicate GABAergic spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission processes are partially non-overlapping, suggesting they may serve divergent roles in neuronal signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spontaneous release</kwd><kwd>GABAergic neurotransmission</kwd><kwd>picrotoxin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM008203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horvath</surname><given-names>Patricia M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH070727</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monteggia</surname><given-names>Lisa M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH66198</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kavalali</surname><given-names>Ege T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 MH064913</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Piazza</surname><given-names>Michelle K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>GABAergic postsynaptic responses mediated by spontaneous and evoked neurotransmitter release are partially segregated, suggesting they may serve distinct roles in neuronal signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synaptic neuronal communication can be broadly classified into either evoked or spontaneous neurotransmission. Evoked neurotransmission is the canonical action-potential driven signaling that causes synchronous or asynchronous release of vesicles at multiple synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Südhof, 2013</xref>). Spontaneous neurotransmission occurs via action-potential independent release of single synaptic vesicles. At the molecular level, spontaneous neurotransmission has been shown to utilize partly different molecular machinery and act at distinct postsynaptic sites than evoked neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kavalali, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The organizing principles surrounding evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission may differ between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Spontaneous and evoked glutamate release at excitatory synapses in the hippocampus, as well as synapses at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction, activate distinct sets of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Melom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peled et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sara et al., 2011</xref>). Synaptic <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<italic>D</italic>-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the hippocampus also show a near complete segregation in their responses to spontaneous and evoked glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atasoy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reese and Kavalali, 2016</xref>). These studies have demonstrated that spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission can occur at the same synapse; nevertheless, these different forms of transmission activate separate NMDA and AMPA receptors. Segregation may be necessary due to the clear and distinct differences in downstream signaling between evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission at excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Autry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crawford et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonzalez-Islas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nosyreva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramirez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sutton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sutton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sutton et al., 2004</xref>). It remains unclear whether spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission play separate roles at inhibitory synapses. In contrast to excitatory neurotransmission, inhibitory neurotransmission serves distinct functions in circuits, targets different neuronal sites, and partly relies on separate presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular machineries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Courtney et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Higley, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tyagarajan and Fritschy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams and Smith, 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is critical to address directly whether receptors that respond to spontaneous and evoked GABA release are segregated at inhibitory synapses.</p><p>Here, we examine whether inhibitory synapses exhibit postsynaptic segregation of spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission. These experiments require a use-dependent γ-aminobutyric acid-A receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) antagonist to separate inhibitory spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission. Picrotoxin (PTX) is a commonly used noncompetitive GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akaike et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallagher et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nicoll and Wojtowicz, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takeuchi and Takeuchi, 1969</xref>). Structural evidence suggests PTX binds within the pore of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gurley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hibbs and Gouaux, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Masiulis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Olsen, 2006</xref>), and may act in a use-dependent manner to block GABA<sub>A</sub>R channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akaike et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Newland and Cull-Candy, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yoon et al., 1993</xref>). However, previous studies used exogenously applied GABA to examine the pharmacology of PTX; this setting may not be completely relevant to physiological signaling mediated by synaptically released GABA. We first show PTX acts as a use-dependent GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist during inhibitory neurotransmission. We subsequently used PTX to investigate postsynaptic segregation of spontaneous and evoked signaling at inhibitory synapses and identified partially segregated populations of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs that are solely activated by evoked release. Collectively, these results provide new insight into fundamental aspects of GABAergic neurotransmission.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Picrotoxin acts as a use-dependent antagonist in a manner consistent with open channel block</title><p>We first tested whether PTX acts as a use-dependent GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist to selectively block open GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs activated during inhibitory neurotransmission in dissociated hippocampal cultures. Typically, blockers that gain access to their binding sites via open channel pores prematurely hinder channel conductance leading to faster decay times. Therefore, in these experiments, we examined decay times after PTX treatment. Both spontaneous and evoked currents had faster decay times after PTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). Here and all subsequent experiments, we used 50 µM of PTX as this concentration of PTX was able to completely abolish spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) within 5 min of application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, also see below). Under the same conditions, stimulating hippocampal synapses at a variety of frequencies and measuring the evoked IPSC (eIPSC) peak amplitudes in the presence of PTX resulted in a response that decreased as a function of stimulation number regardless of PTX incubation time, indicating PTX is a use-dependent antagonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, stimulation in the absence of PTX led to a small decrease in eIPSC peak amplitude which was far less than the decrease in the presence of PTX, and may reflect metabolic rundown. Together, these data support PTX as use-dependent antagonist during inhibitory neurotransmission.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PTX blocks GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in a use-dependent manner consistent with open-channel block.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scaled example traces of mIPSCs before and after PTX addition.

When measuring the time course of mIPSC block in PTX, we found that 5 min of PTX treatment in the absence of stimulation was sufficient to fully block the mIPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>). Both the frequency and amplitude distributions of these spontaneous events were unaltered by the addition of tetrodotoxin (TTX), indicating that suppression of excitatory synaptic transmission to isolate inhibitory neurotransmission is in itself sufficient to block all network activity and enable detection of mIPSCs without a requirement for TTX application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is possible that some receptors which are activated by spontaneous release remain unblocked after 5 min, but these mIPSCs may be undetectable due to a reduced size. To test this possibility, we used a high Cl<sup>-</sup> internal solution to increase mIPSC amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>). Augmented mIPSCs recorded using the high Cl<sup>-</sup> internal solution followed a similar time course of block in the presence of PTX as those recorded using the standard internal solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>), indicating that GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs which are activated by spontaneous signaling have reached a steady state of block following a 5 min incubation in PTX. Because PTX is use-dependent, and nearly all spontaneous responses are suppressed after a 5 min incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), the majority of remaining response to evoked stimulation after 5 min must be mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs which are only responsive to evoked neurotransmission.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission are partly segregated at inhibitory synapses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing experiment design.

Treatment of the 8 min no drug condition with bicuculline after the 10<sup>th</sup> stimulation drastically reduced the response amplitude down to the level of 8 min bicuculline treatment, indicating that the measured response is mediated through GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs.

When no drug is applied during rest, the evoked response is diminished compared to the initial response before treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, open symbols). This may be due to metabolic rundown, as in these recordings we did not detect any alterations in membrane or pipette access resistances. Spontaneous mIPSCs, in contrast, were largely unaffected by this rundown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data establish the upper bound of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated response. To establish a lower bound for GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated response, bicuculline was applied for 8 min. As a competitive antagonist, bicuculline blocks GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs regardless of whether they have been activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akaike et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Masiulis et al., 2019</xref>). Response amplitudes after bicuculline incubation were greatly diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, purple), however, some current remained (~7%), which was sensitive to tetrodotoxin application, indicating that it was not an artifact of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, brown). This is consistent with previous studies, in which PTX achieved an imperfect block of GABA-induced current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akaike et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Newland and Cull-Candy, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yoon et al., 1993</xref>). Additionally, application of bicuculline to control drug-free conditions led to a drastic and immediate decrease in eIPSC amplitudes, indicating that responses above this baseline level represent currents mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs.</p><p>Next, we applied PTX in the absence of stimulation for 5 min, and then stimulated cells and measured the eIPSC response. If there is complete overlap between the receptors which are activated by spontaneous release and those activated by evoked release, after a 5 min incubation with PTX, when the majority of receptors activated by spontaneous release are blocked, we would expect to see no eIPSC response to stimulation above the level reached after bicuculline block. However, if the two populations of receptors are completely separate, we would expect to see a high eIPSC response comparable to the drug-free condition response. In these experiments, we found an intermediate initial eIPSC response following complete block of receptors activated by spontaneous release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F–H</xref>, 5 minutes). The response decreased over successive stimulations due to the continued presence of PTX, indicating that receptors which were activated by previous evoked release are subsequently blocked. Using the initial responses in the drug-free condition and those remaining after bicuculline treatment as the maximum and minimum of the detectable GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated response, we were able to calculate that 40.1 ± 9.6% of the evoked response remains after complete suppression of mIPSCs. The magnitude of the remaining evoked response was remarkably similar if the cells were incubated at rest with PTX for 8 min (39.7 ± 4.6%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). This result indicates that approximately 40% of the evoked inhibitory response is mediated by postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs which are exclusively activated by evoked neurotransmission, while the remaining 60% of the response is mediated by receptors which are activated by both spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission in hippocampal cultures. Consistent with a partial overlap of receptors activated by evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission, the initial response to evoked stimulation was much higher when receptors activated by spontaneous release were not fully blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> minutes).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Use dependence of PTX block of GABAergic transmission in hippocampal slices</title><p>To probe the postsynaptic organization of spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission within an intact synaptic circuit, we utilized ex vivo hippocampal slices from mature rats (11–13 weeks).

We then continued to perfuse PTX and resumed 0.1 Hz stimulation for 30–40 min. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Our previous data show that 5 min of PTX application at rest is sufficient to block spontaneous activity in cultured hippocampal neurons, and it has been reported that the rates of spontaneous neurotransmission are similar between cultured neurons and brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ertunc et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kavalali, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sara et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, we measured the remaining evoked response in 5 min intervals following PTX application at rest, as the time for PTX to perfuse into the recording chamber and reach full concentration may differ between our culture and slice recordings. Accordingly, multiple minutes passed before the fIPSP response was reduced following the start of PTX perfusion when stimulation was continuously given (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,G</xref>). Additionally, fIPSP peak amplitude was reduced compared to baseline when stimulation was resumed at 5 and 10 min, but the extent of block was much higher following 10 min of application at rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–I</xref>). The decreased response following PTX application in the absence of stimulation indicates a high degree of overlap between GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs activated by evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission. Conversely, following 10 min of PTX application at rest, when most receptors activated by spontaneous signaling are expected to be suppressed, there is a remaining evoked response, suggesting that this response is mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs activated specifically by evoked stimulation consistent with our prior findings. Remarkably, this remaining response was similar in magnitude to our results in culture (34.05 ± 5.37%).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Recovery of spontaneous neurotransmission following GABA<sub>A</sub>R block</title><p>Our findings so far suggest that evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission partially overlap and that a population of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are solely activated by evoked release by examining the remaining evoked responses following GABA<sub>A</sub>R block during rest. To investigate this further, we examined the kinetics of recovery from GABA<sub>A</sub>R block in our dissociated culture system. For this purpose, we blocked GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs by applying PTX in the presence of 55 mM of KCl for 90 s then measuring the recovery of mIPSCs from PTX block in the presence or absence of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). As expected, the eIPSC response was greatly diminished when 55 mM of KCl alone was applied for 90 s, likely due to rapid depletion of vesicle pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sara et al., 2002</xref>). Nevertheless, the eIPSC responses recovered back to a steady baseline following removal of the KCl solution. eIPSC responses following 55 mM of KCl with PTX treatment also recovered following successive stimulations, however the recovery occurred over a longer time period, consistent with the premise that blocked receptors were gradually unblocked by successive stimulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>). This finding agrees with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Newland and Cull-Candy, 1992</xref>) where PTX unblock from GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs has been shown to be at least partially use-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also examined mIPSC responses to 55 mM of KCl with and without PTX in the presence or absence of this stimulation. Following application of 55 mM of KCl, mIPSC responses were partly diminished, but then recovered back to a steady baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>). When 55 mM of KCl was co-applied with PTX, mIPSC responses were greatly diminished, indicating GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs activated by spontaneous release were blocked by 55 mM of KCl and PTX co-application. The recovery of mIPSCs in cells treated with 55 mM of KCl and PTX in the absence of stimulation was slow and minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>). This is not surprising since the spontaneous release rate per synapse is in the order of 1 vesicle per minute per synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leitz and Kavalali, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sara et al., 2005</xref>). However, the presence of 0.2 Hz stimulation significantly increased the recovery of mIPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), indicating that evoked release activates some of the same GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs as spontaneous release. To ensure our results were not being biased towards receptors which are specifically activated by evoked release caused by depolarization, we repeated this experiment using the GABA<sub>A</sub>R agonist muscimol (10 µM) in combination with PTX to block GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We obtained similar results using this approach, that is stimulation significantly increased the recovery of mIPSCs following GABA<sub>A</sub>R block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>).

This use-dependent action of PTX allowed us to investigate fundamental properties of GABAergic inhibitory synapses. By altering presynaptic release probability via changes in external Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we show that PTX can be used to interrogate release probability at inhibitory synapses in both cultures and hippocampal slices. Additionally, we were able to test whether evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission processes are segregated at inhibitory synapses. Our data show that while it is not as complete as previously reported at excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atasoy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Melom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peled et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reese and Kavalali, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sara et al., 2011</xref>), there is nevertheless significant postsynaptic segregation of the two forms of neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses.</p><p>The use-dependent NMDA receptor blocker MK-801 has been instrumental in determining basic properties of glutamatergic synapses such as presynaptic release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hessler et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang and Stevens, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huettner and Bean, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rosenmund et al., 1993</xref>), receptor saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McAllister and Stevens, 2000</xref>), and receptor mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tovar and Westbrook, 2002</xref>). Our results show that PTX is similarly use-dependent and can be used to monitor alterations in release probability of GABAergic synapses. By increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, we gradually augmented release probability at inhibitory synapses and observed a corresponding increase in the rate at which GABAergic responses were blocked. It is therefore likely that many of the same analyses initially performed for NMDA receptors at glutamatergic synapses can be performed for GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at GABAergic synapses. However, it is important to caution that PTX does not simply block pore conductance of GABA channels but rather binds to a site within the pore to stabilize a closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Masiulis et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, recovery from block is only partially use-dependent as indicated by earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Newland and Cull-Candy, 1992</xref>). Although these properties of PTX have limited impact on the experiments we performed here, they may influence alternative experimental designs such as delineating metabotropic and ionic receptor effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nabavi et al., 2013</xref>), or those that solely rely on response recovery after block.</p><p>Our results show that evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission processes are partially segregated at inhibitory synapses. This notion is supported by the GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated evoked responses remaining following the block of all GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs activated by spontaneous neurotransmission in both hippocampal cultures and slice. We estimate that 34–40% of the total evoked GABAergic response recorded at the stratum pyramidale of hippocampal CA1 region and in hippocampal cultures is mediated by receptors which are only activated by evoked neurotransmission. Although mIPSC recovery following GABA<sub>A</sub>R block was enhanced by the presence of stimulation, these results do not exclude the possibility that some GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are only activated by spontaneous release and account for the population that recovers in the absence of stimulation. These findings suggest a model of partial, but not complete, segregation between GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs which are activated by evoked release, and those activated by spontaneous release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>A major question arising from this work is: how is this partial segregation achieved? Segregation may start at the level of presynaptic release mechanisms, including dedicated signaling pathways that selectively impact spontaneous or evoked release as well as distinct synaptic vesicle pools and vesicle recycling pathways to carry out the two forms of neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kavalali, 2015</xref>). A growing body of evidence suggests that synapses are organized into ‘nano-columns’ such that a single vesicle only activates juxtaposed receptors on the postsynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biederer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maschi and Klyachko, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). Based on these studies, two non-mutually exclusive models can be proposed. One model posits that segregation is achieved through a combination of differential presynaptic molecular regulation and pre/postsynaptic spatial separation within the same synapse. Alternatively, segregation may arise through differential action of these mechanisms over different inhibitory synapses. Earlier studies demonstrated that excitatory synapses can exhibit both spontaneous and evoked release while others exclusively exhibit spontaneous or evoked release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leitz and Kavalali, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Melom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peled et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reese and Kavalali, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Walter et al., 2014</xref>). With GABAergic neurotransmission, limitations in the resolution and speed of current chloride sensors or other probes to visualize activity at the level of single synapses, makes this question difficult to address at this time. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that some GABAergic synapses could release neurotransmitter only via spontaneous release, only via evoked release, or both leading to the partial segregation seen in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>There could be many reasons why segregation is not as complete at inhibitory synapses as at excitatory synapses. First, there may be more overlap in the molecular machinery used for spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. Although earlier work has suggested that synaptic vesicle pools mediating spontaneous and evoked release may be distinct at inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2010</xref>), unlike at excitatory synapses, spontaneous release at inhibitory synapses is partly coupled to activation of voltage activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsintsadze et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vyleta and Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams and Smith, 2018</xref>). Moreover, recent evidence suggests that synaptotagmin-1, the canonical Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for fast synchronous evoked release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geppert et al., 1994</xref>), also regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent spontaneous release, but only at inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Courtney et al., 2018</xref>). Second, unlike Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling through NMDA receptors, chloride flow through GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs has very few targets that may direct downstream biochemical signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heubl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Piala et al., 2014</xref>), although GABAergic transmission has been shown to indirectly regulate dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Higley, 2014</xref>). Therefore, the strong segregation that is seen at excitatory synapses may not be as essential to mediate inhibitory synaptic communication. Our current findings provide evidence that the postsynaptic organization of inhibitory synapses shows only partial segregation of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs that respond to evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), suggesting a distinct organizing principle of these synapses compared to their excitatory counterparts. Nevertheless, given recently identified targets for chloride-mediated biochemical signaling in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heubl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Piala et al., 2014</xref>), even this partial segregation may provide a platform for differential signaling by evoked and spontaneous GABAergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Adult female dam CD1 rats (Sprague-Dawley, Charles River) aged 11–13 weeks were housed on a 12 hr light/dark cycle at ambient temperature (23 ± 3°C and humidity (50 ± 20%) with access to food and water ad libitum.

No more than four hippocampal slices were used per dam, and each experiment was performed on slices from at least two different animals. Dams were anesthetized with isofluorane and decapitated. Brains were removed and immersed in ice-cold dissection buffer containing the following: 2.6 mM of KCl, 1.25 mM of NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 mM of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 mM of CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM of MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 212 mM of sucrose and 10 mM of glucose for 2–3 min. Hippocampi were dissected and cut with a vibratome into 400 μm-thick transverse sections in ice-cold dissection buffer continuously aerated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Area CA3 was surgically removed immediately after sectioning. Sections were recovered for 3–6 hr at 30°C in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing the following: 124 mM of NaCl, 5 mM of KCl, 1.25 mM of NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 mM of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2 mM of CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 mM of glucose, pH 7.4 (continuously aerated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). 25 μM of D-APV and 10 μM of NBQX were added to the ACSF to block NMDA and AMPA channels, respectively, and isolate inhibitory GABA-mediated currents. In several experiments, PTX was applied for long durations to fully block GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. Following the conclusion of these experiments, bicuculline was applied to confirm the range of inhibitory response. Bicuculline did not further decrease the measured response, indicating that as for dissociated culture experiments, PTX blocked the full range of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated response. For experiments examining release probability, concentration of CaCl<sub>2</sub> in ACSF varied at 2 mM, 1 mM and 0.5 mM. Following recovery, hippocampal slices were transferred to the recording chamber and perfused with oxygenated ACSF at a rate of 2–3 mL/min at 30°C.

The fIPSP peak amplitude of pulse 2 (P2) was divided by pulse 1 (P1) to give a ratio representing presynaptic release probability.

The lower limit was then subtracted from the first fIPSP response following the continuation of stimulation, and this value was divided by the range and subtracted from one to determine the percentage of baseline response that was intact.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Horvath et al. carefully documents a novel segregation of inhibitory synaptic receptors between those responsible for spontaneous (miniature) responses and those driving activity dependent release. This work builds on the power of dispersed ex vivo cultures of neurons that facilitates detailed physiological studies, and the exploitation of the fact that the channel blocking inhibitor picrotoxin can be used to provide information on recent use of receptors. Overall, these results show that similar to what is already known about excitatory synapses, inhibitory synapses show a similar subdivision into spontaneous vs evoked, although the segregation is less complete for inhibition.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission are partially segregated at inhibitory synapses&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation is being overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>There is potential interest in this paper, however there are two major concerns. The full reviews are posted below. By the way, the identification of picrotoxin as a use-dependent blocker is a nice finding.</p><p>Can you briefly respond to the following:</p><p>1) The potential impact of this report might be limited given that the extent of segregation between spontaneous and evoked GABA-containing vesicles seems to be much less than for excitatory vesicles. This combined with some results that were perceived to be ambiguous in their interpretation potentially further weaken the paper.</p><p>2) The results obtained are limited to one preparation (immature monolayer culture) and it is unclear how general this finding is in relation to developmental stage and in the &quot;more intact&quot; nervous system.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Horvath et al. , using the model system of immature rat hippocampal dispersed cultures, report on the potential independence of GABA-a receptors mediating spontaneous vs activity-dependent synaptic release of the inhibitory neurotransmittter GABA. They find that the GABA-a receptor pore blocking antagonist picrotoxin shows novel use-dependence that should enable the use of this compound to infer information about release probabilities at inhibitory synapses, given that high release probabilities will lead to relatively greater release of GABA and therefore greater use-dependent block.</p><p>Using this approach, the authors show that, as previously shown for excitatory synaptic receptors, inhibitory receptors show partial segregation i.e. that the receptors mediating spontaneous (activity-independent, presumably spontaneous single vesicle release events) do no overlap 100% with those activated by evoked synaptic transmission.</p><p>The results are novel, in that segregation of receptors has not, to my knowledge, been reported for inhibitory synapses, and could be important in terms of further understanding of the mechanisms regulating synaptic transmission in the brain. The experiments are carefully executed and illustrated, and are for the most part convincing. A minor limitation is that the results are limited to this elegant, yet artificial cell culture system that may not fully recapitulate the native perisynaptic environment in the brain. This last issue could reduce the potential impact of the report.</p><p>1) Validation in another neural system, such as acute or cultured brain slices would broaden the interpretation and impact.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Horvath al., described experiments performed on cultured rat hippocampal neurons performed to investigate if there is postsynaptic segregation of evoked and spontaneous release at inhibitory synapses. The work is an extension of earlier studies from the labs of Drs Kavalali and Monteggia which have studied how evoked and spontaneous release differ at many synapses in the hippocampus. I do not believe that the manuscript is suitable for publication in its current form because of a number of uncertainties concerning experimental design and interpretation of the findings. My major concern relates to interpretation the experiments described in Figure 4 after which the authors propose that some GABA receptors are only activated by spontaneous release and unaffected by concurrent evoked release. The design of this experiment was set up to preferentially increase the block of receptors involved in evoked release. The 90 sec exposure to picrotoxin and had previously been shown (Figure 3B) to only block 50% of the minis. However, following the application of 90 mM potassium and picrotoxin there appeared to be almost complete block of both spontaneous and evoked IPSCs. After application, the recovery of spontaneous transmission appeared more impaired than recovery of evoked transmission. I believe this result indicates that the authors have shown that some GABA receptors are involved in only evoked release and that the GABA receptors involved in spontaneous release are also involved in it evoked release. In addition to addressing this question I have other specific questions for the authors:</p><p>1) Please describe, in the Materials and methods or an early part of the Results, how eIPSCs were elicited? Was it by field stimulation or some other method? The time of decay of eIPSC changed with PTX and time. When was the exemplar in 1C recorded (how long after application) and was that steady state?</p><p>2) Please provide data on eIPSC decrement with stimulation/frequency in the absence of PTX (see Figure 1E). This will facilitate our interpretation of data comparing synaptic activity at different time points in later experiments.</p><p>3) Is the Y axis in Figure 3A (and 4E) measurement of normalized mIPSC frequency or a product of frequency and amplitude? If the latter, please justify.</p><p>4) There are a number of occasions in which it would be interesting to know how mIPSCs changed over time since &quot;metabolic rundown&quot; that affected eIPSCs in Figure 3 could also affect mIPSCs. In fact, in Figure 3B there appears to be ~30% rundown in 2 mins of basal activity in this set of experiments. This is surprising since Figure 3—figure supplement 1 shows frequency and amplitude are unaffected by TTX in unmatched experiments. The case would be stronger if it was demonstrated within recordings that TTX did not affect frequency or amplitude. Perhaps the experiments used to make the brown circle data in Figure 3F can be analyzed to test this idea.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your revised article &quot;Spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission are partially segregated at inhibitory synapses&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

This work builds on the power of dispersed ex vivo cultures of neurons that facilitates detailed physiological studies, and the exploitation of the fact that the channel blocking inhibitor picrotoxin can be used to provide information on recent use of receptors. Overall, these results show that similar to what is already known about *excitatory* synapses, inhibitory synapses show a similar subdivision into spontaneous vs evoked, although the segregation is less complete for inhibition.</p><p>Overall, this is an important contribution to the literature, as it provides novel information of inhibitory signaling in the brain, which is critical in maintaining proper circuit balance. The study should be the starting point for further studies of mechanisms and consequences of such segregation.</p><p>The authors made the following significant changes to the manuscript:</p><p>1) They added field recordings from acute hippocampal slices and replicated key findings obtained from cell cultures.</p><p>2) They added new experiments using muscimol.</p><p>3) Investigated use-dependence of PTX unblock at 2 frequencies.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>– The only remaining substantive critique is that the LFP approach for assessing inhibition is not a standard one, and more direct experiments utilizing intracellular experiments would certain be more compelling, although these are not strictly required.</p><p>– In addition, there are few, if any details regarding the precise methods of ensuring that the evoked LFP response accurately portrays inhibitory signaling.

The full reviews are posted below. By the way, the identification of picrotoxin as a use-dependent blocker is a nice finding.</p><p>Can you briefly respond to the following:</p><p>1) The potential impact of this report might be limited given that the extent of segregation between spontaneous and evoked GABA-containing vesicles seems to be much less than for excitatory vesicles. This combined with some results that were perceived to be ambiguous in their interpretation potentially further weaken the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Our results demonstrate that segregation of postsynaptic GABA receptors responding to evoked and spontaneous GABA release is not as complete as our previous reports on NMDA receptors and AMPA receptors (Atasoy et al., 2008; Sara et al., 2011). We think elucidating this fundamental property of GABAergic neurotransmission, regardless of the experimental outcome is extremely important. In our opinion, it was surprising that we could detect any segregation at all as there is limited evidence for biochemical signaling mediated by GABAergic transmission. Our earlier studies have associated segregation of evoked and spontaneous excitatory transmission with their distinct effects on biochemical signaling. Our current findings suggest a partial dissociation of putative signaling functions for evoked and spontaneous GABAergic neurotransmission, which we plan to pursue in future work.</p><p>Moreover, we believe the approach and the methods we demonstrate here will enable other groups to test the same question in their systems. For instance, our earlier work was instrumental in studies that were performed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction by other groups (e.g. Peled et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The results obtained are limited to one preparation (immature monolayer culture) and it is unclear how general this finding is in relation to developmental stage and in the &quot;more intact&quot; nervous system.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Our extensive work using hippocampal culture preparations show that synapses in this system reach maturity within two weeks as judged by their functional as well as ultrastructural properties (Kavalali et al., 1999; Mozhayeva et al., 2002). A key benefit of the culture systems is the ability to stimulate a large majority of the synaptic contacts onto the neuron of interest. Nevertheless, we have tested key predictions of these results in acute hippocampal slices and found a similar portion of the inhibitory evoked response remains after incubation with picrotoxin at rest to block GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs activated by spontaneous release. These results indicate that across systems 34-40% of the inhibitory evoked response is mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs which are only activated by evoked release and strengthen a key finding of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Horvath et al. , using the model system of immature rat hippocampal dispersed cultures, report on the potential independence of GABA-a receptors mediating spontaneous vs activity-dependent synaptic release of the inhibitory neurotransmittter GABA. They find that the GABA-a receptor pore blocking antagonist picrotoxin shows novel use-dependence that should enable the use of this compound to infer information about release probabilities at inhibitory synapses, given that high release probabilities will lead to relatively greater release of GABA and therefore greater use-dependent block.</p><p>Using this approach, the authors show that, as previously shown for excitatory synaptic receptors, inhibitory receptors show partial segregation i.e. that the receptors mediating spontaneous (activity-independent, presumably spontaneous single vesicle release events) do no overlap 100% with those activated by evoked synaptic transmission.</p><p>The results are novel, in that segregation of receptors has not, to my knowledge, been reported for inhibitory synapses, and could be important in terms of further understanding of the mechanisms regulating synaptic transmission in the brain. The experiments are carefully executed and illustrated, and are for the most part convincing. A minor limitation is that the results are limited to this elegant, yet artificial cell culture system that may not fully recapitulate the native perisynaptic environment in the brain. This last issue could reduce the potential impact of the report.</p><p>1) Validation in another neural system, such as acute or cultured brain slices would broaden the interpretation and impact.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their kind words regarding our work and thoughtful suggestions. We have conducted additional experiments to test key predictions in hippocampal slice. Using this system and measuring fIPSPs we were able to recapitulate our findings from culture. As in culture, PTX acted in a use-dependent manner and was able to distinguish between different presynaptic release probabilities based on the rate of fIPSP block. Additionally, following incubation with PTX at rest to block GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs activated by spontaneous signaling, we found that 34 ± 5.37% of evoked response remains. This is remarkably similar to our results in culture, in which 40.1 ± 9.6% of the evoked response remained following incubation with PTX at rest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript Horvath al., described experiments performed on cultured rat hippocampal neurons performed to investigate if there is postsynaptic segregation of evoked and spontaneous release at inhibitory synapses. The work is an extension of earlier studies from the labs of Drs Kavalali and Monteggia which have studied how evoked and spontaneous release differ at many synapses in the hippocampus. I do not believe that the manuscript is suitable for publication in its current form because of a number of uncertainties concerning experimental design and interpretation of the findings. My major concern relates to interpretation the experiments described in Figure 4 after which the authors propose that some GABA receptors are only activated by spontaneous release and unaffected by concurrent evoked release. The design of this experiment was set up to preferentially increase the block of receptors involved in evoked release. The 90 sec exposure to picrotoxin and had previously been shown (Figure 3B) to only block 50% of the minis. However, following the application of 90 mM potassium and picrotoxin there appeared to be almost complete block of both spontaneous and evoked IPSCs. After application, the recovery of spontaneous transmission appeared more impaired than recovery of evoked transmission. I believe this result indicates that the authors have shown that some GABA receptors are involved in only evoked release and that the GABA receptors involved in spontaneous release are also involved in it evoked release.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their insightful comments. In our experiments, 90 seconds of 55 mM of potassium was used to elicit a flood of GABA neurotransmitter that would activate GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs beyond those normally activated by evoked release. We believe the increased block of mIPSCs supports this premise. However, the reviewer makes a good point that 90 seconds of 55 mM of potassium may not be the best way to block all GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, and may preferentially block those receptors which mediate responses to evoked release. Therefore, we have performed additional experiments utilizing the GABA<sub>A</sub>R agonist muscimol to activate and block GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. Our experiments with muscimol recapitulate our findings with KCl, and indicate that this manipulation did not selectively block receptors activated by evoked release.</p><p>Our interpretation of the data in this figure relies on the recovery of the GABAergic response following PTX block being use-dependent (as shown by new data in the supplement and described above). If the receptors activated by evoked and spontaneous release are overlapping, we would expect stimulation to activate the same receptors as spontaneous release, thereby speeding up the recovery of the spontaneous mIPSC response. However, if the receptors activated by evoked and spontaneous release are non-overlapping, we would expect stimulation to activate a separate set of receptors and therefore have limited impact on the recovery of the spontaneous mIPSC response, which would instead rely only on spontaneous signaling.</p><p>Initially, using our non-standard measure of mIPSC recovery we did not find an impact of stimulation on the rate of mIPSC recovery and thus concluded this represented a set of receptors which was only activated by spontaneous signaling. Upon reanalysis of our data to use the more standard integrated charge as a measure of GABAergic recovery, we did find that stimulation increased the rate of mIPSC recovery. This is more in line with our previous block experiments showing partial overlap of the GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs activated by spontaneous and evoked release. However, this data does not exclude the possibility that the recovery of mIPSCs in the absence of stimulation is partly mediated by receptors which are only activated by spontaneous release. The slow recovery of mIPSCs in the absence of stimulation is likely due to the slow rate of spontaneous release at any given synapse (~1 vesicle/minute) compared to the 0.2 Hz applied stimulation (1 stimulation/5 seconds).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to addressing this question I have other specific questions for the authors:</p><p>1) Please describe, in the Materials and methods or an early part of the Results, how eIPSCs were elicited? Was it by field stimulation or some other method? The time of decay of eIPSC changed with PTX and time. When was the exemplar in 1C recorded (how long after application) and was that steady state?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their careful examination of our study. The eIPSCs were elicited by bath stimulation through parallel platinum electrodes. The exemplar in 1C was taken from the 10<sup>th</sup> response to stimulation in PTX following 8 minutes of PTX application at rest (no stimulation). We have clarified this point in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please provide data on eIPSC decrement with stimulation/frequency in the absence of PTX (see Figure 1E). This will facilitate our interpretation of data comparing synaptic activity at different time points in later experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful point. We agree that this will be useful to plot these data together and have adjusted our figures accordingly. As seen in Figure 1E, the rundown associated with stimulation in the absence of PTX is far less than the block of GABAergic response measured in the presence of PTX.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Is the Y axis in Figure 3A (and 4E) measurement of normalized mIPSC frequency or a product of frequency and amplitude? If the latter, please justify.</p></disp-quote><p>The Y-axes in these figures is a normalized product of mIPSC frequency and amplitude. We initially chose this metric as a measure of charge transfer because the integrated charge of each event would be affected by decreased decay time following PTX addition. This would decrease overall charge transferred without necessarily providing a full measure of receptor block. However, we recognize that this is a non-standard measure and have updated our analysis to reflect integrated charge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are a number of occasions in which it would be interesting to know how mIPSCs changed over time since &quot;metabolic rundown&quot; that affected eIPSCs in Figure 3 could also affect mIPSCs. In fact, in Figure 3B there appears to be ~30% rundown in 2 mins of basal activity in this set of experiments. This is surprising since Figure 3—figure supplement 1 shows frequency and amplitude are unaffected by TTX in unmatched experiments. The case would be stronger if it was demonstrated within recordings that TTX did not affect frequency or amplitude. Perhaps the experiments used to make the brown circle data in Figure 3F can be analyzed to test this idea.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes an excellent point and we have included experiments in which spontaneous IPSCs were measured within recordings before and after TTX. These recordings show that the frequency and amplitude of events is unchanged following the addition of TTX indicating that we are measuring bona fide mIPSCs. Additionally, mIPSCs are stable in TTX over the course of 10 minutes indicating that they are not affected by the same rundown which effects evoked IPSCs.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>– The only remaining substantive critique is that the LFP approach for assessing inhibition is not a standard one, and more direct experiments utilizing intracellular experiments would certain be more compelling, although these are not strictly required.</p></disp-quote><p>While this may not be a standard approach, it allowed us to test the prediction of our findings in mature hippocampal slices. We have followed as closely as possible guidelines from other published works measuring inhibition in hippocampal slice (Younts et al., 2016).
