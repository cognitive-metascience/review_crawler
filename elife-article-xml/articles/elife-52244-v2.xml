sleep-wake regulation. However, the ensemble dynamics underlying sleep regulation remain poorly understood. Here, we show slow, state-predictive brainstem ensemble dynamics and state-dependent interactions between the brainstem and the hippocampus in mice. On a timescale of seconds to minutes, brainstem populations can predict pupil dilation and vigilance states and exhibit longer prediction power than hippocampal CA1 neurons. On a timescale of sub-seconds, pontine waves (P-waves) are accompanied by synchronous firing of brainstem neurons during both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep. Crucially, P-waves functionally interact with CA1 activity in a state-dependent manner: during NREM sleep, hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) precede P-waves. On the other hand, P-waves during REM sleep are phase-locked with ongoing theta oscillations and are followed by burst firing of CA1 neurons. This state-dependent global coordination between the brainstem and hippocampus implicates distinct functional roles of sleep.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Though almost all animals sleep, its exact purpose remains an enigma. This is particularly true for the period of sleep where people dream most vividly, which is known as rapid eye movement sleep or REM sleep for short. In addition to the eye movements that give it its name, during this phase of sleep, the pupils of the eyes become smaller, muscles relax and neurons in part of the brain activate in a regular, repeating way known as pontine waves or P-waves.</p><p>The brainstem is a key brain region that helps the body determine when it is time to sleep and when it is time to be awake. It is found at the back of the brain, and connects the brain to the spinal cord, serving as a conduit for nerve signals to and from the rest of the body. However, it was not clear how the brainstem’s activity during sleep interacts with other brain regions that are important in the sleep process, such as the hippocampus.</p><p>REM sleep is not unique to humans; in fact, it occurs in all mammals. Tsunematsu et al. studied mice to better understand the role of the brainstem during sleep. In the experiments, the brain waves, muscle tone and pupil sizes of the mice were monitored, while a probe inserted into the brainstem of the mice measured the activity of the neurons. Analysis of the probe data could predict changes in pupil size ten seconds beforehand and transitions between wakefulness, REM sleep and non-REM sleep up to sixty seconds in advance. This long timescale suggests that there are a number of complex interactions following brainstem activity that lead to the changes in sleep state.</p><p>Tsunematsu et al. were also able to detect P-waves for the first time in mice and found that they are timed with activity from the hippocampus depending on the sleep state. During REM sleep, the P-waves precede the hippocampal activity, while during non-REM sleep, they follow it. These results further imply that the two sleep states serve different purposes. The detection of P-waves in mice shows that they are similar to other mammals that have previously been studied. Further studies in mice could help to provide more insight into the mechanisms of sleep and the purpose of the different stages.</p></abstract><kwd-group

For example, cortical slow oscillations, sleep spindles and hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) are prominent neural events during NREM sleep, whereas theta oscillations and ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) or pontine (P) waves are seen during REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steriade, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Montgomery et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buzsáki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jouvet, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Steriade et al., 1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Callaway et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Datta, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bizzi and Brooks, 1963</xref>). Although neural ensemble dynamics underlying these sleep-related neural events in the thalamus and the cortex including the hippocampus have been well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steriade, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buzsáki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Steriade et al., 1993a</xref>), little is known about population activity within the brainstem. To achieve a better understanding of the functional roles of sleep states, it is essential to characterize state-dependent changes in brainstem network activity and their functional interactions with cortical regions across sleep states.</p><p>The brainstem, including the midbrain, pons and medulla has long been implicated in the sleep-wake cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jouvet, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saper et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Weber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weber and Dan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luppi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scammell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Héricé et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu and Dan, 2019</xref>). It contains various nuclei, each of which consists of diverse cell-types and exhibits state-dependent firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Weber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weber and Dan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luppi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scammell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Héricé et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu and Dan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). However, how brainstem populations act in concert is a question that remains poorly explored. For example, the extent to which their activity exhibits anticipatory dynamics for ongoing vigilant states is still unclear. In addition, it is also unclear whether and how brainstem populations functionally interact with various neural oscillations or events in the cortex across sleep states. Characterizing these physiological properties is crucial to uncover the roles of brainstem populations in sleep regulation and ultimately in the functions of sleep states.</p><p>In the present study, we adopt several in vivo electrophysiological approaches in mice to investigate state-dependent ensemble dynamics in the brainstem, mainly the pons. We show that, on a timescale of seconds to minutes, brainstem neurons show state-dependent firing with cell type-specificity. They also have a longer predictive power for vigilance states than hippocampal CA1 neurons. On a timescale of sub-seconds, we find state-dependent functional interactions between the brainstem and the hippocampus, with a focus on P-waves. During NREM sleep, the timing of P-waves is phase-locked with various cortical oscillations and hippocampal SWRs precede P-waves. During REM sleep, P-waves co-occur with hippocampal theta oscillations and precede burst firing of hippocampal neurons. These results imply that brainstem populations not only play a regulatory role in the sleep-wake cycle, but also contribute to global state-dependent dynamics across brain regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Brainstem population recording across sleep-wake cycles</title><p>To investigate the state-dependency of brainstem population activity, we inserted a silicon probe into the mouse brainstem in a head-fixed condition, and performed simultaneous monitoring of cortical electroencephalograms (EEGs), electromyograms (EMGs) and pupil dilation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Thus, we confirmed highly diverse state-dependent firing in the brainstem.</p><p>Because the recorded neurons were distributed across various nuclei in the brainstem, it was difficult to determine their state-dependency in each nucleus.

To verify this, we performed in vivo fiber photometry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals from pontine cholinergic neurons by expressing GCaMP6s in freely behaving mice (four animals, 12 recording sessions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

However, it is still unclear how pupil dilation changes around the transition of sleep-wake states and to what extent the activities of brainstem neurons as a population can predict pupil dilation quantitatively. To address these issues, we analyzed datasets from head-fixed mice either with silicon probe recordings from the brainstem (six animals, six recording sessions) or the hippocampus (two animals, three recording sessions), or with field potential recording from the brainstem with a bipolar electrode (six animals, nine recording sessions).</p><p>As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yüzgeç et al., 2018</xref>), head-fixed mice kept their eyes open, allowing us to monitor pupil dilation across states along with cortical EEG and EMG. The effects of behavioral states on pupil diameter was statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, F<sub>2, 53</sub> = 220.33, p&lt;0.0001, one-way ANOVA), with pupil diameter being constricted during REM sleep and dilated during wakefulness.</p><p>With respect to pupil dilation dynamics across states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), pupil diameter dynamically fluctuated during wakefulness and gradually constricted during NREM sleep. Typically, 10–20 s before REM sleep, the pupil diameter would further decrease and was fully constricted during REM sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Taking advantage of the simultaneous recording of neural population activity and pupil monitoring, we examined how brainstem neurons can predict pupil dilation. First, we predicted pupil dilation on the basis of the activity of individual neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) by applying a linear regression analysis. Because it was expected that the preceding neural activity can better predict pupil dilation, we systematically shifted the temporal relationship between spike trains and pupil diameter (see 'Materials and methods'). As expected, most of the neurons showed asymmetric profiles of R<sup>2</sup> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Although individual profiles were diverse, the average profile showed brainstem neuron activities that were predictive of pupil diameter around 10 s in advance. We also predicted pupil diameter on the basis of simultaneously recorded brainstem neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) by applying a multiple linear regression analysis. As with individual neurons, we observed an asymmetric profile of predictability. Thus, changes in brainstem neural activity preceded those in pupil diameter. Thereby, brainstem populations have predictive power for pupil diameter.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Longer predictability of brainstem ensembles for vigilance states</title><p>Next, we examined whether and to what extent brainstem neurons can predict sleep-wake states. To address this, first, we extracted the features of neural population activity by applying non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), a technique that finds compact and easily interpretable representations of neural population activity in the form of parts-based activity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee and Seung, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Onken et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>) (see 'Materials and methods'). Overall firing rate reflected state changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), whereas NMF was able to extract several modules that captured state-dependent firing patterns across neurons in an unsupervised fashion. For example, module 1 represented REM-on activity, whereas module 2 was activated at the end of NREM sleep and module 3 was most active during wakefulness. Indeed, the weights in each module were consistent with the state-dependency of individual neural firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Besides modules capturing firing patterns across neurons, NMF also yielded the activation coefficients of these modules. We noticed that the dynamics of these activation coefficients show predictive activity: in the case of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, the activation coefficients of modules 1 and 2 gradually built up during REM and NREM sleep, respectively. Therefore, we hypothesized that brainstem population activity exhibits not just state-dependency, but also predictive power for behavioral states (i.e., wakefulness, NREM sleep and REM sleep). To test this, we took the activation coefficient profiles from the three modules and classified behavioral states by training a linear classifier, with systematic time shifting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Brainstem populations showed predictive activity tens of seconds before transitions into all three behavioral states.</p><p>Does this predictive activity last longer in brainstem populations than in other brain regions? Of many brain regions, hippocampal neurons are well known to exhibit state-dependent firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buzsáki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mizuseki and Miyawaki, 2017</xref>), but they are less likely to contribute to the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle directly. Hence, hippocampal neurons could serve as a reference to assess the ability of brainstem populations to predict behavioral states. To examine whether brainstem populations exhibit predictive activity over a longer period than do hippocampal populations, we performed the same analysis for neural activity in the hippocampal CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Although CA1 neurons also had predictive power for several tens of seconds, the profile was relatively short-lasting compared to that of brainstem neurons. Thus, brainstem neurons have longer-lasting predictive power for behavioral states than hippocampal CA1 neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Brainstem population activity underlying P-waves during NREM and REM sleep</title><p>On a timescale of seconds to minutes, brainstem neurons show diverse but specific state-dependent firing and have predictive power for pupil dilation and behavioral states. To investigate brainstem neural firing on a sub-second timescale, we focused on P-waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Callaway et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Datta, 1997</xref>). Although these sub-second neural events in the brainstem have long been recognized, the underlying neural ensembles and relations to other sleep-related oscillations are not fully understood.</p><p>Taking advantage of our dataset, we first examined whether the mouse brainstem exhibits P-waves like those observed in other mammalian species. We implanted a bipolar electrode in the pons (n = 16 recordings) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and monitored LFPs by subtracting signals. During REM sleep, we observed large-amplitude irregular neural events, which often appeared bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> right). We also observed similar, but isolated, neural events during NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> left). These neural events appeared more often during REM sleep (p&lt;0.0001, two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Intriguingly, the frequency of these events gradually increased during NREM to REM sleep transitions and decreased during REM sleep to wakefulness transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Because these characteristics generally resemble those in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Callaway et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Datta, 1997</xref>), we concluded that these neural events are P-waves in mice.</p><p>P-waves can also be seen in silicon probe recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Similar large-amplitude, irregular neural events were observed in subtracted and filtered LFPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Many of the simultaneously recorded brainstem neurons fired during P-waves. To assess this tendency, we pooled the peri-event firing profiles of all recorded brainstem neurons around P-waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>). The firing profiles were aligned at the trough timing of P-waves. A subset of neurons showed peak firing at the falling phase of P-waves. This tendency was consistent between NREM and REM sleep with respect to neural firing within the brainstem, suggesting that P-waves during NREM sleep (P-waves<sup>NREM</sup>) are equivalent to P-waves during REM sleep (P-waves<sup>REM</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>State-dependent functional interactions between P-waves and cortical activity</title><p>The co-firing of a subset of brainstem neurons underlies P-waves during both NREM and REM sleep. What are the impacts of such neural events on other brain regions? Are P-waves associated with any other sleep-related neural events? Addressing these questions would provide insight into the functions of P-waves. To this end, first, we investigated the relationship between P-waves and cortical EEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). During NREM sleep, P-waves were associated with multiple oscillatory components. Averaged P-wave-triggered cortical EEGs exhibited multiple phasic components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), which consisted of delta (1–4 Hz), theta (~7 Hz) and beta (15 ~ 30 Hz) frequencies. To examine this trend further, we assessed the phase relationship between P-wave timing and cortical oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We found significant phase preferences of P-wave timing (p&lt;0.01, Rayleigh test). We further assessed this phase-locking activity by computing resultant vector length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), which is a descriptive circular statistic and represents the length of the mean resultant vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berens, 2009</xref>): the closer this value is to one, the more concentrated is the phase coupling. We found larger phase modulation at delta and beta ranges.</p><p>On the other hand, P-waves<sup>REM</sup> exhibited distinct associations with cortical oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>). We observed significant phase modulation at theta range (p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), indicating that two prominent neural markers in REM sleep, that is, theta oscillations and P-waves, are temporally organized. We found that the effect of sleep states on these phase-locking activities was statistically significant (F<sub>1,179</sub> = 4.90, p&lt;0.05, two-way ANOVA). We also computed effect size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The effect was larger at the delta range during NREM sleep. Hence, the temporal coupling between P-waves and cortical oscillations was modified by sleep states.</p><p>Next, we investigated the relationship between P-waves and hippocampal CA1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We started by assessing the phase relationship between hippocampal LFPs and P-waves across frequency bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We found that the effect of sleep states on the resultant vector length was significant (F<sub>1,79</sub> = 4.00, p&lt;0.05, two-way ANOVA). The timing of P-waves was strongly phase-locked at the theta range (~7 Hz) in both sleep states and there was no significant difference in the resultant vector length across frequencies, but we observed stronger phase modulations in high frequency (≥30 Hz) components during REM sleep based on the effect size. We further examined underlying spiking activity in the hippocampus CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Intriguingly, although a subset of CA1 neurons fired most strongly around the timing of P-waves during both NREM and REM sleep, the temporal order between CA1 neural firing and P-waves was state-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>): during NREM sleep, co-firing of hippocampal neurons was followed by P-waves, whereas P-waves were followed by burst firing in a subset of CA1 neurons during REM sleep. To test the hypothesis that co-firing of CA1 neurons during NREM sleep may reflect SWRs, we detected high-frequency ripple events based on hippocampal LFPs to assess the temporal relationship between ripples and P-waves<sup>NREM</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). We found that ripple events preceded P-waves during NREM sleep across all of four recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> <italic>inset</italic>) (p&lt;0.05, <italic>t</italic>-test). Thus, P-waves are strongly associated with hippocampal activity in both sleep states. However, these associations are state-dependent.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although state-dependent neural ensembles have been intensively characterized in the cortex including the hippocampus, little is known about state-dependent brainstem ensembles.

These relatively slow dynamics may be related to observations from optogenetic experiments in which the effect of optogenetic stimulation on state transitions often emerges tens of seconds after stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamantidis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Van Dort et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsunematsu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsunematsu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>On a timescale of sub-seconds, we characterized P-waves in the mouse, with respect to underlying neural firing as well as associated neocortical and hippocampal activities. P-waves typically appear during REM sleep and less often during NREM sleep. P-waves in both sleep states are accompanied by synchronous firing of brainstem neurons, suggesting that underlying local activity during P-waves is similar between sleep states. However, the relationship of P-waves to cortical neural events is state-dependent: the timing of P-waves<sup>NREM</sup> are phase-locked to various cortical oscillations and hippocampal SWRs precede P-waves<sup>NREM</sup>, suggesting that P-waves<sup>NREM</sup> are part of the brain-wide neural events triggered by SWRs. During REM sleep, P-waves are phase-locked most strongly at theta frequency in both the neocortex and hippocampus. Crucially, P-waves precede firing in a subset of hippocampal CA1 neurons, suggesting that P-waves<sup>REM</sup> may trigger brain-wide neural events. Thus, P-waves are part of the state-dependent coordinated activity across the brain.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Technical considerations</title><p>State-dependent activity in the brainstem has been described over the past several decades by using various methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pace-Schott and Hobson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Datta and Maclean, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Steriade and McCarley, 1990</xref>). The present study utilized a silicon probe to monitor activity from multiple neurons simultaneously with high temporal resolution. This approach allowed us (1) to quantify the state dependency of brainstem neural ensemble dynamics on a timescale of seconds to minutes, (2) to decode vigilance states on the basis of population activity, and (3) to characterize neural population activity underlying P-waves for the first time. However, because silicon probe recording alone has a limitation in identifying cell types, additional approaches, such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) or electrophysiology with optogenetic tagging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Weber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yague et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), can complement this approach in order to determine how specific types of neurons contribute to state-dependent neural ensembles in the brainstem.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Slow dynamics of brainstem ensemble dynamics</title><p>Our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> are consistent with the notion that brainstem populations play a regulatory role in pupil dilation and constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larsen and Waters, 2018</xref>), as well as in global brain states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Héricé et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luppi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Steriade et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weber and Dan, 2016</xref>). Crucially, the asymmetric profile of the predictability of pupil diameter suggests that the modulation of brainstem activity precedes pupil dilation, rather than being simply correlated to it.</p><p>The long-lasting predictability of brainstem populations for behavioral states is not trivial. Intriguingly, the slow (30–60 s) timescale recalls us the timescale observed in some of optogenetic experiments: although optogenetic stimulation can modulate neural firing at a millisecond resolution, the effect of optical stimulation on state transitions typically emerges tens of seconds after stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamantidis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Van Dort et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). The exact mechanism is still unknown, but we hypothesize that the modulation of neural activity in the brainstem occurs tens of seconds before global brain state transitions from one state to another. In other words, each state emerges from complex interactions across various regions of the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>P-waves in mice</title><p>Although PGO or P-waves have been studied since the 1960s in several mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Callaway et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Datta, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bizzi and Brooks, 1963</xref>), to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to characterize P-waves in mice. Given the growing importance of mice as an animal model for sleep research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Héricé et al., 2019</xref>), the confirmation of P-waves in mice is important for further interrogation with respect to the generation mechanism and function of P-waves.</p><p>We have noticed several similarities and differences in P-waves between mice and other species. First, the waveform of P-waves in mice is generally consistent with those in other species, such as cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Callaway et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeannerod et al., 1965</xref>) and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Datta, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farber et al., 1980</xref>), suggesting that underlying neural ensembles may be similar across species. Indeed, the phasic firing just before (&lt;25 ms before) the trough of P-waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) resembles the observations in cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McCarley et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Steriade et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sakai and Jouvet, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nelson et al., 1983</xref>). In the near future, it would be interesting to extend our approach further to explore how activity propagates across brainstem neurons during P-waves by identifying cell-types. Second, the frequency of P-waves during REM sleep is generally consistent across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Datta, 1997</xref>). However, we have also noticed that the frequency of detected P-waves varied across our experiments. This may be explained by variation in either the REM sleep quality or the electrode positions. Further analysis of P-waves across brainstem nuclei will provide insights into their relationship with sleep homeostasis and the mechanism of P-wave genesis in mice. Datta and his colleagues performed a series of pioneering studies and reported species differences in the site of P-wave genesis between cats and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Datta et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Datta and Hobson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Datta et al., 1992</xref>): the caudolateral peribrachial area was identified as the induction site of P-waves (PGO waves) in cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Datta and Hobson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Datta et al., 1992</xref>), whereas the subcoeruleus nucleus was identified in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Datta et al., 1998</xref>). It will be important to revisit this issue in mice by adopting modern technologies. Third, the temporal evolution of P-wave frequency is generally similar in mice and cats: the frequency of PGO-waves gradually increases before the transition of NREM to REM sleep in cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Steriade et al., 1989</xref>). Although it was weak, a similar tendency was observed in our recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Rather, the frequency of P-waves increases during REM sleep. This subtle difference may be explained by anatomical differences between species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Datta, 2012</xref>). These species differences may also imply differences in the function of P-waves between species. Finally, although P-waves appear more frequently during REM sleep, it is important to note that similar neural events also occur during NREM sleep. Given state-dependent interactions between P-waves and cortical oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), the mechanisms of P-wave genesis are probably distinct.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>State-dependent global coordination of neural ensembles</title><p>The temporal correlation between P-waves and hippocampal theta rhythms during REM sleep is consistent with previous studies in cats and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karashima et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karashima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Karashima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sakai et al., 1973</xref>). The phase-locked activity with fast gamma (80–110 Hz) in the hippocampus may relate to the recent observation that demonstrated the close association between local hippocampal theta and fast gamma events and brain-wide hyperemic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergel et al., 2018</xref>). Because a number of hippocampal CA1 neurons fire immediately after P-waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), P-waves may play a role in the regulation of hippocampal ensemble dynamics as well as in brain-wide events during REM sleep.</p><p>On the other hand, the picture during NREM sleep seems to be distinct. Because SWRs precede P-waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), and because SWRs are known to be generated within hippocampal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>), SWRs play a leading role in brain-wide sub-second neural events, including P-waves. These state-dependent brain-wide neural ensembles imply that different sleep states have distinct functional roles.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>A total of 21 mice were used in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and were housed individually with a 12 hr:12 hr light/dark cycle (light on hours: 7:00–19:00). Mice had ad libitum access to food and water. All experiments were performed during the light period.

Body temperature was maintained at 37°C with a feedback temperature controller (40–90–8C, FHC). Lidocaine (2%, 0.1–0.3 mg) was administered subcutaneously at the site of incision. Two bone screws were implanted onto the skull as electrodes for cortical EEGs, and twisted wires were inserted into the neck muscle as electrodes for EMG. Another bone screw was implanted onto the cerebellum as a ground/reference.</p><p>For pontine EEG recording, bipolar electrodes were bilaterally implanted in the medial parabrachial nucleus of the pons (5.1 mm posterior, 1.2 mm lateral from bregma, 3.2 mm depth from brain surface). The bipolar electrodes consisted of 75 or 100 µm diameter stainless wires (FE631309, Advent Research Materials and FE205850, Goodfellow, respectively). The tip of two glued wires were separated by 0.5–1.0 mm vertically to differentiate EEG signals. All electrodes were connected to connectors (SS-132-T-2-N, Semtec) and securely attached onto the skull with dental cement. A pair of nuts was also attached onto the skull with dental cement as a head-post. After the surgery, Carprofen (Rimadyl, 5 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneously.</p><p>For brainstem or hippocampal silicon probe recording, in addition to bone screws for cortical EEGs and a ground/reference, a pair of nuts was attached onto the skull with dental cement as a head-post. After the head-post surgery, the animals were left to recover for at least 5 days. During the habituation period, the animals were placed in a head-fixed apparatus, by securing them by the head-post and placing the animal into an acrylic tube. This procedure was continued for at least 5 days, during which the duration of head-fixing was gradually extended from 10 to 120 min. A day after the habituation period, the animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and a craniotomy to insert the silicon probe into the brainstem and hippocampus was performed. Two craniotomies were performed, one on the left hemisphere (4.0 mm to 5.5 mm posterior, 1.0 to 1.3 mm lateral from bregma) for the brainstem recording and a second also on the left hemisphere (2.0 mm posterior, 1.5 mm lateral from bregma) for the hippocampus recording. To protect and prevent the brain from drying, the surface was covered with biocompatible sealants (Kwik-Sil and Kwik-Cast, WPI). The following day, the animals were placed in the head-fixed apparatus for electrophysiological recording as described below.</p><p>For fiber photometry experiments, cortical EEG and EMG electrodes were implanted as described above and connected to a 2-by-3 piece connector (SLD-112-T-12, Semtec). Two additional anchor screws were implanted bilaterally over the parietal bone to provide stability and a small portion of a drinking straw was placed horizontally between the anchor screws and the connector. The viral vector (AAV5-CAG-flex-GCaMP6s-WPRE-SV40, Penn Vector Core; titer 8.3 × 10<sup>12</sup> GC/ml) was microinjected (500 nl at 30 ml/min) (Nanoliter2010, WPI) to target the PPT/LDT area (−4.5 mm posterior, 1 mm lateral from bregma and 3.25 mm depth from brain surface). The micropipette was left in the brain for an additional 10 min and then slowly raised up. An optic fiber cannula (CFM14L05, Thorlabs) was then implanted 3 mm deep from the surface of the brain and all components were secured to each other and to the skull with dental cement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>In vivo electrophysiological experiments in a head-fixed condition</title><p>Experimental procedures were as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lyngholm and Sakata, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yague et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, all electrophysiological recordings were performed in a single-walled acoustic chamber (MAC-3, IAC Acoustics) with the interior covered with 3 inches (~ 7.5 cm) of acoustic absorption foam. The animals were placed in the same head-fixed apparatus, by securing them by the head-post and placing the animal into an acrylic tube. During the entire recording, the animals were not required to do anything actively. For pontine EEG recording, cortical EEG, EMG and pontine EEG signals were amplified (HST/32 V-G20 and PBX3, Plexon), filtered (0.1 Hz low cut), digitized at a sampling rate of 1 kHz and recorded using LabVIEW software (National Instruments). Recording was performed for 5 hr from 9:00 to 14:00. For brainstem or hippocampal silicon probe recording, a 32-channel four shank silicon probe (A4 × 8–5 mm-100-400-177 for brainstem recording or Buzsaki32 for hippocampus recording) was inserted slowly with a manual micromanipulator (SM-25A, Narishige) into the brainstem (3.75 mm – 4.3 mm from the brain surface) or the hippocampus (1.55 mm – 1.85 mm from the brain surface). Probes were inserted perpendicularly with respect to the brain surface. Broadband signals were amplified (HST/32 V-G20 and PBX3, Plexon) relative to the screw on the cerebellum, filtered (0.1 Hz low cut), digitized at 20 kHz and recorded using LabVIEW software (National Instruments). The recording session was initiated &gt;1 hr after the probe was inserted to its target depth, to stabilize neural signals. Recording preparation started from 8:00 and terminated by 15:00.

A 470 nm LED (M470L3, Thorlabs) was used to extract a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signal and a 405 nm LED (M405L3, Thorlabs) was used to obtain a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent isosbestic signal. Light from the LEDs was directed through excitation filters (FB470-10, FB405-10, Thorlabs) and a dichroic mirror to the fiber launch (DMLP425R and KT110/M, respectively). The fiber launch was connected to a multimode patch cable (M82L01, Thorlabs), which attached to an implantable optic fiber on the mouse via a ceramic mating sleeve (CFM14L05 and ADAF1, respectively). Light emissions from GCaMP6s expressing neurons were then collected back through the optic fiber and directed through a detection path, passing a dichroic mirror (MD498) to reach a photodetector (NewFocus 2151, Newport). A National Instruments DAQ (NI USB-6211) and custom-written LabVIEW software were used to control the LEDs and to acquire fluorescence data at 1 kHz. LEDs were alternately turned on and off at 40 Hz in a square pulse pattern. Electrophysiology signals were recorded at 1 KHz using an interface board (RHD2000, Intan Technologies) and connected to the mouse via an amplifier (RHD2132, Intan Technologies). Mice were habituated to being handled and tethered to the freely behaving system over several consecutive days. Mice were scruffed and the straw on the headcap slotted into a custom-made clamp, to keep the head still and to absorb any vertical forces when connecting the electrophysiology and fiber photometry tethers to the headcap. Once connected, mice were placed in an open top Perspex box (21.5 cm x 47 cm x 20 cm depth) lined with absorbent paper, bedding and some baby food.

The brains were removed and immersed in the above fixative solution overnight at 4°C and then immersed in a 30% sucrose in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) for at least 2 days. The brains were quickly frozen and were cut into coronal or sagittal sections with a sliding microtome (SM2010R, Leica) or with a cryostat (CM3050, Leica), each with a thickness of 50 or 100 µm.

For ChAT-IRES-Cre::Ai32 mice, to confirm the position of ChAT-expressing neurons, we performed GFP and ChAT double staining.

For training, a single file containing all states (AW, NREM sleep and REM sleep) was chosen on the basis of the sleep score. This initial step was critical to reflect the dynamic range of pupil dilation or constriction in each experiment. After choosing the file, 20 frames were randomly selected to mark the left and right edges of the pupil manually. ImageJ was used for this manual marking. Using these labeled frames, the deep convolutional neural network was then trained, and all of the video files were processed to detect the left and right edges of pupil. After processing, visual inspection was performed by generating a down-sampled (50–100 times) video clip. The same procedure was applied across all recordings. To compute pupil diameter, the distance between the left and right edges of the pupil was calculated across frames. The profile was filtered (low-pass filter at 0.5 Hz) and z-scored. To compute eye movement, the middle point of pupil was determined and the distance of the middle points between two continuous frames was calculated. The profile was then normalized by the maximal value of the profile.

Photobleaching was estimated by a single exponential curve and the difference between the fluorescent signal trace and the estimate was further low-pass filtered at 4 Hz. To estimate moving artifacts, the filtered 405 nm signals were linearly scaled based on the filtered 470 nm signals using a linear regression. To estimate dF/F signals, then the 470 nm signals were subtracted from the scaled 405 nm signals.

To evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the linear model, the R-squared value was calculated.

The sequence of MSEs were normalized.</p><p>To find interpretable patterns in the population activity, we adopted non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee and Seung, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Onken et al., 2016</xref>). NMF takes a non-negative data matrix and factorizes this matrix into two non-negative matrices. One of these matrices, the module matrix contains patterns, whereas the other matrix, the activation coefficient matrix, indicates how these patterns need to be weighted in order to reconstruct the original data matrix. Owing to the non-negativity constraints, NMF yields a parts-based representation: one pattern cannot be canceled by another pattern. For a data matrix representing images of faces, the method yields face patterns, such as eyes, eyebrows and noses in the module matrix and non-negative weights of these patterns in the activation coefficient matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee and Seung, 1999</xref>). For neural population activity, NMF can decompose spike counts into ‘space’ (neurons) modules and the activation coefficients of these modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Onken et al., 2016</xref>). For this purpose, spike trains were discretized by binning them into 4 s intervals, which were equivalent to the time window for sleep scoring (see above).

In each run, we randomly initialized <bold>W</bold> and <bold>H</bold> and applied the update rules up to 100 times or until convergence. For each decomposition, we performed 10 runs and selected the run with the lowest Kullback–Leibler divergence. The <italic>m</italic> columns of <bold>W</bold> then represented the <italic>m</italic> space modules and the <italic>m</italic> corresponding rows of <bold>H</bold> represented their activation coefficients for each time bin.</p><p>To select the number of space modules <italic>m</italic>, we evaluated how many modules were needed, so that additional modules did not significantly improve the decomposition. Our procedure was similar to that used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Marchis et al. (2013)</xref>. We generated surrogate data by shuffling all of the elements of the matrix <bold>R</bold> and then decomposed the shuffled matrix in the same way as we previously decomposed the original <bold>R</bold>. We quantified the quality of a decomposition using the variance accounted for (VAF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark et al., 2010</xref>). Starting with one module, we incremented the number of modules until the VAF of the unshuffled data decomposition did not exceed 3/4 of the average VAF of the decompositions of 100 shuffles.</p><p>To classify three behavioral states on the basis of the activation coefficients, a linear classifier was trained by fitting a multivariate normal density to each state with 10-fold cross validation. Then classification performance was calculated. This procedure was repeated by shifting the time relationship between the activation coefficients and sleep scores.</p><p>To detect P-waves, two EEG or LFP signals in the brainstem were subtracted and filtered (5–30 Hz band-pass filter). If the signals cross a threshold, the event was recognized as P-waves. To determine the detection threshold, a 1 min segment of the subtracted signals was extracted from the longest NREM sleep episode for a reliable estimation of stable noise level. The noise level was estimated by computing root-mean-square (RMS) values in every 10-ms time window. The threshold was defined as mean + 5 x standard deviation of the RMS values. The timing of P-waves was defined as the timing of the negative peak.</p><p>The phase analysis was essentially the same as that described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yague et al., 2017</xref>). Cortical EEG or hippocampal LFP signals were used for this analysis. For hippocampal LFPs, signals from two separate channels were subtracted to minimize volume conduction. To derive band-limited signals in different frequency bands, a Kaiser finite impulse response filter was used with sharp transition bandwidth of 1 Hz, pass-band ripple of 0.01 dB and stop-band attenuation of 50 dB. For filtering, the MATLAB ‘filtfilt’ function was used. In the present study, the following bands were assessed: [2–4], [4–7], [7–10], [10–15], [15–20], [20–30], [30–50], [50–80], [80–110], and [110–150] Hz. The instantaneous phase of each band was estimated from the Hilbert transform and the phase of P-wave occurrence was computed. To quantify the relationship between P-waves and EEG/LFP phase, the percentage of P-waves elicited in each phase bin was calculated. The resultant vector length was computed as an absolute value of mean resultant vector <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> by using the <italic>circ_r</italic> function of the CircStats Toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berens, 2009</xref>). Rayleigh’s test for non-uniformity of circular data was performed to assess the statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) of the non-uniformity of the P-wave vs EEG/LFP phase distribution.</p><p>To detect ripples in the hippocampus, LFP signals from the channel that detected spiking activity were used. Band-limited signals at 140–250 Hz were computed by using a Kaiser finite impulse response filter (see above). Two sequences of RMS values were calculated with two different time window: 2 s (long RMS) and 8 ms (short RMS). If the short RMS exceeds four times larger long RMS for 8 ms, then signals were recognized as a ripple event. To quantify the asymmetry of the cross-correlogram between SWRs and P-waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), the asymmetry index was defined as: (<italic>N<sub>pre</sub> – N<sub>post</sub></italic>)/(<italic>N<sub>pre</sub> + N<sub>post</sub></italic>), where <italic>N<sub>pre</sub></italic> and <italic>N<sub>post</sub></italic> are the number of SWRs 100 ms before and after P-waves, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were presented as mean ± SEM unless otherwise stated.

light on a long-standing question of how pontine-wave (P-wave) activity interacts with hippocampal network activity patterns during non-REM and REM sleep. Over the last 2 decades, groups of investigators working on hippocampal physiology have argued that SWRs are the primary physiological mechanism underlying sleep-associated memory consolidation. Yet, another group of researchers have argued that the P-wave is the primary physiological activity for sleep-associated memory consolidation. This electrophysiological study correlates pontine neuronal ensemble dynamics during P-waves with hippocampal SWRs during non-REM sleep. Thus, the results of the present study reveal an important link between P-waves and SWRs. This study also shows, for the first time, that the P-waves are present in mice. The characterization of P-waves in mice is expected to pave the way for future studies of specific P-wave mechanisms of generation as well as impacting a broad range of studies that address state-specific brain stem influences on neuronal ensemble dynamics in higher brain regions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;State-dependent pontine ensemble dynamics and interactions with cortex across sleep states&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Subimal Datta (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The current title of the manuscript is 'State-dependent pontine ensembles dynamics.…', and the Abstract and main text refer to &quot;pontine populations&quot; and &quot;pontine neurons&quot;. However, for the majority of analysis, a mixture of brainstem neurons including neurons in the midbrain and medulla were used. If the authors would like to uncover effects that are specific to pons, they should use only neurons recorded from pons. In that case, detailed histological verification would be required for each animal. A histological analysis appears in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, but it is only provided for one animal and with low resolution; therefore, it is impossible to determine from this image from which brain stem structure the neurons were recorded. Relatedly, Figure 1—figure supplement 1 refers to &quot;Neurons recorded from pontine cholinergic nuclei&quot;, yet histological analyses verifying that these neurons were recorded from pontine cholinergic nuclei are missing.</p><p>2) The relationship of the present work to previous work requires further elaboration. Specific points related to this point are listed below:</p><p>a) In the cat, PGO-waves have been recorded in the lateral geniculate nucleus and in many other parts of the forebrain. The pons has been suspected to be the origin of the first component of the PGO waves in the forebrain and occipital cortex. However, in the rat, the PGO-wave is absent in the lateral geniculate and other forebrain areas. Therefore, the functions of P-waves in the rats and mice may not be similar as the functions of PGO waves in the cat. This possibility should be acknowledged in this manuscript. The P-wave generator in the rat (1998) and P-wave/PGO-wave in generator in the cat (1992) were shown to be in two different areas in the pons. This study, for the first time, shows that the P-waves are present in mice and will likely encourage future investigations to uncover mechanisms of P-wave generation in mice, which may be different than cats and rats.</p><p>b) The anticipatory relationship between neuronal activity in the pons and state changes has been shown previously by Steriade, McCarley, Hobson, Datta and colleagues (reviewed in the classic book, &quot;Brain control of wakefulness and sleep&quot; and other review articles by these authors. See also Steriade, Sakai and Jouvet 1984). Karashima and colleagues have described the relationship between pontine activity and hippocampal theta in cats (Brain Res 2002 958: 347-358, not cited) and rats (Brain Res 2005 1051: 50-6, not cited).</p><p>c) Relevant studies involving single-unit recordings that described PGO burst neurons (e.g. McCarley, Nelson and Hobson, 1978) should be discussed.</p><p>3) The authors recorded neuronal activity during sleep from head-fixed mice, whose eyes were open during sleep session. A point was raised that mice naturally sleep with their eyes closed. Also, the structure and properties of sleep are likely different between freely moving (non-fixed) and head-fixed animals. Free-moving mice show NREM-REM-NREM cycles in addition to the NREM-REM-AWAKE sequence. The authors only showed the NREM-REM-AWAKE transition and not a NREM-REM-NREM transition. The latter transition may not occur because sleep in head-fixed animals differs from that of free-moving animals. Therefore, the authors should compare and contrast the properties (e.g., duration, EMG, LFP of REM and non-REM, cycles and structure of NREM-REM-NREM) of sleep in head-fixed animals with those properties that have been reported in freely moving animals.</p><p>4) It is unclear whether the differences between REM and NREM in Figure 6D, E and Figure 7B are statistically significant.</p><p>5) It is unclear from which area (CA1, CA3, DG) of the (dorsal or ventral) hippocampus recordings were obtained.</p><p>6) The authors should clarify what the animals were doing during the awake state.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52244.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The current title of the manuscript is 'State-dependent pontine ensembles dynamics.…', and the Abstract and main text refer to &quot;pontine populations&quot; and &quot;pontine neurons&quot;.

We have added comments in Discussion by referring to the pioneering works in the cat and rat.</p><p>Discussion section:</p><p>“Datta and his colleagues performed a series of pioneering studies and reported species differences in the site of P-wave genesis between cats and rats (Datta et al., 1998, Datta and Hobson, 1995, Datta et al., 1992): the caudolateral peribrachial area was identified as the induction site of P-waves (PGO waves) in cats (Datta and Hobson, 1995, Datta et al., 1992) whereas the subcoeruleus nucleus was identified in rats (Datta et al., 1998). It would be important to revisit this issue in mice by adopting modern technologies.”</p><p>Discussion section:</p><p>“This subtle difference may be explained by anatomical differences between species (Datta, 2012). These species differences may also imply differences in the function of P-waves between species.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The anticipatory relationship between neuronal activity in the pons and state changes has been shown previously by Steriade, McCarley, Hobson, Datta and colleagues (reviewed in the classic book, &quot;Brain control of wakefulness and sleep&quot; and other review articles by these authors. See also Steriade, Sakai and Jouvet, 1984).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out these pioneering works. In the revised manuscript, we have cited the suggested works. In addition, because the present study has utilized population activity to predict vigilance states, we have added a phrase in the Discussion.</p><p>Discussion section:</p><p>“State-dependent activity in the brainstem has been described over the past several decades by using various methods (Pace-Schott and Hobson, 2002, Datta and Maclean, 2007, Steriade and McCarley, 1990).”</p><p>Discussion section:</p><p>“Our results in Figures 3 and 4 are consistent with the notion that brainstem populations play a regulatory role in pupil dilation/constriction (Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005, Larsen and Waters, 2018) as well as global brain states (Brown et al., 2012, Herice et al., 2019, Luppi et al., 2012, Steriade et al., 1984, Weber and Dan, 2016).”</p><p>Discussion section:</p><p>“This approach allowed us (1) to quantify state dependency of brainstem neural ensemble dynamics on a timescale of seconds to minutes, (2) to decode vigilance states based on population activity, and (3) to characterize neural population activity underlying P-waves for the first time.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Karashima and colleagues have described the relationship between pontine activity and hippocampal theta in cats (Brain Res 2002 958: 347-358, not cited) and rats (Brain Res 2005 1051: 50-6, not cited).</p></disp-quote><p>We have cited their publications.</p><p>Discussion section:</p><p>“The temporal correlation between P-waves and hippocampal theta rhythms during REM sleep is consistent with previous studies in cats and rats (Karashima et al., 2002, Karashima et al., 2004, Karashima et al., 2005, Sakai et al., 1973).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Relevant studies involving single-unit recordings that described PGO burst neurons (e.g. McCarley, Nelson and Hobson, 1978) should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, thank you for pointing out this crucial point. We have added comments in Discussion by referring to several relevant works.</p><p>Discussion section:</p><p>“Indeed, the phasic firing just before (&lt;25 ms) the trough of P-waves (Figure 5) resembles the observations in the cat (McCarley et al., 1978, Steriade et al., 1990, Sakai and Jouvet, 1980, Nelson et al., 1983). In the near future, it would be interesting to extend our approach further to explore how activity propagates across brainstem neurons during P-waves by identifying cell-types.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors recorded neuronal activity during sleep from head-fixed mice, whose eyes were open during sleep session. A point was raised that mice naturally sleep with their eyes closed. Also, the structure and properties of sleep are likely different between freely moving (non-fixed) and head-fixed animals. Free-moving mice show NREM-REM-NREM cycles in addition to the NREM-REM-AWAKE sequence. The authors only showed the NREM-REM-AWAKE transition and not a NREM-REM-NREM transition. The latter tranistion may not occur because sleep in head-fixed animals differs from that of free-moving animals. Therefore, the authors should compare and contrast the properties (e.g., duration, EMG, LFP of REM and non-REM, cycles and structure of NREM-REM-NREM) of sleep in head-fixed animals with those properties that have been reported in freely moving animals.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising the important point. Fortunately, our fiber photometry experiments were performed in a tethered condition (hereafter called an “unfixed” condition). Therefore, we had an opportunity to directly compare their sleep architecture, cortical EEGs and EMGs between the head-fixed (n = 24) and unfixed conditions (n = 12). The results have been provided as new Figure 1—figure supplement 3.</p><p>Although the total recording duration was significantly different between the conditions (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A), we have observed that the proportion of awake state was significantly longer in our head-fixed condition (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B). This observation was paralleled with the longer average duration of awake episodes (Figure 1—figure supplement 3C). These results may have been reflecting the nature of the head-fixed condition.</p><p>Regarding the NREM-REM-NREM transition, we observed only one incidence in our dataset (Figure 1—figure supplement 3D). According to literature (e.g., Figure 3 in Mochizuki et al., <italic>J Neurosci</italic> 2004), the REM-NREM transition is indeed very rare in mice. Because of the extremely low probability, we could not analyse such a state transition.</p><p>Please also see Figure 1—figure supplement 3D, in which we did not observe any significant difference in state transition probabilities between the conditions.</p><p>In addition to sleep architecture, we have also compared EEGs and EMGs (Figure 1—figure supplement 3E and F). We observed that EMG power (based on root-mean-square) during wakefulness was significantly larger in the unfixed condition. This may be due to the nature of the condition where the animals could move.</p><p>Overall, although we have observed several differences in sleep architecture and EMG, we did not observe any significant difference in transition probabilities and cortical EEGs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is unclear whether the differences between REM and NREM in Figure 6D, E and Figure 7B are statistically significant.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the issue with lacking statistical analysis in the original manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we have provided the outcomes of two-way ANOVA to assess the effect of brain states on the strength of coupling between P-waves and various oscillations. The effect size has provided an additional measure to quantify the effect of states on the coupling at each frequency band.</p><p>During this assessment, we have learned that resultant vector strength, a descriptive circular statistic, provides more straightforward interpretation regarding the coupling between oscillations and P-waves. Therefore, we have decided to take this measure, rather than the modulation index.</p><p>The results of statistical analysis can be summarised as follows:</p><p>– In Figure 6D, the effect of sleep states on the resultant vector strength was significant (F<sub>(1,179)</sub> = 4.90, p &lt; 0.05, two-way ANOVA).</p><p>– In Figure 7B, the effect of sleep states on the resultant vector strength was significant (F<sub>(1,79)</sub> = 4.00, p &lt; 0.05, two-way ANOVA).</p><p>Results section:</p><p>“We further assessed this phase-locking activity by computing resultant vector length (Figure 6D), which is a descriptive circular statistic and represents the length of the mean resultant vector (Berens, 2009): the closer this value is to one, the more concentrated is the phase coupling.”</p><p>Results section:</p><p>“We found that the effect of sleep states on these phase-locking activity was statistically significant (F1,179 = 4.90, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, two-way ANOVA). We also computed effect size (Figure 6E). The effect was larger at the delta range during NREM sleep. Hence, the temporal coupling between P-waves and cortical oscillations was modified by sleep states.”</p><p>Results section:</p><p>“We found that the effect of sleep states on the resultant vector length was significant (F1,79 = 4.00, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, two-way ANOVA). While the timing of P-waves was strongly phase-locked at the theta range (~7 Hz) in both sleep states and there was no significant difference in the resultant vector length across frequencies, we observed stronger phase modulations in high frequency (≥30 Hz) components during REM sleep based on the effect size.”</p><p>Materials and methods section:</p><p>“The resultant vector length was computed as an absolute value of mean resultant vector 𝑟̅ by using <italic>circ_r</italic> function of CircStats Toolbox (Berens, 2009).”</p><p>Materials and methods section:</p><p>“In Figures 6B and 7B, two-way ANOVA with post-hocHSD criterion was performed. In Figure 7D, two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test was performed.”</p><p>In addition, we have also noticed that we did not provide evidence how the results of Figure 7D (the coupling between P-waves and SWRs during NREM sleep) are replicable.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have addressed this issue by quantifying the asymmetry of the cross-correlogram by measuring the “asymmetry index”. We have found that the number of SWRs was higher before P-waves than that after P-waves across all recordings (<italic>n</italic> = 4) (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <italic>t</italic>-test), indicating that the temporal relationship between P-waves and SWRs was robust.</p><p>Please see Results and Materials and methods, and the inset of Figure 7D.</p><p>Results section:</p><p>“We found that ripple events preceded P-waves during NREM sleep across all of four recordings (Figure 7D inset) (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <italic>t</italic>-test).”</p><p>Materials and methods section:</p><p>“To quantify the asymmetry of the cross-correlogram between SWRs and P-waves (Figure 7D), the asymmetry index was defined as: (<italic>N<sub>pre</sub>- N<sub>post</sub>)/(N<sub>pre</sub></italic>+ <italic>N<sub>post</sub></italic>), where <italic>N<sub>pre</sub></italic>and <italic>N<sub>post</sub></italic>are the number of SWRs 100 ms before and after P-waves, respectively.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is unclear from which area (CA1, CA3, DG) of the (dorsal or ventral) hippocampus recordings were obtained.</p></disp-quote><p>The hippocampus recordings were performed in the dorsal CA1.
