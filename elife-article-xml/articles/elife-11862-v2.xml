Despite evidence for a functional segregation between CA1, CA3 and parahippocampal areas, their specific role within this frame is unclear. Especially, the contribution of CA3 is questionable as very remote memories might be too degraded to be used for pattern completion. To identify the specific role of these areas, we imaged brain activity in mice during retrieval of recent, early remote and very remote fear memories by detecting the immediate-early gene <italic>Arc</italic>. Investigating correlates of the memory trace over an extended period allowed us to report that, in contrast to CA1, CA3 is no longer recruited in very remote retrieval. Conversely, we showed that parahippocampal areas are then maximally engaged. These results suggest a shift from a greater contribution of the trisynaptic loop to the temporoammonic pathway for retrieval.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11862.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11862.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11862.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>There are two schools of thought about what role the hippocampus – a region of the brain – plays in memory.

Some studies showing temporally-graded retrograde amnesia following hippocampal damage in humans have provided evidence that memory becomes hippocampal-independent as it ages and is ultimately ‘stored’ in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez and Squire, 1994</xref>: “the system consolidation theory”). An alternative theory posits that the hippocampus is not only engaged in retrieving recent memories but that it also supports cortical areas in retrieving more remote memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nadel and Moscovitch, 1997</xref>: the ‘multiple trace theory’). The hippocampal subfields CA1 and CA3 are functionally segregated and quite a few studies have investigated their role in recent memory, for example in the retrieval of contextual fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wheeler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Remaud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daumas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rampon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McHugh and Tonegawa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hunsaker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goshen et al., 2011</xref>; see for reviews: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nakazawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kesner, 2007</xref>). However, it is unclear whether they contribute to a similar extent to the retrieval of more remote memories. A recent lesion study in humans indicates that CA1 participates to the retrieval of early and very remote memories (over 30 years-old) in addition to its well-established role for recent memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartsch et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, the role of CA3 in the retrieval of remote memory has not been yet studied in humans and has rarely been investigated in animals for memories older than a month, a period of time roughly equivalent to four years in humans based on life expectancy. Hence, very little is known about the extent to which CA3 contributes to the retrieval of remote and very remote memory. Nonetheless, computational studies suggest that CA3 would contribute to retrieving memories, at least recent and early remote memory, via processes involving the completion of memory representations based on partial or degraded features of these representations (the ‘pattern completion’ theory: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rolls et al., 1997</xref>). However, the memory for single features and/or details that could serve as retrieval cues degrades over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wiltgen and Silva, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wiltgen et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, it raises the question whether CA3 would also contribute to the retrieval of very remote memories or whether its contribution depends on the age of the memory trace.</p><p>In addition, a critical involvement of the parahippocampal region in the retrieval of recent and early remote memory is supported by a handful of animal studies and by recent reports of flat retrograde amnesia in patients with damage extending from the hippocampus to other medial temporal lobe areas. However, these studies did not investigate very remote memory traces while the contribution of cortical areas to the retrieval of memory is thought to be maximal at this stage. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Squire and Alvarez, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gusev et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bucci et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burwell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Izquierdo et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, despite evidence for a functional segregation between parahippocampal areas in terms of spatial/non-spatial information processing and/or of the mediation of distinct memory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mishkin et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eichenbaum et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beer et al., 2013</xref>), no study has yet dissociated the specific contribution of the perirhinal (PER) and postrhinal cortices (POR) nor that of the lateral and medial entorhinal cortices (LEC, MEC) to the retrieval of remote memory.</p><p>Here, we address these issues using a contextual fear conditioning task by testing whether CA3 contributes to a comparable extent as CA1 to the retrieval of recent (1 day and 1 week-old), early remote (1 month-old) and very remote memories (6 months or 1 year-old), the latter corresponding roughly to 20 and 40 years-old memories in humans based on life expectancy which are among the delays the most investigated in studies focusing on very remote memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, we investigated the extent to which the PER, the POR, the LEC and the MEC differentially contribute to the retrieval of these memories. Because performing in-vivo electrophysiology recording simultaneously in six distant brain areas remains a major challenge and using a lesion/inactivation approach in adjacent brain areas in mice was unlikely to yield the spatial resolution necessary to tease apart the specific function of each area, a high-resolution molecular imaging technique (e.g. to the cellular level) was employed. This imaging technique is based on the detection of the expression of the immediate-early gene <italic>Arc</italic> which has been especially linked to plasticity processes and cognitive demands and has been recently used for mapping cognitive processes in the medial temporal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guzowski et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nakamura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sauvage et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–G</xref>). <fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11862.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Contextual fear-conditioning task and memory performance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic description of the task. Mice were exposed to a conditioning chamber they explored freely for 2.5 min after which they received a single 1 mA footshock and were returned to their home-cage after 3.5 additional min. Memory for the association of the footshock with the conditioning context was tested after either 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months or a year by re-exposing the conditioned mice to the conditioning chamber and measuring freezing levels (n=4 mice per delay; n=20 total). Upon completion of the task, mice were sacrificed and their brain processed for imaging. ‘No-shock’ age-matched control groups were exposed to the exact same experimental conditions but did not receive any footshock (n=4 mice per delay; n=20 total).

All shocked groups showed stronger freezing than their no-shock controls at test as shown by differences in freezing levels significantly higher than 0 (a 55.9 ± 3.4% increase in average). Importantly, freezing levels were similar across delays, suggesting that memory strength did not significantly differ as memory aged.

Conditioned mice reexposed to the conditioning chamber froze in average 36 ± 4.7% more than the conditioned mice tested in the new context, demonstrating that the freezing levels were specific to the conditioning chamber.

Of note, statistical analysis of the data with or without normalization, e.g. direct analysis of the% resting time at test, yield the same results. Importantly, this result shows that a difference in memory strength across delays cannot account for the differences in the pattern of activation reported in the present study. In addition, we tested that the freezing behavior observed during re-exposure was specific to the conditioning context by exposing two additional conditioned groups to a new context either 1 day or 1 year after conditioning. In this case, freezing levels were strikingly lower than those observed by re-exposing the mice to the conditioning chamber, demonstrating that the freezing behavior was indeed specific to the conditioning context (one day: conditioning context: 52.4 ± 2.5% vs new context: 19.8 ± 5.9%; one year: conditioning context: 62.5 ± 8.4% vs new context: 21.9 ± 8.385%; both ts&gt;3.9 and ps&lt;0.007; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Of note, a time-dependent generalization of the freezing behavior to a similar context has been reported in some studies testing subjects 15 to 42 days after conditioning i.e. for the retrieval of early remote memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Winocur et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wiltgen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wiltgen and Silva, 2007</xref>) as well as a generalization to different contexts depending on experimental conditions (multiple footshocks, preexposure to conditioning context etc..) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kitamura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biedenkapp and Rudy, 2007</xref>). No such generalization was seen in our study one year after conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) as the new testing context was designed to be as different as possible from the conditioning context (in shape, color, cues, heights and width, odor, background noise, lightning and texture), the protocol did not include preexposure to the conditioning context and only one footshock was delivered. Similar findings were also observed in studies investigating the retrieval of memory at remote delays (50 days and 16 months, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anagnostaras et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gale et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Supplementary information: analysis of the freezing levels with or without normalization (e.g. direct analysis of the% resting time at test) yields the same results</title><p>An alternative way to express conditioned fear responses is to report the% resting time at test. However, as mentioned in the material and methods, the conditioning baseline of one of the ten groups studied (the one year-shock group) was slightly lower than that of the other shock groups (F(4,15)=3.37, p=0.037; post-hoc Tukey: 1 year vs. 1 day p=0.041; vs. 1 month or 6 months: p=0.079 and p=0.071, respectively; importantly though, no significant shock vs no-shock effect was found at this delay: t(6)=1.97; p=0.131). Since a similar pattern was found at test (shock groups: F(4,15)=6.85, p&lt;0.005, post hoc Tukey: 1 year vs. all other delays ps&lt;0.010, except 6 months p=0.068) focusing solely on the% resting time at test could have led to a misinterpretation of the test data since the lower freezing index at test is carried by a lower baseline at conditioning. Therefore, freezing levels discussed in the manuscript have been normalized by the conditioning baseline for each group. Nevertheless, for the sake of transparency, we also performed the analysis on non-normalized freezing levels (e.g. on% resting time at test). This analysis led to the same conclusion as the analysis of the normalized data: shocked animals display significantly higher freezing levels than the no-shock groups at all delays, reflecting a successful memory for the context-footshock association (two-way ANOVA with ‘shock’ and ‘delay’ as factors and ‘% resting time at test’ as dependent variable: shock effect: F(1,30)=275.9, p&lt;0.001; delay effect: F(4,30)=15.147, p&lt;0.001; interaction shock x delay effect: F(4,30)=1.21, p=0.328; all ts&gt;5.25, ps&lt;0.012).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CA3’s activation is limited to recent and early remote memories while CA1 is recruited independently of the age of the memory trace</title><p>First, we tested if CA3 and CA1 were differentially recruited as memory aged and especially if CA3 was engaged for the retrieval of very remote memories. Statistical analysis of the task-induced <italic>Arc</italic> expression revealed that, the contribution of CA3 to the retrieval of memory is restricted to that of recent and early remote memory traces (e.g. to up to 1 month-old memories) while it was negligible for very remote memories (6 months- and 1 year-old memory traces; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Indeed, CA3 was no longer engaged for memory retrieval at this time point (F(4,15)=26.73, p&lt;0.001; Tukey posthoc: recent or early remote traces vs very remote traces: all ps&lt;0.028; comparisons to 0: up to 1 month-old traces: ps&lt;0.010, 6 months and 1 year old traces: n.s). Importantly, this was only the case for CA3 as revealed by a significant region by delay interaction and further statistical analysis showing that, in contrast to CA3, CA1 was engaged for all delays and overall more activated than CA3 (CA1 and CA3 comparisons to 0: all ps&lt;0.033; area effect: F(1,30)=62.74, p&lt;0.001; delay effect: F(4,30)=20.15, p&lt;0.001; region by delay interaction effect: F(4,30)=5.84, p=0.001; post-hoc analysis: CA1 vs CA3: all ts&gt;3.89 and ps&lt;0.030 but for 6 months t=2.36, p=0.099 and 1 week n.s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In addition, within-area analysis showed that activation levels in CA1 were higher one day after conditioning compared to all other delays but comparable between the remaining delays (F(4,15) = 9.46, p=0.001; Tukey posthoc: one day higher than any other delay: all ps&lt;0.041 but for 1 month p=0.090; one week to one year: all ps&gt;0.083 but 1 month vs 6 months: p=0.038). Of note, analysis of the task-induced <italic>Arc</italic> expression with or without normalization yields the same results. This new finding of a time-limited involvement of CA3 for the retrieval of memory was further supported by significant correlations between memory performance and <italic>Arc</italic> levels in CA3 for recent and early remote memories, which failed to reach significant for very remote memory traces (recent and early remote: R<sup>2</sup>=0.47, p&lt;0.001; very remote: R<sup>2</sup>=0.06, p=0.351; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>) while correlations were significant for CA1 independently to the age of the memory trace (R<sup>2</sup>s.&gt;0.40, ps&lt;0.008; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). The lack of involvement of CA3 in the retrieval of very remote memories was further strengthened by the fact that levels of activation in CA3 did not differ between the memory-impaired and the memory-intact animals that were tested one year after conditioning (intact vs impaired: freezing index: t(6) = 4.32, p=0.005, <italic>Arc</italic> expression: t(6)=1.08, p=0.321, comparison to 0: n.s; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). In a striking contrast and supporting a crucial role of CA1 in the retrieval of very remote memories, CA1 was not recruited in the memory-impaired group as opposed to the memory–intact group (intact vs impaired: t(6)=3.38, p=0.015; comparisons to 0: memory impaired: t(3)=0.08, p=0.936; memory intact: t(3)=6.69, p=0.007; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Of note, these results are unlikely due to an age- related decline specific to CA3 since baseline <italic>Arc</italic> expression was comparable between and within CA1 and CA3 over time as shown by the absence of significant ‘area’ x ‘delay’ interaction, main area effects and posthocs analysis over time failing to reach significance (area effect: (F(1,30)= 2.30; p=0.14), delay effect: F(4,30)=0.77;p=0.55, area by delay interaction effect: (F(4,30)=40; p=0.81; posthocs: delay effects: CA1: F(4,20)= 0.63, p=0.65; CA3: F(4,20)=0.52, p=0.72) and because <italic>Arc</italic> expression elicited by a maximal electroconvulsive shock, a standard positive control for this type of study, does not significantly differ between CA1 and CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nakamura et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, these findings suggest that the decline of expression seen in CA3 is specific to the task. These results show for the first time a clear functional segregation of CA3 and CA1 in the retrieval of memory over time, with CA3 contributing only to the retrieval of recent and early remote memories and CA1 being recruited independently of the age of the memory trace.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11862.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Activity patterns in CA1 and CA3 over time and correlations with memory performance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CA3’s contribution to memory retrieval depends on the age of the memory trace, not CA1’s, as CA3’s was no longer significantly recruited for the retrieval of very remote memories.

In addition, all areas were activated across all delays (comparisons to 0: all ts&gt;3.52, ps&lt;0.039; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>) at the exception of the MEC and the POR for recent memories and the PER one week after conditioning (all ts&lt;2.22, ps&gt;0.113). However, this latter result might reflect a slightly larger SEMs for these time points rather than a true functional difference between brain areas since comparisons of activity levels between the LEC and the MEC and between the PER and the POR for the recent memory time points did not yield any significant differences (ts(3)&lt;1.98; ps&gt;0.142). Of note, analysis with or without normalization of the task-induced <italic>Arc</italic> expression yields the same results. Interestingly, parahippocampal areas of animals showing impaired memory when tested one year after conditioning were also significantly activated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), albeit less than those of animals whose memory was intact (comparisons to 0: memory intact: ts(3)&gt;3.821, ps&lt;0.032; memory impaired: ts(3)&gt;3.929, ps&lt;0.029, except MEC: t(3)=2.65, p=0.077; intact vs. impaired: LEC and PER: ts(6)&gt;5.58, ps&lt;0.001; POR: t(6)= 2.27, p=0.063; MEC: t(6)=1.67, p=0.146). This result might suggest that, in the memory-impaired group, a partial memory representation had been consolidated and stored in the cortical areas, but that a weak activation of these areas alone does not suffice for successful retrieval. Thus, in summary, no qualitative differences were observed in the patterns of activation of the parahippocampal areas over time. However, the PER and LEC, which receive stronger connections from the amygdala than the MEC and the POR, were more activated than the MEC and the POR during the retrieval of the most remote memories (6 months- and one-year old traces), a time point which coincides with the epoch at which cortical areas are thought to play a strong role in the retrieval of memories. This result suggests a segregation of the parahippocampal areas in terms of memory processes rather than in terms of spatial or non-spatial information processing at this time point. In addition, these results further underline the critical role of CA1 in the retrieval of very remote memories as activation of the parahippocampal areas alone appeared not to be sufficient for a successful retrieval of the memory trace at this time point.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11862.007</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Activity patterns in the parahippocampal areas over time and apparent (and possibly misleading) over-time shift from the involvement of the hippocampus to the involvement of the parahippocampal region in memory retrieval.</title><p>All parahippocampal areas were maximally engaged for the most remote memories and patterns of activity were comparable between the (<bold>A</bold>) LEC and PER and (<bold>B</bold>) the MEC and POR.

Activity in the hippocampus was higher than that of the parahippocampal region for the retrieval of recent and early remote memories while an inversed relationship emerged for the retrieval of very remote memories (area effect: F(1,30)=9.984; p=0.004; delay effect: F(4,30)=1.539; p=0.216; delay x area interaction effect: F(4,30)=61.629, p&lt;0.001; post-hoc analysis: recent and early remote memory: ts&gt;4.21, ps&lt;0.024; very remote memories: ts&gt;6.07 ps&lt;0.009).

Conversely, the parahippocampal region was maximally activated for retrieving very remote memories (F(4,19)=52.51, p&lt;0.001; recent or early remote memories vs very remote memories: all ps&lt;0.001) but was also recruited for recent and early remote memories (comparisons to 0: ts(3)&gt;3.79; ps&lt;0.032). In conclusion, this analysis underlines the fact that, if CA1 and CA3’s contribution are not dissociated, the hippocampal contribution to the retrieval of very remote memories might be largely underestimated. Nevertheless, even in this case, the over-time shift from an engagement of the hippocampus to that of an engagement of the parahippocampal region in retrieving memory is only relative and not absolute, given that the hippocampus is still significantly activated even for the retrieval of very remote memories.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Investigating memory retrieval over such an extended period of time enabled us to provide the first evidence of a time-limited contribution of CA3 to the retrieval of memory while, in striking contrast, CA1 remained involved regardless of the age of the memory trace. In addition, parahippocampal areas were substantially more involved in retrieving very remote memory traces than more recent ones and their activity patterns appeared to reflect memory demands rather than information content.</p><p>To our knowledge, no study has investigated the role of CA3 in retrieving remote memory traces in humans and only one studied early remote memory in animals (e.g. up to one month-old traces which roughly corresponds to a 4 year-old memory trace in humans based on life expectancy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gusev et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the contribution of CA3 to the retrieval of memory traces as old as what is considered to be a remote/very remote memory trace in humans (in the order of decades) is not known. For this reason, we studied 6 months-and one year- old memories traces in mice, which roughly correspond to 20 and 40 year-old memory traces in humans. Doing so enabled us to report for the first time the lack of engagement of CA3 in the retrieval of very remote memories. This time-limited role of CA3 was supported by a lack of recruitment during the retrieval of the most remote memory traces (6 months- and one year-old) while CA3 was strongly activated for recent and early remote memories (up to 1 month-old traces). This result was confirmed by a significant correlation between CA3 activity levels and memory performance during the retrieval of the recent and early remote memories, which did not hold for very remote traces. The approach we have adopted does not allow for the characterization of the specific process by which CA3 fails to aid in retrieving memory. However, since computational studies and studies that have limited their investigations to recent and early remote memory traces have speculated that CA3’s contribution to memory retrieval would increase as memory ages because of an increasing demand on the completion of representations using partial or degraded features of these stored representations (the ‘pattern completion theory’: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rolls et al., 1997</xref>), we speculate that the lack of engagement of CA3 in retrieving very remote memories stems from a failure to ‘pattern complete’ memory representations. Indeed, by this time, these very old memory representations might have degraded to such an extent that it is impossible to use any specific features as an efficient retrieval cue. This hypothesis would go along with reports demonstrating that details of memory representations are lost as memory ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wiltgen and Silva, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wiltgen et al., 2010</xref>) and will require further investigations to be tested.</p><p>In striking contrast to the limited involvement of CA3, we found an ongoing involvement of CA1 in memory retrieval. This result is in agreement with the only two studies specifically investigating the role of CA1 in remote memory retrieval. Indeed, transient inhibition of cell firing in CA1 in mice using optogenetics drastically impaired fear memory retrieval, one or twenty eight days after conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goshen et al., 2011</xref>). Likewise, a recent fMRI study in humans showed impairments in autobiographic and episodic memory for traces even older than 30 years-old following focal CA1 lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartsch et al., 2011</xref>). Our result of a selective involvement of CA1 in the retrieval of very remote memories at this time point is supported by the lack of a recruitment of this area in the memory-impaired group tested one year after conditioning as opposed to a strong activation in the memory intact group and the fact that CA3 was not recruited in either group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Importantly, using a high resolution molecular imaging technique, we bring the first evidence that the persistent engagement of the hippocampus in memory retrieval does not involve CA3. This result, in turn, suggest that hippocampal patterns of activation observed in previous human fMRI studies investigating the retrieval of very remote memory, might essentially be driven by CA1, but could not be specifically identified as such because of the limited spatial resolution of standard fMRI techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ryan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rekkas and Constable, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonnici et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, the fact that only CA1 is activated for these late time points suggests a preferential involvement of the temporoammonic pathway over that of the trisynaptic loop for the retrieval of very remote memories. Robust evidence for this hypothesis is not yet available for very remote memories, but lesions of the temporoammonic pathway in rats specifically impaired early remote memory (28 days-old) in rats tested in a Morris watermaze task, while recent memory (one day-old) was spared. This result suggests that direct entorhinal cortex inputs to CA1 contribute to the retrieval of early remote memory, possibly by further consolidating memories that were not consolidated after 28 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Remondes and Schuman, 2004</xref>). In the present study, because we investigated a much larger time-window and found that CA1 was still activated in addition to the parahippocampal cortical areas, but not CA3, we speculate that the temporoammonic pathway is not only important for the consolidation of memories but also for the retrieval of already consolidated memories.</p><p>Furthermore, parallel to the disengagement of CA3 in the retrieval of very remote memories, we found a maximal involvement of the parahippocampal areas. The hypothesis of a functional segregation of the parahippocampal region between a 'PER-LEC stream' and a 'POR-MEC stream' is essentially based on studies investigating the role of the PER during the retrieval of recent memory, while much fewer have addressed the specific role of the POR, the LEC and the MEC within this frame and during the retrieval of early remote memories. In addition, no study has yet investigated their contribution for very remote memories, despite the belief that the contribution of cortical areas to memory retrieval would be the largest for the most remote memories. Our results for recent and early remote time-points match published data according to which, for example, the PER and the POR are recruited to a similar extent for contextual fear conditioning and the LEC and MEC contribute to a similar extent to memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bucci et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burwell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Izquierdo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goshen et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, we show for the first time that the contribution of the PER, the POR, the LEC and the MEC is indeed the largest for the retrieval of very remote memories. Patterns of activation were comparable between the LEC and the PER and between the MEC and the POR. Interestingly though, LEC and PER were more activated than the MEC and the POR during the retrieval of very remote memory traces. This result appears to rather reflect the type of memory process the areas were engaged into (fear conditioning) rather than the content of information processed (contextual information), supporting a view that has recently emerged from the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eichenbaum et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beer et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, the amygdala which plays a crucial role in fear conditioning, sends stronger projections to the PER/LEC than to the MEC/POR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pitkänen et al., 2000</xref>) and higher activity levels in the POR and MEC than in the PER and LEC would have been expected if information content was primarily reflected in the pattern of activation observed. Altogether, our data show a preferential role of the parahippocampal region for the retrieval of very remote memories as opposed to that of early remote and recent memories, matching the pattern commonly reported for the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frankland and Bontempi, 2005</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our results provide the first evidence of a disengagement of CA3 for the retrieval of very remote memories and identify CA1 as the main player at this time point. These results are consistent with the view that at least the hippocampal subfield CA1 is involved in retrieving memory independently of the age of memory trace, possibly by providing support to cortical areas that include the parahippocampal areas. Of note, averaging activity levels of the hippocampal areas on the one hand and those of the parahippocampal areas on the other hand revealed that both the hippocampus and the parahippocampal region were activated independently of the age of the memory trace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Hence, the gradual “transfer” of the memory trace from the hippocampus to the cortex is unlikely to be an all-or-nothing phenomenon, but seems to go along with a shift in the relative contribution of the two regions as the memory trace ages, and possibly a shift in the contribution of the networks they belong to. More specifically, our results suggest that the trisynaptic loop could play a preponderant role in retrieving early memories as reflected by an involvement of CA3, CA1 and the parahippocampal areas at this stage, while the retrieval of very remote memories would require an heavier contribution of the temporoamonic pathway as indicated by the lack of recruitment of CA3 and a strong activation of CA1 and the parahippocampal areas.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>8–12 weeks old male C57BL/6 mice (n=72 total) bred at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum were used.

Two infrared sensor rings fitted the arena and detected vertical and horizontal activity using the TruScan photobeam activity system (Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA, USA)</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Procedure</title><p>Mice were randomly divided into three groups (shock, no-shock and home-cage). For the four first delays (1 day, 1 week, 1 month and 6 months) four mice were tested per group (e.g. n=12 per delay; n=48 total). Since preliminary studies showed that approximately half of the mice tested one year after conditioning had ‘forgotten’ the context-footshock association, a confounding factor for the imaging data, twice as many mice were conditioned for the one year ‘shock’ group (n=8 for the ‘shock’ group; n=16 total for this delay). To test whether the fear conditioned response observed in shocked animals was specific to the context in which they were conditioned, two additional groups of mice (n=4 each; n=8 total) were conditioned in the usual conditioning box and later tested in a completely novel context differing in olfactory, tactile and visual cues (lightening, texture of the floor and background noise) instead of the original conditioning arena. Animal were tested as triplets formed of one ‘shock’, one ‘no-shock’ and one ‘home-cage’ mice.</p><p>The fear-conditioning protocol was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sauvage et al. (2000)</xref>. On conditioning day, mice belonging to the ‘shock’ groups were placed in the conditioning chamber that they could freely explore for 2.5 min (baseline). Subsequently, a 1 mA footshock was delivered for 2 s and mice remained for another 2.5 min in the arena. ‘No-shock’ control animals underwent the exact same procedure, except that they did not receive a shock. ‘Home-cage’ controls stayed in their cages at all times and were used to evaluate baseline <italic>Arc</italic> expression. The arena was thoroughly cleaned with distilled water and 10% ethanol after each animal. After a delay of either 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months or 1 year, the memory for the association of the context with the foot-shock was tested by re-exposing the mice to the same conditioning chamber for 6 min while no shock was delivered (test day).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Behavioral analysis</title><p>The cumulative time during which an animal did not change its position (resting time) during the sampling time of 250 ms was measured both during conditioning and test. Conditioned suppression of activity, e.g. relative resting time or freezing index, was taken as indicator of fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sauvage et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rammes et al., 2000</xref>). Because the baseline resting time of the ‘shock’ one-year group (one of the ten groups studied) was slightly lower (or trending to be) than that of the other shock groups (F(4,15)=3.37, p=0.037; post-hoc Tukey: 1 year vs. 1 day p=0.041; vs. 1 month or 6 months (p=0.079 and 0.071, respectively) and because a similar pattern was found at test, focusing solely on the% resting time at test could have led to a misinterpretation of the test data since the lower freezing index at test is carried by a lower baseline at conditioning. Hence, freezing levels discussed in the manuscript have been normalized by the conditioning baseline for each group: the freezing index was calculated by normalizing the resting time during the first 2.5 min of test by the baseline resting time during the first 2.5 min of conditioning: freezing index= ([test resting time- baseline resting time]/baseline resting time)*100. Also, to focus as much as possible on the conditioning suppression activity related to the context-footshock association (and not that contributed by other parameters), differences in freezing indices between the ‘shock’ and ‘no-shock’ groups are represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. These were calculated by subtracting the freezing indices of the ‘no-shock’ groups from that of their age-matched ‘shock’ controls. Importantly, statistical analysis of the data with or without baseline or ‘no-shock’ normalizations (e.g.% resting time at test) yield similar results. Finally, as predicted by pilot experiments and suggested by studies in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lindenberger, 2014</xref>), about half of the one-year ‘shock’ group showed poor memory performance: freezing levels of half of the one-year ‘shock’ group (n=4) were quite low (24.76 ± 2.2% in average as opposed to 62.85 ± 5.4% for the other half of the group). This group is referred to as ‘memory-impaired’ group in the manuscript and their performance underwent a separate analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Imaging activity in the medial temporal lobe</title><p>Detection of the immediate-early gene <italic>Arc</italic> using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques. Animals were sacrificed by decapitation immediately after the test session. Brains were removed, flash frozen with iso-pentane and stored at -80°C. Frozen brains were sectioned into 8 ɥm thick sections with a cryostat (Leica CM 3050 S) and mounted on Polylysine slides (Thermo Scientific), which were stored at -80°C. T. Kitsukawa (Osaka University, Japan) provided the plasmid for generating <italic>Arc</italic> antisense and sense RNA probes. The plasmid contained a ~1.2 kbp <italic>Arc</italic> transcript including intron regions.

Six images from these nonadjacent sections were acquired for each area of interest and covered ~900 ɥm. A Keyence Fluorescence Microscope (BZ-9000E; Japan) was used to capture images. The images had 1360x1024 pixels (362 x 272 ɥm²) and were taken with a 40x objective (z-stacks of 0.7 ɥm thick pictures). Images were taken with constant exposure time, light intensity and contrasts optimized for the appearance of intranuclear labeling as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vazdarjanova and Guzowski (2004)</xref>. To account for stereological considerations, counting was performed on 8 ɥm thick nonadjacent sections that contained one layer of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">West, 1999</xref>). Cells were counted in a double-blind manner with the experimenter being unaware of the hypothesis tested. Cells were counted as <italic>Arc</italic> positive when one or two characteristic red dots were visible in the DAPI labeled nucleus. Cells without these dots were counted as negative. The percentage of <italic>Arc</italic> positive cells was calculated as: number of <italic>Arc</italic> positive cells/(number of <italic>Arc</italic> positive cells + number of <italic>Arc</italic> negative cells) x 100. “Task-induced <italic>Arc</italic> expression” was calculated for each MTL area by subtracting <italic>Arc</italic> expression found in no-shock controls from the <italic>Arc</italic> expression found in animals that had received a shock during conditioning. Because all experimental conditions were kept identical and only the delay between conditioning and test differed, comparisons of task-induced <italic>Arc</italic> expression are thought to reflect differences in fear memory retrieval that dependent upon the age of the memory trace.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Behavioral performance</title><p>A one way ANOVA was used to compare freezing levels across delays and one-sample t-tests for comparisons to zero.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Imaging a memory trace over half a life-time in the medial temporal lobe reveals a time-limited role of CA3 in retrieval&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. One of the three reviewers, Paul Frankland, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>It is widely accepted that memories for events are encoded in hippocampal-cortical networks, but over time these memories become less dependent onthe hippocampus. There do remain several complexities and controversies aboutthis idea. This paper reports a study that imaged brain activity related tocontext fear conditioning in mice after retention intervals ranging from</p><p>1 day to 1 year using the immediate-early gene <italic>Arc</italic>. The study reportshow different regions of the hippocampus and parahippocampal areas changetheir involvement in memory over this very wide range of times.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers agreed that the study is a valuable look at the role ofhippocampus in very long-term memory recall. The attention to hippocampalsubdivisions is important.</p><p>2) All the reviewers expressed concerns about the statistical analysis.</p><p>These included the sample size, the methodology of the analysis (controls and double-blind), and the need to tighten up the analysis of the CA1-CA3 dissociation. The authors should address these points in the detailed comments below.</p><p>3) The analysis of correlation between <italic>Arc</italic> and memory performance should also be improved.</p><p>4) The authors should better place their study and its findings in contextof existing work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This study examines cellular and behavioral signatures of memoryfor up to a year (roughly half a lifetime for a mouse). The authors report thatthe CA3 no longer retains cellular signatures of memory at long times,but the CA1 and various parahippocampal regions do. This is an interestingfinding, with implications for the differential role of CA1 and CA3 invery long-term memory storage in the mouse.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Is there a positive control for stimulus-evoked <italic>Arc</italic> expression in theseregions? Possibly there is an age-related decline in such expression in CA3but no other regions.

While this idea has reached textbook status, it is not without controversy/complexities. For example, in rodent studies, the hippocampal dependency at remote time points may depend upon memory quality (e.g., Wiltgen studies). Moreover, in some cases there is evidence that the hippocampus never really becomes 'unimportant' (e.g., Sutherland studies). Using a molecular imaging approach to examine patterns of activation following recall of a contextual fear memory (imaging for <italic>Arc</italic> mRNA as an indicator of recently activated neurons), the current paper addresses this now classic question, but with 2 important twists. First, the authors pay attention to hippocampal subdivisions (and do not consider the hippocampus as a whole) and, second, they use very remote time-points to probe memory organization (i.e., 6 months to a year instead of the standard one month 'remote' time-point). Both these novel aspects of the design, I believe, have the potential to offer new insights.</p><p>The core findings: 1) CA1 remains 'engaged' during memory recall regardless of memory age; 2) CA3 becomes disengaged at only the very remote time-points (6 months, 1 year); 3) Parahippocampal regions become increasingly engaged with memory age. The important take home is the CA1/CA3 dissociation at the very remote time points.</p><p>Overall strengths: The CA1/CA3 dissociation is important. In previous rodent imaging studies shorter time frames have been used and the hippocampus has typically not been subdivided (but see below). This dissociation may explain some of the 'noise' in the literature, in much the same way as Wiltgen's distinction between hippocampal engagement during recall of precise vs imprecise context memories. Finally, the inclusion of parallel analyses of transformed/non-transformed data sets is a strength.</p><p>Overall weaknesses: The most interesting aspect of the paper is the CA1/CA3 dissociation at very remote time-points. However, the statistical support for this isn't as clear cut as one might hope. Comparing CA1 and CA3 activation directly, they differ at 1 month and 1 year, but not at 6 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). A related concern is the necessity to drop animals from analysis at the 1-year time point likely muddies the interpretation of this time point. A second weakness, when placing this paper in the broader context of recent studies examining organization of context fear memories, is the lack of causal intervention (e.g., optogenetic silencing of tagged 'engram' cells in Tonegawa, Mayford, Inokuchi and Wiltgen papers).</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) The sample sizes are low (n=4 per group) for these types of analyses, and may contribute to the lack of statistical clarity with respect to the CA1/CA3 dissociation.</p><p>2) It is not clear to me why freezing levels would be predicted to decline in the 1-year group – is there a citation the authors could include? The only paper that I am aware of-Gale et al. (2004) did not observe a drop off at super long delays.</p><p>3) The authors did not see a time-dependent increase in generalization. This is quite unexpected given many previous studies (e.g., Wiltgen), and is worthy of more comment and discussion. In fact, this idea of time-dependent generalization is brought in the Discussion (second paragraph) and the authors use it to explain the absence of CA3 activation (because representation is degraded sufficiently to make pattern completion not possible). But they don't see any evidence for this in their behavior.</p><p>4) Correlation analysis. I found these quite unconvincing. To support the argument that memory performance and <italic>Arc</italic> levels are related the authors need to find a correlation within the shocked group. The current analysis only really shows that shocked animals have more <italic>Arc</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The paper reports on a study that imaged brain activity related to context fear conditioning in mice after retention intervals ranging from 1 day to 1 year using the immediate-early gene <italic>Arc</italic>. The involvement of CA1 and CA3 decreased across delays, whereas the involvement of the parahippocampal regions increased across delays. The results were taken as indicating that in contrast to CA1, CA3 is no longer recruited in very remote retrieval, and that parahippocampal areas showed increasing involvement as delay increased.</p><p>Overall, I think the results are novel and that the methods are sound. So I think this will make a nice contribution to the literature. But I did have a few suggestions.</p><p>1) The dissociation between the hippocampal regions and the parahippocampal regions seems well supported by the results. However, the apparent dissociation between CA1 and CA3 is not nearly as compelling. It seems to me that both regions are involved in retrieval and they both decrease across delays, it’s just that CA3 starts off lower and so it approaches nonsignificance earlier. In order to support a claim of a dissociation here it would be necessary to show a significant interaction between regions (CA1 va CA3) and forgetting rate. As it is, it’s just that at the longer delays CA3 activity is not significantly above threshold whereas CA1 activity is. Given CA1 was always showing a larger memory effect it is perhaps not too surprising. I think the other dissociation is very interesting, so the results will be of considerable interest to many researchers, however I think that the discussion of the CA1 – CA3 dissociation needs to be toned down (unless the interaction is significant).</p><p>2) I found the Introduction to be a bit confusing. For example, I did not feel like I had a good idea of what the existing literature has shown us with respect to the involvement of these MTL regions in studies of fear conditioning across these types of retention intervals. Moreover, it was not entirely clear why the specific delays were examined in the current study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11862.010</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p> <italic>1) Is there a positive control for stimulus-evoked Arc expression in theseregions?

Moreover, as a further indirect support for a difference between the two areas at 6 months, only activity in CA1 differs from 0 (i.e. only CA1 is engaged during the retrieval of memory 6 months after conditioning) and not that of CA3. To boot, a more stringent statistical analysis of the data using a 2-way ANOVA with ‘areas’ and ‘delays’ as factors revealed a significant area by delay interaction effect showing quite robustly that the contribution of CA1 and CA3 in retrieving memory over time differs. We have answered this comment in more detail below.</p><p><italic>A related concern is the necessity to drop animals from analysis at the 1-year time point likely muddies the interpretation of this time point.</italic> </p><p>Here again the Reviewer 2 does not ask us to address this point. However, since there could have been a misunderstanding at this level, we would like to point out that no animals were ‘dropped’ from the 1 year time point but that (as mentioned in the original manuscript Materials and methods; procedure) activity patterns of animals that remembered the association at this time point (memory-intact mice) and those of mice that did not (memory-impaired mice) were analyzed separately to prevent for differences in memory strength between delays to confound the imaging data. This way, on the one hand, activity levels in groups with comparable accuracy were compared over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and on the other hand, activity levels in mice with impaired or intact memory after one year were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Importantly, the latter comparison gave further support to our main finding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>): that CA1 is crucial for the retrieval of very remote memory but not CA3, since activity differed only in CA1 between memory-impaired and memory- intact mice. In other words, the interpretation of the 1-year time point would have been muddied only if the memory- intact and memory-impaired animals would not have been analyzed separately as the memory strength of the memory-impaired mice is significantly lower than that of the memory-intact mice (and that of the mice at all other delays).</p><p> <italic>Specific comments:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The sample sizes are low (n=4 per group) for these types of analyses, and may contribute to the lack of statistical clarity with respect to the CA1/CA3 dissociation.</italic> </p><p>It is not clear which question Reviewer 2 wants us to address but it is important to point out that because of the strenuous character of the studies involving the combination of behavioral data and molecular imaging based on the detection of <italic>Arc</italic> expression, the standard number of animals for which <italic>Arc</italic> detection is performed varies between n=3-5 per group (see for example Guzowski et al., Nature Neuroscience, 1999; Vazdarjanova et al., J of Neuroscience, 2000; Guzowski et al., PNAS, 2006; Beer et al., 2013). Of note, it is important to stress that in the present study ‘even’ with this sample size, significant statistical differences were detected in 3 out of the 4 delays studied (i.e. it is possible to detect significant differences with this size of sample).</p><p>By ‘the lack of statistical clarity with respect to the CA1/CA3 dissociation’, we gather that the reviewer refers to the fact that the difference between CA1 and CA3 ‘s recruitment for the retrieval of 6 months-old memory failed to reach significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This is true, however there is a clear visual trend even for this time point and CA1 and CA3’s activity differs for 3 of the 4 other delays studied. Moreover, even though the direct t-test comparison between CA1 and CA3 activity levels at 6 months failed to reach significance, comparison to 0 in each area at this time point suggested a clear difference since only CA1 was found to be engaged. Lastly, an even more stringent statistical analysis of the data using two way anova with areas and delay as factors revealed a delay by area interaction effect indicating a robust difference in the recruitment of CA1 and CA3 over time. This was stated in the original manuscript and has now be made even clearer by rephrasing the paragraph as follows:</p><p>“Importantly, this was only the case for CA3 as revealed by a significant region by delay interaction and further statistical analysis showing that, in contrast to CA3, CA1 was engaged for all delays and overall more activated than CA3 (CA1 and CA3 comparisons to 0: all ps&lt;.033; area effect: F(1,30)=62.74, p&lt;.001; delay effect: F(4,30)=20.15, p&lt;.001; region by delay interaction effect: F(4,30)=5.84, p=.001; post-hoc analysis: CA1 vs CA3: all ts&gt;3.89 and ps&lt;.030 but for 6 months t=2.36, p=.099 and 1 week n.s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).”</p><p> <italic>2) It is not clear to me why freezing levels would be predicted to decline in the 1-year group</italic> – <italic>is there a citation the authors could include? The only paper that I am aware of-Gale et al. (2004) did not observe a drop off at super long delays.</italic> </p><p>Reviewer 2 likely refers to the following sentence of the manuscript:</p><p>“Finally, as predicted, freezing levels of half of the one-year ‘shock’ group (n=4) were quite low (24.76 ± 2.2% in average as opposed to 62.85 ± 5.4% for the other half of the group)”.</p><p>There is indeed very little data published in animal on the topic. In humans though, important interindividual differences have been reported in the ability of retrieving memory over time (see for a review Lindenberger, Science, 2014). In essence by “as predicted’, we meant “… as predicted <italic>by pilot experiments and suggested by studies in humans</italic>”.</p><p>To address Reviewer 2’s comment we have now rephrased the sentence mentioned above into: “Finally, as predicted <italic>by pilot experiments and suggested by studies in humans</italic> (Lindenberger, Science, 2014)about half of the one-year ‘shock’ group showed poor memory performance: the freezing level of half of the one-year ‘shock’ group (n=4) was quite low…”.</p><p>Also we would also like to point out that in Gale et al., 2004, 10 times more footshocks were delivered than in our study (10 versus 1 footshock). Hence, it is likely that the memory trace generated in this study is much stronger than in our study and therefore is likely to decay much later/slower than that in our study. In the absence of more data on the subject or direct possible comparisons, this could be one reason why Gale et al., 2004 do not observe a drop off at long delay and that we do.</p><p><italic>3) The authors did not see a time-dependent increase in generalization. This is quite unexpected given many previous studies (e.g., Wiltgen), and is worthy of more comment and discussion.</italic> </p><p>Time-dependent generalization (e.g. freezing to a context that is not the conditioning context) has been reported in Wiltgen’s studies and others (Winocur et al., 2007; Wiltgen et al., 2010; Wiltgen et al., 2007) when the new context is similar to the conditioning context which is not the case in our study. A time-dependent generalization to a ‘different’ new context has also been reported though but was found to depend heavily on the experimental protocol used (preexposure to the conditioning context, multiple footshocks; Wang et al., 2009; Kitamura et al., 2012; Biedenkapp and Rudy, 2007) which was not the case either in our study. Finally, as a further support to our findings, the absence of time-dependent generalization was also observed in two other studies investigating remote and very remote memory in fear conditioning tasks (delays of 16 months or 50 days, Gale et al., 2004; Anagnostaras et al., 1999, respectively). For these reasons, we did not expect a time-dependent increase in generalization and did not observe one in the present experiment.</p><p>To address Reviewer 2’s comment, we now state in the Results section the following:</p><p>“Of note, a time-dependent generalization of the freezing behavior to a similar context has been reported in some studies testing subjects 15 to 42 days after conditioning i.e. for the retrieval of early remote memory (Winocur et al., 2007; Wiltgen et al., 2010; Wiltgen et al., 2007) as well as a generalization to different contexts depending on experimental conditions (multiple footshocks, preexposure to conditioning context etc.) (Wang et al., 2009; Kitamura et al. 2012; Biedenkapp and Rudy, 2007). […] Similar findings were also observed in studies investigating the retrieval of memory at remote delays (50 days and 16 months, respectively; Anagnostaras et al., 1999; Gale et al., 2004).”</p><p><italic>In fact, this idea of time-dependent generalization is brought in the Discussion (second paragraph) and the authors use it to explain the absence of CA3 activation (because representation is degraded sufficiently to make pattern completion not possible). But they don't see any evidence for this in their behavior.</italic> </p><p>As much as we understand that a lack of pattern completion could lead to generalization, this is not our interpretation of the data (one of the reasons being that indeed in our hands no generalization takes place). Hence, we rather remain cautious and restrict our speculation to the fact that the lack of CA3’s engagement might reflect a failure in pattern completing representations.</p><p><italic>4) Correlation analysis. I found these quite unconvincing. To support the argument that memory performance and Arc levels are related the authors need to find a correlation within the shocked group. The current analysis only really shows that shocked animals have more Arc.</italic> </p><p>The point of our correlation analysis is indeed to show that shocked animals have more <italic>Arc</italic> than controls that were not shocked but were exposed to the exact same experimental conditions with the goal of giving further support to the fact that <italic>Arc</italic> expression and memory performance are tightly related. Significant correlations were only found at time our data suggest CA1 and CA3 are engaged in retrieving memory (i.e. not for CA3 for very remote memories). Thus, including shock and no shock group in the analysis does not automatically yield significant correlations.</p><p>Another motivation for our approach was that the variance of the imaging data (% <italic>Arc</italic> + cell) in the shock or the no-shock groups was quite low (in other words, activity levels for a given performance are quite similar within groups) which renders separate correlation analyses basically meaningless (Faul et al., 2007, Behavior Research Methods). Also of importance, correlation analysis is rarely performed in this type of study principally due to the low statistical power linked to a low sample size because of the strenuous character of the studies (Guzowski et al., Nature Neuroscience, 1999; Vazdarjanova et al., J Neuroscience, 2000; Guzowski et al., PNAS, 2006). However, in a recent study of the leader in the field (C. Barnes), correlation analyses between imaging results and behavioral indices of controls and experimental animals were performed in a similar manner as we did ((Hartzell et al., J. of Neurosc., 2013). For these reasons, we have not altered <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (B to E).</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p> <italic>[…] Overall, I think the results are novel and that the methods are sound.
