by CD4 T cells. CCR2<sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocytes (IMs) have been implicated in Mtb-specific CD4 T cell responses but their in vivo contribution remains unresolved. Herein, we show that transient ablation of IMs during infection prevents Mtb delivery to pulmonary lymph nodes, reducing CD4 T cell responses. Transfer of MHC class II-expressing IMs to MHC class II-deficient, monocyte-depleted recipients, while restoring Mtb transport to mLNs, does not enable Mtb-specific CD4 T cell priming. On the other hand, transfer of MHC class II-deficient IMs corrects CD4 T cell priming in monocyte-depleted, MHC class II-expressing mice. Specific depletion of classical DCs does not reduce Mtb delivery to pulmonary lymph nodes but markedly reduces CD4 T cell priming. Thus, although IMs acquire characteristics of DCs while delivering Mtb to lymph nodes, cDCs but not moDCs induce proliferation of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01086.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01086.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01086.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Tuberculosis is a disease that kills more than one million people every year. It is caused by mycobacteria, notably <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, and the World Health Organization estimates that about one third of the world’s population has latent tuberculosis, although only one person in 10 goes on to develop an active infection. Understanding why some individuals develop active infections, whereas most do not, could help with the development of a vaccine to prevent tuberculosis and/or new treatments for the disease. Disappointing results from vaccine trials and the emergence of drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis have increased the need for more research into the interactions between mycobacteria and the human immune system.</p><p>Tuberculosis is spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes and someone else inhales the mycobacteria spread by the first person. When <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> first enters the human respiratory tract, the innate immune system tries to identify and destroy cells that have been infected. However, if this initial response is not effective, the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> can persist in the lungs and trigger the adaptive immune response. This involves CD4 T cells working to eliminate the infection, but our understanding of the adaptive immune response is not complete.</p><p>Samstein et al. probed the role that immune cells known as inflammatory monocytes play in the adaptive immune response. Previous research has suggested that inflammatory monocytes may develop into dendritic cells that directly prime the CD4 T cells to respond when the lung has been infected. However, Samstein et al. demonstrate that the inflammatory monocytes carry <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> from the lungs of infected mice to the draining lymph nodes during the second week of infection. These monocytes develop many of the characteristics of dendritic cells, but they do not activate the CD4 T cells.</p><p>Samstein et al. show that dendritic cells, contrary to previous evidence, are not necessary for the transport of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> from the lungs to the draining lymph nodes. Without the dendritic cells, however, fewer CD4 T cell are primed in the lymph nodes. Samstein et al. suggest that the inflammatory monocytes play a crucial role by transporting the live bacteria to the lymph nodes. And once in the lymph nodes, the monocytes transfer invading antigens to dendritic cells to initiate the production of the CD4 T cells to lead the fight against the infection.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01086.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01086.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic></kwd><kwd>inflammatory monocyte</kwd><kwd>dendritic cell</kwd><kwd>CD 4 T cell priming</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI080619-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Samstein</surname><given-names>Miriam</given-names></name><name><surname>Leiner</surname><given-names>Ingrid M</given-names></name><name><surname>Sušac</surname><given-names>Bože</given-names></name><name><surname>Glickman</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name><name><surname>Pamer</surname><given-names>Eric G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI039031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Samstein</surname><given-names>Miriam</given-names></name><name><surname>Leiner</surname><given-names>Ingrid M</given-names></name><name><surname>Sušac</surname><given-names>Bože</given-names></name><name><surname>Glickman</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name><name><surname>Pamer</surname><given-names>Eric G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM07739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Samstein</surname><given-names>Miriam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inflammatory monocytes carry live Mycobacteria from the lung to draining lymph nodes and acquire many characteristics of dendritic cells but fail to stimulate proliferation of CD4 T cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inflammatory monocytes (IMs) express Ly6c, CD11b and CCR2, a chemokine receptor that facilitates emigration of IMs from the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Serbina and Pamer, 2006</xref>). Although IMs make important contributions to innate immune defense during infection, recent studies also implicate IMs in priming of CD4 T cell responses during fungal, viral and parasitic infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Traynor et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Leon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Edismo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hohl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Rivera et al., 2011</xref>). Experiments using CCR2-deficient mice also suggested that monocytes contribute to T-cell-mediated defense against Mtb. IMs, however, can also serve as permissive host cells for Mtb in later stages of infection, suggesting that IMs can both restrict and enhance Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonelli et al., 2010</xref>). Because recruitment of IMs in CCR2-deficient mice is defective throughout early, intermediate and late stages of infection, it has not been possible to specifically define the role of monocytes at different times during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Peters et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Scott and Flynn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Peters et al., 2004</xref>).

To address this, we adoptively transferred naïve, Thy1.1-marked, ESAT-6-specific CD4 T cells (C7 T cells) into CCR2-DTR mice prior to aerosol Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gallegos et al., 2008</xref>). Monocytes were depleted 7–11 days following infection, and mediastinal lymph nodes and lungs were harvested 12 and 21 days following infection. In comparison to mLNs obtained from PBS treated mice, mLNs obtained from monocyte-depleted mice were smaller, with significantly reduced total and CD4 T cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). C7 T cells had proliferated in mLNs of control mice 12 days after infection but had not expanded in monocyte-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>). Reduced C7 T cell proliferation in mLNs resulted in reduced C7 T cell frequencies in lungs of monocyte-depleted mice 21 days following infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Transfer of naïve C7 T cells to control mice resulted in a four to fivefold reduction of Mtb CFUs in lungs, suggesting that supplementing the endogenous T cell repertoire with additional naive, ESAT-6-specific CD4 T cells enhances immune defense against Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

To exclude the possibility that depletion of a non-monocyte cell population resulted in loss of Mtb transport from lungs to mLNs, we purified IMs from CCR2-GFP mice by sorting GFP+ cells that did not express NK1.1, CD4, FLT3 and C-kit. This strategy did not require antibody staining for trafficking molecules (CCR2 and CD11b) and eliminated NK cells, CD4 T cells, dendritic cell progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells, yielding a highly purified (&gt;99% pure) population of IMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We adoptively transferred 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> IMs on day 8 and 10 of infection while depleting CCR2+ cells on days 7, 9 and 11. The transferred IMs were detectable in lungs and mLNs and down-regulated expression of CCR2 and CD11b and up-regulated expression of MHC class II, CD11c and CD103 during trafficking from the lung to mLNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Administration of IMs to monocyte-depleted CCR2-DTR mice enhanced live Mtb transport to mLNs, as detected 12 days following infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Infusion of IMs to WT mice did not enhance delivery of Mtb to mLNs, suggesting that IMs are not limiting during the first 2 weeks of Mtb infection.

To determine whether CCR2 is required for trafficking to lungs and mLNs during Mtb infection, we purified IMs from CCR2-deficient, CCR2-GFP mice for adoptive transfer into Mtb-infected, CCR2-DTR recipient mice that were monocyte depleted between 7 and 11 days following infection. Quantitative culture 12 days following Mtb infection demonstrated that wild-type and CCR2-deficient IMs were equivalent at delivering Mtb to mLNs, indicating that CCR2-signaling does not contribute to trafficking of IMs between these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>Although IMs acquired characteristics of dendritic cells and are essential for Mtb transport from infected lungs to mLNs, it remained unclear whether IMs directly primed Mtb-specific CD4 T cells. Therefore, we transferred C7 T cells into MHC class II-deficient CCR2-DTR mice, depleted monocytes 7–11 days following infection and adoptively transferred MHC class II-expressing purified monocytes on days 8 and 10 following infection. In contrast to our previous experiments with MHC class II-expressing recipients, C7 T cells were not primed in MHC class II-deficient recipients of MHC class II-expressing monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Adoptively transferred IMs trafficked to mLNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and, as demonstrated in the previous experiments, corrected Mtb delivery to draining lymph nodes to levels seen in mice that had not been monocyte-depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, defective antigen transport to the draining mLN could not explain the lack of CD4 T cell proliferation. In a reciprocal experiment, we transferred MHC class II-deficient IMs into Mtb-infected, MHC class II-expressing CCR2-DTR mice on the same schedule described above and quantified the C7 T cell response. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> demonstrates that the magnitude of the C7 T cell response was similar in monocyte-depleted mice rescued with either MHC class II-expressing or deficient monocytes. Taken together, these experiments indicate that IMs primarily serve as carriers of Mtb, delivering live bacteria to mLNs and enabling but not directly priming CD4 T cells.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01086.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>IMs do not prime CD4 T cells directly.</title><p>CCR2-DTR mice that were either MHC class II KO or WT received naive ESAT-6-specific C7 T cells the day before infection and were treated with DT or PBS on days 7, 9 and 11 and received purified IMs on days 8 and 10.

To determine whether classical DCs are required for Mtb-specific CD4 T cell priming, we used zDC-DTR mice, in which DT administration leads to a loss of classical DC populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Meredith et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Meredith et al., 2012b</xref>). We transferred C7 T cells into zDC-DTR mice, infected the mice with Mtb and administered DT on days 7–11 following infection. Depletion of classical DCs resulted in markedly reduced C7 T cell expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) but did not reduce the number of live Mtb in mLNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). FLT3L-deficient mice, which lack classical DCs but not IMs, also have markedly reduced CD4 T cell responses following Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) despite the presence of Mtb in the mLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results indicate that classical DCs, while dispensable for trafficking of live Mtb from infected lungs to mLNs, are essential for CD4 T cell priming.</p><p>These experiments have refined our understanding of the role of IMs during the initiation of adaptive immune defense against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. During the second week of murine infection, IMs play the critical role of delivering live Mtb to draining mLNs, an indispensable step for Mtb-specific CD4 T cell priming. Our results extend previous reports that IMs influence CD4 T cell priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Leon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hohl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nakano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Rivera et al., 2011</xref>) by demonstrating that IMs serve as transporters of live bacteria from the site of infection to the site of T cell priming.</p><p>In contrast to reports from other disease models demonstrating that IMs differentiate into DCs and then directly prime CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cheong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Zigmond et al., 2012</xref>) our adoptive transfer studies using MHC class II KO mice reveal that IMs, despite acquiring characteristics of DCs, do not prime Mtb-specific CD4 T cells in vivo. Why IMs fail to prime DCs in this setting remains unclear. Evidence that moDCs generated in vitro can stimulate T cell responses suggests that IMs can process and present antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Schreurs et al., 1999</xref>). Recovery of several hundred adoptively transferred IMs from the mLNs of infected mice also suggests that sufficient numbers of IM were present to prime T cells. One possible explanation is that IMs, by virtue of being infected with Mtb, are ineffective at stimulating Mtb-specific lymphocytes, in contrast to resident dendritic cells that have not been infected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wolf et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Antigen transport and T cell priming are often considered the two major functions of DCs. A number of studies, however, have demonstrated that multiple DC subsets can be involved in priming of naive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Itano et al., 2003</xref>). Other studies characterizing CD8 T cell responses to cutaneous viral infection have demonstrated a role for CD103+ DCs in transport and priming with potential contributions by inflammatory monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bedoui et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Edismo et al., 2009</xref>). One previous study has suggested that IMs carry fungal antigens from a site of cutaneous inoculation to draining LNs and transfer antigens to LN resident DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ersland et al., 2010</xref>). Our study extends this finding to live pulmonary infection with Mtb. IMs transport bacteria to lymph nodes and transfer antigen to classical dendritic cells prior to CD4 T cell priming.</p><p>The mechanism of antigen transfer in mLNs remains undefined. It is possible that cross-dressing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wakim et al., 2011</xref>), in which infected cells pass MHC molecules to uninfected cells, plays a role during Mtb infection. We did not detect transfer of MHC class II molecules from host cells to adoptively transferred, MHC class II-deficient monocytes. The number of MHC/peptide complexes required per APC to stimulate T cell responses, however, may be very small and below our level of detection. That said, given our finding that MHC class II-deficient IMs effectively complemented monocyte-depleted, MHC class II sufficient mice while MHC class II-expressing monocytes could not correct deficient T cell priming in MHC class II-deficient, monocyte-depleted mice, we believe that transfer of MHC class II molecules in either direction plays a minimal role in T cell priming during Mtb infection. Future studies will determine whether live Mtb are transferred to classical DCs, or whether transfer principally involves the movement of processed or unprocessed proteins from infected monocytes to uninfected DCs.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 and MHC class II-deficient mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an elegant and straightforward study that makes an important contribution on the role of different APCs in transport and presentation of antigen in vivo in a biologically relevant system.</p><p>The only open aspect is the mechanism of antigen transfer from inflammatory monocytes to resident DC. It would be interesting if the authors could provide insights on why the monocytes that carry Mtb to lymph nodes do not present antigen to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Is there a problem with their localization within lymph nodes? Or are they incompetent for antigen processing and presentation (their antigen presentation capacity could be tested ex vivo)? Or are they too few to function as APC and their role is limited to spreading a live organism? In addition the authors may also consider the alternative possibility that resident DCs transfer their MHC class II molecules to inflammatory monocytes (a process related to “cross dressing”). In this case DC depletion would block T cell activation because the source of MHC class II is absent. This possibility could be addressed by asking whether there is any MHC class II on class II KO inflammatory monocytes after adoptive transfer and infection. While these experiments would provide a mechanistic explanation to the results, they are not essential to support the major conclusions of the study and consequently the authors may address these issues in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01086.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We thank the editor and reviewers for the review of our manuscript. We have addressed the major issues raised by the review with additional experiments and we have modified the Discussion of our manuscript. As pointed out, the mechanism of antigen transfer between monocytes and resident DCs remains unclear. Many in vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of monocyte-derived DCs to prime T cells, suggesting that IM-derived cells are not intrinsically incapable of antigen processing, presentation or T cell priming. Our ability to detect several hundred adoptively transferred IMs per mLN by flow cytometry suggests that a paucity of these cells is an unlikely explanation for their inability to prime T cells. We believe, and there is published evidence for this from other laboratories, that live Mtb infection interferes with MHC class II antigen processing and presentation. We have inserted statements in the Discussion to address these interesting possible explanations for our findings.</p><p>The reviewers also raised the possibility that our findings of CD4 T cell priming following transfer of MHC class II-deficient IMs might be explained by transfer of MHC molecules from mLN resident cells to IMs. Because this phenomenon, referred to as cross-dressing, might contribute to CD4 T cell priming during Mtb infection, we performed a repeat experiment in an attempt to detect MHC II molecules on MHC II-deficient IMs following their transfer into Mtb infected, MHC-class-expressing mice. Although we did not find evidence for cross-dressing using this approach, since it is possible that very few MHC molecules are required per cell for T cell priming, we are unable to rule out its contribution. That said, given our finding that MHC class II-deficient IMs effectively complemented monocyte-depleted, MHC class II sufficient mice while MHC class II-expressing monocytes could not correct deficient T cell priming in MHC class II-deficient, monocyte depleted mice, we believe that transfer of MHC class II molecules in either direction plays a minimal role in T cell priming during Mtb infection.</p><p>The manuscript has been corrected to reflect both the number of mice per experiment as well as the number of repetitions that were performed of each experiment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
