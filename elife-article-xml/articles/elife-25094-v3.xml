The posterior signaling center (PSC) is required for maintaining the balance between progenitors and their differentiation into mature hemocytes. Moreover, some factors from the progenitors cell-autonomously control blood cell differentiation. Here, we show that Jumeau (Jumu), a member of the forkhead (Fkh) transcription factor family, controls hemocyte differentiation of lymph gland through multiple regulatory mechanisms. Jumu maintains the proper differentiation of prohemocytes by cell-autonomously regulating the expression of Col in medullary zone and by non-cell-autonomously preventing the generation of expanded PSC cells. Jumu can also cell-autonomously control the proliferation of PSC cells through positive regulation of dMyc expression. We also show that a deficiency of <italic>jumu</italic> throughout the lymph gland can induce the differentiation of lamellocytes via activating Toll signaling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25094.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25094.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Drosophila hematopoiesis</italic></kwd><kwd>lymph gland</kwd><kwd>PSC</kwd><kwd>MZ</kwd><kwd>Jumu</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>General Program 31270923</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Li Hua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Jumu is required for the proper differentiation of prohemocytes and the proliferation and location of PSC cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The development and specification of blood cells in humans and <italic>Drosophila</italic> are controlled by conserved transcriptional regulators and signaling pathways. <italic>Drosophila</italic> has become a suitable model for investigating the genetic and molecular mechanisms of hematopoiesis and associated leukemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crozatier and Vincent, 2011</xref>). Similarly to the process in vertebrates, hematopoiesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> occurs in two waves during development. The first population of hemocytes is derived from the embryonic head mesoderm and provides two types of circulating blood cells, specifically plasmatocytes and crystal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Holz et al., 2003</xref>). The second wave of hematopoiesis occurs during the larval stage in a specialized hematopoietic organ known as the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>). At the onset of metamorphosis, the lymph gland breaks down, releasing plasmatocytes and crystal cells into the circulating hemolymph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crozatier and Vincent, 2011</xref>). In response to an immune challenge, the lymph gland can also give rise to a third cell type, the lamellocytes, which are produced in response to wasp infestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crozatier and Meister, 2007</xref>). The third-instar larval lymph gland contains a pair of primary lobes and a variable number of secondary lobes posterior to the primary lobes. The primary lobes are organized in three zones: the cortical zone (CZ) contains differentiated hemocytes, the medullary zone (MZ) is composed of prohemocytes, and the posterior signaling center (PSC) functions as a hematopoietic niche for maintaining a population of blood cell precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jung et al., 2005</xref>). Similar to the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche in the mammalian bone marrow, the PSC plays a key role in supporting <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood cell homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). PSC cells are specified by the expression of two transcription factors, the homeotic protein Antennapedia (Antp) and Collier (Col), which is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> early B-cell factor (EBF) ortholog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crozatier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, PSC cells also selectively express the secreted factor Hedgehog (Hh) and the Serrate (Ser) signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lebestky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). In the <italic>col</italic> mutant, all Antp-positive PSC cells are missing, and the population of MZ hematopoietic precursors is lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). Conversely, increasing the PSC size via <italic>Antp</italic> overexpression can increase the size of the MZ at the expense of the CZ during late stages of the third instar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, the decapentaplegic/bone morphogenetic protein (Dpp/BMP), Wingless (Wg) and insulin/TOR signaling pathways cell-autonomously control the size of the PSC by regulating the expression of dMyc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sinenko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benmimoun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tokusumi et al., 2015</xref>). A recent study suggested that Slit/Robo signaling from the cardiac tube also controls PSC morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morin-Poulard et al., 2016</xref>). Prohemocytes within the MZ express the Hh receptor Patched (Ptc), the Jak/Stat signaling pathway receptor Domeless (Dome), and DE-cadherin (Shg), which is a target of Wg function in prohemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sinenko et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, a significant up-regulation of ROS levels occurs during the third larval instar, and this up-regulation primes hematopoietic progenitors for differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Owusu-Ansah and Banerjee, 2009</xref>). It has been shown that the Hh signal from the PSC contributes to the maintenance of prohemocytes within the MZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, Wingless and insulin/TOR signaling can autonomously maintain hemocyte progenitors in the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sinenko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benmimoun et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Jumeau (Jumu) is a member of the winged-helix/forkhead (Fkh) transcription factor family in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Previous studies have shown that Jumu is a suppressor of position-effect variegation and is involved in neurogenesis and in eye, wing and bristle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Strödicke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheah et al., 2000</xref>). A recent study showed that Jumu and its homolog, Checkpoint suppressor homologue (CHES-1-like), regulate the division of cardiac progenitor cells through a Polo-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2012</xref>). Our previous study demonstrated that the loss of <italic>jumu</italic> affects the number and phagocytosis of circulating hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jin et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, the overexpression of <italic>jumu</italic> induces melanotic nodules by activating Toll signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). In this paper, we show that Jumu is expressed in the entire lymph gland and plays crucial roles during <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoiesis. Jumu protein within the entire lymph gland suppresses the activation of Toll signaling by down-regulating Col expression and thereby prevents lamellocyte differentiation. Jumu protein within the MZ maintains the proper differentiation of prohemocytes by cell-autonomously preventing the local overexpression of Col in the MZ and by non-cell-autonomously inhibiting the ectopic and expanded Col<sup>+</sup> PSC cells. Moreover, our results also demonstrate that Jumu cell-autonomously controls PSC cell proliferation by regulating the expression of dMyc.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Jumu is involved in the differentiation of hemocyte precursors</title><p>To further analyze the function of Jumu in larval hematopoietic homeostasis, we first detected the expression of the plasmatocyte marker P1, the crystal cell marker Hindsight (Hnt) and the lamellocyte marker L1 in the lymph glands of <italic>jumu</italic> mutants. Because all <italic>jumu</italic> homozygous null mutants died during embryogenesis, to further reduce the expression of Jumu, we utilized the double heterozygotes generated by crosses between different <italic>jumu</italic> heterozygote mutants. Only a few <italic>jumu</italic> double heterozygotes mutants survived until adulthood, and these were found to exhibit poor viability and female sterility. The <italic>jumu</italic> heterozygote mutant lymph gland showed obvious reductions in plasmatocyte and crystal cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–J</xref>). Moreover, the number of crystal cells in the <italic>jumu</italic> double heterozygotes mutants was clearly less than that found in heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>). However, plasmatocyte differentiation in the <italic>jumu</italic> double heterozygotes mutants was not clearly reduced compared with that found in <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). In addition, only very few lamellocytes could be detected in less than 10% of the lymph glands (n = 30 lobes) of <italic>jumu</italic> heterozygotes, whereas more than 90% of the lymph glands in the <italic>jumu</italic> double heterozygotes mutants (n = 40 lobes) showed large numbers of lamellocytes in the primary and secondary lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–N</xref>). Moreover, a reduced primary lobe size and an enormous overgrowth of secondary lobes were features of <italic>jumu</italic> double heterozygotes lymph glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,L</xref>). To further determine whether the change in hematopoietic homeostasis observed in the <italic>jumu</italic> double heterozygotes mutants depends on the expression levels of <italic>jumu</italic>, the transcription levels of <italic>jumu</italic> in heterozygotes and double heterozygotes third-instar larvae were quantified. The <italic>jumu</italic> transcription levels were reduced by approximately half and 40-fold in the heterozygotes and the double heterozygotes mutants, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1EE</xref>).

In contrast to wild-type larvae, the lymph glands of <italic>jumu</italic> heterozygotes third-instar larvae strongly expressed prohemocyte markers and presented a greatly enlarged MZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O–Y</xref>). However, the lymph glands of <italic>jumu</italic> double heterozygotes mutants did not show an obviously enlarged MZ compared with the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1X,Y</xref>). In addition, we also assessed ROS as a specific marker for MZ.

These results indicate that the loss of <italic>jumu</italic> prevents the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors into plasmatocytes and crystal cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Jumu negatively regulates the proliferation and ectopic expansion of Col<sup>+</sup> PSC cells</title><p>Previous studies have indicated that an increased PSC domain size can cause an increase in the MZ and a reduction of hemocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>). To investigate whether an increase in the number of PSC cells could be observed in <italic>jumu</italic> mutants, we detected the expression of Antp, a specific marker of the PSC in the lymph gland. As predicted, the loss of <italic>jumu</italic> indeed led to substantial increases in the PSC size and cell number to different degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–E,U</xref>). In particular, the deletion mutants <italic>jumu<sup>Df2.12</sup></italic> and <italic>jumu<sup>Df3.4</sup></italic> showed strong increases in PSC cells and ectopic expansion of Antp; these ectopic PSC cells were scattered and often formed two or more cell clusters with higher accumulation in the MZ and CZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>jumu</italic> double heterozygotes mutants showed more severe defects in PSC morphology, specifically the existence of PSC cells mostly in the secondary lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, the Hh signal from the PSC is required for the maintenance of prohemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>); thus, we subsequently detected Hh expression using the <italic>hhF4-GFP</italic> reporter gene. Similarly to the expression of Antp, <italic>jumu</italic> mutants also showed increased numbers of Hh<sup>+</sup> cells, and these were highly co-localized with Antp<sup>+</sup> PSC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G’</xref>). It has been indicated that Col is also a PSC-specific marker and regulates Antp and Hh expression in the PSC in third-instar larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, we tested whether <italic>jumu</italic> affects the PSC by controlling the level of Col. Similar to Antp and Hh, increased Col was also observed in <italic>jumu</italic> mutant lymph glands, and increased numbers of <italic>Col&gt;GFP</italic><sup>+</sup> PSC cells were colocalized with Antp<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–L</xref>). Moreover, a reduced expression of Col can inhibit the phenotypes associated with <italic>jumu</italic> mutants: specifically clearly reduced numbers of both Col<sup>+</sup> and Antp<sup>+</sup> PSC cells accompanied by a reduction in the MZ size and an increased differentiation of plasmatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M–U</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the ectopic PSC cells in <italic>jumu</italic> mutant lymph glands are migrated from the PSC or are de novo arising in the MZ and CZ, we first detected the morphology of the PSC at different larval stages. Expanded PSC cells were observed in <italic>jumu</italic> mutant L1 larvae and were amplified in L2 and L3 larval stages (<italic>Fgure 3A-L’</italic>). In addition, we observed that the ectopically expanded Antp<sup>+</sup> PSC cells did not co-localize with any <italic>dome-GFP<sup>+</sup></italic> cells or <italic>Hml-GFP<sup>+</sup></italic> cells in the MZ and CZ domains, particularly among the ectopic PSC cells adjacent to MZ or CZ cells during the early larval stage; in fact, we did not detect any intermediate cells co-expressing both Antp and GFP appeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–L’</xref>). In summary, these results indicate that the ectopic PSC cells in <italic>jumu</italic> mutants are derived from the PSC domain, and Jumu controls hematopoietic homeostasis by serving as a crucial negative regulator of Col<sup>+</sup> PSC cell proliferation and ectopic expansion.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25094.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title><italic>jumu</italic> is required for the prevention of ectopic PSC cells derived from the PSC domain during larval development.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Immunostaining against the PSC cell marker Antp (green) in L1 larvae (<bold>A, B</bold>) and L2 larvae (<bold>C, D</bold>).

In wild-type larvae, Jumu is expressed in the entire lymph gland and mainly located in the nuclei and presents markedly higher expression in the PSC than in the other domains during the L1 to L3 larval stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–F”</xref>); however, the signal was nearly abolished in <italic>jumu</italic> double heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Moreover, we found that Jumu is also expressed in cardiomyocytes and is colocalized with Antp in some cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–A’’</xref>).

Notably, a deficiency in Slit/Robo signaling resulted in defects in the PSC similar to those obtained in <italic>jumu</italic> mutants, and both Slit, which is the canonical ligand of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Robo, and Jumu are expressed in the dorsal vessel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morin-Poulard et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we first asked whether Jumu protein in cardiomyocytes controls Slit/Robo signaling and, in turn, regulates both proliferation and clustering of the PSC.

This result suggests that Jumu does not directly regulate Slit/Robo signaling in the dorsal vessel. Moreover, the loss of Shg or the activation of Cdc42 in the PSC can induce the clustering of PSC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morin-Poulard et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we questioned whether Jumu protein in the MZ controls the PSC morphology by regulating the expression of Shg or the activation of Cdc42. Therefore, we first analyzed Shg expression in the PSC and found that the expression levels of Shg were not reduced in the PSC of <italic>jumu<sup>Df2.12</sup></italic> compared with the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–B’’</xref>), suggesting that the role of Jumu in the PSC morphology is independent of Shg. Moreover, the overexpression of the dominant negative form of Cdc42 (<italic>cdc42-DN</italic>) in the PSC of <italic>jumu<sup>Df2.12</sup></italic> did not rescue the increased number and clustering of the PSC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>).

We subsequently asked whether Jumu also controls the PSC cell number by regulating dMyc expression. The use of <italic>TepIV-Gal4</italic> to knock down or overexpress <italic>jumu</italic> did not change the expression levels of dMyc in the MZ and CZ; however, we observed increased dMyc expression in the PSC cells of <italic>TepIV&gt;jumu RNAi</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–L’, S</xref>). In addition, we detected dMyc in the lymph gland of <italic>e33C&gt;jumu RNAi</italic> and <italic>jumu</italic> mutant larvae. The loss of <italic>jumu</italic> throughout the lymph gland did not cause an obvious reduction of dMyc in the MZ and CZ but caused an observable increase in the dMyc levels in PSC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M–Q’, S</xref>).

These results indicate that Jumu protein in prohemocytes might be required to prevent the overexpression of dMyc in the neighboring PSC cells in a non-cell-autonomous manner and that it accordingly inhibits the overproliferation and ectopic presence of PSC cells in an indirect manner. The loss of BMP/Dpp activity leads to increased numbers of PSC cells through the up-regulation of the expression of dMyc, and Dpp signaling is regulated directly by Dlp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morin-Poulard et al., 2016</xref>).

Although an expansion of the neighboring PSC population was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B and E</xref>), the knockdown of <italic>jumu</italic> in prohemocytes did not obviously reduce plasmatocyte or crystal cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G,J,K,L and O</xref>). However, the overexpression of <italic>jumu</italic> in the MZ resulted in massive differentiation of plasmatocytes and crystal cells and a reduction in hematopoietic progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H,J,M and O</xref>).

Conversely, most P1<sup>+</sup> cells were colocalized with clonal cells overexpressing <italic>jumu</italic> (GFP<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C–C’’</xref>), suggesting that the overexpression of <italic>jumu</italic> in clonal cells can promote hemocyte differentiation in a cell-autonomous manner. Altogether, the HHLT clonal analyses indicate the cell-autonomous requirement of Jumu in controlling lymph gland hemocyte differentiation.</p><p>A recent study suggested that in addition to its expression in the PSC, Col is also expressed at low levels in prohemocytes and is required for preventing the differentiation of prohemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benmimoun et al., 2015</xref>). The above-described results show that the loss of <italic>col</italic> in the lymph gland of the <italic>jumu</italic> mutants also rescued the increased MZ size and the reduced differentiation of plasmatocyte phenotypes in addition to inhibiting the expansion of PSC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M–T</xref>). Thus, we evaluated whether Jumu could cell-autonomously inhibit the expression of Col in prohemocytes in addition to preventing the ectopic expansion of Col<sup>+</sup> PSC cells. The intensity of the Col signal in the MZ was quantified. As predicted, the expression of Col was clearly increased in the <italic>dome&gt;jumu RNAi</italic> lymph gland and significantly reduced in the <italic>dome&gt;UAS-jumu</italic> lymph gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6P–R’, V</xref>). Similarly, <italic>jumu</italic> mutants also displayed an increased Col expression signal in the MZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6S–V</xref>). A previous study suggested that Col regulates the expression of (Dlp) in the PSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>). We found that Dlp is also expressed in the MZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6W,W’</xref>), and the overexpression of <italic>col</italic> in the MZ enhanced the production of Dlp protein, an effect that was accompanied by the expansion of the MZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6X,X ’and AA</xref>). Consistent with this phenotype, we found increased and reduced levels of Dlp expression in the MZ of <italic>dome&gt;jumu RNAi</italic> and <italic>dome&gt;UAS-jumu</italic> mutants, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Y–AA</xref>). In addition, the <italic>dome</italic>-driven expression of <italic>col</italic> was sufficient to suppress the plasmatocyte and crystal cell differentiation phenotypes associated with <italic>jumu</italic> overexpression in prohemocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I,J,N and O</xref>). These results demonstrate that Jumu cell-autonomously promotes the differentiation of prohemocytes by inhibiting the expression of Col in the MZ. Moreover, the overexpression of Col in prohemocytes did not induce the ectopic expansion of PSC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>); thus, the expanded PSC cell phenotype caused by <italic>jumu</italic> loss-of-function is independent of the increased expression of Col in the MZ.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Jumu cell-autonomously controls the size of the PSC by regulating the expression of dMyc</title><p>To test whether <italic>jumu</italic> is also cell-autonomously required in the PSC, we used a <italic>col-Gal4</italic> driver to knock down and overexpress <italic>jumu</italic> in the PSC. The expression of dome-MESO, a reporter of JAK-STAT signaling, was used to identify prohemocytes. In contrast to knockdown in the MZ or the entire lymph gland, the knockdown of <italic>jumu</italic> in the PSC (<italic>col&gt;jumu RNAi</italic>) led to a reduction in the number of PSC cells and the overdifferentiation of plasmatocytes at the expense of the MZ; consistently, the overexpression of <italic>jumu</italic> in the PSC (<italic>col&gt;UAS-jumu, Antp&gt;UAS-jumu</italic>) substantially increased the number of PSC cells and resulted in an expansion of the MZ at the expense of hemocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–L</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

These results suggest that Jumu cell-autonomously controlsthe size and cell number of the PSC. A previous study suggested that a reduction in the Col levels in the PSC can cause an increase in the number of PSC cells by down-regulating Dlp and Hh expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>). The above-described results indicate that <italic>jumu</italic> negatively regulates the expression of Col in prohemocytes. Thus, we first asked whether the overexpression of <italic>jumu</italic> also reduces the expression of Col in the PSC, thereby indirectly increasing the number of PSC cells. However, although the number of Col<sup>+</sup> PSC cells was significantly increased, the average pixel intensity of the Col signal per PSC cell was not reduced in the <italic>Antp&gt;UAS-jumu</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). In addition, the overexpression of <italic>jumu</italic> in the PSC did not result in a loss of Hh and Dlp expression, which are directly regulated by Col (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G–K’</xref>). Dpp signaling is regulated directly by Dlp and indirectly by Col (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>). We subsequently detected whether Jumu protein in the PSC controls the proliferation of PSC cells by suppressing the activity of the Dpp signaling pathway.

Moreover, the above results suggest that Jumu protein in the MZ non-cell-autonomously prevents an increase in dMyc expression in the PSC. In addition, the knockdown of <italic>dmyc</italic> or <italic>jumu</italic> in the PSC resulted in a similar phenotype of fewer PSC cells, and correspondingly, the overexpression of <italic>dmyc</italic> or <italic>jumu</italic> in the PSC also caused increased numbers of PSC cells. Thus, we hypothesized that the existence of a regulatory relationship between Jumu and dMyc. Therefore, we first detected the expression of dMyc in <italic>jumu</italic> loss- and gain-of-function lymph glands. Surprisingly, a reduced level of dMyc was observed in the PSC of <italic>col&gt;jumu</italic> RNAi lymph glands, whereas an increased level of dMyc was observed in <italic>col&gt;UAS-jumu</italic> lymph glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M–O’, R</xref>). However, the knockdown of <italic>dmyc</italic> in the PSC did not result in an obvious absence of Jumu expression in the PSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7P–Q”, S</xref>). Additionally, the knockdown of <italic>dmyc</italic> in PSC cells can suppress the increase in PSC cells caused by the overexpression <italic>of jumu</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7T–V</xref>). These results indicate that Jumu is a direct or indirect positive regulator of dMyc expression in the PSC and promotes the overproliferation of PSC cells.</p><p>The above results show that Jumu in the MZ does not cell-autonomously regulate dMyc expression in the MZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–L’</xref>). Similarly, the loss or overexpression of <italic>jumu</italic> in the CZ did not cause obvious changes in the dMyc levels (data not shown). These results suggest that the role of Jumu in the regulation of dMyc expression is specifically restricted to the PSC of the lymph gland. To further address whether Jumu can directly regulate <italic>dmyc</italic> transcription, we subsequently detected the protein and transcription levels of the <italic>dmyc</italic> gene in circulating hemocytes and found that the overexpression of <italic>jumu</italic> in circulating hemocytes led to increases in the dMyc protein level and the transcription of the <italic>dmyc</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>). We then analyzed the 2000 bp promoter sequence of the <italic>dmyc</italic> gene using Ensembl, a web system for predicting promoters, and found 23 putative FKH transcription factor- binding sites on the promoter sequence using JASPAR, a database of transcription factor binding profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,D</xref>). Because Jumu contains a conserved FKH DNA-binding domain, we then examined whether Jumu regulates the expression of <italic>dmyc</italic> at the transcriptional level by directly binding to its promoter via the FKH domain in vivo through a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. We designed specific primers for possible FKH domain-binding sites in the <italic>dmyc</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Total lysates from S2 cells stably expressing Flag-Jumu were used as an input positive control, along with immunoprecipitation with IgG (as a negative control) or antibodies against Flag, and the immunoprecipitated chromatin fragments were detected using PCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, using anti-Flag antibodies compared with IgG control, there was no obvious positive signal at the <italic>dmyc</italic> promoter region of −1993 bp to −105 bp, but a specific enrichment of the <italic>dmyc</italic> gene region of −46 bp to +235 bp was observed. This fragment contains three putative FKH-binding sites, one inside the promoter region and two inside the 5’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). To further determine the binding site recognized by Jumu in the <italic>dmyc</italic> promoter, we mutated each of the three putative FKH-binding sites at two positions crucial for the efficiency of FKH binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). The Fragment from −643 to +467 of the <italic>dmyc</italic> promoter was cloned into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3, and a reporter assay showed that the co-transfection of S2 cells with a <italic>jumu</italic> expression construct and pGL3-<italic>dmyc</italic> (WT-643/+467) resulted in a nearly two-fold induction of reporter gene activity compared with the control. The disruption of the Site 1 (Mut1) led to an almost three-fold reduction of reporter gene activity compared with WT-643/+467, whereas the mutation of the Site 2 (Mut2) and Site 3 (Mut3) did not affect the reporter gene activity. Taken together, these results suggest that Jumu can be endogenously recruited to the conserved FKH-binding sites located in −27/–17 of the <italic>dmyc</italic> promoter via its FKH domain, and further strengthen the possibility that Jumu positively up-regulates <italic>dmyc</italic> expression by directly binding to the <italic>dmyc</italic> promoter.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25094.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Jumu regulates the expression of <italic>dmyc</italic> by binding to its FKH-binding site.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) The overexpression of <italic>jumu</italic> in circulating hemocytes (<italic>Hml&gt;GFP&gt;UAS-jumu</italic>) up-regulates <italic>dmyc</italic> expression at the translation (<bold>A</bold>) and transcription levels (<bold>B</bold>). ***p&lt;0.001 (Student’s <italic>t</italic> test).

We subsequently analyzed the spatial-temporal regulation of Jumu on PSC development during larval development. First, the expression pattern of dMyc during larval development was detected. dMyc is expressed at high levels in MZ and CZ cells but at low levels in PSC cells, and its expression pattern remains the same at all stages of larval development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similarly, the expression pattern of Jumu does not change during larval development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–F’’</xref>), suggesting that Jumu protein in the PSC might be responsible for the maintenance of dMyc expression. We then used a temporal and regional gene expression targeting system (Gal<sup>80ts</sup>/Gal4 expression system) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McGuire et al., 2003</xref>) to knock down <italic>jumu</italic> in the PSC at different larval stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3M</xref>). Similar to the phenotype observed after the knockdown of <italic>jumu</italic> in the PSC from embryogenesis, the knockdown of <italic>jumu</italic> in the PSC from L1 larval stage or L2 stage also caused the reductions in the PSC cell number to different degrees; in fact, the earlier knock down of <italic>jumu</italic> resulted in a greater reduction in the PSC cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A–F,N</xref>). This result indicates a continuous role for Jumu in PSC cell proliferation during larval development. The above results show that the loss of <italic>jumu</italic> in the MZ is responsible for the ectopic PSC cells detected in the early larval stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). We then used the Gal80ts/Gal4 expression system to knock down <italic>jumu</italic> in the MZ at different larval stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3M</xref>). The loss of <italic>jumu</italic> in the MZ from L1 larval stage or L2 stage also caused the ectopic expansion of PSC cells, and an earlier knockdown of <italic>jumu</italic> resulted in an increased ectopic expansion of PSC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3G–L,O</xref>). This result further confirms that the expression of Jumu in the MZ prevents the expansion of PSC cell toward the MZ throughout larval development. In conclusion, the expression of Jumu in the MZ and PSC simultaneously maintains the normal development of the PSC. Moreover, changes in the <italic>jumu</italic> expression levels in the entire lymph gland result in defects in PSC morphology similar to those detected in response to changes in the <italic>jumu</italic> levels in the MZ but opposite to those caused by changes in the <italic>jumu</italic> levels in the PSC, indicating that the expression of Jumu in the MZ might play a more prominent role in regulating PSC morphology when <italic>jumu</italic> is lost or overexpressed in both the PSC and the MZ.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The loss of <italic>jumu</italic> in the entire lymph gland leads to the generation of lamellocytes through the activation of Toll signaling</title><p>The above-described results suggest that the severe loss of <italic>jumu</italic> can induce an increase in lamellocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–N</xref>). We subsequently investigated where and how Jumu controls the generation of lamellocytes. The knockdown of <italic>jumu</italic> in different zones of the lymph gland did not cause obvious increases in the lamellocytes; in fact, only less than 20% of the lymph gland showed a few lamellocytes (n &gt; 30) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). However, using <italic>e33C-Gal4</italic> to knock down <italic>jumu</italic> in the entire lymph gland led to the generation of numerous lamellocytes in more than 50% of the lymph gland (n = 32), and similar to <italic>jumu</italic> mutant, <italic>e33C&gt;jumu RNAi</italic> also showed reduced numbers of crystal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–E</xref>).

Moreover, a recent study show that the Toll signaling transcription factors Dorsal and Dorsal-related immunity factor (Dif) are expressed in the lymph gland and that the ectopic expression of both factors in the PSC can cause the generation of lamellocytes in the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gueguen et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we asked whether the lamellocytes caused by the loss of <italic>jumu</italic> in the lymph gland are linked to Toll signaling. The expression and localization of Dorsal and Dif were detected via antibody staining, and interestingly, we found that Dorsal was enriched in nuclei throughout the lymph glands in the control animals (<italic>Srp-Gal4</italic>), whereas Dif was located in the cytoplasm and showed high expression levels in the PSC and lower signals in the MZ and CZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9L,R</xref>). To rule out the effect of the transgenes background of the <italic>Srp-Gal4</italic> line on the localization of Dorsal and Dif, we also detected the expression of Dorsal and Dif in the wild-type (<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>) lymph gland and observed the same results (data not shown). The knockdown of <italic>jumu</italic> in the entire lymph gland did not affect the expression and localization of Dorsal but caused an activation of Dif, mainly in the CZ and partly in the MZ but not in the PSC; in fact, most cells in the CZ showed obvious nuclei enrichment of Dif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9M,S</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2E–F’</xref>). In addition, Dorsal and Dif were not enriched in the nuclei of circulating cells of the <italic>Srp&gt;jumu RNAi</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>), suggesting that the knockdown of <italic>jumu</italic> might activate the Toll signaling specifically in the lymph gland. We found that the activation of the Toll pathway throughout the through the overexpression of <italic>Toll<sup>10b</sup></italic> under the control of <italic>Srp-Gal4</italic> also caused a robust increase in the lamellocyte in more than 80% of the lymph glands (n = 30), and also led to enrichment of Dif in the nuclear in the MZ and CZ without affecting the Dorsal expression and localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9N,T</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2G,G’</xref>). To further confirm whether Toll signaling is involved in the generation of lamellocytes in the <italic>Srp&gt;jumu RNAi</italic> mutant, we performed rescue experiment with a <italic>dif</italic> mutant. The loss of <italic>dif</italic> effectively reduced the lamellocytes in the <italic>Srp&gt;jumu RNAi</italic> mutant; specifically, only less than 10% of the lymph gland generated a few lamellocytes, and the nuclear enrichment of Dif was abolished (n = 36) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9J,V</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the activation of Dif in the lymph gland can spontaneously induce lamellocyte differentiation and that Jumu can prevent the activation of Dif and consequently maintain the normal hemocyte differentiation in the lymph gland.<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25094.017</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Loss of <italic>jumu</italic> in the entire lymph gland induces the generation of lamellocytes through the activation of Toll signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Immunostaining for L1 (red) and Hnt (red) shows that the knock down of <italic>jumu</italic> in the entire lymph gland increases the number of lamellocytes (<bold>B</bold>) and reduces the number of crystal cells (<bold>D</bold>).

The more recent results suggest that the development and maintenance of <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoietic progenitors are associated with niche interactions and systemic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mercier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shim et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, some conserved molecules and regulatory networks controlling lymph gland homeostasis have been gradually elucidated.</p><p>In this study, we showed that Jumu is expressed in the entire lymph gland and regulates the differentiation of the lymph gland via multiple regulatory mechanisms. It has been demonstrated that Jumu regulates nucleolar morphology and function and chromatin organization and that the correct genetic dose is required for nucleolar integrity and correct nucleolar function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hofmann et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we found that Jumu also regulates the hemocyte differentiation of the lymph gland in a dose-dependent manner. The change in the level of <italic>jumu</italic> expression in the entire lymph gland substantially alters the composition of the hemocyte population and the morphology of the lymph gland. The loss of one copy of <italic>jumu</italic> leads to the expansion of Col<sup>+</sup> PSC cells and to a reduced differentiation of plasmatocytes and crystal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). The loss of two copies of <italic>jumu</italic> induces a more severe phenotype of ectopic Col<sup>+</sup> PSC cells throughout the primary and secondary lobes of the lymph gland, favors lamellocyte differentiation at the expense of crystal cells, and causes obvious overgrowth of the secondary lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Notably, the obvious lamellocyte differentiation phenotype was only observed in larvae in which <italic>jumu</italic> was knocked in the entire lymph gland and not in the larvae in which <italic>jumu</italic> was knocked down in different specific zones. This phenomenon suggests that the generation of lamellocytes might require a systemic deficiency of <italic>jumu</italic> in the entire lymph gland and that local <italic>jumu</italic> expression might be sufficient to prevent lamellocyte differentiation. Our results suggest that the loss of <italic>jumu</italic> in the entire lymph gland induces lamellocyte generation through the activation of Toll signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Our previous study has showed that the overexpression of <italic>jumu</italic> in both circulating hemocytes and the fat body activates the Toll pathway in hemocytes that were deposited on the fat body, and subsequently leads to the formation of melanotic nodules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). These results suggest that the correct genetic dose of <italic>jumu</italic> is important for the activation of Toll-dependent immune response and chronic inflammation. Moreover, several pathways, such as the JAK/STAT, JNK, Insulin/TOR and Spi/EGFR signaling pathways, have been reported to be directly involved in the differentiation of lamellocytes in different zones of the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Owusu-Ansah and Banerjee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sinenko et al., 2011</xref>). However, although the role of Toll signaling in the immune response and larval hematopoiesis has been investigated widely, most studies focused on the fat body and hemolymph, and few studies investigated the lymph gland. Here, we found that in contrast to its expression in circulating hemocytes, Dorsal is highly expressed in nuclei in the lymph gland, suggesting that it might be involved in lymph gland development and homeostasis in addition to participating in the Toll-dependent immune response. Different from Dorsal, Dif is expressed in the cytoplasm of cells in the lymph gland and becomes enriched in nuclei upon activation of the Toll pathway. This result suggests that similar to its role in the fat body and circulating hemocytes, Dif might also mainly participate in the Toll-mediated immune response. Toll signaling in the PSC also non- cell-autonomously influences fate choice in basal and parasite-activated hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gueguen et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the Toll ligand, Spz protein and <italic>SPE</italic> transcripts are expressed in cells of the lymph gland lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Paddibhatla et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mulinari et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jang et al., 2006</xref>). These findings indicate that Toll signaling might play an important role in the regulation of lymph gland hematogenesis. However, the regulatory mechanism of Toll signaling on the development and immune response of the lymph gland remain to be addressed. Moreover, we found that ectopic expression of <italic>col</italic> throughout the lymph gland also leads to the activation of Toll signaling and that Jumu might control the Toll signaling by regulating <italic>col</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Some elements, such as fly IkB, <italic>cact,</italic> the SUMO conjugase and Ubc9, can balance the activation of immune signaling, the loss of function of these factors result in constitutive activation of Toll signaling in the fat body and circulating hemocytes and indirectly causes chronic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Paddibhatla et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, the correct genetic dose of Jumu and Col might maintain the normal immune homeostasis of the lymph gland and indirectly prevent the development of chronic inflammation. Future studies will address the mechanism through which Jumu and Col regulate the activation of Toll signaling in the lymph gland.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25094.020</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model of the role of Jumu in lymph gland hematopoiesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation showing that the fate of hemocyte differentiation is determined by the level of <italic>jumu</italic> expression in the entire lymph gland.

Previous studies suggest that the PSC functions as a hematopoietic niche and is essential for the maintenance of prohemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). Conversely, recent studies indicate that ablation of the PSC does not affect prohemocyte maintenance and that the PSC is dispensable for the maintenance of prohemocytes under laboratory breeding conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benmimoun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Oyallon et al., 2016</xref>). However, changes in the levels of certain proteins or signal elements from the PSC indeed affect prohemocyte differentiation. It has been suggested that dMyc is expressed at low levels in PSC cells and that the forced expression of dMyc selectively in the PSC leads to an increased number of PSC cells and further results in an expansion of the prohemocyte pool at the expense of hemocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, Slit/Robo signaling, Dpp/Wg signaling and the genetic regulators InR, Bam, and Rbf control the number of PSC cells by regulating the expression of dMyc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morin-Poulard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sinenko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tokusumi et al., 2015</xref>). Our results indicate that Jumu cell-autonomously ensures proper PSC cell proliferation by positively regulating dMyc expression in the PSC and that it further affects the maintenance of prohemocytes in an indirect manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). In addition, through an in vitro experiment, we also confirmed that Jumu promotes the transcription of the <italic>dmyc</italic> gene via directly binding to its promoter. Moreover, Jumu shows no obvious regulatory effect on the dMyc level in the MZ and CZ, which suggests that the role of Jumu in the regulation of dMyc expression is zone-specific. In addition to the cell-autonomous mechanism, Jumu also controls the numbers of PSC cells in a non-cell-autonomous manner. The loss of <italic>jumu</italic> in the entire lymph gland or the MZ can lead to the ectopic expansion of PSC cells, and this effect is accompanied by the overexpression of dMyc in these cells. This result suggests that Jumu might regulate the expression of some regulatory factors in the MZ that can deliver signals to neighboring PSC cells and indirectly prevent the overexpression of dMyc, thereby maintaining the proper PSC cell number and location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). However, overexpression of <italic>jumu</italic> in the MZ alone is not sufficient to reduce dMyc expression and the number of PSC cells. In fact, this result indicates that Jumu protein in the MZ might mainly function in the maintenance of the normal development margin between the MZ and the PSC and further maintains the homeostasis of each zone of the lymph gland but does not directly regulate proliferation in the PSC in a spontaneous manner. It has been suggested that Slit from the cardiac tube controls PSC morphology and that inter-organ crosstalk between the cardiac tube and the PSC is required to preserve the normal PSC morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morin-Poulard et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, Jumu might also participate in the inter-zone communication between the MZ and the PSC and thereby preserve the normal development of each zone. Notably, different from the PSC phenotypes caused by the loss of <italic>jumu</italic> in the MZ or in the entire lymph gland, the additional PSC cells induced by the overexpression of <italic>jumu</italic> or <italic>dmyc</italic> in the PSC are all located in the original PSC domain rather than being scattered through the MZ or CZ, further strengthening the notion that Jumu protein in the MZ and the PSC regulate the distribution of PSC cells through different mechanisms. The relationship between Jumu and the known signaling pathways associated with PSC development remains to be addressed.</p><p>In addition to regulating the homeostasis of the PSC, Jumu also maintains prohemocyte differentiation in a cell-autonomous manner by preventing the overexpression of Col in the MZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). More recently, it was shown that the EBF transcription factor Col is also expressed at low levels in prohemocytes as well as in the PSC and that Col directly promotes the maintenance of <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood cell progenitors independently of the niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benmimoun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Oyallon et al., 2016</xref>). The overexpression of <italic>jumu</italic> in the MZ is sufficient to reduce the Col level and induce an increased differentiation of prohemocytes. However, we found that although the knockdown of <italic>jumu</italic> in the MZ causes an increase in the Col level, the differentiation of plasmatocytes and crystal cells is not markedly reduced. We speculate that this phenomenon might be caused by the dose-dependent function of <italic>jumu</italic> and that the RNAi-induced decrease in the <italic>jumu</italic> expression level in the MZ is insufficient to obtain a sufficient expression of Col to inhibit the differentiation of prohemocytes. Moreover, it has been suggested that Col protein in the PSC controls the number of PSC cells by activating the expression of Dally-like (Dlp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>). In this study, we showed that Col also positively regulates the expression of Dlp in the MZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Different from its role in the MZ, ectopic expression of <italic>col</italic> throughout the lymph gland leads to the generation of lamellocytes and reduced crystal cells but does not affect plasmatocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crozatier et al., 2004</xref>); interestingly, these phenotypes were also observed in <italic>jumu</italic> double heterozygotes but not in <italic>jumu</italic> heterozygotes. These results suggest that the correct expression levels and regions of <italic>jumu</italic> or <italic>col</italic> are required for the normal lymph gland development. Further work is needed to decipher the regulation and the mechanisms of action of Col in the maintenance of lymph gland homeostasis. Moreover, the signals associated with <italic>jumu</italic> and other transcription factors that regulate <italic>col</italic> expression remain to be addressed. A recent study showed that Ebf2, the mammalian ortholog of Col, can promote hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance by controlling the development of osteoblastic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kieslinger et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that the members of the forkhead-box (FOX) transcription factor family in human and mouse play crucial roles in various aspects of immune regulation, from lymphocyte survival to thymic and embryonic development and cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coffer and Burgering, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lehmann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">von Both et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martínez-Gac et al., 2004</xref>).

Alexa Fluor 488-, Alexa Fluor 568- and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used. ROS detection was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evans et al., 2014</xref>) using dihydroethidium (Invitrogen). Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope or a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope equipped with fluorescence optics. All staining was performed in samples from at least three independent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Image analyses</title><p>For quantifications, the lymph glands were scanned at an optimized number of slices (aiming to acquire all staining signals throughout the tissue) using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope, usually less than three optical sections from the Z stack can contain all signal from one tissue. To quantify the crystal cell and ROS indexes and the PSC cell number, the consecutive slices from the same primary lobe were assembled in Photoshop CS6, and the merged images were used for the quantifications. The crystal cell and ROS indexes were calculated as the total number of Hnt<sup>+</sup> or ROS<sup>+</sup> cells (quantified using ImageJ, NIH), respectively, in each primary lobe divided by the relative area of the primary lobe. The total PSC cell (Antp<sup>+</sup> cell) number in each primary lobe was also quantified using ImageJ. At least 30 lymph glands were scored for each genotype. For the quantification of P1<sup>+</sup> cells and the Shg<sup>+</sup> and domeMESO<sup>+</sup> cell indexes, the fluorescent images collected by Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope were converted to 8-bit images and then recalibrated to obtain an identical threshold using ImageJ. The area with the identical threshold was captured and measured with ImageJ. To measure the total size of the primary lobes, the DAPI-expressing area was captured using freehand selection tool of ImageJ and measured. The plasmatocyte differentiation index was assessed by determining the average area of P1<sup>+</sup> cells from all optical sections of a primary lobe compared with the area of the primary lobe. The proportion of prohemocytes in the primary lobes (MZ/lobe 1) was defined as the average area of Shg<sup>+</sup> or domeMESO<sup>+</sup> cells in all optical sections of a primary lobe compared with the area of the primary lobe. At least 30 lymph glands were analyzed for each genotype. For quantification of the Col, Dlp, dMyc and Jumu fluorescence signal intensities in the MZ or PSC, images were captured with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope at the same exposure times, and at least three confocal slides (4 μm) per stack were analyzed. The total intensity values for Col, Dlp, dMyc and Jumu in each ROI (region of interest) were measured using ImageJ. For the analysis of Col and Dlp staining in the MZ, dome-GFP was used to define the ROIs. For the analysis of dMyc and Jumu staining in the PSC, Antp labeling was used for to define the ROIs. The ROIs in the fluorescent images were captured using the freehand tool and then converted to 8-bit images. The total intensity value of the ROIs with an identical threshold was captured and measured with ImageJ. The average pixel intensity values of dMyc or Jumu in PSC cells (integrated intensity/area of Antp-labeled cells) were calculated. The pixel intensity values of Col or Dlp in the MZ were assessed as the integrated intensity in the ROIs compared with the area of the primary lobe. For each fluorescence quantification experiment, at least 20 lymph glands were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays</title><p>ChIP assays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2005</xref>). In brief, S2 cells (CVCL_Z232, Invitrogen, Cat#R690-07) were transfected with the pMK33-Flag-jumu full CDS construct using the Effectene Transfection kit (Qiagen). S2 cells stably expressing Flag-jumu were fixed in 1% formaldehyde at room temperature. The samples were then sonicated to obtain DNA fragments between 200 and 800 bp in length. The fragmented chromatin was incubated with the anti-Flag antibody (Sigma) or IgG (Santa Cruz) bound to Salmon Sperm DNA/Protein A Agarose Slurry (Upstate) overnight at 4°C. The immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were recovered using a MiniElute purification kit (Qiagen) and analyzed by PCR amplification. Similar results were obtained in three independent ChIP experiments.

The methods describe that an optimal number of sections were used. What does this mean? Was the number of optical sections kept constant in each case? Indeed, are these all confocal images? An LSM510 is mentioned but most of the analysis was done on an Axioplan2 microscope. If the entire depth of the tissue is imaged, there will be a great deal of variability. How does pixel intensity converted to number of cells when the intensity per cell could vary and how were the thresholds set? Why are the quantitations in the later figures represented as histograms? Ideally, the entire paper should have a uniform standard in how images are quantified so that the readers can get a clear comparison between all of the data presented.

Authors have shown that one copy loss of Jumu inhibits the blood progenitor differentiation due to the expansion of PSC cells. These phenotypes are restored by expression of Jumu specifically in the blood progenitors, while the other cell-type specific drivers do not result in the rescue phenotype. Authors have also shown that overexpression of Jumu in the blood progenitors induces differentiation of mature blood cells, and confirmed that expression of Col and Dlp are regulated by levels of Jumu in the MZ. In addition to the function of Jumu in the MZ, authors have identified that Jumu in the PSC controls the proliferation of PSC cells and thereby indirectly affects the progenitor maintenance. One possible downstream of Jumu identified in this paper is dMyc, of which expression can be directly controlled by Jumu. Overall, these data suggest two independent functions of Jumu in the regulation of progenitors by inhibition of Col in the MZ or by activating dMyc expression in the PSC.</p><p>1) One of the main findings of Jin and Hao is that one-copy loss of Jumu induces expansion of the PSC cells in the lymph gland. However, the phenotype shown by Jumu heterozygote (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,F</xref>' or H) includes both proliferation and clustering defects of the PSC. Previous study has shown that these two phenomena are regulated by two independent pathways in the PSC; proliferation is regulated by Dpp/dMyc and clustering, by DE-cad/Cdc42 (Morin-Poulard et al., 2015). Authors have demonstrated that expression of Jumu in the MZ rescues both proliferation and clustering phenotypes of the PSC. To support the authors' claim, it will be important to identify genetic correlations in between Jumu in the MZ and two other pathways in the PSC in detail.</p><p>2) Along the same lines; if Jumu is widely expressed in other tissues including the dorsal vessel, it is possible that Jumu regulates Slit/Robo that in turn regulates both proliferation and clustering of the PSC. To exclude the involvement of Slit/Robo pathway and its indirect regulation, experiments such as Hand-gal4 driving Jumu RNAi or overexpression of Jumu will simply solve this concern.</p><p>3) One-copy loss of Jumu induces expansion of PSC cells in the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and this phenotype is recapitulated by Dome-gal4 driving Jumu RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). However, downregulation of Jumu in the PSC further reduces the number of PSC cells, while overexpression of Jumu leads to the proliferation of PSC cells. These data indicate that Jumu regulates dMyc in opposite ways in two zones; Jumu in the MZ non-autonomously inhibits dMyc whereas Jumu in the PSC autonomously activates dMyc. However, in the development of the PSC, PSC cells require proliferation at earlier stages while Jumu needs to inhibit the proliferation in later instars. Developmental relevance of Jumu would be also important for understanding the gene function. Supplementing strong evidence that there are changes in the expression levels of Jumu/dMyc throughout larval development, or different phenotypes led by early vs late knockdown of Jumu in different zones would strengthen the developmental function of Jumu/dMyc in the PSC.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this study, Hao and Lin explore the role of Jumu in controlling blood progenitor function in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, specifically in the larval lymph gland. Their findings demonstrate that Jumu maintains prohemocytes by cell-autonomously preventing the overexpression of Col in the MZ and by non-cell-autonomously inhibiting dMyc in the PSC to regulate its size. Their study also studies reveals a requirement for Jumu in cell-autonomously controlling PSC cell proliferation via dMyc. Their findings provide novel insight into the molecular regulation of progenitor maintenance, in particular a novel mechanism in which the progenitor population provides feedback to the cells of the niche/PSC for their own maintenance. The quality of the data is excellent and consistent with established standards for this field. However, there are a few concerns that need to be addressed:</p><p>Expression of Hedgehog in the PSC should be assessed upon overexpression of Jumu in the MZ to determine if the increased differentiation observed is due to loss of this maintenance signal.</p><p>It cannot be assumed that lamellocytes present in the lymph gland of trans-heterozygote Jumu mutants is due to loss of collier (Discussion, second paragraph). Staining of lymph glands for lamellocytes in which Jumu is removed in specific zones would allow insight into the process.</p><p>Dome-gal4 is expressed outside of the MZ in many other organs and the authors cannot rule an effect external to the signal responsible for the observed effect of inhibiting PSC expansion in Jumu mutants. This should be stated.</p><p>It would be useful to have clones of Jumu made in which the cell autonomous effects observed can be established, particularly given that the levels of Jumu may have different effects on cell maintenance and differentiation.</p><p>In addition, the following need to be corrected prior to publication:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1S-U</xref>: the ROS staining looks poorly done.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M and N</xref>: these experiments need labeling with a MZ marker like shg or ptc.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D and H</xref>: it is not clear if the ectopic Antp cells are derived from the PSC or the result of a homeotic transformation in which an ectopic PSC is generated. The fact that Dome&gt;UAS-Jumu rescues the phenotype of ectopic PSC may have to do with Jumu preventing the PSC fate in the MZ (domeless is expressed very early in lymph gland development) rather than the PSC increasing in size.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O</xref>: The quantification panel can go in supplementary to maintain symmetry for the figure.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-C</xref>: the Jumu staining looks cytoplasmic while clearly nuclear with some cytoplasmic in the PSC. Have the authors looked at the developmental pattern of expression of Jumu to determine if it is ever nuclear in the lymph gland outside of the PSC? The developmental pattern of Jumu expression is essential to understand its function.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M and O</xref>: images too blurry.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P</xref>: can go in supplementary.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>: the figure is missing dome-gal4, UAS-Jumu, UAS-col with Antp immunostaining.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>: the schematic model is misleading since the trans heterozygote must include a hypomorphic mutation and not a complete loss of function to allow survival into adulthood.

Our previous paper indicated that the overexpression of <italic>jumu</italic> simultaneously in both hemocytes and the fat body leads to an enrichment of Dorsal and Dif in the nuclei of aggregated circulating hemocytes and deposited hemocytes on the fat body.

(“Cheah PY, Chia W, Yang X. 2000. Jumeaux, a novel <italic>Drosophila</italic> winged-helix family protein, is required for generating asymmetric sibling neuronalcell fates.

Domina (Dom), a new <italic>Drosophila</italic> member of the FKH/WH gene family, affects morphogenesis and is a suppressor of position-effect variegation. Mech Dev 96: 67–78.”). In addition, we detected the expression pattern of Jumu protein in the lymph gland at different larval stages through staining with anti-Jumu antibody and observed that Jumu is expressed in the entire lymph gland and mainly localized in the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A-4F</xref>”; subsection “Jumu expression in prohemocytes is required for preventing the ectopic expansion of PSC cells”).</p><p>With respect to the known role of Hox gene Homothorax (Hth) in Antp expression is restricted to embryo, Antp<sup>+</sup> cells were decreased in the embryo of the Homothorax (Hth) mutant (Mandal L, Martinez-Agosto JA, Evans CJ, Hartenstein V, Banerjee U. 2007.

ROS only appear in the MZ until the middle- third larval stage and can primes hematopoietic progenitors for differentiation (Owusu-Ansah E, Banerjee U. 2009. Reactive oxygen species prime <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoietic progenitors for differentiation. Nature461: 537–541”). We observed low ROS levels in <italic>jumu</italic> mutant third-instar larva; therefore, the progenitor cells are unable to differentiate into mature hemocytes.

We have described the quantification methods in detail in the Materials and methods section(subsection “Image analyses”).

For the quantifications of the Col, Dlp, dMyc and Jumu fluorescence signal intensities in the MZ or PSC, at least 20 lymph glands were analyzed. We provide a detailed description about the collection and analysis of images in the Materials and methods section(subsection “Image analyses”).</p><p>In this study, the Antp, Hnt and ROS signals were converted to the number of cells, because these three markers are all located in nuclei and show a clearer signal. Moreover, the signal intensity in each cell was similar, and these signal points are relatively scattered and can thus be counted easily. The image acquisition settings were adjusted to avoid over-exposure, but allow observation of a clear scattered signal.</p><p>All quantification graphs are presented as box-and-whiskers with the exceptions of Figures 1EE and 9B, which show the quantification of mRNA levels.</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>., the data look very nice, but a developmental series will be useful in knowing whether the cells are migrating or arising in the wrong site. Overexpression of Antp causes an expansion of the PSC, the reason has never been clear. This again brings up the question of whether ANTP controls JUMU.</italic> </p><p>We have added a description of the morphology of the PSC at different larval stages and the colocalization of Antp<sup>+</sup> PSC cells and <italic>dome-GFP<sup>+</sup></italic>cells or <italic>Hml-GFP<sup>+</sup></italic>cells, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>(subsection “Jumu negatively regulates the proliferation and ectopic expansion of Col<sup>+</sup> PSC cells”).

The results indicate that the ectopic PSC cells in the <italic>jumu</italic> mutants are derived from the PSC domain. In addition, previous studies have shown that Antp is only located in the PSC of the lymph gland (Mandal L, Martinez-Agosto JA, Evans CJ, Hartenstein V, Banerjee U. 2007.

Although dMyc might be one of the factors responsible for the increase in circulating hemocytes in <italic>Hml&gt;UAS-jumu</italic>, some other signaling pathways and elements might also be involved in the proliferation of circulating hemocytes. The role of Jumu in hemocyte proliferation remains to be further investigated.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25094.023</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25094.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25094.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-25094-resp-fig2-v3"/></fig></p><p><italic>8) Also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, the binding assay needs a critical control with mutated binding sites.</italic> </p><p>We mutated two positions in each of the three putative FKH-binding sites, the mutated promoter was cloned to the pGL3 vector, and a luciferase reporter gene assay was used to detect their activation.

However, the phenotype shown by Jumu heterozygote (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,F</xref>' or H) includes both proliferation and clustering defects of the PSC. Previous study has shown that these two phenomena are regulated by two independent pathways in the PSC; proliferation is regulated by Dpp/dMyc and clustering, by DE-cad/Cdc42 (Morin-Poulard et al., 2015). Authors have demonstrated that expression of Jumu in the MZ rescues both proliferation and clustering phenotypes of the PSC. To support the authors' claim, it will be important to identify genetic correlations in between Jumu in the MZ and two other pathways in the PSC in detail.</italic> </p><p>We have analyzed the correlations between Jumu and DE-cad/Cdc42 or Dpp/dMyc in the MZ in the regulation of PSC morphology. The expression levels of Shg (DE-cad) were not reduced in the PSC of <italic>jumu<sup>Df2.12</sup></italic>compared with the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-1B</xref>’’). We then performed a rescue experiment to identify the correlation between Jumu and Cdc42. The overexpression of the dominant negative form of Cdc42 (<italic>cdc42-DN</italic>) in the PSC of <italic>jumu <sup>Df2.12</sup></italic>did not rescue the increased number and clustering defect of the PSC cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-1E</xref>). These results suggest that Jumu protein in the MZ controls the clustering morphology of the PSC in a DE-cad/Cdc42-independent manner. In addition, we also found that the expression of Dlp and P-Mad was not reduced in the PSC of <italic>jumu<sup>Df2.12</sup></italic>compared with the wild-type, suggesting that Jumu does not regulate Dpp signaling in the PSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F-1I</xref>’’, subsection “The loss of jumu in the MZ non-cell-autonomously induces increases in dMyc in the PSC”).</p><p><italic>2) Along the same lines; if Jumu is widely expressed in other tissues including the dorsal vessel, it is possible that Jumu regulates Slit/Robo that in turn regulates both proliferation and clustering of the PSC. To exclude the involvement of Slit/Robo pathway and its indirect regulation, experiments such as Hand-gal4 driving Jumu RNAi or overexpression of Jumu will simply solve this concern.</italic> </p><p>We knocked down or overexpressed <italic>jumu</italic> using the <italic>Hand-Gal4</italic> driver to detect PSC cells but did not observe defects in either proliferation or clustering in the PSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-1D</xref>). Moreover, using <italic>Hand-Gal4</italic> driver to overexpress <italic>jumu</italic> in the <italic>jumu<sup>Df2.12</sup></italic>mutant did not rescue the PSC phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and 4H</xref>; subsection “The loss of jumu in the MZ non-cell-autonomously induces increases in dMyc in the PSC”).</p><p><italic>3) One-copy loss of Jumu induces expansion of PSC cells in the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and this phenotype is recapitulated by Dome-gal4 driving Jumu RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). However, downregulation of Jumu in the PSC further reduces the number of PSC cells, while overexpression of Jumu leads to the proliferation of PSC cells. These data indicate that Jumu regulates dMyc in opposite ways in two zones; Jumu in the MZ non-autonomously inhibits dMyc whereas Jumu in the PSC autonomously activates dMyc. However, in the development of the PSC, PSC cells require proliferation at earlier stages while Jumu needs to inhibit the proliferation in later instars. Developmental relevance of Jumu would be also important for understanding the gene function. Supplementing strong evidence that there are changes in the expression levels of Jumu/dMyc throughout larval development, or different phenotypes led by early vs late knockdown of Jumu in different zones would strengthen the developmental function of Jumu/dMyc in the PSC.</italic> </p><p>First, we detected the expression pattern of Jumu and dMyc in the lymph gland during larval development. We observed that Jumu and dMyc are detected throughout larval developmental stage and that is expression pattern is similar to that detected in the third-instar lymph gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B-4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>; subsection “Jumu cell-autonomously controls the size of the PSC by regulating the expression of dMyc”, last paragraph). This result suggests that Jumu protein in the PSC and MZ might consistently balance the dMyc expression levels.</p><p>We then used a temporal and regional gene expression targeting system to knock down <italic>jumu</italic> in the PSC or MZ at different developmental stages and detect the PSC numbers. The results show that the PSC cells were reduced or expanded to different degrees at each developmental stage from first to third instar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>, subsection “Jumu cell-autonomously controls the size of the PSC by regulating the expression of dMyc”, last paragraph). These results suggest that Jumu expression in both the MZ and the PSC ensures maintenance of normal PSC development.</p><p>Moreover, we hypothesize that Jumu protein located in the MZ mainly prevents the expansion and scattering of PSC cells toward the MZ and indirectly maintains normal MZ development during lymph gland development but is not sufficient to initiate the inhibition of PSC cell proliferation. We also found that the loss of <italic>jumu</italic> in the MZ causes an expansion of the PSC and an increase in dMyc expression and that the overexpression of <italic>jumu</italic> in the MZ did not spontaneously lead to the reduction in the PSC cell number and dMyc expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, 5R, 5L, 5L</xref>’ and 5S). In other words, the main function of Jumu in the MZ may be maintenance of the normal development zone margin between the MZ and the PSC as well as maintenance of the homeostasis of each zone of the lymph gland. A detailed discussion is provided in the third paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>In this study, Hao and Lin explore the role of Jumu in controlling blood progenitor function in Drosophila, specifically in the larval lymph gland. Their findings demonstrate that Jumu maintains prohemocytes by cell-autonomously preventing the overexpression of Col in the MZ and by non-cell-autonomously inhibiting dMyc in the PSC to regulate its size. Their study also studies reveals a requirement for Jumu in cell-autonomously controlling PSC cell proliferation via dMyc. Their findings provide novel insight into the molecular regulation of progenitor maintenance, in particular a novel mechanism in which the progenitor population provides feedback to the cells of the niche/PSC for their own maintenance. The quality of the data is excellent and consistent with established standards for this field.

The clonal analysis confirmed these conclusions. First, clonal cells in which <italic>jumu</italic> was knocked down rarely overlapped with P1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B-B</xref><italic>’’</italic>), but most P1<sup>+</sup> cells overlapped with clonal cells overexpressing <italic>jumu</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C-3C</xref>’’), suggesting that Jumu autonomously promotes hemocyte differentiation.

Previous studies have shown that Jumu is located in the nuclei of syncytial embryos, is present in all nuclei of the cellular blastoderm, and is predominantly expressed in the brain lobes, in the segmented CNS and in elements of the PNS. In third-instar larvae, the most prominent expression of Jumu is in imaginal discs, the CNS, the ring gland and the hindgut (<underline>Cheah, P.Y</underline>., <underline>Chia, W</underline>., <underline>Yang, X</underline>., 2000.
