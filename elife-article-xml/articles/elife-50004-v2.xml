It is hypothesized that Cas1 evolved from casposases, a novel class of transposases. We show here that the <italic>Methanosarcina mazei</italic> casposase can integrate varied forms of the casposon end in vitro, and recapitulates several properties of CRISPR-Cas integrases including site-specificity. The X-ray structure of the casposase bound to DNA representing the product of integration reveals a tetramer with target DNA bound snugly between two dimers in which single-stranded casposon end binding resembles that of spacer 3'-overhangs. The differences between transposase and CRISPR-Cas integrase are largely architectural, and it appears that evolutionary change involved changes in protein-protein interactions to favor Cas2 binding over tetramerization; this in turn led to preferred integration of single spacers over two transposon ends.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>casposon</kwd><kwd>transposon</kwd><kwd>CRISPR-Cas</kwd><kwd>Cas1</kwd><kwd>integrase</kwd><kwd>mobile genetic element</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hickman</surname><given-names>Alison B</given-names></name><name><surname>Kailasan</surname><given-names>Shweta</given-names></name><name><surname>Genzor</surname><given-names>Pavol</given-names></name><name><surname>Haase</surname><given-names>Astrid D</given-names></name><name><surname>Dyda</surname><given-names>Fred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The tetrameric structure of a casposase bound to DNA and its biochemical properties show how a transposase could have evolved to perform CRISPR-Cas spacer acquisition.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CRISPR-Cas systems, encoded in the genomes of many bacterial and archaeal species, function as defense systems against invading foreign nucleic acids such as bacteriophages and plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barrangou et al., 2007</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mohanraju et al., 2016</xref>). They provide acquired immunity in which the first step in thwarting an attack involves extracting short stretches of the foreign nucleic acid and archiving these DNA segments (or ‘spacers’) at the CRISPR locus where they alternate with host-specific repeats; this part of the process is known as adaptation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marraffini, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sternberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amitai and Sorek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jackson et al., 2017</xref>). The CRISPR locus is then transcribed as a long CRISPR RNA (pre-crRNA) that is digested into shorter pieces (crRNAs). These ‘guide’ crRNAs are incorporated into a ribonucleoprotein interference complex that can recognize and cleave its complementary target sequence, thus destroying the invading nucleic acid.</p><p>Many different types of CRISPR-Cas systems have been discovered, with varying cohorts of associated genes and genomic architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Makarova et al., 2018</xref>). Common to all known autonomous CRISPR-Cas systems is the Cas1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Makarova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Makarova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wright et al., 2019</xref>) which acts in concert with its binding partner Cas2 to recognize, process, and integrate protospacers into the CRISPR-Cas locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yosef et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nuñez et al., 2014</xref>). Notable exceptions are the type V-C and V-D systems which lack a <italic>cas2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shmakov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burstein et al., 2017</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis of Cas1 proteins suggests that they may have originated from casposons, a novel class of putative DNA transposons in which a Cas1 homolog (the ‘casposase’) functions as the transposase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krupovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koonin and Makarova, 2017</xref>). If so, the evolution of CRISPR-Cas systems would parallel that of the adaptive immune system in higher eukaryotes, which evolved from an ancient DNA transposon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kapitonov and Jurka, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carmona and Schatz, 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Methanosarcina mazei</italic> casposon organization and initial biochemical characterization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (left) Schematic of a representative casposon from <italic>Methanosarcina mazei</italic> (the gene organization of casposon MetMaz1FA1A3-C2 is shown; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krupovic et al., 2016</xref>) adjacent to host tRNA-Leu gene (red arrow).

Efficient protospacer integration requires 3'-single stranded overhangs on each spacer end, and integration of the two 3'-ends into opposing strands of the target leads to the duplication of the CRISPR repeat.</p><p>Much less is known about casposases. Although the casposase from the archaeon <italic>Aciduliprofundum boonei</italic> is an active DNA integrase in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hickman and Dyda, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Béguin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Béguin et al., 2019</xref>), in vivo transposition activity has yet to be demonstrated and how casposon ends competent for integration might be generated remains a mystery. Casposons contain varying collections of other genes (as shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), but only the casposase and a family B polymerase appear common to all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krupovic et al., 2017</xref>). It is possible that casposases possess an endonuclease activity that would generate the necessary free 3’-ends, but this has not yet been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hickman and Dyda, 2015</xref>). Alternatively, a cellular protein might be responsible for generating free casposon ends, by analogy to those proteins such as RecBCD or AddAB implicated in the generation of protospacers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McGinn and Marraffini, 2019</xref>). It has also been suggested that the casposon-encoded family B polymerase might be responsible for synthesizing linear copies of the casposon that could then be integrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krupovic et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Given the great abundance of DNA transposons and DNA transposase genes in nature - and in particular those with a catalytic core based on the RNase H-like fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aziz et al., 2010</xref>) - it is intriguing that a relatively sparsely distributed transposase was selected over the course of evolution to become the core of the CRISPR-Cas spacer acquisition system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krupovic et al., 2014</xref>). Another puzzling aspect of the relationship is that, in most cases, DNA transposition involves strict specific recognition of transposon ends that are typically integrated into random locations in the genome whereas spacer acquisition involves the integration of many different fragments of invading DNA at a specific CRISPR locus just adjacent to a leader sequence.</p><p>To understand how Cas1 of CRISPR-Cas systems may have evolved from a transposase, we have characterized the biochemical properties of a casposase from <italic>Methanosarcina mazei</italic>. We have also determined its three-dimensional structure bound to branched DNA that represents the product of casposon end insertion into a specific sequence at the 3'-end of a host tRNA-Leu gene. We show that the casposase is tetrameric when bound to its target site and can site-specifically integrate a range of substrates including casposon ends with 3'-overhangs and even short single-stranded DNA ends as well as ssRNA. Our results suggest an evolutionary process in which a transposase that on its own recapitulates several canonical biochemical properties of CRISPR Cas1-Cas2 complexes acquired the ability to bind Cas2. This acquired interaction with a Cas2 dimer would have fundamentally changed the architecture of the integration complex, turning its properties away from transposon integration and towards spacer integration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The <italic>Methanosarcina mazei</italic> casposase is a site-specific integrase</title><p>The casposase from <italic>A. boonei</italic>, a species of archaea from the deep-sea hydrothermal vent euryarchaeota two lineage, is an active integrase that generates 14–15 bp target site duplications (TSDs) in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hickman and Dyda, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Béguin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Béguin et al., 2019</xref>). It can integrate into random DNA but demonstrates a preference for site-specific integration into the very 3'-end of a host tRNA gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Béguin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Béguin et al., 2019</xref>). Recently it was reported that a large family of closely related casposons are present in multiple strains of <italic>Methanosarsina mazei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krupovic et al., 2016</xref>), an archaeal species that lives in semiaquatic and usually temperate habitats. Different strains of <italic>M. mazei</italic> have casposons in different genomic locations, strongly suggesting that these casposons are either currently active or have recently been active. One commonly observed genomic location for casposons in this species is within tRNA-Leu genes. Analysis of integration sites suggested that there is a short consensus sequence, 5'-CGCA, within the TSDs observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krupovic et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To determine if <italic>M. mazei</italic> casposase genes encode currently active integrases and whether they exhibit an insertion site preference, we expressed and purified a representative casposase (see Figure 6A), and tested its in vitro activity using an integration assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We initially used a 31mer dsDNA oligonucleotide (‘dsLE31’) which represents one of the casposon Left End (LE) sequences found in <italic>M. mazei</italic> strains; the particular sequence used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) is one of the shortest Terminal Inverted Repeats (TIRs) and is identical in multiple casposon copies in <italic>M. mazei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krupovic et al., 2016</xref>). We used pUC19 and several variants of it as the target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As <italic>M. mazei</italic> casposons have been frequently observed within tRNA-Leu genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krupovic et al., 2016</xref>), we elected to investigate one such possible target site. We first introduced 14 bp into pUC19 (‘+TSD’) corresponding to an observed genomic TSD comprised of the final 4 bp of the tRNA-Leu gene and 10 additional bp. The particular TSD sequence chosen (found in strain 1 .F.A.1B.3 and others, shown in green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) conforms to the in vivo consensus sequence in which a conserved 5'-CGCA motif is followed by an AT-rich sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krupovic et al., 2016</xref>). We also generated pUC19 derivatives that contain either 15 or 30 more bp of the upstream tRNA-Leu gene (designated ‘+TSD+15 bp’ and ‘+TSD+30 bp’, respectively). Under the assay conditions used, the reaction time course shows that pUC19 itself is a poor target (lanes 1–5). Although there was little or no product formed when only the TSD (lanes 6–10) or TSD+15 bp (lanes 11–15) was introduced, relaxed products consistent with single-ended integration (SE) and linear products consistent with double-ended (DE) integration were readily observed when the TSD+30 bp of the tRNA-Leu gene were included (lanes 16–20). There was no further increase in activity when longer regions of the tRNA-Leu gene were included in the target plasmid (data not shown). These results suggested that integration by the <italic>M. mazei</italic> casposase is target-specific, and that the target site is contained within the sequence corresponding to TSD+30 bp. This is similar to the reported in vitro targeted integration of the <italic>A. boonei</italic> casposon into the 3' end of a host tRNA-Pro gene, although in that case, the data suggested that the target of this casposase is contained within a distinct TSD+15 bp region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Béguin et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To rule out the possibility that the casposon end oligonucleotide we used could be integrated using either of its terminal 3'-OH groups, we tested substrate derivatives with different phosphorylated 3' ends that would prevent their use as nucleophiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In this assay, we used a shorter casposon end oligonucleotide (dsLE17) which was also an effective substrate in the production of relaxed and linear products when incubated with the pUC19+TSD+30 bp target plasmid (lanes 1–4). It has previously been shown for the <italic>A. boonei</italic> casposase that ends considerably shorter than the entire TIR are competent for in vitro integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hickman and Dyda, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Béguin et al., 2019</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, relaxed and linear products were still formed when the remote 3'-OH group of dsLE17 was blocked by phosphorylation (lanes 5–7); conversely, when the nucleophilic 3'-OH group at the casposon end was blocked, there was no detectable product formation (lanes 8–10). In the context of the blocked casposon end, we also extended the top strand with 7-nt of ssDNA, and again no activity was detected (lanes 11–13). These results indicate that the casposase differentiates between the available 3’-OH groups of supplied oligonucleotides, and uses only the 3’-OH group at the casposon end as the nucleophile for integration.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>In vitro integration activity properties of the <italic>M. mazei</italic> casposase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Effect of blocking free 3'-OH ends on product formation.

(2019)</xref> that single-stranded casposon ends are effective substrates for the <italic>A. boonei</italic> casposase.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, with the exception of the random single-stranded 17mer (‘ssran17’) control, all oligonucleotide substrates tested produced relaxed and linear products consistent with single-ended and double-ended integrations when the specific target plasmid pUC19+TSD+30 bp was used, but not with pUC19. The level of production of the linear plasmid product (i.e., consistent with double-ended integration) was the highest for TR17; dsLE17 and ssLE17 produced similar intermediate levels, and ranTR17 and dsran17 were the least effective substrates.</p><p>We were intrigued by the capacity of the casposase to integrate ssDNA, and we repeated the assay with casposon-specific ssDNA oligonucleotides of varying length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Remarkably, casposon ends as short as six nt could be specifically integrated, a result that has also recently been demonstrated for the <italic>A. boonei</italic> casposase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Béguin et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, the results indicate that the <italic>M. mazei</italic> casposase has a wide tolerance for the type and sequence of oligonucleotides it can integrate, but with an apparent preference for a partially single-stranded casposon end. The putative evolution from transposition to spacer integration must therefore have involved acquiring the ability to discriminate among possible substrates and to integrate only short, recessed spacers of relatively specific length.</p><p>In order to quantify precise target site-specificity, we performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the linear plasmid products generated when pUC19+TSD+30 bp was used as the integration target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). Assays were carried out using either the 31mer casposon TIR (dsLE31) or a 29mer casposon end recessed by 5-nt on the top strand (TR29). As NGS has not been reported for casposases to date, we varied the sample preparation method in several ways. For four samples, linear reaction products resulting from the independent incubation with dsLE31 with pUC19+TSD+30 bp were isolated from agarose gels and subjected to either 17 cycles (duplicate samples S1A1, S2A1) or 30 cycles (duplicate samples S3A2, S4A2) of PCR prior to the preparation of sequencing libraries. We also carried out a large-scale reaction using TR29 so that enough linear product could be obtained directly to avoid the need for PCR amplification prior to library preparation (sample S5D). This allowed us to assess the relative integration frequency for the two possible orientations of the casposon end, as our PCR strategy would not detect products resulting from the use of the remote 3'-OH as the nucleophile.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Characterization of target-site specificity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Double-end integration products of five independent reactions (sample S1-S5) were purified and analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS).

The substrate sequence 3’ of the novel insertion identifies the 14 bp target-site.

For the four samples generated using PCR amplification, no other integration sites were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). For sample S5D, 99.4% of the detected integration events were at TS1, and only two other sites in the pUC19 backbone were detected with reads corresponding to integration into both strands of the target (TS2,TS3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Alignment of the three sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, inset) indicated that TS2 and TS3 contain a conserved 5'-CGC motif at one site of integration. Notably, all three observed target sites have a C nucleotide at the −2 position flanking the integration site but no other sequence conservation. We detected no sequences that would have been generated if the opposite 3'-end of the casposon end oligonucleotides were used as the nucleophile. Collectively, these results suggest that integration by the <italic>M. mazei</italic> casposase is remarkably sequence-specific, and that the most important target sequence features directing integration are clustered around the 5'-CGCA motif detected in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krupovic et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To explore aspects of target recognition by casposases in more detail, we employed an integration assay using short target oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) containing the region we established as sufficient for site-specific targeting. Integration into a 40mer target (‘targ40’) oligonucleotide by TR17, the most active substrate in the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, was readily detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and yielded products during the time course corresponding to the expected size for site-specific integration. The conserved 5'-CGCA target motif was critical as its mutation resulted in almost complete loss of both top and bottom strand integration (‘mutCGCA’). We also established that there was no detectable integration into a random 40mer (‘ran40’). Mutation of four bp just 5' of the CGCA motif (‘mutL’) severely reduced integration as did mutating the last five bp of the TSD (‘mutR’), although to a lesser extent. As the plasmid assay had revealed that integration is dependent upon some portion of the upstream 15–30 bp tRNA sequence, we mutated the region corresponding to bp 12–17, and this abolished activity (‘mut12-17’). We were also curious how symmetrizing the TSD (i.e., placing the 5’-CGCA motif on both strands at the target site) might impact activity and we found it was as effective a target as the original TSD (‘symTSD’).</p><p>We took advantage of this assay to more finely dissect the stimulatory effect of recessing the top strand of the casposon end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Starting with a blunt-ended dsLE20 substrate, we progressively deleted single nucleotides from the top strand to thereby generate a series of substrates with progressively longer 3’-single-stranded overhangs. The assay was performed in triplicate and the product bands for integration into the top and bottom strands separately quantitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Under these conditions, there was little detectable product formation with the blunt-ended substrate and only slight stimulation with a 1-nt 3'-single-stranded overhang. Maximal activity for bottom strand integration was obtained once the 3'-overhang was 2-nt and was thereafter essentially unchanged as the length of the overhang was increased to 7-nt. Integration into the top strand as a function of 3'-overhang length lagged behind that of bottom strand integration, and reached its maximal level once the 3'-overhang was 4-nt. Although it is not clear if the difference between the top and bottom strand is significant or a consequence of the asymmetry of the target, these results suggest that only a few unpaired nucleotides are required at the casposon end for optimal integration activity. It is possible that the reduced activity we observe with blunt-ended substrates reflects a need for transient fraying at the end for binding and integration.</p><p>Lastly, encouraged by the tolerance of the <italic>M. mazei</italic> casposase towards integration substrates and by the report of direct integration of ssRNA by a type III reverse transcriptase-Cas1 fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Silas et al., 2016</xref>), we also tested the RNA version of ssLE17. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, ssRNA also can be integrated into the target oligonucleotide targ40 although far less efficiently.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>M. mazei</italic> casposase is tetrameric when bound to target and its casposon ends</title><p>We next investigated the in vitro DNA binding properties of casposases using interferometric scattering mass spectrometry (iSCAMS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Young et al., 2018</xref>) and analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC).

In the presence of a 17-nt ssDNA casposon end (ssLE17), the MW shifted to 109 kDa, suggesting binding while the protein remained dimeric. Due the uncertainty of this measurement, we could not distinguish between one or two casposon ends bound per dimer (104 kDa vs. 109 kDa). In the presence of a branched oligonucleotide substrate comprised of two single-stranded 8-nt casposon ends linked to a symmetrized target sequence mimicking the integration product (minus any overhangs that might be present in vivo), the resulting protein-DNA complex had a measured MW of 219 kDa, consistent with a tetramer bound to one integration product molecule.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Characterization of casposase-DNA complexes.</title><p>Characterization by interferometric scattering mass spectrometry (iSCAMS) analysis.

During the course of these experiments, it became clear that the elution position of the casposase varied as a function of concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) whereas its complexes with either TR17 or with the integration product studied by iSCAMS eluted at positions expected for a tetramer over a range of protein concentrations.

In the integration product complex, each dimer is functionally and structurally asymmetric with a ‘catalytic’ monomer whose active site contains the scissile phosphate group that links transposon end DNA and the target site, and a ‘noncatalytic’ monomer in which the active site is located on the periphery of the assembly facing away from the DNA. This functional asymmetry at the dimer level recapitulates the observed asymmetry of Cas1 dimers in structurally characterized CRISPR Cas1-Cas2 integration complexes bound to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nuñez et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wright et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the complex, there is interpretable density for all four monomers until amino acid 341, but thereafter the C-terminus is not visible in two of the monomers and, in the other two, there is interpretable density only until residues 354 and 359.

Close examination of solvent channels and difference electron density maps revealed density consistent with isolated α-helices that are likely regions of the C-terminal HTH domain but we are unable to assign them to a specific register. Thus it appears that when the casposase is bound to this integration product mimic, the C-terminal residues remain disordered within the crystal and do not stably engage with the rest of the protein or DNA. In an attempt to provide insight into the role of the C-terminus, we expressed and purified a C-terminally truncated version of the casposase consisting of residues 1–341 (ΔHTH, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and assayed its activity against the range of substrates previously evaluated for the full-length protein.

The deep branching of casposons within the Cas1 phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Makarova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Makarova et al., 2018</xref>) and the clear mechanistic similarity between DNA transposition and CRISPR spacer acquisition makes the idea of an evolutionary relationship highly attractive. Like transposases and integrases with RNase H-like catalytic domains, the CRISPR-Cas integrase carries out transesterification to insert one piece of DNA into another, generates uniform-sized TSDs upon insertion, and produces a head-to-tail array of integrated DNA segments through tandem insertion as often seen with insertion sequences and transposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Siguier et al., 2015</xref>). Yet, the putative evolutionary ancestor of the CRISPR-Cas integration system is not from one of the prevalent DNA transposon superfamilies but, rather, from the relatively sparsely distributed casposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krupovic et al., 2014</xref>). The reason for this may lie in the unusual capacity of the <italic>M. mazei</italic> casposase to integrate a variety of substrate types, including nonspecific and random DNA, into a strongly preferred target site, the important characteristic if a CRISPR array is to serve as an effective library of a range of previously encountered foreign DNA. Thus, on the hypothetical evolutionary pathway towards spacer integration, casposases appear well-suited to act as the starting point for a system to integrate a range of largely unrelated DNA sequences.</p><p>Our biochemical results described here indicate that the <italic>M. mazei</italic> casposase already possesses several observed properties of Cas1-Cas2 integrases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marraffini, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sternberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amitai and Sorek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jackson et al., 2017</xref>), as has also been recently reported for the <italic>A. boonei</italic> casposase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Béguin et al., 2019</xref>). For example, the crucial identity of a few bp on each side of the top strand casposon integration site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, mutCGCA and mutL) corresponds to the conserved feature of CRISPR-Cas integration for specificity to the leader-repeat border. Specific integration of a transposon avoids any possible deleterious effects of random integration on the host cell genome, whereas for CRISPR-Cas, this also ensures that the latest encountered cellular invader is effectively neutralized as it generates the most robust immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McGinn and Marraffini, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the requirement for a sequence motif upstream of the casposon integration site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E</xref> mut12-17) appears to correspond to the observation that in some CRISPR-Cas systems, sequences upstream within the leader are important for integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkhnbashi et al., 2016</xref>). This requirement is understood for the <italic>E. coli</italic> Type I-E system in which IHF binds within the last 40 bp of the leader and is needed to bend and deform the target site so that integration can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nuñez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wright et al., 2017</xref>). It is possible that the role of the casposase HTH domain is to recognize a specific sequence just upstream of the integration site and thereby direct integration; this would be consistent with our observation that it is crucial for activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We have expressed and purified the HTH domain alone, but have been unable to confirm an interaction with DNA (data not shown). As these shared properties are already features of casposon transposition, they are not a consequence of the evolution of one system into the other.</p><p>Based on the biochemistry and structure presented here, we suggest an evolutionary pathway in which the crucial change was architectural (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig9video1">Figure 9—video 1</xref>). In this scenario, the ability of the casposase to tetramerize on DNA upon target binding was lost when it acquired a preference for binding to a Cas2 molecule rather than to itself. This seems a reasonable possibility as the total protein surface buried by the casposase by tetramerization (~2400 Å<sup>2</sup>) is substantially smaller than the total Cas1-Cas2 buried surface in the heterohexamer of either <italic>E. coli</italic> (~7800 Å<sup>2</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nuñez et al., 2014</xref>) or of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (~4000 Å<sup>2</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>). As shown by the structure here, if an intervening Cas2 dimer were introduced as a bridge between the two noncatalytic subunits of the casposase tetramer, the active sites of the catalytic monomers would not only remain oriented towards each other but Cas2 would provide an additional DNA binding surface that could preferentially direct a single, short piece of DNA between two active sites.</p><p>In this model, the CRISPR repeat sequence would be therefore derived from the original target site preferred by the casposase, and any original specificity for the casposon terminal inverted repeats would devolve to a residual spacer sequence preference. It is also possible that one evolutionary path could conserve the ability of the <italic>M. mazei</italic> casposase to integrate RNA as well as DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Silas et al., 2016</xref>). We note that the RAG1 protein of the V(D)J recombinase, also derived from a DNA transposon, conserves properties of its original transposase in that specific signal sequences are recognized and cleaved out from its flanking coding sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schatz and Swanson, 2011</xref>) while the random integration activity has been severely reduced to avoid genomic damage. Thus, in both cases, it is the logic of the particular system (i.e., biochemical properties of its transposase) that has been evolutionarily conserved.</p><p>In the evolutionary model presented here, when Cas2 was acquired as a preferred binding partner, it seems likely that Cas1 active sites would be forced farther apart in CRISPR integrases than in casposases, thereby expanding the length of the target site duplication. As has been pointed out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wright et al., 2019</xref>), this could have been important to allow the sampling of longer pieces of DNA which would produce more specific crRNA for incorporation into effector complexes at a later step in the immunity process. However, it is not yet clear why - or even if - the two integration pathways are necessarily mutually exclusive, if appropriate substrates are supplied. Indeed, the presence in <italic>M. mazei</italic> strains of ‘solo-TIRs’ of specific length (either 19 or 31 bp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krupovic et al., 2016</xref>) might be evidence of the capacity of a casposase to integrate short spacer-like sequences or an early step along the path to the development of a CRISPR array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jackson et al., 2017</xref>). It is an intriguing possibility that some casposases may already possess the ability to integrate short CRISPR-like spacers, and nothing in the casposase structure appears to rule it out except perhaps the tight quarters of the compact tetramer and the lack of an extended dsDNA binding surface such as that provided by Cas2.</p><p>It has recently been reported that a type V-C Cas1 protein is active in vitro for spacer integration in the absence of Cas2, and has been proposed to be an early ancestor of the Cas1-Cas2 spacer acquisition system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wright et al., 2019</xref>). Like the casposase here, the V-C Cas1 forms a tetrameric assembly upon binding to oligonucleotides that represent spacer integration products but differs in three key features. The first is its exquisite preference for spacers that are recessed by 0–2 nt on one strand: spacers that are recessed by three nt or longer are not functional for spacer integration whereas the <italic>M. mazei</italic> casposase is capable of integrating blunt-ended substrates, substrates with varying numbers of single-stranded nucleotides at its 3'-end, as well as completely single-stranded casposon ends of varying length. The second difference from casposases is the length of the target site as the 25 bp V-C target site, although shorter than average for CRISPR-Cas systems, is substantially larger than the ~14 bp average for casposases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krupovic et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, the V-C Cas1 is less sequence-specific in its integration site preference relative to other characterized Cas1-Cas2 integrases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wright et al., 2019</xref>), in marked contrast to the stringent sequence-specificity we observed here for the <italic>M. mazei</italic> casposase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). It will be extremely interesting to understand the structural basis of the transformation from casposase to a functional tetrameric spacer integrase.</p><p>The structure here provides insight into how a casposase recognizes single-stranded casposon ends and its target site sequence, but the target DNA used does not contain all of the elements required for site-specific integration. Determining the role of sequences just upstream of the top strand integration site may provide insight into the ancestral role of what became the critical CRISPR leader-repeat border. Another intriguing question relates to the role of the casposase C-terminal domain. It is tempting to speculate that it might play a role similar to that of IHF in the Type I-E system in bending target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nuñez et al., 2016</xref>), perhaps through recognition of a specific sequence upstream of the integration site, but the answer awaits further investigation. Our results explain the capability of casposases to use ssDNA as an integration substrate but do not shed light on the nature of the in vivo substrate. As it is not known if an integratable casposon is generated through an excision mechanism or through the process of replication, where ssDNA fits into the puzzle remains to be established. The only other transposons known to site-specifically integrate ssDNA are those of the IS<italic>200</italic>/IS<italic>605</italic> family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barabas et al., 2008</xref>). However, their integration is fundamentally different as both the 3' and 5' ends of the elements are joined to a single-stranded target. It will be interesting to determine if the effectiveness of ssDNA casposon ends for integration might be linked more closely to the mechanism of casposon mobility, as originally proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krupovic et al., 2014</xref>). Certainly, the fellow-traveling <italic>polB</italic> gene in casposons is suggestive that ssDNA and replication may be central to casposon mobility.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (Methanosarsina mazei)</td><td>casposase</td><td/><td>WP_011035139.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>Top10</td><td>Invitrogen/ThermoFisher</td><td>C404003</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>B834(DE3)</td><td>MilliporeSigma</td><td>69041–3</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial kit</td><td>Selenomethionine Medium Complete</td><td>Molecular Dimensions</td><td>MD12-500</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pUC19</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>P/N 54357</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>PEG 8000</td><td>Hampton Research</td><td>HR2-535</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>CHES, pH 9.0</td><td>Hampton Research</td><td>HR2-256-05</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial kit</td><td>Nextera XT DNA sample prep</td><td>Illumina</td><td>#FC1311024</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td><italic>Rsubread</italic> package</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/Rsubread">http://bioconductor.org/packages/Rsubread</ext-link></td><td>V1.34.7</td><td>DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.18129/B9.bioc.Rsubread">10.18129/B9.bioc.Rsubread</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Gviz package</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/Gviz/">https://bioconductor.org/packages/Gviz/</ext-link></td><td/><td>V1.26.5</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td><italic>ggseqlogo</italic></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/%20ggseqlogo/versions/0.1">https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ ggseqlogo/versions/0.1</ext-link></td><td/><td>V0.1</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td><italic>Biostrings</italic></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biostrings.html">https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biostrings.html</ext-link></td><td/><td>V2.50.2, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_006459">SCR_016949</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td><italic>Rsamtools</italic></td><td/><td/><td>V1.34.1</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td><italic>ShortRead</italic></td><td/><td/><td>V1.40.0</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td><italic>GenomicAlignments</italic></td><td/><td/><td>V1.18.1</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td><italic>Jalview</italic></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jalview.org">www.jalview.org</ext-link></td><td/><td>V1.0, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_006459">SCR_006459</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>XDS</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://xds.mpimf-heidelberg.mpg.de/">xds.mpimf-heidelberg.mpg.de</ext-link></td><td/><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015652">SCR_015652</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>XPREP</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bruker.com">https://www.bruker.com</ext-link></td><td>Bruker</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>SHELXD</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://shelx.uni-ac.gwdg.de/">http://shelx.uni-ac.gwdg.de/</ext-link></td><td/><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Usón and Sheldrick, 1999</xref>;

For optimal expression and purification, the single point mutation C184S was introduced and 17 additional amino acids were added between the N-terminal TEV protease cleavage site and M1 to allow complete removal of the thioredoxin (Trx) tag. Purification was essentially as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hickman and Dyda, 2015</xref>). For selenomethionine-substituted protein, the coding sequence corresponding to the Trx-casposase fusion protein was subcloned into pET-29b, and transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> strain B834(DE3). Expression was performed using the M9 minimal media kit and selenomethionine from Molecular Dimensions Inc (Maumee, OH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Full selenomethionine substitution was confirmed by LC/MS (Biochemistry Core Facility, NHLBI). Purification and crystallization were identical to those of the unsubstituted protein. All purification steps were carried out at 4°C.</p><p>A C-terminally truncated casposase, residues 1-341 (ΔHTH), was generated by the deletion of residues 342-406 from the Trx-casposase fusion protein by PCR mutagenesis. Expression and purification was identical to that of the full-length version. Single and double point mutations were introduced by PCR, and sequences of the full coding frame confirmed. Purification was essentially as the wild-type with the exception of the Y206A/R280A double mutant, which yielded only ~10% of the level of soluble protein when compared to wild-type and was not completely cleaved by TEV, despite prolonged incubation. Due to the low level of recovered protein, it was assayed without performing the usual final size exclusion chromatography step.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Enzymatic assays</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>In vitro DNA integration into pUC19 and modified pUC19 target plasmids</title><p>Oligonucleotides (IDT) were resuspended in 10 mM Tris and, as needed, mixed in the appropriate molar ratio, heated to 95°C for 15 minutes, and allowed to slowly cool to room temperature. Modified pUC19 target plasmids were constructed using the QuikChange method by introducing target sequences between bp 575 and 576. For assays, purified protein (75 nM) and oligonucleotide (200 nM) were mixed in buffer consisting of 25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 0.05 mg/ml BSA, and 5 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> and incubated at room temperature for the times indicated. For each set of reactions, a &quot;no end&quot; control was performed in which the oligonucleotide was omitted. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 150 ng target plasmid and stopped at time points indicated by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mM followed by proteinase K digestion for 30 min at 37<sup>◦</sup>C (NEB; 40 U per reaction tube).

The resulting DNA was then used as the template for four independent PCR reactions using a LE31 primer to amplify the product. The reaction was carried out for either 17 or 30 cycles. Amplified products corresponding to the size of linearized pUC19 were again isolated from agarose prior to library preparation. For the fifth sample, the integration reaction was scaled up four-fold and carried out in triplicate for 2 hours using TR29 as the integration substrate.

It is hypothesized that Cas1 evolved from a rare class of transposases, called casposases. Here, Hickman et al. express and purify a casposase from <italic>Methanosarsina mazei</italic>. They demonstrate that the MmCasposase integrates a wide variety of RNA and DNA substrates into a specific location. Integration requires substrates with a free 3'-OH and a target that contains specific sequence motifs. To understand the mechanism of integration the authors crystallize the casposase bound to DNA. The structure reveals a tetrameric architecture in which two casposase dimers sandwich the target DNA. The authors compare this structure to available crystal structures of Cas1 and Cas1-2 integration complexes. This analysis shows that the casposase tetramer is mutually exclusive with Cas2 binding and suggests how architectural changes in the Cas1-Cas2 complex may have led to mechanistic differences between the two types of integrases.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review.

If, however, these points can be addressed satisfactorily then the paper could be resubmitted to <italic>eLife</italic> for further consideration, should the authors wish to do so.</p><p>1) Clarification on the DNA substrates used in the biochemical assay, and an explanation for how these substrates relate to the biology are required. Additional controls and additional time points are necessary. Important controls are missing from the results presented in Figure 1, most notably negative controls in which the plasmid is incubated with casposase in the presence of divalent metal ions but no transposon end substrates. Previous Cas1 studies have observed considerable nicking activity (or possibly nicking/cleavage from contaminating proteins), so it is crucial that the baseline activity of the casposase protein prep on plasmid DNA is evaluated. Furthermore, for the data presented in panels C and D, no lanes exist showing the starting plasmid substrate at time 0 (i.e. in the absence of protein and transposon end substrate); since any given plasmid prep will have variable ratios of supercoiled to open-circular plasmid, it is critical that the reader have this comparison – for the exact substrate used in the experiments – to fully evaluate the biochemical activity of casposase and discriminate this from the starting status of the substrate. Labeling the bands &quot;target,&quot; &quot;SE,&quot; and &quot;DE,&quot; is misleading, since a plasmid will naturally purify from a bacterial culture with some fraction in the open circular form, which will migrate the same as a SE product but is certainly not a single-end integration product.</p><p>2) Provide more experimental support and/or justification for the specific choice of the 8-nt overhang integration product. Why was 8 selected as the overhang length? Was a larger crystallization screen performed, and this was the only substrate geometry that resulted in diffracting crystals? Is there any further evidence that this is a physiologically relevant ssDNA end sequence? For at least one reviewer, it was unclear what the SEC data provided that was not show by the iSCAMS analysis. All reviewers commented on misplaced labels and inappropriate units (time rather than volume) in the SEC. There was some discussion about moving the SEC to the supplement but regardless of where it is discussed, the interpretation of these data must be clarified.</p><p>3) The authors gloss over the interesting finding that the HTH domain is disordered in the crystals and fail to follow-up with further experiments to investigate the role of this domain on biochemical integration activity, and whether the domain may be important in the context of more physiologically relevant substrates.</p><p>4) A major take-away from this manuscript would be that this casposase integrates substrates primarily at a specific target site rather than randomly, as has been previously touched upon in the literature. However, apparent integration events in pUC19 alone and farther away from the target site have been detected in this and previous studies. No sequencing data for these events are shown, and the authors fail to perform additional analysis on integration patterns. The sequences should be shown and discuss. It has become routine in spacer acquisition studies with Cas1 to deep sequence half-site integration products in order to gain deeper insights into specificity. Similar NGS experiments are warranted here to enhance their biochemical results. While NGS experiments are not required for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, the authors should perform bioinforamtics analyses to determine whether related casposons are always present in genomes adjacent to similar target sites. Please mention, in the Discussion, the recent observation that the Type V-C Cas1 is much less sequence-specific in its integration site preference.</p><p>5) When describing the structure, the authors note several protein-DNA contacts, but it is unclear whether any of these contacts contribute to the specificity for the TSD target or LE substrate. From the data shown in Figure 1C, it appears that the casposase is somewhat specific for the LE sequence, especially for shorter single-stranded DNAs. Can this specificity be explained by the structure? Do R191 and R192 contribute to the specificity of the casposase for the TSD? The authors speculate about the importance of stacking interactions for ssDNA substrate binding (subsection “ssDNA casposon end binding resembles that of spacer 3' overhangs”). Did the authors perform any mutagenesis experiments to establish the importance of these contacts for target and substrate specificity? Experiments supporting structure-based hypotheses proposed by the authors are required.</p><p>6) The order in which substrates are shown on the left gel in Figure 1C is confusing. If possible, it would be helpful if this gel could be re-run to place casposon-specific and random substrates of similar type (e.g. TR17 vs ranTR17) in adjacent lanes on the gel. Is a dsran17 substrate (i.e. a fully double-stranded random substrate of 17 bp) also integrated? In addition, ssran12 and ssLE11 could be omitted from this gel, as these substrates are also tested in the rightmost gel in the panel.</p><p>7) In paragraph two of the Discussion section, the authors suggest a similarity in the lack of sequence specificity on the bottom strand of the casposase TSD with a lack of sequence specificity for spacer-side integration by Cas1-Cas2. However, it is important to note that Cas1-Cas2 does display specificity for the entire direct repeat sequence, likely through sequence-specific deformations of the repeat that occur during full-site integration (as proposed by Wright et al., 2017). In that study, it was shown that mutations in the repeat affect spacer-side integration, but do not have an effect on leader-side integration. Thus, the conclusion stated by the authors that bottom strand integration is sequence-independent and instead based on a &quot;molecular ruler&quot; is not consistent with current models for spacer-side integration.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Cas1 and Cas2 are hallmarks of the CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems found in most archaeal and many bacterial genomes. Koonin and colleagues have previously identified homology between Cas1 and casposon family proteins (doi: 10.1186/1741-7007-12-36) and predicted that CRISPR repeats evolved from the target site duplications (doi: 10.1016/j.mib.2017.04.004). These predictions have been largely validated with in vitro biochemical studies (doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkv1180, doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw821, doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz447). Here, Hickman et al., extend the previous work by defining essential features of the target site and testing a wide-variety of integration substrates. This on its own would not warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, they use this qualitative biochem to identify substrates that result in higher order assemblies and they determine the structure of the tetrameric complex bound to DNA. Overall the experiments appear technically sound, and the paper delivers the first structure of a casposase. These mechanistic insights and evolutionary connection of this system to CRISPR-Cas immune systems are important and warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, the text and figure are a challenge to interpret (esp Figure 1) and considerable revision is required to make this work accessible to a broad readership.</p><p>The authors purify a casposases from <italic>Methanosarcina mazei</italic> and determine sequence requirements for integration. The authors describe a sequencing method to determine the location of integration. 7 of 8 integration occurs at the TSD sequence with concomitant generation of a 14 bp TSD. &quot;The other sequenced product arose from integration into a site ~110 bp away from the specific sequence and was also accompanied by a 14 bp TSD.&quot; Please include more information. Was there sequence similarity between these sites? If not, what does this say about the mechanism of recognition and how does this relate what the structures teaches us about recognition?</p><p>Figure 1A. It is not clear what the authors are intending to teach the reader in panel A. Based on the figure legend title (&quot;Casposase structure and function&quot;) the reader is expecting to see a structure, rather than a schematic of the genomic context. Most of the arrows in the schematic are different colors, which have no explanations, the sequence inserted below the schematic is too small to decipher, and the blue box inserted to the right is not labeled or sufficiently explained. To easily understand this figure, readers will need to be familiar with the papers by Koonin et al. I think this is an unfair expectation of readers.</p><p>Seems like it would be worth showing a gel or at least referencing the gel in Figure 5—figure supplement 4, when the authors first claim to have &quot;expressed and purified a representative casposase&quot;.</p><p>Figure 1B. I was unable to understand how the TIR (introduced in font size ~2 in panel B) is different form the TSD, which is introduced in panel A. I understand that it's a tandem inverted repeat but where is the sequence, how long, how is it related to the biology (I'm lost)..? Why is the first gel white on black and the second is black on white? Are these different imaging methods of the same assay? If the 5'-CGCA motif is conserved, then why do the authors mutate the first 6 rather than the first 4 bps of the TSD sequence?</p><p>Figure 1C. What are the red dots one end of the orange oligonucleotides?</p><p>Figure 2A. In my opinion, seeing a gel of the purified protein is more important to me than seeing a series of SEC runs with increasing concentration of the DNA substrates. If the authors choose to show these in the main text, then a vertical line extending from the protein alone peak down though the other runs will help illustrate the shift. The authors disclose that &quot;the complex did not produce the expected shift on SEC for a tetramer&quot;, but the peak does not look symmetrical to me and the left edge appears to be almost vertical. This would suggest that the complex may be eluting in the void, but the x-axis is in time rather than volume, so it is hard to know what this mean for a16/60 Superdex 200 column. Try a Sup 6 column and include a regression line fit with standers. It appears that the labels for the x-axis are misplaced for the last column (&quot;integration products&quot;). In my opinion this entire figure could go in the supplemental material and Figure 1 should be refined and split into two figures.</p><p>The text for Table 1 overlaps the table itself making it a little hard to interpret. I suggest adding a sentence to the text that states how the structure was determined (e.g., MR or experimental phases).</p><p>Figure 3. Active site subunits &quot;shown in pink sticks&quot; are nearly impossible to see. I could not find an explanation for the green spheres in panel B.</p><p>Figure 4. The authors state that &quot;Each casposase monomer exhibits the fold expected of a Cas1 homolog&quot; but none of the figures do a good job of showing this and I could not find an RMSD for a define set of equivalently positioned atoms.</p><p>Discussion paragraph five: delete word &quot;is&quot;. “It is an intriguing possibility is that some casposases may already possess the ability to integrate short CRISPR-like spacers,…..”</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In their manuscript, Hickman and colleagues present the first crystal structure of a transposon-encoded casposase bound to an integration product mimic, revealing a tetrameric architecture in which two Cas1 dimers sandwich the target DNA destined to be duplicated during downstream molecular steps within the pathway. Biochemical experiments are presented to argue that single-stranded transposon ends may be the natural substrate utilized during integration, and that specific sequence motifs in both the transposon end and the target site affect biochemical integration activity. By comparing their casposase-DNA structure to available crystal structures of Cas1 homologs in the context of the Cas1-Cas2 complexes that mediate spacer acquisition during adaptive immunity in CRISPR-Cas systems, the authors argue a plausible evolutionary scenario by which gaining Cas2 interactions could have directed casposases towards an integration mechanism that is more akin to spacer acquisition than transposition.</p><p>The crystal structure is a notable advance that broadens our understanding of the Cas1/casposase protein family, and is undoubtedly a substantive contribution to the field. However, in this reviewer's opinion, the biochemical experiments that accompany this finding fall short of providing compelling evidence for a specific integration mechanism, and instead leave more to be desired in terms of what overhang geometries are optimal, how integration sites are chosen, and how casposons are excised. In addition, the authors gloss over the interesting finding that the HTH domain is disordered in the crystals and fail to follow-up with further experiments to investigate the role of this domain on biochemical integration activity, and whether the domain may be important in the context of more physiologically relevant substrates. I believe additional experiments are merited for this study to go beyond reporting a novel structure, to helping yield new mechanistic insights for the process of casposon transposition.</p><p>1) Some important controls are missing from the results presented in Figure 1, most notably negative controls in which the plasmid is incubated with casposase in the presence of divalent metal ions but no transposon end substrates. Previous Cas1 studies have observed considerable nicking activity (or possibly nicking/cleavage from contaminating proteins), so it is crucial that the baseline activity of the casposase protein prep on plasmid DNA is evaluated. Furthermore, for the data presented in panels C and D, no lanes exist showing the starting plasmid substrate at time 0 (i.e. in the absence of protein and transposon end substrate); since any given plasmid prep will have variable ratios of supercoiled to open-circular plasmid, it is critical that the reader have this comparison – for the exact substrate used in the experiments – to fully evaluate the biochemical activity of casposase and discriminate this from the starting status of the substrate. I would even argue that naming the bands &quot;target,&quot; &quot;SE,&quot; and &quot;DE,&quot; is misleading, since a plasmid will naturally purify from a bacterial culture with some fraction in the open circular form, which will migrate the same as a SE product but is certainly not a single-end integration product.</p><p>2) A major question is left unaddressed (and mostly unmentioned) in the manuscript, namely, in what form the casposon is excised and integrated. I understand this is still unclear in the literature, that previous attempts to monitor excision by this group were unsuccessful (i.e. Hickman and Dyda, 2015), and that there is as yet no in vivo transposition data for casposons. Nevertheless, the reader should certainly be given more context on this topic, in the Introduction/Discussion, and in the Results section to better motivate the range of donor substrates tested. I would also like to see the authors test a larger panel of &quot;Top Strand Recessed&quot; substrates, and to more quantitatively compare integration activities amongst these substrates, and between these substrates and blunt dsDNA substrates. Similar experiments in the context of spacer acquisition by Cas1 complexes (e.g. Wright et al., 2019) have revealed the likely substrates that are used biologically, based on a clear optimum in terms of integration product formation kinetics. The authors have an opportunity to make similar discoveries with their casposase, but the use of just two timepoints, the lack of any product quantification, and the relatively small set of substrates tested, limits the potential of their biochemical assays.</p><p>3) Related to #2, I would prefer more experimental support and/or justification for the specific choice of the 8-nt overhang integration product. Why was 8 selected as the overhang length? Was a larger crystallization screen performed, and this was the only substrate geometry that resulted in diffracting crystals? Is there any further evidence that this is a physiologically relevant ssDNA end sequence? What happens if the casposon end substrates are shorter, or partially double-stranded? For example, it seems that the iSCAMS analysis could be scaled up to test a wider range of model integration products, to investigate whether tetramer formation is more or less favored with certain substrates, which could help suggest what may or may not be more 'relevant.'</p><p>4) The authors point out that capsposases have an additional C-terminal HTH domain that is absent in Cas1, and that this domain could not be modeled into the experimental electron density. In light of these interesting observations, the authors should test the biochemical activity casposase mutants in which this domain is truncated; does these mutants show behave similarly? Differently? Although it would be interesting to further investigate whether this domain becomes ordered with different DNA substrates, I understand that pursuing additional structures may be too much to ask. However, certainly some biochemical investigations are warranted here. I would also caution the authors against stating that the HTH domain &quot;is not in a folded state&quot; – although I am not a structural biologist, the absence of ordered density in a X-ray crystal structure is not equivalent to a domain being unfolded.</p><p>5) A major take-away from this manuscript would be that this casposase integrates substrates primarily at a specific target site rather than randomly, as has been previously touched upon in the literature. However, apparent integration events in pUC19 alone and farther away from the target site have been detected in this and previous studies. No sequencing data for these events are shown, and the authors failed to perform additional analysis on integration patterns. It has not become routine in spacer acquisition studies with Cas1 to deep sequence half-site integration products in order to gain deeper insights into specificity, and the authors should perform similar NGS experiments here to enhance their biochemical results. These experiments could provide much more data on the target site requirements, but looking for conservation (or lack of conservation) in the motifs that are preferred adjacent to integration sites other than at the 3' end of tRNA-Leu.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study, Hickman et al. describe the activity and structure of a casposase, the hypothesized evolutionary ancestor of the Cas1 integrase found in CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems. The authors demonstrate in vitro DNA integration by the casposase from <italic>Methanosarcina mazei</italic>, and perform biochemical experiments to establish the target sequence specificity and substrate preferences for this casposase. They also report, for the first time, a structure of the casposase bound to an integration product mimic. The casposase forms a tetramer composed of two casposase dimers sandwiching the DNA. The structure provides insight into the mechanism of substrate and target recognition by the casposase. In addition, comparison of the casposase and Cas1-Cas2 complex structures show that the casposase tetramer is mutually exclusive with Cas2 binding, and suggests how architectural changes in the Cas1-Cas2 complex may have led to mechanistic differences between the two types of integrases. The structure of the casposase is an important first step in understanding casposon function and the evolution of CRISPR-Cas adaptation mechanisms, and the authors propose several interesting hypotheses based on the structure. However, these hypotheses are largely speculative and could greatly benefit from experimental evidence. In particular, the structural data is not supported by any biochemical experiments to establish a structure-function relationship. Thus, the structure is largely descriptive, although the authors speculate on the importance of a number of observed interactions within the structure. Several examples are provided in comment 1 below, in addition to few other concerns that should also be addressed by the authors.</p><p>1) When describing the structure, the authors note several protein DNA contacts, but it is unclear whether any of these contacts contribute to the specificity for the TSD target or LE substrate. From the data shown in Figure 1C, it appears that the casposase is somewhat specific for the LE sequence, especially for shorter single-stranded DNAs. Can this specificity be explained by the structure? Do R191 and R192 contribute to the specificity of the casposase for the TSD? The authors speculate about the importance of stacking interactions for ssDNA substrate binding (subsection “ssDNA casposon end binding resembles that of spacer 3' overhangs”). Did the authors perform any mutagenesis experiments to establish the importance of these contacts for target and substrate specificity? In general, the study would be greatly improved by experiments supporting the structure-based hypotheses proposed by the authors when describing the structure.</p><p>2) The order in which substrates are shown on the left gel in Figure 1C is confusing. If possible, it would be helpful if this gel could be re-run to place casposon-specific and random substrates of similar type (e.g. TR17 vs ranTR17) in adjacent lanes on the gel.

Your revised article has been evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the manuscript has been dramatically improved and there is unanimous consensus that the paper should be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers offer a few additional suggestions, as outlined below:</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Hickman et al. express and purify a casposase from <italic>Methanosarsina mazei</italic>. They demonstrate that the MmCasposase integrates a wide variety of RNA and DNA substrates into a specific location. Integration requires substrates with a free 3'-OH and a target that contains specific sequence motifs. To understand the mechanism of integration the authors attempt to crystallize the casposase bound to DNA oligonucleotides representing different stages of the integration reaction. Diffracting crystals of the casposase bound to a substrate that mimics the post integration step were used to determine a 3.1 Å resolution structure. The structure reveals a tetrameric architecture in which two casposase dimers sandwich the target DNA. The authors highlight several interactions with target and the substrate, and mutants are used to test the importance of these interactions. The authors compare this structure to available crystal structures of Cas1 and Cas1-2 complexes. This analysis shows that the casposase tetramer is mutually exclusive with Cas2 binding and suggests how architectural changes in the Cas1-Cas2 complex may have led to mechanistic differences between the two types of integrases. Collectively, the biochemistry and structure presented support a speculative discussion that connects architectural changes in the casposase that would accommodate Cas2 binding and the transition to a Cas1-Cas2 complex that is necessary for spacer integration. While clarity of presentation could be improved in places, the work is rigorously performed, and the conclusions are of interest to a broad readership.</p><p>Organization of the presentation:</p><p>The initial characterization of casposon substrate and target specificities is much improved by the new experiments. However, the presentation is a bit disjointed, as it jumps back and forth between characterization of substrate and target requirements. For example, Figures 1C, 3A-B and 3D all investigate casposon end requirements, while Figures 2 and 3C are on target specificity. Indeed, in one case this requires that the reader read ahead to understand the experiment explained in Figure 2 (&quot;for the rationale, see Figure 3A and associated discussion&quot;). This section could flow better if the authors combine Figure 1C, 3A-B, and 3D into a new Figure, which could be Figure 2. This would also allow the authors to show a panel describing all substrates used in these three panels, as it is currently confusing that TR17 and ssLE17 are shown in Figure 1C but not mentioned until much later in the text. Figures 2 and 3C could then be combined to form a new Figure 3. With these changes, the authors could first define casposon end requirements, and then describe the characterization of the target sequence.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50004.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this manuscript, Hickman et al. present the first crystal structure of a transposon-encoded casposase bound to an integration product mimic.

In our revised manuscript, for all experiments involving plasmid substrates, a negative control is shown in which plasmid is incubated with the casposase and metal ion in the absence of a transposon end substrate. We have re-labeled the product band positions as suggested by the reviewers, and these are now indicated as &quot;relaxed&quot;, and &quot;linear&quot;. The target plasmid is now labelled &quot;sc&quot;. We have retained the SE and DE terminology in the schematic in Figure 1B, as these are the products expected by the model. As a reader can now judge, there is not much nonspecific nicking with our purified casposase under the assay conditions used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Provide more experimental support and/or justification for the specific choice of the 8-nt overhang integration product. Why was 8 selected as the overhang length? Was a larger crystallization screen performed, and this was the only substrate geometry that resulted in diffracting crystals? Is there any further evidence that this is a physiologically relevant ssDNA end sequence?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize, as in our original submission we failed to mention that we tried a wide range of DNA oligonucleotides for structural studies over the course of many months, and that – to date – the only substrate that has yielded crystals that diffract X-rays well enough to allow us to solve the structure is the 8-nt overhang integration product. We believe that such exploration (riddled with many failures) is typical in experimental structural biology. As shown in Figure 3B, an 8-nt ssDNA casposon sequence produces products in an integration assay that are specific for the target site (i.e., they are not seen with pUC19 alone). Thus, it has the specificity expected for a biologically relevant end sequence but we cannot say more than this in the absence of an in vivo assay for casposon mobility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For at least one reviewer, it was unclear what the SEC data provided that was not show by the iSCAMS analysis. All reviewers commented on misplaced labels and inappropriate units (time rather than volume) in the SEC. There was some discussion about moving the SEC to the supplement but regardless of where it is discussed, the interpretation of these data must be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the SEC data are perhaps not as important in light of the iSCAMS analysis; therefore we have chosen to present it (and some new data) now as supplemental material (Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and 2). The supplemental figures now show the chromatograms with corrected labels and volume units. We have been able to clarify the apparent disconnect between the iSCAMS and SEC results with further SEC experiments in which we performed a dilution series with the protein alone and complexes with TR17 and the crystallized integration product. These revealed that the elution properties of the casposase alone and its complexes change as a function of protein concentration. We conclude that the lower concentration used for iSCAMS more accurately reflects the property of the casposase in vivo. These results are now discussed in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors gloss over the interesting finding that the HTH domain is disordered in the crystals and fail to follow-up with further experiments to investigate the role of this domain on biochemical integration activity, and whether the domain may be important in the context of more physiologically relevant substrates.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the structure as a guide to produce a soluble version of the casposase missing the C-terminal domain (residues 1-341, &quot;ΔHTH&quot;) – solubility being a property that had frustratingly eluded us in the absence of structural information. We have therefore been able to follow up with integration experiments using a range of substrates, and these results are now presented in Figure 6 and associated text. Indeed, the C-terminal domain is crucial, although we do not know if it is recognizing the oligonucleotide end or the target. To date, we have not been able to confirm an interaction with either.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A major take-away from this manuscript would be that this casposase integrates substrates primarily at a specific target site rather than randomly, as has been previously touched upon in the literature. However, apparent integration events in pUC19 alone and farther away from the target site have been detected in this and previous studies. No sequencing data for these events are shown, and the authors fail to perform additional analysis on integration patterns. The sequences should be shown and discuss. It has become routine in spacer acquisition studies with Cas1 to deep sequence half-site integration products in order to gain deeper insights into specificity. Similar NGS experiments are warranted here to enhance their biochemical results. While NGS experiments are not required for publication in eLife, the authors should perform bioinforamtics analyses to determine whether related casposons are always present in genomes adjacent to similar target sites. Please mention, in the Discussion, the recent observation that the Type V-C Cas1 is much less sequence-specific in its integration site preference.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer's suggestion that the need for an NGS experiment was justified. We recruited the expertise of our colleagues, Dr. Pavel and Dr. Haase, who helped us to perform the NGS analysis on the linear product of targeted integration. They are now included as co-authors, and the new data are presented in Figure 2 and discussed in the text. As suggested, we have added a sentence regarding Type V-C Cas1 to the Discussion as follows: “Finally, the V-C Cas1 is less sequence-specific in its integration site preference relative to other characterized Cas1-Cas2 integrases (Wright et al., 2019), in marked contrast to the stringent sequence-specificity we observed here for the <italic>M. mazei</italic> casposase (Figure 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) When describing the structure, the authors note several protein-DNA contacts, but it is unclear whether any of these contacts contribute to the specificity for the TSD target or LE substrate. From the data shown in Figure 1C, it appears that the casposase is somewhat specific for the LE sequence, especially for shorter single-stranded DNAs. Can this specificity be explained by the structure? Do R191 and R192 contribute to the specificity of the casposase for the TSD? The authors speculate about the importance of stacking interactions for ssDNA substrate binding (subsection “ssDNA casposon end binding resembles that of spacer 3' overhangs”). Did the authors perform any mutagenesis experiments to establish the importance of these contacts for target and substrate specificity? Experiments supporting structure-based hypotheses proposed by the authors are required.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, in order to explain the specificity for short ssDNAs, we generated several mutants to test the roles of the residues observed to form interactions with the ssDNA. These include three mutant versions of the casposase that the structure predicted should disrupt the stacking interactions, as well as the double-mutant R191A/R192A. We have compared their activity on the TSD target vs. pUC19 to evaluate target specificity, and have tested their integration activity using a range of substrates to probe the role of these residues in substrate specificity (Figure 7F and Figure 7—figure supplement 1). These data are now discussed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The order in which substrates are shown on the left gel in Figure 1C is confusing. If possible, it would be helpful if this gel could be re-run to place casposon-specific and random substrates of similar type (e.g. TR17 vs ranTR17) in adjacent lanes on the gel. Is a dsran17 substrate (i.e. a fully double-stranded random substrate of 17 bp) also integrated? In addition, ssran12 and ssLE11 could be omitted from this gel, as these substrates are also tested in the rightmost gel in the panel.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the haphazard organization of the gels presented in our original submission.

These data are now in Figure 3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In paragraph two of the Discussion section, the authors suggest a similarity in the lack of sequence specificity on the bottom strand of the casposase TSD with a lack of sequence specificity for spacer-side integration by Cas1-Cas2. However, it is important to note that Cas1-Cas2 does display specificity for the entire direct repeat sequence, likely through sequence-specific deformations of the repeat that occur during full-site integration (as proposed by Wright et al., 2017). In that study, it was shown that mutations in the repeat affect spacer-side integration, but do not have an effect on leader-side integration. Thus, the conclusion stated by the authors that bottom strand integration is sequence-independent and instead based on a &quot;molecular ruler&quot; is not consistent with current models for spacer-side integration.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon repeating our initial experiments with time courses, it has become clear that our original statement has to be revised. As shown in Figure 3C, when the activity of the &quot;mutR&quot; substrate is compared to that of &quot;symTSD&quot;, two substrates that differ in sequence at the site of &quot;bottom strand&quot; integration, there is clearly a difference. We have removed the entire section from the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Cas1 and Cas2 are hallmarks of the CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems found in most archaeal and many bacterial genomes. Koonin and colleagues have previously identified homology between Cas1 and casposon family proteins (doi: 10.1186/1741-7007-12-36) and predicted that CRISPR repeats evolved from the target site duplications (doi: 10.1016/j.mib.2017.04.004). These predictions have been largely validated with in vitro biochemical studies (doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkv1180, doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw821, doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz447). Here, Hickman et al., extend the previous work by defining essential features of the target site and testing a wide-variety of integration substrates. This on its own would not warrant publication in eLife. However, they use this qualitative biochem to identify substrates that result in higher order assemblies and they determine the structure of the tetrameric complex bound to DNA. Overall the experiments appear technically sound, and the paper delivers the first structure of a casposase. These mechanistic insights and evolutionary connection of this system to CRISPR-Cas immune systems are important and warrant publication in eLife. However, the text and figure are a challenge to interpret (esp Figure 1) and considerable revision is required to make this work accessible to a broad readership.</p><p>The authors purify a casposases from Methanosarcina mazei and determine sequence requirements for integration.

Biochemical experiments are presented to argue that single-stranded transposon ends may be the natural substrate utilized during integration, and that specific sequence motifs in both the transposon end and the target site affect biochemical integration activity. By comparing their casposase-DNA structure to available crystal structures of Cas1 homologs in the context of the Cas1-Cas2 complexes that mediate spacer acquisition during adaptive immunity in CRISPR-Cas systems, the authors argue a plausible evolutionary scenario by which gaining Cas2 interactions could have directed casposases towards an integration mechanism that is more akin to spacer acquisition than transposition.</p><p>The crystal structure is a notable advance that broadens our understanding of the Cas1/casposase protein family, and is undoubtedly a substantive contribution to the field. However, in this reviewer's opinion, the biochemical experiments that accompany this finding fall short of providing compelling evidence for a specific integration mechanism, and instead leave more to be desired in terms of what overhang geometries are optimal, how integration sites are chosen, and how casposons are excised. In addition, the authors gloss over the interesting finding that the HTH domain is disordered in the crystals and fail to follow-up with further experiments to investigate the role of this domain on biochemical integration activity, and whether the domain may be important in the context of more physiologically relevant substrates. I believe additional experiments are merited for this study to go beyond reporting a novel structure, to helping yield new mechanistic insights for the process of casposon transposition.</p><p>1) Some important controls are missing from the results presented in Figure 1, most notably negative controls in which the plasmid is incubated with casposase in the presence of divalent metal ions but no transposon end substrates. Previous Cas1 studies have observed considerable nicking activity (or possibly nicking/cleavage from contaminating proteins), so it is crucial that the baseline activity of the casposase protein prep on plasmid DNA is evaluated. Furthermore, for the data presented in panels C and D, no lanes exist showing the starting plasmid substrate at time 0 (i.e. in the absence of protein and transposon end substrate); since any given plasmid prep will have variable ratios of supercoiled to open-circular plasmid, it is critical that the reader have this comparison – for the exact substrate used in the experiments – to fully evaluate the biochemical activity of casposase and discriminate this from the starting status of the substrate. I would even argue that naming the bands &quot;target,&quot; &quot;SE,&quot; and &quot;DE,&quot; is misleading, since a plasmid will naturally purify from a bacterial culture with some fraction in the open circular form, which will migrate the same as a SE product but is certainly not a single-end integration product.</p></disp-quote><p>These issues have been addressed by repeating the experiments in Figure 1, as discussed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A major question is left unaddressed (and mostly unmentioned) in the manuscript, namely, in what form the casposon is excised and integrated. I understand this is still unclear in the literature, that previous attempts to monitor excision by this group were unsuccessful (i.e. Hickman and Dyda, 2015), and that there is as yet no in vivo transposition data for casposons. Nevertheless, the reader should certainly be given more context on this topic, in the Introduction/Discussion, and in the Results section to better motivate the range of donor substrates tested.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the excision of casposons is an open question at this point. However, one possible consequence of the model for self-synthesizing transposons is that excision may not in fact be occurring as the element might be synthesized at the donor site without the need for excision. However, this is pure speculation at this point. We have included a few sentences in the revised Introduction in which we discuss how free casposon ends might be generated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would also like to see the authors test a larger panel of &quot;Top Strand Recessed&quot; substrates, and to more quantitatively compare integration activities amongst these substrates, and between these substrates and blunt dsDNA substrates. Similar experiments in the context of spacer acquisition by Cas1 complexes (e.g. Wright et al., 2019) have revealed the likely substrates that are used biologically, based on a clear optimum in terms of integration product formation kinetics. The authors have an opportunity to make similar discoveries with their casposase, but the use of just two timepoints, the lack of any product quantification, and the relatively small set of substrates tested, limits the potential of their biochemical assays.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have performed the plasmid integration assay with a larger panel of &quot;Top Strand Recessed&quot; substrates, ranging from blunt-ended to 7-nt recessed (Figure 3D).

Why was 8 selected as the overhang length? Was a larger crystallization screen performed, and this was the only substrate geometry that resulted in diffracting crystals? Is there any further evidence that this is a physiologically relevant ssDNA end sequence? What happens if the casposon end substrates are shorter, or partially double-stranded?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, we have tried a wide range of substrates in crystallization experiments and with the exception of the 8-nt overhang, none has yielded crystals of sufficient diffraction quality. We have added the following so the reader can understand why this particular complex was studied: &quot;In an effort to further characterize the casposase and its interactions with its substrates, we attempted to crystallize the casposase bound to DNA oligonucleotides representing different stages of the integration reaction. Many casposase-DNA complexes yielded poorly-diffracting crystals including the casposase bound to recessed dsDNA oligonucleotides and ssDNA oligonucleotides of varying length representing the casposon ends. This was also the case with casposase bound to mimics of the post-integration step using both symmetric and asymmetric complete integration target sites and casposon ends of varying length and dsDNA-ssDNA composition. We were eventually able to obtain diffracting crystals of the casposase…&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example, it seems that the iSCAMS analysis could be scaled up to test a wider range of model integration products, to investigate whether tetramer formation is more or less favored with certain substrates, which could help suggest what may or may not be more 'relevant.'</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and this line of inquiry is one of our future plans.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors point out that capsposases have an additional C-terminal HTH domain that is absent in Cas1, and that this domain could not be modeled into the experimental electron density.

No sequencing data for these events are shown, and the authors failed to perform additional analysis on integration patterns.

The authors demonstrate in vitro DNA integration by the casposase from Methanosarcina mazei, and perform biochemical experiments to establish the target sequence specificity and substrate preferences for this casposase. They also report, for the first time, a structure of the casposase bound to an integration product mimic. The casposase forms a tetramer composed of two casposase dimers sandwiching the DNA. The structure provides insight into the mechanism of substrate and target recognition by the casposase. In addition, comparison of the casposase and Cas1-Cas2 complex structures show that the casposase tetramer is mutually exclusive with Cas2 binding, and suggests how architectural changes in the Cas1-Cas2 complex may have led to mechanistic differences between the two types of integrases. The structure of the casposase is an important first step in understanding casposon function and the evolution of CRISPR-Cas adaptation mechanisms, and the authors propose several interesting hypotheses based on the structure. However, these hypotheses are largely speculative and could greatly benefit from experimental evidence. In particular, the structural data is not supported by any biochemical experiments to establish a structure-function relationship. Thus, the structure is largely descriptive, although the authors speculate on the importance of a number of observed interactions within the structure. Several examples are provided in comment 1 below, in addition to few other concerns that should also be addressed by the authors.</p><p>1) When describing the structure, the authors note several protein DNA contacts, but it is unclear whether any of these contacts contribute to the specificity for the TSD target or LE substrate.

Can this specificity be explained by the structure? Do R191 and R192 contribute to the specificity of the casposase for the TSD? The authors speculate about the importance of stacking interactions for ssDNA substrate binding (subsection “ssDNA casposon end binding resembles that of spacer 3' overhangs”).

However, it is important to note that Cas1-Cas2 does display specificity for the entire direct repeat sequence, likely through sequence-specific deformations of the repeat that occur during full-site integration (as proposed by Wright et al., 2017). In that study, it was shown that mutations in the repeat affect spacer-side integration, but do not have an effect on leader-side integration. Thus, the conclusion stated by the authors that bottom strand integration is sequence-independent and instead based on a &quot;molecular ruler&quot; is not consistent with current models for spacer-side integration.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. As discussed above, upon further examination of our data, we realize that our original statement was not correct. We have removed the entire section from the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Organization of the presentation:</p><p>The initial characterization of casposon substrate and target specificities is much improved by the new experiments. However, the presentation is a bit disjointed, as it jumps back and forth between characterization of substrate and target requirements. For example, Figures 1C, 3A-B and 3D all investigate casposon end requirements, while Figures 2 and 3C are on target specificity. Indeed, in one case this requires that the reader read ahead to understand the experiment explained in Figure 2 (&quot;for the rationale, see Figure 3A and associated discussion&quot;). This section could flow better if the authors combine Figure 1C, 3A-B, and 3D into a new Figure, which could be Figure 2. This would also allow the authors to show a panel describing all substrates used in these three panels, as it is currently confusing that TR17 and ssLE17 are shown in Figure 1C but not mentioned until much later in the text. Figures 2 and 3C could then be combined to form a new Figure 3. With these changes, the authors could first define casposon end requirements, and then describe the characterization of the target sequence.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that most of these suggestions would help with the logic and the flow. However, a minor problem arises with Figure 3D which is certainly related to substrate specificity (as Figure 1C, 3A-B) but uses an assay that is introduced and validated only in Figure 3C (i.e., substrates are integrated into an oligo targ40 but not ran40). The solution we chose is to keep 3C and 3D together. We have therefore created a new Figure 2 with 1C, 3A-B, and combined old Figures 2 and 3C-3D into new Figure 3.</p></body></sub-article></article>
