regulation requires insight into RNA transcription, processing and modification. We adapted nanopore direct RNA sequencing to examine RNA from a wild-type accession of the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and a mutant defective in mRNA methylation (m<sup>6</sup>A). Here we show that m<sup>6</sup>A can be mapped in full-length mRNAs transcriptome-wide and reveal the combinatorial diversity of cap-associated transcription start sites, splicing events, poly(A) site choice and poly(A) tail length. Loss of m<sup>6</sup>A from 3’ untranslated regions is associated with decreased relative transcript abundance and defective RNA 3′ end formation. A functional consequence of disrupted m<sup>6</sup>A is a lengthening of the circadian period. We conclude that nanopore direct RNA sequencing can reveal the complexity of mRNA processing and modification in full-length single molecule reads. These findings can refine Arabidopsis genome annotation. Further, applying this approach to less well-studied species could transform our understanding of what their genomes encode.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epitranscriptome</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>nanopore</kwd><kwd>polyadenylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J00247X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barton</surname><given-names>Geoffrey J</given-names></name><name><surname>Simpson</surname><given-names>Gordon G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M004155/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barton</surname><given-names>Geoffrey J</given-names></name><name><surname>Simpson</surname><given-names>Gordon G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M010066/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barton</surname><given-names>Geoffrey J</given-names></name><name><surname>Simpson</surname><given-names>Gordon G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>799300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knop</surname><given-names>Katarzyna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008890</institution-id><institution>University of Dundee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GCRF Challenge Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barton</surname><given-names>Geoffrey J</given-names></name><name><surname>Simpson</surname><given-names>Gordon G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>097945/B/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barton</surname><given-names>Geoffrey J</given-names></name><name><surname>Simpson</surname><given-names>Gordon G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sequencing mRNA directly with nanopores can reveal the authentic combinations of multiple mRNA processing events in full-length mRNA molecules in addition to identifying base modifications.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Patterns of pre-mRNA processing and base modifications determine eukaryotic mRNA coding potential and fate. Alternative transcripts produced from the same gene can differ in the position of the start site, the site of cleavage and polyadenylation, and the combination of exons spliced into the mature mRNA. Collectively termed the epitranscriptome, RNA modifications play crucial context-specific roles in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Meyer and Jaffrey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>). The most abundant internal modification of mRNA is methylation of adenosine at the N6 position (m<sup>6</sup>A). Knowledge of RNA modifications and processing combinations is essential to understand gene expression and what genomes really encode.</p><p>RNA sequencing (RNAseq) is used to dissect transcriptome complexity: it involves copying RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) with reverse transcriptases (RTs) and then sequencing the subsequent DNA copies. RNAseq reveals diverse features of transcriptomes, but limitations can include misidentification of 3′ ends through internal priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jan et al., 2011</xref>), spurious antisense and splicing events produced by RT template switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Houseley and Tollervey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mourão et al., 2019</xref>), and the inability to detect all base modifications in the copying process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Helm and Motorin, 2017</xref>). The fragmentation of RNA prior to short-read sequencing makes it difficult to interpret the combination of authentic RNA processing events and remains an unsolved problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Steijger et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We investigated whether long-read direct RNA sequencing (DRS) with nanopores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garalde et al., 2018</xref>) could reveal the complexity of Arabidopsis mRNA processing and modifications. In nanopore DRS, the protein pore (nanopore) sits in a membrane through which an electrical current is passed, and intact RNA is fed through the nanopore by a motor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garalde et al., 2018</xref>). Each RNA sequence within the nanopore (five bases) can be identified by the magnitude of signal it produces. Arabidopsis is a pathfinder model in plant biology, and its genome annotation strongly influences the annotation and our understanding of what other plant genomes encode. We applied nanopore DRS and Illumina RNAseq to wild-type Arabidopsis (Col-0) and mutants defective in m<sup>6</sup>A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Růžička et al., 2017</xref>) and exosome-mediated RNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lange et al., 2014</xref>).

The spike-ins were detected in a quantitative manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), consistent with the suggestion that nanopore sequencing is quantitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garalde et al., 2018</xref>). For the portion of reads that align to the reference, sequence identity was 92% when measured against the ERCC RNA spike-ins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The errors showed evidence of base specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). For example, guanine was under-represented and uracil over-represented in indels and substitutions relative to the reference nucleotide (nt) distribution. In some situations, this bias could impact the utility of interpreting nanopore sequence errors. We used the proovread software tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hackl et al., 2014</xref>) and parallel Illumina RNAseq data to correct base-calling errors in the nanopore reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Depledge et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Artefactual splitting of raw signal affects transcript interpretation</title><p>We detected artefacts caused by the MinKNOW software splitting raw signal from single molecules into two or more reads. As a result, alignments comprising apparently novel 3′ ends were mapped as adjacent to alignments with apparently novel 5′ ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). A related phenomenon called over-splitting was recently reported in nanopore DNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Payne et al., 2019</xref>). Over-splitting can be detected when two reads sequenced consecutively through the same pore are mapped to adjacent loci in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Payne et al., 2019</xref>). Over-splitting in nanopore DRS generally occurs at low frequency (&lt; 2% of reads). However, RNAs originating from specific gene loci, such as <italic>RH3</italic> (<italic>AT5G26742</italic>), appear to be more susceptible, with up to 20% of reads affected across multiple sequencing experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Spurious antisense reads are rare or absent in nanopore DRS</title><p>Two out of 9,445 (0.02%) reads mapped antisense to the ERCC RNA spike-in collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>). None of 19,665 reads mapped antisense to the highly expressed gene <italic>RUBISCO ACTIVASE</italic> (<italic>RCA</italic>) (<italic>AT2G39730</italic>), consistent with the lack of antisense RNAs annotated at this locus. Consequently, we conclude that spurious antisense is rare or absent from nanopore DRS data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wyman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mourão et al., 2019</xref>). This simplifies the interpretation of authentic antisense RNAs, which is important in Arabidopsis because the distinction between RT-dependent template switching and authentic antisense RNAs produced by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that copy mRNA is not straightforward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Matsui et al., 2017</xref>). For example, by nanopore DRS, we could identify Arabidopsis long non-coding antisense RNAs, such as those at the auxin efflux carriers <italic>PIN4</italic> and <italic>PIN7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

ERCC-00002 has an expected poly(A) tail length of 24 nt, and the median nanopolish polyA estimate was 23.3 nt (95% confidence intervals [CIs] [5.7, 102]; n = 1,485).

We conclude that the median nanopolish-polyA estimates of poly(A) tail length are accurate within a few bases, but individual read measurements have a wide margin of error. Application of this approach to reads mapping to the Arabidopsis genome indicated a median length estimate of 68 nt for Arabidopsis mRNA poly(A) tails, but with a wide range in estimated lengths for individual mRNAs (95% were in the 13–200 nt range; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

The median genomic distance between nanopore DRS and Helicos DRS 3′ ends was 0 ± 13 nt (one standard deviation) demonstrating close agreement between these orthogonal technologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Likewise, the overall distribution of the 3′ ends of aligned nanopore DRS reads resembles the pattern we previously reported with Helicos data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sherstnev et al., 2012</xref>). For example, 97% of nanopore DRS 3′ ends (4,152,800 reads at 639,178 unique sites, 93% of all unique sites) mapped to either annotated 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) or downstream of the current annotation. Mapping of 3′ ends to coding sequences or 5′UTRs was rare (2.8%, 119,524 reads at 39,610 unique sites, 5.8% of all unique sites), and mapping to introns even rarer (0.29%, 12,554 reads at 7791 unique sites, 1.1% of unique sites). Even so, examples of the latter included sites of alternative polyadenylation with well-established regulatory roles, such as in mRNA encoding the RNA-binding protein FPA, which controls flowering time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hornyik et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and in mRNA encoding the histone H3K9 demethylase IBM1, which controls levels of genic DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rigal et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In addition, we identified novel examples of intronic alternative polyadenylation predicted to influence gene function. For example, we found frequent cleavage and polyadenylation at mRNA encoding the PTM homeodomain transcription factor (AT5G35210) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). PTM mediates retrograde signalling upon cleavage of a C-terminal transmembrane domain that sequesters it to the chloroplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feng et al., 2016</xref>).

To address this issue, we examined whether the 3′ ends of nanopore DRS reads mapped to potential internal priming substrates comprised of six consecutive adenosines within a transcribed coding sequence (according to the Arabidopsis Information Portal Col-0 genome annotation, Araport11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>). Of the 10,116 such oligo(A)<sub>6</sub> sequences, only four have read alignments terminating within 13 nt in all four datasets. Of these, two were not detectable after error correction with proovread (suggesting that they resulted from alignment errors) and the other two mapped to the terminal exon of coding sequence annotation, indicating that they may be authentic 3′ ends. Hence, internal priming is rare or absent in nanopore DRS data. It is possible that a standard nanopore DRS approach may be compromised in the quantitative detection of RNAs with very short poly(A) tails or tails incorporating uridylation for decay. However, overall, we conclude that nanopore DRS can identify multiple authentic features of RNA 3′ end processing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Cap-dependent 5′ RNA detection by nanopore DRS</title><p>Nanopore DRS reads are frequently truncated prior to annotated transcription start sites, resulting in a 3′ bias of genomic alignments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Depledge et al., 2019</xref>). Consequently, it is impossible to determine which, if any, aligned reads correspond to full-length transcripts. To address this issue, we used cap-dependent ligation of a biotinylated 5′ adapter RNA to purify capped mRNAs (a related approach has recently been used by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>). We then re-sequenced two biological replicates of Arabidopsis Col-0 incorporating 5′ adapter ligation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and filtered the reads for 5′ adapter RNA sequences using the sequence alignment tool BLASTN and specific criteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

First, we compared the nanopore cap-capture 5’ ends with full-length Arabidopsis cDNA clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Seki et al., 2002</xref>). We found that 41% of adapter-ligated nanopore DRS reads mapped within 5 nt of transcription start sites and 60% mapped within 13 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Next, we compared the nanopore cap-captured 5’ ends to Arabidopsis data obtained using an Illumina-based high throughput 5’ mapping approach called nanoPARE (parallel analysis of RNA ends) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schon et al., 2018</xref>). We found that 75% of nanopore DRS cap-capture 5’ ends mapped within 5 nt of a transcription start site detected using single base resolution peak-calling from nanoPARE reads, and 82% mapped with 13 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This closer agreement is presumably due to the increased depth of nanoPARE data leading to greater coverage of alternative transcription start sites. We also detected recently defined examples of alternative 5′ transcription start sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Ushijima et al., 2017</xref>) at specific Arabidopsis genes, which are also supported by nanoPARE data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We therefore conclude that this approach is effective in detecting authentic mRNA 5′ ends.</p><p>Reads with adapters had, on average, 11 nt more at their 5′ ends that could be aligned to the genome compared with the most common 5′ alignment position of reads lacking the 5′ adapter RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This difference may be explained by loss of processive control by the motor protein when the end of an RNA molecule enters the pore. As a result, the 5′ end of RNA is not correctly sequenced. Consistent with these Arabidopsis transcriptome-wide nanopore DRS data, reads mapping to the synthetic ERCC RNA Spike-Ins and <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNAs also lacked ~11 nt of authentic 5′ sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). However, the precise length of 5′ sequence missing from all of these RNAs varied, suggesting that sequence- or context-specific effects on sequence accuracy are associated with the passage of 5′ RNA through the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>).</p><p>Despite the close agreement between nanopore DRS, Illumina RNAseq and full-length cDNA data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Seki et al., 2002</xref>) at <italic>RCA</italic>, the start site annotated in Araport11 and the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Reference Transcript Dataset 2 (AtRTD2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>) is quite different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The apparent overestimation of 5′UTR length is widespread in Araport11 annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>), consistent with the assessment of capped Arabidopsis 5′ ends detected by nanoPARE sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schon et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, with appropriate modification to the current protocol, such as we describe here, nanopore DRS data can be used to revise Arabidopsis transcription start site annotations.</p><p>We next asked whether the truncation of reads prior to predicted TSSs in conventional nanopore DRS data might inform features of biological RNA decay. We examined if there was enrichment of 5’ nanopore DRS reads terminating in proximity to miRNA cleavage sites predicted in protein coding and non-coding RNAs. We identified peaks of downstream cleavage products at mRNA encoding, for example, HAM1, which is targeted by miR170 and miR171 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>), NAC1 (targeted by miR164), ARF proteins (targeted by miR160) and SPL domain-containing proteins (targeted by miR156/7) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). In addition, we could detect cleavage of the non-coding <italic>TAS</italic> RNAs that are targeted by miR173 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Therefore, nanopore DRS can reveal regions of internal mRNA and ncRNA cleavage. Since nanopore DRS does not sequence the 5’ end of RNA accurately, precision in this approach would be improved by ligation of an adapter to uncapped RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schon et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Nanopore DRS reveals the complexity of splicing events</title><p>In single reads, nanopore sequencing revealed some of the most complex splicing combinations so far identified in the Arabidopsis transcriptome.

After error correction, only 13% (39,061) of unique splice junctions were unsupported by an orthogonal dataset, consistent with an improvement in alignment accuracy. The four nanopore DRS datasets for Col-0 biological replicates captured 75% (102,486) and 69% (104,686) of Araport11 and AtRTD2 splice site annotations, respectively. Most of the canonical GU/AG splicing events (100,450; 81%) detected in the error-corrected nanopore data were found in both annotations and were supported by Illumina RNAseq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

For example, we identified 19 <italic>FLM</italic> splicing patterns that adhered to known splice junction sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, 11 of these transcript isoforms were not previously annotated. In order to investigate this phenomenon transcriptome-wide, we analysed the 5′ cap-dependent nanopore DRS datasets of full-length mRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Unique sets of co-splicing events were extracted from error-corrected reads (so as to focus on splicing, we did not consider single exon reads or 5′ and 3′ positions). In total, 13,064 unique splicing patterns were detected that matched annotations in Araport11, AtRTD2 or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Another 8,659 unique splicing patterns were identified that were not present in either annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Of these, 50% (4,293) used only splice donor and acceptor pairs that were already annotated in either Araport11 or AtRTD2. Hence, this approach defines splicing patterns (including retained introns) produced from alternative combinations of known splice sites.</p><p>We next asked whether these full-length nanopore DRS reads could reveal alternative splicing events with a predicted functional impact, such as the introduction of premature termination codons (PTCs) that can target mRNAs for nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). We could identify established cases of alternative splicing that lead to NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kalyna et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). In addition, by highlighting reads overlapping annotated ORFs, with splicing events that would shift the annotated stop codon out of frame, we identified novel events that could lead to NMD. For example, exon skipping at mRNA encoding a KH domain protein (AT5G56140) and the use of alternative acceptor sites at mRNA encoding XRCC (AT1G80420) introduce PTCs. In both cases, the splicing events detected with nanopore DRS were supported by reads from our Illumina RNAseq data.</p><p>Overall, we conclude that nanopore DRS can reveal a greater complexity of splicing in the context of full-length mRNAs compared with short-read data. However, accurate splice pattern detection benefits from error correction with, for example, high-accuracy orthogonal short-read sequencing data. However, even with error-free sequences, accurate splice detection can be confounded by the existence of equivalent alternative junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dehghannasiri et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, improved computational tools are required, not only for basecalling or error correction but also for splicing-aware long-read alignment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Differential error site analysis reveals m<sup>6</sup>A modifications transcriptome-wide</title><p>mRNA modifications have emerged recently as a crucial, but relatively neglected, layer of gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Meyer and Jaffrey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>). m<sup>6</sup>A has been mapped transcriptome-wide using approaches based on antibodies that recognize this mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Helm and Motorin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Linder et al., 2015</xref>). However, in principle, m<sup>6</sup>A can be detected by nanopore DRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garalde et al., 2018</xref>). Since m<sup>6</sup>A is not included in the training data for nanopore base-calling software, we asked whether its incorrect interpretation could be used to identify m<sup>6</sup>A in RNA. To test this possibility, we examined whether we could detect m<sup>6</sup>A in a matched set of synthetic RNAs that differ only in the presence or absence of N6 methylation at a single adenosine. We selected a 60 nt portion of the human MALAT1 lncRNA with a previously reported m<sup>6</sup>A site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). The m<sup>6</sup>A modified and unmodified RNAs were chemically synthesised, complete with a 50 nt poly(A) tail and sequenced using nanopore DRS. Using read alignments to the known sequence of the synthetic RNA, we applied a G-test to detect differences in the basecall profile of alignments at each reference position. Using this differential error rate approach, we could correctly map the position of m<sup>6</sup>A in these synthetic RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>We next asked, if this same approach could be used to map Arabidopsis m<sup>6</sup>A transcriptome-wide. For this, we applied nanopore DRS to four biological replicates of an Arabidopsis mutant defective in the function of <italic>VIRILIZER</italic> (<italic>vir-1</italic>), a conserved m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex component, and four biological replicates of a line expressing VIR fused to Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) (VIR complemented; VIRc) that restores VIR activity in the <italic>vir-1</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Růžička et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In parallel, we sequenced six biological replicates of each genotype with Illumina RNAseq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2B</xref>). We used the differential error rate analysis approach to compare the mutant (defective m<sup>6</sup>A) and VIR-complemented lines. We identified 17,491 sites with a more than two-fold higher error rate (compared with the TAIR10 reference base) in the VIR-complemented line with restored m<sup>6</sup>A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). No VIR-dependent error sites mapped to either chloroplast or mitochondrial-encoded RNAs. In all, 99.4% of the differential error sites mapped within Araport11 annotated protein-coding genes. Motif analysis of these error sites revealed the DRAYH (D = G or U or A, R = G or A, Y = C or U, H = A or C or U) sequence (E value &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−16</sup>), which closely resembles the established m<sup>6</sup>A target consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Meyer and Jaffrey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The most frequently detected motifs in this analysis, AAm<sup>6</sup>ACU and AAm<sup>6</sup>ACA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), match those most frequently detected in Arabidopsis using the orthogonal Me-RIP approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Luo et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, we also detect 187 sites (4.8%) associated with the motif AGAUU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), raising the possibility that a C following m<sup>6</sup>A is not an invariant feature of the Arabidopsis m<sup>6</sup>A code. In addition, like the established location of m<sup>6</sup>A sites in mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Meyer and Jaffrey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>), the error sites were preferentially found in 3′UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The relatively low resolution of Me-RIP analysis is associated with an interpretation of enrichment of m<sup>6</sup>A over stop codons. However, consistent with the development of other more accurate methods of mapping m<sup>6</sup>A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ke et al., 2015</xref>), nanopore DRS analysis does not support this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Since approximately five nt contribute to the observed current at a given time point in nanopore sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garalde et al., 2018</xref>), the presence of a methylated adenosine could affect the accuracy of base-calling for the surrounding nucleotides. Consistent with this, we identified 3,871 unique sequences (False Discovery Rate [FDR] &lt; 0.1) matching the motif discovered at error sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), with a median of one error site per motif (95% CIs [1, 5]).

Previous maps of Arabidopsis m<sup>6</sup>A are based on Me-RIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shen et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2018</xref>) and limited by a resolution of around 200 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ke et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, to examine Arabidopsis m<sup>6</sup>A sites with a more accurate method, we used miCLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Linder et al., 2015</xref>) analysis of two biological replicates of Arabidopsis Col-0. We found that, like the differential error sites uncovered in the nanopore DRS analysis, the Arabidopsis miCLIP reads were enriched in 3′ UTRs but with no enrichment over stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In all, 66% of the called nanopore DRS differential error sites fell within 5 nt of an miCLIP peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). We therefore conclude that our analysis of nanopore DRS data can detect authentic VIR-dependent m<sup>6</sup>A sites transcriptome-wide.</p><p>We next examined how the power of the differential error rate analysis approach to detect m<sup>6</sup>A depends upon sequencing depth. To do this we used a random sub-sampling approach at different read depths. Using the single replicate of MALAT1 synthetic RNA nanopore DRS data we were able to detect m<sup>6</sup>A at the correct position in more than 95% of random sub-samples with 60 reads per condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Since the stoichiometry of m<sup>6</sup>A varies in nature, we replaced some of the sample of methylated reads with unmethylated reads in silico. When 50% of reads in the methylation positive condition are sampled from the unmethylated condition, more than 200 reads per condition are required to reliably detect m<sup>6</sup>A in &gt; 95% bootstraps, indicating that stoichiometry is an important factor in the power to detect differentially methylated sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We next performed a sub-sampling analysis for a selection of m<sup>6</sup>A sites using the Arabidopsis nanopore DRS datasets. We found that the number of reads required to detect m<sup>6</sup>A varies between Arabidopsis genes and between methylated positions in transcripts from the same gene. Presumably, these distinctions reflect differences in stoichiometry (or possibly sequence context) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). For some positions, we can reliably detect m<sup>6</sup>A with only 10 reads per replicate (in a four replicate per condition experiment).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Defective m<sup>6</sup>A perturbs gene expression patterns and lengthens the circadian period</title><p>The combination of transcript processing and modification data obtained using nanopore DRS enabled us to investigate the impact of m<sup>6</sup>A on Arabidopsis gene expression.

DaPars-mediated analysis also revealed a clear directional shift to proximal poly(A) site selection at thousands of loci in the <italic>vir-1</italic> background, with 3408 genes displaying a decrease in distal poly(A) site usage, compared to only 166 genes displaying an increase in distal poly(A) site usage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Consequently, DaPars analysis is consistent with our nanopore DRS study, indicating that the predominant disruption in 3’ end formation in the <italic>vir-1</italic> mutant is a shift to proximal poly(A) site selection.</p><p>To address the relationship between m<sup>6</sup>A and 3’ end formation further, we asked if differential error sites were phased (associated) with specific poly(A) sites. We clustered reads from VIRc samples by their 3’ position using kernel density estimation. We then compared the error profiles of reads from different 3’ clusters using a G-test to identify whether 3’ end positions were associated with m<sup>6</sup>A levels (only positions which had differential error in the <italic>vir-1</italic> vs VIRc comparison were tested). We identified 327 error sites which were phased with 3’ end position, overlapping 207 annotated genes. 149 (72%) of these also display a statistically detectable change in 3’ end position in the <italic>vir-1</italic> mutant compared to VIRc. For example, at <italic>PRPL34</italic> (<italic>AT1G29070</italic>), selection of the distal poly(A) sites pA2 and pA3 is associated with increased mismatches to the reference base (presumably resulting from higher levels of m<sup>6</sup>A) at an upstream error site, compared to the proximal poly(A) site pA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Consistent with this, there is a quantitative shift to selection of the proximal poly(A) site pA1 in the <italic>vir-1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These findings indicate that changes in 3’ end position in the <italic>vir-1</italic> mutant may result directly from the loss of m<sup>6</sup>A.</p><p>In the <italic>vir-1</italic> mutant, there is an increase in the relative abundance of 3’ end positions in the region approximately 0-20 nt downstream of differential error sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Notably, the distribution of the canonical poly(A) signal AAUAAA peaks 19 nt upstream of the cleavage site in Arabidopsis mRNA (related hexamers, differing at only a single position, show similar distribution patterns) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sherstnev et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore compared the distribution of the poly(A) signal AAUAAA (and related hexamers differing at only a single position, except AAAAAA) with the motifs underlying differential error sites. This analysis reveals a close overlap of the peak of AAUAAA-like poly(A) signals with the m<sup>6</sup>A motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). This finding may reflect the relative similarity of the most common Arabidopsis m<sup>6</sup>A motifs (such as AAACU and AAACA) to the poly(A) signal, and indicates that adenosine residues directly adjacent to, or within, the poly(A) signal itself may be methylated. Since loss of m<sup>6</sup>A activates the selection of upstream poly(A) signals, these findings are consistent with m<sup>6</sup>A at (or in the vicinity of) AAUAAA inhibiting recognition of the poly(A) signal for subsequent cleavage and polyadenylation.</p><p>We next investigated those events where downstream readthrough was detected in <italic>vir-1</italic>. The impacts of altered 3′ processing can be complex and have the potential to change the relative abundance of transcripts processed from the same gene but with different coding potential. For example, we detected increased readthrough of an intronic cleavage site in the Symplekin-like gene <italic>TANG1</italic> (<italic>AT1G27595</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and increased readthrough and cryptic splicing at <italic>ALG3</italic> (<italic>AT2G47760</italic>) that also results in chimeric RNA formation with the downstream gene <italic>GH3.9</italic> (<italic>AT2G4G7750</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). The existence of the <italic>ALG3-GH3.9</italic> chimeric RNAs was supported by Illumina RNAseq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) and confirmed by RT-PCR, cloning and sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). We detected 523 loci with increased levels of chimeric RNAs in <italic>vir-1</italic> resulting from unterminated transcription proceeding into downstream genes on the same strand (Supplementary dataset 24). Chimeric RNAs were recently detected in mutants affecting other components of the Arabidopsis m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex, MTA and FIP37 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pontier et al., 2019</xref>). However, only 33% of upstream genes forming the chimeric RNAs had detectable m<sup>6</sup>A sites in the VIR-complemented line with restored VIR activity. Consequently, these findings might be explained either by an m<sup>6</sup>A-independent role for VIR (or the writer complex) in 3′ end formation or an indirect effect on factors required for 3′ processing. m<sup>6</sup>A independent roles for the human m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferases METTL3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2016</xref>) and METTL16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pendleton et al., 2017</xref>) have been found previously, and a role for the writer complex in controlling Arabidopsis RNA processing independent of m<sup>6</sup>A cannot be overlooked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pendleton et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Overall, we conclude that loss of <italic>VIRILIZER</italic>-dependent m<sup>6</sup>A disrupts Arabidopsis mRNA 3’ formation. Although this includes readthrough at poly(A) sites with the formation of chimeric RNAs, the predominant impact is loss of suppression of proximal poly(A) sites.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We used nanopore DRS to reveal the Arabidopsis transcriptome. Using orthogonal datasets as validation in each case, we could demonstrate the utility of nanopore DRS in revealing full-length mRNAs, mapping 5’ cap position, the position and estimated length of the poly(A) tail, patterns of alternative splicing, sites of internal RNA cleavage, and m<sup>6</sup>A modification of RNA. As a result, we could not only confirm previously established complexity in Arabidopsis RNA processing, but uncover novel events too. We found that spurious antisense signal was rare or absent, as were internal priming artefacts that complicate interpretation of authentic antisense RNAs and poly(A) sites respectively. Improvements in the utility of nanopore DRS likely depend upon more accurate base-calling, refined splitting of signal, increased read-depth and the development of software for splice-aware alignment of long sequencing reads.</p><p>The key technological question we addressed in this study, was whether nanopore DRS could be used to map m<sup>6</sup>A transcriptome-wide. We show that a simple and transparent statistical test of basecalling error rate can identify m<sup>6</sup>A. Available basecalling software depend upon recurrent neural networks trained with signal produced from sequencing RNA where modified bases are unlabelled and present in relatively low abundance. As a result, basecallers cannot accurately assign m<sup>6</sup>A. Since 5 RNA bases occupy a nanopore at any one time, m<sup>6</sup>A can affect the accuracy of basecalling of surrounding nucleotides. Formally then, an error-rate based approach has an approximate resolution of 9 nt. However, the methylated base can be interpreted using a position weight matrix of the consensus motif associated with error sites. Nanopore DRS technology and basecalling software continues to develop. In our experience, so long as the basecallers are not trained to directly identify m<sup>6</sup>A, and sequencing and analysis is performed on a common iteration of the nanopore DRS platform (the same generation of sequencing kit, pore and basecalling software), then an error rate approach is still able to map m<sup>6</sup>A. Since this is a statistical test, it depends upon an aggregation of reads and does not map m<sup>6</sup>A directly in single molecules. Consequently, the power to detect m<sup>6</sup>A will depend upon read depth.</p><p>Until recently, high throughput m<sup>6</sup>A mapping has depended on antibodies that recognise this modification. However, antibody-based approaches such as MeRIP/m<sup>6</sup>A-seq and miCLIP are limited in some respects. For example, they cannot readily define stoichiometry, do not necessarily detect m<sup>6</sup>A only, have unclear sensitivity, and the fragmentation of RNA required for library preparation may result in the underrepresentation of sites close to RNA 3’ ends. As a result, antibody-independent approaches to mapping m<sup>6</sup>A have been sought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garcia-Campos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Meyer, 2019</xref>). The enzyme MaZF cleaves RNA at ACA in a methylation-dependent manner and is used in MAZTER-Seq to give single base resolution and insight into m<sup>6</sup>A stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garcia-Campos et al., 2019</xref>). Since MAZTER-Seq is limited to the detection of m<sup>6</sup>As in an ACA context (and spatial constraints) the majority of m<sup>6</sup>A sites in human or yeast cells cannot be detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garcia-Campos et al., 2019</xref>). Another recently developed nanopore DRS-based approach to map m<sup>6</sup>A, called EpiNano, also has context-specific limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2019</xref>); nanopore DRS of <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNAs was used to train a support vector machine model to detect m<sup>6</sup>A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). However, EpiNano cannot currently call m<sup>6</sup>A in a <italic>k</italic>-mer with more than one adenosine, and hence 92% of m<sup>6</sup>A sites we identify in Arabidopsis are undetectable with this approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Since nanopore DRS is a relatively recent development in RNA sequencing, we anticipate that alternative approaches will refine our ability to identify RNA modifications in single molecule reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lorenz et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The key biological question we set out to address, was whether an unbiased transcriptome-wide sequencing approach (that mapped m<sup>6</sup>A in the context of full-length mRNAs) could reveal the functional impacts of m<sup>6</sup>A on Arabidopsis gene expression. We found that disrupting m<sup>6</sup>A was associated with altered patterns of mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation. Although we detected readthrough at some poly(A) sites, the predominant effect was the activation of proximal poly(A) sites in the absence of m<sup>6</sup>A, indicating that m<sup>6</sup>A can suppress proximal poly(A) site selection. We found that the distribution of m<sup>6</sup>A sites and the canonical poly(A) signal AAUAAA (and related hexamers with one mismatch position) closely overlapped, indicating that adenosines within the AAUAAA signal itself could be methylated. In mammals, recognition of AAUAAA involves direct binding by the CPSF30 and WDR33 proteins of the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schönemann et al., 2014</xref>). The Arabidopsis homologs (CPSF30 and FY respectively) show conservation of amino acid residues involved in recognizing AAUAAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clerici et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). In Arabidopsis, the conserved, constitutive role for CPSF30 and FY in recognising the poly(A) signal is associated with the evolution of features for specific gene regulation. For example, FY has C- terminal proline-containing motifs that mediate an interaction with the plant-specific RNA binding protein FCA, conferring upon FY a specialised function in controlling the timing of Arabidopsis flower development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Simpson et al., 2003</xref>). Meanwhile, Arabidopsis (like other plants and the apicomplexa) expresses a CPSF30 isoform (regulated by alternative polyadenylation in Arabidopsis) that encodes a YT521-B homology (YTH) domain with the potential to bind and read m<sup>6</sup>A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stevens et al., 2018</xref>). We speculate that m<sup>6</sup>A at AAUAAA either directly inhibits binding of CPSF30 and FY to the poly(A) signal, or that binding of m<sup>6</sup>A by YTH domain containing proteins (possibly CPSF30-YTH itself) blocks canonical recognition by CPSF30 and FY, and hence assembly of an active cleavage and polyadenylation complex. Future experiments will dissect the mechanisms involved.</p><p>The impact of individual m<sup>6</sup>A sites on Arabidopsis biology is likely to be context-specific. However, it is clear that m<sup>6</sup>A is almost exclusively found in mRNA 3’UTRs (in steady-state analyses). Consequently, the effect of m<sup>6</sup>A is likely to be mediated mostly through mRNA alternative polyadenylation, stability, translatability and the formation of specific protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mayr, 2019</xref>). We (and others) find that transcripts modified with m<sup>6</sup>A are predominantly stabilised in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2018</xref>). An explanation for this phenomenon is that m<sup>6</sup>A protects against upstream endonucleolytic mRNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2018</xref>). We report here that m<sup>6</sup>A predominantly inhibits the selection of downstream proximal cleavage and polyadenylation sites. These distinct phenotypes may reflect temporal differences in how m<sup>6</sup>A affects mRNA fate. During co-transcriptional processing, m<sup>6</sup>A may influence the site of cleavage and polyadenylation, but subsequently affect mRNA phase separation and fate in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ries et al., 2019</xref>). Arabidopsis has 13 YTH domain containing proteins with the potential to bind and read m<sup>6</sup>A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reichel et al., 2019</xref>). Understanding the complexity of the roles that they play will help explain the context-specific functions of m<sup>6</sup>A. The combination of m<sup>6</sup>A mapping and RNA complexity revealed by nanopore DRS, provides an additional approach to address these questions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>We have shown that nanopore DRS has the potential to refine multiple features of Arabidopsis genome annotation and to generate the clearest map to date of m<sup>6</sup>A locations, despite the genome sequence being available since 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kaul and Arabidopsis Genome Initiative, 2000</xref>).

Based on our experience with Arabidopsis, we anticipate that the combination of nanopore DRS and other sequencing approaches will improve genome annotation. Consistent with this, we recently applied nanopore DRS to refine the annotation of water yam (<italic>Dioscorea alata</italic>), an African orphan crop. Indeed, we are moving into an era where thousands of genome sequences are available and programmes such as the Earth BioGenome Project aim to sequence all eukaryotic life on Earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lewin et al., 2018</xref>). However, genome sequences provide only part of the puzzle: annotating what they encode will be essential for us to fully utilize this information.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plants</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>Wild-type <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accession Col-0 was obtained from Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre.

Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) and BAM file manipulations were performed using samtools version 1.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Variation in mapping rates is likely caused by differences in the amount of RNA loaded onto the flowcell. For example, the cap-capture procedure, resulted in less input RNA for library preparation. This has two consequences: first, it results in lower pore occupancy during sequencing, resulting in many apparently low quality ‘reads’ which are actually noise signal from empty pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mojarro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pontefract et al., 2018</xref>); second, an increased number of reads map to Enolase II, the internal standard control RNA (Oxford Nanopore Technologies control strand) added to each library. For MALAT1 synthetic RNAs, which were only 110 nt in length including a 50 nt poly(A) tail, minimap2 parameters were relaxed to allow lower mapping scores: kmer size (-k) was reduced to 10; the minimum number of minimisers per chain (-n), to 2; the minimum chaining score (-m), to 12; and the minimum dynamic programming alignment score (-s), to 8.</p><p>Proovread version 2.14.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hackl et al., 2014</xref>) was used to correct errors in the nanopore DRS reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Depledge et al., 2019</xref>).

Error correction with proovread was conducted in sampling-free mode using a minimum nanopore read length of 50 nt. Since both the Illumina RNAseq and nanopore DRS datasets were strand specific, proovread was modified to prevent opposite strand mapping between the datasets.

Samples sequenced before or during May 2018 had very low levels of over-splitting (between 0.01% and 0.05% of reads) compared with those sequenced in September 2018 onwards (between 0.8% and 1.5% of reads).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-5"><title>Analysis of the potential for internal priming in nanopore DRS data</title><p>To determine whether internal priming caused by the RT step can occur in nanopore data, the location of oligo(A) hexamers within Arabidopsis coding sequence (CDS) regions (Araport11) was determined and reads that terminated within a 20 nt window of each hexamer were counted.

Of these, 137 were supported by only one replicate, and only four were supported by all four biological replicates.

In all, 37% of nanopore peaks occurred at the same position as a Helicos peak, and the standard deviation in distance was 12.5 nt. To determine the percentage of nanopore DRS 3′ ends mapping within annotated genic features, transcripts were first flattened into a single record per gene. Exonic annotation was given priority over intronic or intergenic annotation and CDS annotation was given priority over UTR annotation.

These soft-clipped sequences were then searched for the presence of the adapter sequence using BLASTN version 2.7.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camacho et al., 2009</xref>). Two rules were initially applied to filter BLASTN results: a match of 10 nt or more to the 44 nt adapter, and an E value of &lt; 100. Reads from the adapter-containing dataset that failed one or both criteria were used as negative training examples. A final rule requiring the match to the adapter sequence to occur directly adjacent to the aligned read was also applied. Reads from the adapter-containing dataset that passed all three rules were used as the positive training set. When comparing the ratio of positive to negative examples between datasets containing the adapter and those generated from the same tissue but without the adapter, we found that these three rules gave a signal-to-noise ratio of &gt; 5000 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>In all, 72,083 positive and 123,739 negative training examples from Col-0 tissue replicate one were collected to train the neural network. We then estimated the amount of raw signal from the 5′ end of the squiggle that was required on average to capture the 5′ adapter. To do this, we used nanopolish eventalign version 0.11.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Loman et al., 2015</xref>) to identify the interval in the raw read corresponding to the mRNA alignment to the reference in the positive examples of 5′ adapter-containing sequences. Since the adapter can be identified immediately adjacent to the alignment in sequence space for these reads, the signal after the event alignment should correspond to the signal originating from the adapter. The median length of these signals was 1441 points, and 96% of the signals were &lt; 3000 points. Therefore, we used a window size of 3000 to make predictions.</p><p>The model was trained in Python 3.6 using Keras version 2.2.4 with the Tensorflow version 1.10.0 backend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chollet, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abadi, 2016</xref>). A ResNet-style architecture was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaiming He et al., 2015</xref>), composed of eight residual blocks containing two convolutional layers of kernel size five and a shortcut convolution with kernel size 1. Down-sampling using maximum pooling layers with a stride of 2 was used between each residual block. A penultimate densely connected layer of size 16 was used, with training dropout of 0.5. Input signals were standardized by median absolute deviation scaling across the whole read before the final 3000 points were taken, and the negative samples were augmented by addition of random internal signals from reads and pure Gaussian, multi-Gaussian and perlin noise signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wick et al., 2018</xref>). The whole dataset was also augmented on the fly during training by the addition of Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0.1. Models were trained for a maximum of 100 epochs (batch size of 128, 100 batches per epoch, positive and negative examples sampled in a 1:1 ratio) using the RMSprop optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.001, which was reduced by a factor of 10 after three epochs with no reduction in validation loss. Early stopping was used after five epochs with no reduction in validation loss. We found that a number of negative training examples from the ends of reads, but not from internal positions, were likely to be incorrectly labelled by the BLASTN method, because the model predicted them to contain adapters. We therefore filtered these to clean the training data, before repeating the training process. Model performance was evaluated using five-fold cross validation and by testing on independently generated datasets from Col-0 replicate 2, produced with and without the adapter ligation protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chollet, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abadi, 2016</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the reduction in 3′ bias of adapter-ligated datasets, we used Araport11 exon annotations to produce per base coverage for each gene in the Col-0 replicate two dataset.

Leading zeros at the extreme 5′ and 3′ ends of genes were assumed to be caused by mis-annotation of UTRs and so were trimmed. The quartile coefficient of variation (interquartile range/median) was then used as a robust measure of variation in coverage across each gene.</p><p>Two orthogonal approaches were used to validate the 5′ ends of adapter-ligated reads. First, full-length cDNA clone sequences were downloaded from RIKEN RAFL (Arabidopsis full-length cDNA clones) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Seki et al., 2002</xref>). These were mapped with minimap2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li, 2018</xref>) in spliced mode. The distance from each nanopore alignment 5′ end to the nearest RIKEN RAFL alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Seki et al., 2002</xref>) 5′ end was calculated using bedtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>). The amount of 5′ end sequence that is rescued when 5′ adapters are used was estimated by identifying the largest peak in 5′ end locations per gene in the absence of adapter, and then measuring how this peak shifted using reads predicted to contain adapters. Second, Illumina RNAseq reads derived from 5’ tags using nanoPARE were downloaded from GSE112869 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schon et al., 2018</xref>). nanoPARE reads and matched control RNAseq reads were mapped to TAIR10 with Araport11 reference annotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>) using STAR version 2.6.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>), a maximum multimapping rate of 5, a minimum splice junction overhang of 8 nt (three nt for junctions in the Araport11 reference), a maximum of five mismatches per read, and intron length boundaries of 60–10,000 nt. Mapped reads were filtered into those representing ‘capped’ and ‘uncapped’ 5’ ends by the presence or absence of soft-clipped untemplated Gs at the 5’ end, which are added by reverse transcriptase in a cap dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schon et al., 2018</xref>). 5′ coverage and matched RNAseq 5′ coverage tracks were generated using bedtools version 2.27.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>). nanoPARE capped read peaks were called at single nucleotide resolution with Piranha version 1.2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Uren et al., 2012</xref>) and relaxed <italic>p</italic>-value thresholds of 0.5. Reproducible peaks across pairwise combinations of the three replicates were identified by irreproducible discovery rate (IDR) analysis using Python package idr version 2.0.3 with an IDR threshold of 0.05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2011</xref>). The final set of peaks was identified by pooling the three replicates, re-analysing using Piranha, ranking the peaks by FDR and selecting the top N peaks, where N is the smallest number of reproducible peaks discovered by pairwise comparisons of the three replicates. This yielded 47,986 unique single nucleotide resolution nanoPARE peaks. The distance from each nanopore alignment 5′ end to the nearest nanoPARE peak was calculated using bedtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-13"><title>Identification of miRNA cleavage products in nanopore DRS data</title><p>Nanopore miRNA cleavage product identification was adapted from the EndCut method used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schon et al., 2018</xref>).

A 20 nt window was used instead of measuring 5' ends precisely at the cleavage site, because as we demonstrate in this study, approximately 11 nt are lost from the 5' end of RNA sequencing reads in standard nanopore DRS. Predictions which fell within 5’UTRs or across splice junctions were filtered out to reduce false positives. The <italic>P</italic> values derived from nanopore coverage and Allen scores were combined using the fisher method and corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-14"><title>Differential error site analysis using nanopore DRS data</title><p>To detect sites of <italic>VIRILIZER</italic>-dependent m<sup>6</sup>A RNA modifications, we developed scripts to test changes in per base error profiles of aligned reads. Pileup columns for each position with coverage of &gt; 10 reads were generated using pysam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heger et al., 2014</xref>) and reads in each column were categorized as either A, C, G, U or indel. The relative proportions of each category were counted. Counts from replicates of the same experimental condition were aggregated and a 2 × 5 contingency table was produced for each base comparing <italic>vir-1</italic> and VIR-complemented lines. A G-test was performed to identify bases with significantly altered error profiles. For bases with a <italic>p-</italic>value of &lt; 0.05, G-tests for homogeneity between replicates of the same condition were then performed. Bases where the sum of the G statistic for homogeneity tests was greater than the G statistic for the <italic>vir-1</italic> and VIR-complemented line comparison were filtered. Multiple testing correction was carried out using the Benjamini-Hochberg method, and an FDR threshold of 0.05 was used. The log<sub>2</sub> fold change in mismatch to match ratio (compared with the reference base) between the <italic>vir-1</italic> and VIR-complemented lines was calculated using Haldane correction for zero counts.

Sequences corresponding to these sites were extracted from the TAIR10 reference and over-represented motifs were detected in the sequences using MEME version 5.0.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>), run in zero or one occurrence mode with a motif size range of 5–7 and a minimum requirement of 100 sequence matches. The presence of these motifs at error sites was then detected using FIMO version 5.0.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grant et al., 2011</xref>). A relaxed FDR threshold of 0.1 was used with FIMO to capture more degenerate motifs matching the m<sup>6</sup>A consensus.</p><p>To determine the effect of sequencing depth on the ability to call nanopore differential error sites, we performed a bootstrapped sub-sampling analysis. We conducted this analysis using MALAT1 synthetic RNA sequencing reads, and four differential error sites derived from three genes in the Arabidopsis data. 500 bootstrapped subsamples, at depths between 10 and 250 reads per condition, were generated for each gene and each base in the gene was then tested using differential error rate analysis as described above. Detection was considered successful if any of the differential error sites at the m<sup>6</sup>A motif which could be detected with all reads, was significant in the subsampled reads (FDR threshold 0.05). For the MALAT1 dataset, we also performed analyses on the effect of m<sup>6</sup>A stoichiometry on the ability to detect sites using differential error. For these analyses, reads from the m<sup>6</sup>A positive sample were replaced with reads from the m<sup>6</sup>A negative sample at rates of 0%, 25%, 50% and 75%, to simulate methylation levels of 100%, 75%, 50% and 25% respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-15"><title>Analysis of phasing of nanopore DRS error sites with poly(A) site choice</title><p>To identify error sites which were phased with 3’ ends, we used error sites identified in the <italic>vir-1</italic> vs VIRc comparison. We identified reads overlapping each error site in the VIRc samples using pysam version 0.15.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heger et al., 2014</xref>), and clustered them by 3’ end position using local minima detected after gaussian smoothing with a sigma of 13 nt. Clusters containing fewer than 10 reads in total were discarded. Error sites where there was only one cluster of reads after filtering were not assessed further. Basecall profiles for each 3’ cluster at the overlapping error site were then produced and tabulated into an N × 5 contingency table, where N is the number of 3’ clusters, and five is the basecall type, that is A, C, G, U, or indel. Error sites with differences in basecall profile in different 3’ clusters were detected using a G-test. <italic>P</italic> values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.

Multiple testing correction was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. To approximately identify the direction and distance of the change, the normalized single base level histograms of the VIR-complemented line profile was subtracted from that of the mutant profile, and the minimum and maximum points in the difference profile were identified. These represent the sites of most reduced and increased relative usage, respectively. Results were filtered for an FDR of &lt; 0.05 and absolute change of site &gt; 13 nt (the measured error range of nanopore DRS 3′ end alignment). The presence of m<sup>6</sup>A modifications at genes with differential 3′ end usage was assessed using bedtools intersect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>), and significant enrichment of m<sup>6</sup>A at these genes was tested using a hypergeometric test (using all expressed genes as the background population).</p><p>To identify genes with a significant increase in chimeras in the <italic>vir-1</italic> mutant, we used Araport11 annotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>) to identify reads that overlapped with multiple adjacent gene loci by more than 20% of their aligned length (i.e. chimeric reads) and those originating from a single locus (i.e. non-chimeric reads). To reduce false positives caused by reads mapping across tandem duplicated loci, reads mapping to genes annotated in PTGBase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yu et al., 2015</xref>) were filtered out. Chimeric reads were considered to originate from the most upstream gene with which they overlapped. We pooled reads from replicates for each experimental condition and used 50 bootstrapped samples (75% of the total data without replacement) to estimate the ratio of chimeric to non-chimeric reads at each gene in each condition. Haldane correction for zero counts was applied. The distributions of chimeric to non-chimeric ratios in the <italic>vir-1</italic> and VIR-complemented lines were tested using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test to detect loci with altered chimera production. All possible pairwise combinations of VIR-complemented and <italic>vir-1</italic> bootstraps were then compared to produce a distribution of estimates of change in the chimeric to non-chimeric ratio in the <italic>vir-1</italic> mutant.

Increases in mapping and over-splitting rate that occur in samples collected after September 2018 are therefore likely to have resulted from changes in the MinKNOW software. Other variations in mapping rates are likely caused by differences in the amount of RNA loaded onto the flowcell.

understanding the biology of any organism. While the advent of RNA sequencing using short-read sequencing has greatly enriched our understanding of the transcriptome, challenges due to short-read sequencing include difficulties in mapping uniquely to individual isoforms, and assembling full transcripts, especially in repeat regions. In addition, the need to convert RNA into cDNA libraries for sequencing can result in artifacts in transcript annotation due to template switching of reverse transcriptase enzymes, and cDNA sequencing limited in its ability to detect RNA modifications. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, the authors updated the annotation of the Arabidopsis transcriptome by identifying new antisense transcripts, new splicing patterns, 3' end usage, polyA tail lengths and full length transcripts using 5'cap capture. In addition, using a mutant of the m<sup>6</sup>A writer in Arabidopsis (<italic>vir-1</italic> mutant), and <italic>vir-1</italic> mutant reconstituted with <italic>vir-1</italic>, the authors used increased error rates in direct RNA sequencing to detect m<sup>6</sup>A modifications transcriptome-wide. The authors showed that m<sup>6</sup>A modifications impact RNA stability and circadian cycles are associated with 3' end formation in arabidopsis. The paper is very informative in the utility and limitations of using direct RNA sequencing to interrogate transcriptomes and the strategies described in the manuscript is widely applicable to not only Arabidopsis but also to any biologist interested in their transcriptome of choice.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Nanopore direct RNA sequencing maps an Arabidopsis N6 methyladenosine epitranscriptome&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a timely manuscript to demonstrate the utility of direct RNA sequencing in discovering transcriptomic features in the model organism <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. In addition to studying the primary sequences of the transcriptome, including 5' ends, splicing and polyA+ tail length, the authors also utilized direct RNA sequencing to identify m<sup>6</sup>A modifications in <italic>vir-1</italic> mutants and in <italic>vir-1</italic> mutants with restored VIR activity. They found that m<sup>6</sup>A modifications is associated with 3' end processing in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Overall the manuscript is well written and interesting.</p><p>We have suggestions to improve the manuscript to increase the impact of the novelty and utility of using direct RNA sequencing, as well as the technical strength of the manuscript by adding controls and performing validations to determine the accuracy of the new signals that they find.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) For polyA tail length determination- could the authors show accuracy of their polyA tail determination on a set of standards with known poly(A) tail lengths?</p><p>2) 75% of the author's adapter ligated library failed to align to the transcriptome. The authors should look into the failed reads to explain why this is so.</p><p>3) For transcripts with new 5' ends identified by 5'end capture, the authors should validate of the new 5'ends using 5'end RACE.</p><p>4) A set of RNAs with known m<sup>6</sup>A sites should be generated to determine the accuracy and sensitivity of the author's method in detecting m<sup>6</sup>A to other available softwares, such as Tombo from Nanopore, as well as other published methods including (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/525741v1). The authors should also comment on the robustness of their method with regards to new software changes.</p><p>5) The authors should show data on the correlation between sequencing depth and the ability to detect m<sup>6</sup>A modifications. They should also do deeper analysis to look at the nucleotide composition of the called m<sup>6</sup>A modifications that they capture, as well as whether there is potential bias towards capturing modifications on specific transcripts.</p><p>6) Direct RNA sequencing benefits from the aspect that it is long read, single molecule sequencing. As such, there is the possibility of &quot;phasing&quot; modifications that cannot be performed using short-read sequencing. The authors should show some examples of RNAs with more or less modifications than expected and attempt to associate that with RNA processing to demonstrate the utility of direct RNA sequencing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The possibility to perform RNA sequencing in its native form, without the requirement of cDNA synthesis, represents a major significant advance in RNA biology. Within this context, in this manuscript Matthew Parker and colleagues applied the Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing to characterize the profiling of RNA transcripts in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. In the first part of the manuscript, the aim of this research is to: 1) prove that the Nanopore direct RNA sequencing has the ability to detect long, complex mRNAs under an acceptable error rate and to resolve a great complexity of splicing events; 2) prove that the over-splitting and spurious antisense reads generally occurs at low frequency in Nanopore direct RNA sequencing; 3) prove that Nanopore direct RNA sequencing can be used in estimation of poly-A tail length; 4) prove that Nanopore direct RNA sequencing using Cap-dependent capturing is effective in detecting authentic mRNA 5′ ends by using a convolutional neural network classifier of raw signals. In the second part, the authors present a direct RNA sequencing-based approach to detection of m<sup>6</sup>A methylation in data produced from both the <italic>vir-1</italic> mutants defective in m<sup>6</sup>A and the <italic>vir-1</italic> mutants restoring VIR activity. Furthermore, taking advantage of long read sequencing, the authors found that VIR activity is associated with the maintenance of 3' end formation of mRNAs. Overall, this manuscript describes a scientifically sound investigation of an important scientific area, that of epitranscriptomics. This manuscript will no doubt be a valuable resource to the growing field of direct RNA sequencing. I recommend this manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>I have some specific points detailed below.</p><p>1) In the supplementary Table 1, only 25% and 27% of sequencings reads in the 5' adapter ligation library could be mapped to the TAIR10 genome. The authors should check the sequencing reads to explain in detail the reason for the failed alignment in a large majority of sequencing reads.</p><p>2) Subsection “Differential error site analysis reveals the m<sup>6</sup>A epitranscriptome”, 17,491 sites with a more than two-fold higher error rate in the VIR-complemented line with restored m<sup>6</sup>A. Are these error sites exclusively located in adenine positions? A nucleotide composition summary is required to improve clarity.</p><p>3) Subsection “Spurious antisense reads are rare or absent in nanopore DRS”, the absence of reads mapping to antisense to RCA suggests that spurious antisense is rare or absent from Nanopore direct RNA sequencing data. Is it a generally accepted that the genomic loci of RCA do not generate antisense transcripts? If so, this information should be included.</p><p>4) The webpage (https://github.com/bartongroup/Simpson_Barton_Nanopore_1) which is used to deposit scripts and pipelines on GitHub is not accessible. The code availability will represent a valuable addition to the Nanopore RNA sequencing community and can be used a guide for direct RNA methylation analysis.</p><p>5) This is a technical paper to assess the performance of Nanopore direct RNA sequencing in a pioneer manner. Since m<sup>6</sup>A RNA modification detection and full-length RNA transcript sequencing using Cap-dependent capturing constitutes the major contribution of this paper, the recent advances relating to these topics should be included in the Introduction section.</p><p>Liu H, et al.

RNA Biol 2019:1-10.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Parker et al. demonstrated several interesting applications of nanopore direct RNA sequencing (DRS) to advance the current understanding of Arabidopsis transcriptome. They have assessed the primary performance factors of DRS that are related to the basecalling error profile, poly(A) length distribution, full-length splicing profile, and the reliability of antisense reads. Also, they have developed two new techniques for DRS to find the 5′-end positions of capped RNAs and the m<sup>6</sup>A -modified positions in mRNAs. Finally, they applied an error-based m<sup>6</sup>A -detection method to find the association between the m<sup>6</sup>A modifications of 3′ UTR and RNA 3′-end processing in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.</p><p>This manuscript lists many different types of RNA processing and modification that can be detected by DRS. This is a nice demonstration of the potential applications and strengths of DRS. But most parts do not connect to each other, and the conceptual novelty is limited. I have some concerns that will need to be addressed before publication.</p><p>1) This technique is conceptually similar to the work by Liu et al. (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/525741v1). Please clarify the similarities/differences between Liu et al. and the method described in this manuscript.</p><p>2) Base-calling error profiles can vary depending on the basecaller version, the model in the basecaller, the processing/filtering parameters used for running the basecaller, the pore protein version, and the motor protein version. Recently, there was a huge upgrade for the basecalling model (high-accuracy model, a.k.a. flip-flop basecaller) introduced in Guppy 3.2. Moreover, according to the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), a faster motor protein and the new R10 pore will be introduced to their DRS kits very soon. The authors need to clarify and inform the readers that the error profile presented here may change depending on the basecaller software, a model, a pore, and a motor protein.</p><p>The method described in this manuscript can work in the specific combinations that the authors used, but it does not guarantee its performance in the other settings. Considering the change in the flagship basecaller, Guppy, with higher accuracy after the version used in the manuscript, the authors need to check if this method works with comparable accuracy with the newer Guppy.</p><p>3) In addition, Tombo from the ONT has a mode called &quot;level_sample_compare&quot; that enables the modified base detection by comparing control and experiment groups. Can you discuss a bit about the benefits and drawbacks of your method in comparison with Tombo?</p><p>4) Subsection “Nanopore DRS confirms sites of RNA 3′ end formation and estimates poly(A) tail length”: The standard nanopore DRS library preparation uses the double-stranded RNA-DNA ligation assisted by an oligo(dT) splint. It inevitably introduces a substantial underrepresentation of short poly(A) tails. Even 10 nt oligo(dT) splint often results in a strong bias for &gt; 20 nt poly(A) tails against the shorter tails. Moreover, short poly(A) tails often carry additional U tails which interfere with the ligation to the adapter. In addition, the means of the single-read &quot;poly(A) length measurements&quot; may not be a suitable summarization to estimate the means of &quot;poly(A) lengths.&quot; Nanopolish gives the best approximations of poly(A) lengths at a single-read level. However, as the poly(A) dwell time roughly follows a gamma distribution with a long tail, the mean of the best approximations at a single-read level systematically overestimates the mean of poly(A) length.</p><p>5) Subsection “Cap-dependent 5′ RNA detection by nanopore DRS”: The authors used RNA ligase 1 to mark the 5′ ends of RNAs. Due to the substrate specificity of this enzyme, circularized mRNAs and mRNA-mRNA concatamers might have been produced. Supplementary Table 1 shows that the libraries using the standard protocol yielded ~90% of mappable reads while the libraries with cap-dependent ligation yielded only ~25%. Please describe what the other 75% are. Also, it would be helpful if the sequence information of the 5′ adapter were presented in the manuscript.</p><p>6) Subsection “Differential error site analysis reveals the m<sup>6</sup>A epitranscriptome”: How many of the miCLIP peaks could be detected with nanopore DRS? The authors only show the analyses using the population-level detection of m<sup>6</sup>A -modified sites. A real benefit of nanopore DRS lies in the associative analyses at a single-read level. Is it possible to use the DRS method to call m<sup>6</sup>A -modified sites within single molecules and analyze to see if a modified RNA has different polyadenylation status or 3′ end position from those in an unmodified RNA?</p><p>I feel that the current discoveries related to m<sup>6</sup>A modification in this manuscript can be better done using miCLIP than nanopore DRS.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, &quot;Nanopore direct RNA sequencing maps an Arabidopsis N6 methyladenosine epitranscriptome&quot; the authors use Nanopore direct-read RNA sequencing (DRS) to characterize the Arabidopsis transcriptome, including features that can't easily be determined by short read sequencing, such as cap-associated transcription start sites, splicing events, poly(A) site choice and poly(A) tail length. The authors also use this approach to map sites of m<sup>6</sup>A modification and use a <italic>vir-1</italic> mutant strain to validate m<sup>6</sup>A sites. The identification of modified transcripts allowed the authors to identify a role of m<sup>6</sup>A in regulating length of circadian period. Overall the paper is well written and is easy to follow.</p><p>The authors use cap-dependent ligation to enrich for capped mRNAs, reducing the 3' end bias observed in DRS. It would be of interest to discuss if the transcripts with early 5' ends result from technical artifacts (for example, degradation during RNA preparation) or represent transcripts present in the cell that lack a cap structure that is compatible with the ligation protocol. For example, the authors demonstrate that nanopore DRS can identify rare anti-sense transcripts. Could transcripts with early 5' ends, which are selected against in the cap dependent libraries, represent rare transcripts or degradation intermediary products?</p><p>Additionally, the authors leverage DRS to expand the set of annotated transcripts and splicing isoforms.

It would be informative if in addition to the ERCC controls, a set of RNAs with known m<sup>6</sup>A sites were also included.</p><p>One aspect of m<sup>6</sup>A biology that can't easily be studied with current methodologies is the stoichiometry of the modification at each position in each transcript. Can the authors comment at all on stoichiometry of m<sup>6</sup>A from DRS? Furthermore, can the authors comment on how many reads per transcript are necessary to detect a modification? Is there a bias towards more abundant transcripts? In mammalian cells it has been shown that modified RNAs tend to have shorter 3' UTRs (Molinie et al., 2016)(PMID: 27376769). Can this observation be tested in DRS, and if so, does the same phenomena occur in Arabidopsis? Information on stoichiometry can be validated for ACA sites with transcript specific assays using the MazF nuclease.</p><p>Lastly, can the authors comment on the ability of detecting modifications other than m<sup>6</sup>A through DRS?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49658.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) For polyA tail length determination- could the authors show accuracy of their polyA tail determination on a set of standards with known poly(A) tail lengths?</p></disp-quote><p>We used the software tool nanopolish (polyA), developed by Jared Simpson’s lab, to estimate poly(A) tail length. Details on the development of the tool are incorporated within the Workman et al., pre-print (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/459529v1). Importantly, in this context, the tool was tested on a set of RNA substrates with poly(A) tails of known lengths. Workman et al. state:</p><p>“These datasets consisted of ionic current traces for synthetic <italic>S. cerevisiaeS. cerevisiae</italic> enolase transcripts appended with 3′ poly(A) tails of 10, 15, 30, 60, 80 or 100 nucleotides”</p><p>The analysis of this set of standards with known poly(A) tail lengths in the Workman et al. study reports:</p><p>“Median estimates fell within 4 nucleotides of the expected tail length for the 10-to-80 poly(A) datasets; for the 100 nt dataset, the median estimate was 109 nt.”</p><p>To examine this question independently, using our own nanopore DRS data, we asked how well nanopolish (polyA) performed in identifying the poly(A) tail of the ERCC spike-ins included in our experiments. According to the manufacturers, most of the spike-ins have a terminal poly(A) stretch of 24 nt, with all spike-in poly(A) tails in the range 20-26 nt. For example, ERCC- 00002 has an expected poly(A) tail length of 24 nt, and the median nanopolish polyA estimate was 23.3 nt (95% confidence intervals [CIs] [5.7, 102], n = 1,485). ERCC-00074 also has an expected poly(A) tail length of 24 nt, and the median nanopore polyA estimate was 27.4 nt (95% CIs [8.9, 118], n = 1,439). We conclude that the median estimated poly(A) tail length by nanopolish (polyA) is similarly accurate to that reported by Workman et al., but with a broad margin of error.</p><p>Text relating to these findings is now included in Results section and these data are now included as Figure 2—figure supplement 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) 75% of the author's adapter ligated library failed to align to the transcriptome. The authors should look into the failed reads to explain why this is so.</p></disp-quote><p>This finding is explained by the relatively low amount of input RNA used in the corresponding sequencing runs. In our standard nanopore DRS experiments we used 1,000ng of poly(A+) RNA for input libraries loaded onto the MinION flowcell. However, the recovery of RNA after cap capture was less than 250ng. This reduction in sample RNA has two consequences:</p><p>First, relatively low amounts of input RNA reduces the ratio of the sample RNA to ONT’s internal standard RNA (yeast Enolase II [ENOII]). As a result, an order of magnitude more reads (11-20%) map to Enolase II in the adapter ligated samples compared to our standard nanopore DRS samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><p>Second, low input RNA results in low pore occupancy and “noise reads” consisting of signal from empty pores<sup>1,2</sup>. Consistent with this, the remaining unmapped reads are very short (75% of unmapped reads are 100 nt or less in length) and of low quality (98% of unmapped reads which are 100 nt or less in length have a median per-base quality score of 7, compared to only 1% of mapped reads) as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>.

Consequently, stronger validation of the new 5’ ends we identify could derive from a more orthogonal approach such as the Illumina-based high throughput 5’ end capture method called nanoPARE published at the end of 2018 by Michael Nodine’s group using Arabidopsis RNA3.</p><p>NanoPARE is able to capture 5’ ends using reverse transcription of RNA with a template switching oligonucleotide (TSO), followed by tagmentation and PCR using TSO and transposase specific primers. PCR products are then sequenced using the IIlumina platform. Template switching using the TSO occurs most often at the 5’ end of the mRNA regardless of whether there is an m7G cap or not. Reads originating from the 5’ end of capped mRNAs can be distinguished from reads from uncapped 5’ ends and internal template switching by the addition of untemplated guanosine at the 5’ end of the read.</p><p>To address whether novel 5’ ends identified by nanopore can be validated with another approach, we downloaded and reanalysed nanoPARE data, focussing on those reads with untemplated guanosine that originate from capped mRNAs. The 5’ ends identified by nanopore DRS at <italic>RCA (AT2G39730</italic>), which agree with both our Illumina RNAseq coverage and the RIKEN RAFL clones, also agree well with the coverage from nanoPARE data (Figure 3E in the revised version of manuscript). Furthermore, the alternative transcriptional start sites identified at <italic>AT1G17050</italic> and <italic>AT5G18650</italic> using nanopore DRS are also clearly visible in the nanoPARE data (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D in the revised version of manuscript).</p><p>We reported in our original submission that 60% of nanopore 5’ ends sequenced using the cap capture protocol were within 13 nt of a transcription start site (TSS) identified using RIKEN RAFL cDNA clones (Figure 3C, left panel, in the revised version of manuscript). We can now also report that 75% of nanopore DRS 5' ends sequenced using cap capture are within 5 nt of a TSS detected using single base resolution peak-calling from nanoPARE reads, and 82% of nanopore DRS 5’ ends are within 13 nt of a TSS (Figure 3C, right panel, in the revised version of manuscript). This closer agreement is presumably due to the higher depth of the nanoPARE compared to RIKEN RAFL dataset, leading to the greater coverage of alternate TSSs.</p><p>This information is now reported in the Results section of the manuscript and the data analysis has been incorporated into the Materials and mmethods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A set of RNAs with known m<sup>6</sup>A sites should be generated to determine the accuracy and sensitivity of the author's method in detecting m<sup>6</sup>A to other available softwares, such as Tombo from Nanopore, as well as other published methods including (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/525741v1).

We selected a 60 nt portion of a human lncRNA (MALAT1) that has been reported to be modified by m<sup>6</sup>A, and for which base-specific validation of the modification had been obtained using the orthogonal technique, SCARLET4. The m<sup>6</sup>A -modified and unmodified RNAs were chemically synthesized by Dharmacon (Horizon Discovery), complete with a poly(A) tail 50 nt in length.

In addition, details of the associated methodology involved have been added to the Materials and methods section.</p><p>The relative evaluation of our nanopore differential error analysis against other approaches detecting m<sup>6</sup>A is not straightforward. No comparable assessment of the accuracy or sensitivity of any of the established m<sup>6</sup>A mapping techniques Me-RIP/ m<sup>6</sup>A -Seq5, mi-CLIP6, MAZTER-Seq7 or EpiNano8 exists. This is partly because no absolute “ground truth” for m<sup>6</sup>A sites exists, aside from individual synthesised RNAs. However, we have addressed this question in the following ways:</p><p>Since our manuscript was reviewed, the EpiNano bioRxiv preprint has been published in <italic>Nature Communications</italic><sup>8</sup>. A distinction from the preprint is that the subsequent publication includes an assessment of EpiNano on biological data i.e. nanopore DRS of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strain SK1 defective in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase, IME4. <italic>S. cerevisiaeS. cerevisiae</italic> mRNAs are methylated during meiosis. Hence, synchronisation of cells is required to have appropriate starting material to detect m<sup>6</sup>A. Data corresponding to 3 biological replicates of the “wild-type” strain (Say841 comprising a deletion of NDT80 to facilitate meiosis synchronization) and 3 biological replicates of the <italic>ime4</italic> mutant strain (Say966 in which both NDT80 and IME4 were deleted) were produced.</p><p>Liu et al.<sup>8</sup> compared the relative performance of EpiNano against TOMBO using m<sup>6</sup>A sites identified by Me-RIP/ m<sup>6</sup>A -seq5 as the “ground truth”. However, while our manuscript was under review, another study was published in <italic>Cell</italic> that used an antibody-independent method called MAZTER-seq7 to map m<sup>6</sup>A. MAZTER-seq uses the enzyme MazF, which cleaves RNA in an ACA sequence context, unless the proximal A is methylated7. The MAZTER-seq study reported a minimal estimate of false positives and false negatives (validated in some cases using SCARLET) in <italic>S. Cerevisiae</italic> Me-RIP/ m<sup>6</sup>A -seq data<sup>5,9</sup>. Consequently, Me-RIP/ m<sup>6</sup>A -seq data does not define an absolute “ground truth”. However, MAZTER-seq does not define an absolute “ground truth” either because only a fraction of <italic>S. Cerevisiae</italic> m<sup>6</sup>A sites are in an ACA context</p><p>The nanopore DRS dataset for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic><sup>8</sup> is smaller than that which we report here for Arabidopsis (3 biological replicates, 2,215,099 read alignments compared to our 4 Arabidopsis biological replicates with 10,364,150 read alignments). Consequently, this smaller dataset likely results in reduced power to detect m<sup>6</sup>A. Furthermore, only basecalled data appears to be publicly available and it is not certain whether data is basecalled using MinKNOW (on which basecaller versions can vary due to auto-updates) or independently using a fixed version of the basecaller. Possibly for these reasons, we detect a large number of false positives in the differential error site approach when using an FDR threshold of 0.05 and log fold change threshold of 1 during analysis of these data. We therefore filtered the data with a more stringent FDR threshold of 10-6, resulting in the detection of 2,294 differential error sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3A</xref>). A de novode novo motif search using MEME at these sites returned the motif RGACWWT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3B</xref>), which resembles very closely the motif identified by Schwartz et al. using MeRIP/ m<sup>6</sup>A -seq5. Application of the identified motif to the sequences underlying error sites using FIMO (FDR &lt; 0.1) identified 555 unique m<sup>6</sup>A motif sites. The most common motifs detected with nanopore DRS are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3C</xref> and included GGACA (34.1%) and AGACA (22.3%).

Me-RIP/ m<sup>6</sup>A -seq peak intervals were increased in length to 50 nt centred around the peak summits downloaded from GEO accession GSE51583. Using the motifs predicted de-novo underneath differential error sites, 11.3% of Me-RIP/ m<sup>6</sup>A -seq sites were recovered with a precision of 22.4% for an F1-score of 0.15.

However, since MAZTER-seq only detects m<sup>6</sup>A in an ACA context (and with spatial resolution constraints from other ACA sites), the majority of mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A sites are undetectable with this approach<sup>7</sup>.</p><p>The limitations of EpiNano may derive from the training data used: RNAs were transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic> in either the presence or absence of m<sup>6</sup>A. As a result, not only are RNAs with methylation profiles that have not been reported in nature used in the training set, but also the most frequently occurring sequence contexts found in nature e.g. AAm<sup>6</sup>ACA are missing from the training data. In order to address these limitations, EpiNano does not incorporate sites with more than one A in the <italic>k-mer</italic>, and so like MAZTER-seq, the majority of m<sup>6</sup>A sites found in mRNA are undetectable using EpiNano.</p><p>When we were characterising the features of the differential error sites we identified in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> nanopore DRS data, we asked if these sites were enriched toward the 3’ end of mRNAs as has been previously reported<sup>5</sup>. We found that this was the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>). However, when we plotted the “ground truth” MeRIP/m6A-seq and MAZTER-seq sites in the same way, we found the profiles to be quite different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>). Strikingly, MeRIP/m6A-seq data was relatively depleted in sites that map closest to RNA 3’ ends. These distinctions may be explained either by different degrees of synchronisation in meiosis in the different studies, analysis-based definition of peaks in Me- RIP/m6A-seq data or from the well-established limitations of Illumina-based fragmentation procedures providing sequence coverage at the 5’ and 3’ extremities of RNA molecules. Whatever the explanation, it reveals the limitations in the field to defining m<sup>6</sup>A ground truths in biological data and hence caveats to the analysis that we could perform.</p><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Smoothed distribution of m<sup>6</sup>A sites detected by different approaches around stop codons in <italic>S</italic>.<italic>cerevisiae</italic> SK1.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49658-resp-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In order to address the final point regarding software changes, we have found that comparing samples that have been sequenced with different generations of ONT sequencing kits or pores, or have been basecalled/mapped with different software can result in false positives.

They should also do deeper analysis to look at the nucleotide composition of the called m<sup>6</sup>A modifications that they capture, as well as whether there is potential bias towards capturing modifications on specific transcripts.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to examine the power of our differential error rate analysis approach at detecting m<sup>6</sup>A sites, we performed a bootstrapped subsampling approach using the nanopore DRS data derived from the synthetic MALAT1 RNAs (described in response to point 4), and example methylated positions in the Arabidopsis transcriptome. This analysis reveals that the ability to detect m<sup>6</sup>A from errors is dependent upon sequencing depth, as well as the fraction of reads which are methylated at the position in the methylation positive example.</p><p>Using the single replicate MALAT1 data, we can reliably detect m<sup>6</sup>A at the correct position in more than 95% of bootstraps using only 60 reads per condition. However, this represents an idealised scenario, as the synthetic reads are 100% unmethylated in one condition and 100% methylated in the other. We therefore also performed an <italic>in silico</italic> &quot;dilution&quot; experiment, where we diluted the bootstrapped sample of methylated reads with unmethylated reads and determined whether m<sup>6</sup>A could still be detected. Here we found that when 50% of reads in the methylation positive condition are sampled from the unmethylated condition, &gt; 200 reads per condition are required to reliably detect m<sup>6</sup>A in &gt; 95% of bootstraps, suggesting that the percentage of reads which are methylated at a position is an important factor in the power to detect differentially methylated sites.</p><p>When performing subsampling experiments using example methylated positions from the Arabidopsis nanopore DRS dataset, we find that the number of reads required to detect m<sup>6</sup>A varies between genes, and between methylated positions in the same gene. This is likely due to differences in the percentage of transcripts that are methylated at each position. We also cannot rule out that sequence context-specific error rates affect the sequencing depth required to detect m<sup>6</sup>A. However, we find that for some positions m<sup>6</sup>A can be reliably detected with as little as 10 reads per replicate (in a 4 replicate per condition experiment) suggesting that it is possible to detect m<sup>6</sup>A robustly at the threshold of a median coverage of 10 reads per replicate used in our original analysis.</p><p>These data have now been incorporated into the Results section of the revised manuscript and included as Figure 5—figure supplement 1E, F.</p><p>In order to address the second point of “a deeper analysis at the nucleotide composition of the called m<sup>6</sup>A modifications”, we examined the reference bases at differential error sites. We find that the error sites are not exclusively located at adenosine positions. This is explained by the fact that 5 RNA bases contribute to the nanopore signal at a particular moment in time. Consequently, the presence of a methylated adenosine in the mRNA can cause basecaller errors anywhere within approximately 5 nt of the methylated adenosine. Hence, detection of m<sup>6</sup>A using differential error rates has a resolution of around 9 nt, and multiple bases surrounding a single modified adenosine may be detected as having a differential error rate. Adenosines account for most error sites (61.3%). However, since m<sup>6</sup>A tends to occur in A rich sub-sequence (the most commonly detected methylated motifs in our dataset were AAm<sup>6</sup>ACA and AAm<sup>6</sup>ACU) it is also possible that this represents a mixture of methylated positions and adenosines surrounding methylated positions.</p><p>We previously characterised the motif that underpinned the differential error sites (Figure 5B in our original submitted manuscript) and detailed the frequency of different sequences matching the motif (Supplementary Figure 5B of our originally submitted manuscript). Notably, the two most frequently occurring motifs that we reported (AAACA and AAACU) match the two most enriched motifs detected in Arabidopsis Me-RIP peaks analysis reported by Chuan He and collaborators<sup>10</sup> and also by Wan et al.<sup>11</sup>. In other words, the most frequently occurring m<sup>6</sup>A motifs we identify with nanopore DRS match those identified for Arabidopsis using orthogonal Me-RIP/m6A seq data produced and analysed by other labs.</p><p>We have included text on this further support to the validity of the approach we used into the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Direct RNA sequencing benefits from the aspect that it is long read, single molecule sequencing. As such, there is the possibility of &quot;phasing&quot; modifications that cannot be performed using short-read sequencing. The authors should show some examples of RNAs with more or less modifications than expected and attempt to associate that with RNA processing to demonstrate the utility of direct RNA sequencing.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the ultimate goal would be to distinguish modifications on a single read originating from an individual transcript molecule. We continue to work on this, with the aim of identifying relationships between m<sup>6</sup>A modification and other RNA processing events. However, at this stage, our method for detecting m<sup>6</sup>A is aggregated across all reads, meaning that true phasing is not possible.</p><p>To address the question posed by the reviewers, we developed an approach to test the relationship between mRNA 3' end position and the error profile of the nanopore DRS reads at detected differential error sites using only the methylated (VIRc) samples. Reads from VIRc samples, which overlapped error sites with identifiable m<sup>6</sup>A motifs detected in the <italic>vir-1</italic> vs VIRc comparison, were clustered by their 3’ position using a kernel density estimate with a σ of 13. Clusters with fewer than 10 reads were discarded. We then compared the error profiles of reads from different clusters at the error site, using a G-test approach, to identify whether different 3’ end positions had different levels of methylation. We identified 327 error sites which were phased with 3’ end position, overlapping 207 annotated genes. 149 (72%) of these genes also display a statistically detectable change in 3’ end position in the <italic>vir-1</italic> mutant compared to VIRc, indicating that the changes in 3’ end position in the <italic>vir-1</italic> mutant may result directly from the loss of m<sup>6</sup>A methylation.

(https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/525741v1). Please clarify the similarities/differences between Liu et al. and the method described in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The general principle of using nanopore Direct RNA Sequencing to identify RNA modifications is shared with that used in the pre-print Liu et al. (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/525741v1), which is now published in <italic>Nature Communications</italic><sup>8</sup>. Liu et al. used aggregated measurements of insertion, deletion, and mismatch frequencies at DRACH (where D=A or G or U, R=A or G, H=A or C or U) <italic>k-mer</italic>s, from RNAs transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic> using either ATP or m<sup>6</sup>ATP, to train a support vector machine model to classify methylated and unmethylated positions. There are several important similarities and distinctions between this methodology and our own:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The models produced by Liu et al.<sup>8</sup>, once trained on positive and negative examples, should be able to predict m<sup>6</sup>A in a normal sample without controls. In contrast, our method relies upon comparison between samples with methylation and reduced methylation controls.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Like our method, the model produced by Liu et al.<sup>8</sup> makes predictions for reference positions and cannot identify the presence or absence of m<sup>6</sup>A in individual reads.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The models produced by Liu et al.<sup>8</sup> should detect methylated positions in the analysed transcriptome independently of the writer complex or enzyme which catalyses the methylation. By contrast, our method, when using a mutant with reduced methylation such as <italic>vir-1</italic>, will only detect methylation sites which are lost in the mutant, e.g. VIR-dependent m<sup>6</sup>A sites.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The models produced by Liu et al.<sup>8</sup> rely on the prior knowledge of the DRACH motif to detect m<sup>6</sup>A, meaning that any modifications in other contexts will not be detected. In contrast, our method takes an unbiased statistical comparison approach to detecting m<sup>6</sup>A and is therefore sequence agnostic. We find that 4.8% of detected Arabidopsis m<sup>6</sup>A motifs are in the context AGAUU (Supplementary Figure 5B in our originally submitted manuscript), and 9.55% of detected yeast m<sup>6</sup>A motifs are in the context DGACG (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>) indicating that the prior assumption of the DRACH motif will lead to false negatives.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The data used to train the model from Liu et al.<sup>8</sup> is produced entirely from <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNAs. This imposes limitations to this approach:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNAs will not contain other known RNA modifications (see https://mods.rna.albany.edu for a comprehensive list). These modifications are also likely to cause basecalling errors, which the machine learning model has not been exposed to. This means that when the model is applied to biological samples and encounters errors caused by alternative modifications, it may behave unexpectedly, e.g. by calling them as m<sup>6</sup>A. Our method is unlikely to incorrectly flag other RNA modifications as m<sup>6</sup>A, unless the mutant used as a negative control alters the pattern of these modifications in RNA.</p></list-item></list></list-item></list><p>Because the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNAs contain 100% methylated or 100% unmethylated adenosines only, biologically important <italic>k-mer</italic>s with mixtures of A and m<sup>6</sup>A, such as AAm<sup>6</sup>ACA or AAm<sup>6</sup>ACU, are not sampled. Liu et al.<sup>8</sup> acknowledge this and therefore do not make predictions in 5mer contexts with more than one A. However, by our estimates this would lead to the failure to detect 92% of m<sup>6</sup>A sites we detected in Arabidopsis, and 76.6% of m<sup>6</sup>A sites we detected in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> SK1. The two most frequently occurring motifs that we report in Arabidopsis (AAm<sup>6</sup>ACA and AAm<sup>6</sup>ACU) match the two most enriched motifs detected in Arabidopsis Me-RIP peaks analysis reported by Chuan He and collaborators<sup>10</sup> and also by Wan et al.<sup>11</sup>, providing orthogonal support for these estimates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Base-calling error profiles can vary depending on the basecaller version, the model in the basecaller, the processing/filtering parameters used for running the basecaller, the pore protein version, and the motor protein version. Recently, there was a huge upgrade for the basecalling model (high-accuracy model, a.k.a. flip-flop basecaller) introduced in Guppy 3.2. Moreover, according to the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), a faster motor protein and the new R10 pore will be introduced to their DRS kits very soon. The authors need to clarify and inform the readers that the error profile presented here may change depending on the basecaller software, a model, a pore, and a motor protein.</p><p>The method described in this manuscript can work in the specific combinations that the authors used, but it does not guarantee its performance in the other settings. Considering the change in the flagship basecaller, Guppy, with higher accuracy after the version used in the manuscript, the authors need to check if this method works with comparable accuracy with the newer Guppy.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point, namely that there are many variables controlling the error profiles of nanopore DRS reads. Indeed, we have found that comparing samples that have been sequenced with different kits or pores, or have been basecalled/mapped with different software can result in large numbers of false positives. We have therefore restricted analysis to samples that were sequenced with comparable kits, pores and used the same pipeline, tools, and parameters for basecalling and mapping of all samples.</p><p>In order to address the reviewers comment that the newest versions of ONT's basecaller, Guppy, may not be able to be used in conjunction with error rate analysis to detect m<sup>6</sup>A, we re-basecalled the data derived from the sequencing of the synthetic MALAT1 RNA using Guppy version 3.2.4. This version uses the so-called &quot;flip-flop&quot; approach to achieve higher accuracy. Using this basecaller, we found that there were still statistically detectable changes in error profile at the synthetically modified m<sup>6</sup>A site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig6">Author response image 6</xref>).</p><p>ONT sequencing and data analysis continues to evolve. Indeed, in the time since the reviewer made this comment ONT have announced another improvement to the basecaller using run length encoding, which may replace the flip-flop models implemented in Guppy in the near future.</p><p>However, our experience with machine learning models leads us to believe that so long as ONT do not explicitly train their models to identify m<sup>6</sup>A, it is likely to remain a source of errors in base- calling. This is because machine learning models typically do not generalise well outside the bounds of the data they are trained on. Even if the training datasets do include unlabelled examples of m<sup>6</sup>A, due to the extreme imbalance of m<sup>6</sup>A and A, they are unlikely to be well modelled by the basecaller.</p><p>We have included text to reflect this in a new Discussion section of the manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig6"><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>Comparison of differential error rate analysis in MALAT1 data using older (3.1.2) and newer (3.2.4) Guppy releases.</title><p>Gene track showing the change in the per- reference base test statistic attained when comparing methylated and unmethylated synthetic MALAT1 fragments basecalled using Guppy 3.1.2, which uses recurrent neural network basecalling, and Guppy 3.2.4, which uses recurrent neural network basecalling with a flip-flop architecture.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49658-resp-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In addition, Tombo from the ONT has a mode called &quot;level_sample_compare&quot; that enables the modified base detection by comparing control and experiment groups.

The authors suggested that EpiNano had an increased precision over Tombo, but recovered fewer ground truth sites<sup>7</sup>. We understand that ONT is no longer supporting the further development of Tombo and are instead focussing on the development of a new tool called Megalodon for modification detection. However, this tool does not yet have support for RNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “Nanopore DRS confirms sites of RNA 3′ end formation and estimates poly(A) tail length”: The standard nanopore DRS library preparation uses the double-stranded RNA-DNA ligation assisted by an oligo(dT) splint. It inevitably introduces a substantial underrepresentation of short poly(A) tails. Even 10 nt oligo(dT) splint often results in a strong bias for &gt; 20 nt poly(A) tails against the shorter tails. Moreover, short poly(A) tails often carry additional U tails which interfere with the ligation to the adapter. In addition, the means of the single-read &quot;poly(A) length measurements&quot; may not be a suitable summarization to estimate the means of &quot;poly(A) lengths.&quot; Nanopolish gives the best approximations of poly(A) lengths at a single-read level. However, as the poly(A) dwell time roughly follows a gamma distribution with a long tail, the mean of the best approximations at a single-read level systematically overestimates the mean of poly(A) length.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes very good points and we thank them for their informed insight. We have revised our wording in the manuscript text to refer to the poly(A) length of the sequenced reads rather than Arabidopsis poly(A) tail length. In addition, we have changed our data analysis and edited our text to use the median rather than the mean in these contexts. In addition we have included mention of the impact of short poly(A) tails and uridylated tails might have on quantitative gene expression analysis using the current standard nanopore DRS procedure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “Cap-dependent 5′ RNA detection by nanopore DRS”: The authors used RNA ligase 1 to mark the 5′ ends of RNAs. Due to the substrate specificity of this enzyme, circularized mRNAs and mRNA-mRNA concatamers might have been produced.</p></disp-quote><p>We first investigated whether mRNA-mRNA concatemers were produced in the cap-capture datasets. In our submitted manuscript, we indicated the presence of “over-splitting” of read signal in our DRS datasets, caused by the misinterpretation of signal originating from a single RNA molecule as two molecules. Given that over-splitting can occur, we suggest that “under-splitting” of signal that originates from two unique molecules sequenced consecutively through the same pore may also occur. These will generally be less problematic than over-splitting events, as the chances of under- splitting occurring with two transcripts that have been transcribed from adjacent genomic loci is very low, meaning that they will seldom lead to misidentification of chimeric RNAs. Once base- called, however, these under-split reads would be indistinguishable from physically concatemerized mRNAs catalysed by RNA ligase 1. To identify whether under-splitting occurs in all of our datasets, and whether RNA ligase 1-catalysed concatemers occur in our adapter ligated datasets, we extracted soft-clipped regions from the 5’ and 3’ ends of read alignments to the TAIR10 reference, and remapped them to determine what percentage were alignable to the genome. We found that the percentages of alignable softclipped regions were consistently low in both adapter ligation negative and positive datasets (between 0.04 and 0.27% overall for all experiments), suggesting that the low levels of spurious concatemers are likely to be <italic>in silico</italic> under-splitting errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig7">Author response image 7</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig7"><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><title>Prevalence of concatemerised reads in nanopore DRS data.</title><p>Barplot showing the percentage of read alignments in nanopore DRS data where softclipped regions (i.e. unmapped sequence at 5’ and 3’ ends of alignments) which is mappable elsewhere in the TAIR10 genome, possibly indicating undersplitting of read signal by the MinKNOW software.

The authors only show the analyses using the population-level detection of m<sup>6</sup>A -modified sites. A real benefit of nanopore DRS lies in the associative analyses at a single-read level. Is it possible to use the DRS method to call m<sup>6</sup>A -modified sites within single molecules and analyze to see if a modified RNA has different polyadenylation status or 3′ end position from those in an unmodified RNA?</p></disp-quote><p>Whilst approaching this question we discovered an error in our miCLIP analysis pipeline that meant that the results from the irreproducible rate analysis were not thresholded correctly. Upon correcting this mistake we found that because replicate 3 of our miCLIP experiment was less well correlated with replicates 1 and 2 (spearman's rho 0.54 for replicates 1 vs. 2, 93,046 reproducible sites, spearman's rho 0.42 for replicates 1 vs. 3, 12,777 reproducible sites, spearman's rho 0.47 for replicates 2 vs. 3, 19,948 reproducible sites), it was reducing the quality of the results, and decided to exclude it from the downstream analysis. This has altered our analysis and some results slightly. The Materials and methods and Results sections of the manuscript have been updated accordingly.</p><p>We now find that 65.7% of nanopore error sites are within 5 nt of an miCLIP site detected in two replicates at IDR &lt; 0.05 (Figure 5E, 5F in the revised version of manuscript). Conversely, 31.2% of miCLIP peaks are within 5 nt of an error site detected with nanopore DRS. This is likely because miCLIP is a more sensitive but less precise technique (i.e. has antibody-dependent limitations) than nanopore DRS for mapping m<sup>6</sup>A: we detected 93 thousand significant miCLIP sites compared to only 17 thousand nanopore differential error sites. Furthermore, miCLIP can detect a wider range of methylated adenosines in the transcriptome. Here we report a differential error rate method capable of detecting m<sup>6</sup>A sites dependent on VIR, in poly(A+) RNA. m<sup>6</sup>A sites in poly- or oligo- adenylated RNAs, which are detectable by miCLIP, but which are methylated by other enzymes or writer complexes are not detected by our experimental approach.</p><p>We address the issues regarding single molecule detection and phasing in the Essential Revisions section Point 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I feel that the current discoveries related to m<sup>6</sup>A modification in this manuscript can be better done using miCLIP than nanopore DRS.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify, we carried out 3 biological replicates of miCLIP in this study using wild type <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Col-0 poly(A)+ RNA. Consequently, in addition to our nanopore DRS datasets, we provide here the first miCLIP-based map of m<sup>6</sup>A in any plant species. Compared to the read depth of our current nanopore DRS datasets, our miCLIP data does indeed detect more significant sites using the statistical approach described.</p><p>However, antibody-based approaches to mapping m<sup>6</sup>A, such as miCLIP, are limited in some respects because (i) they cannot readily define stoichiometry (ii) they do not necessarily detect m<sup>6</sup>A only (iii) they have unclear sensitivity. These limitations account, in part, for the recent high-profile publication of the MAZTER-Seq procedure (published while our manuscript was in review) as an antibody-independent approach to mapping m<sup>6</sup>A that addresses these issues (albeit for a sub-set of sequence contexts)<sup>7</sup>.</p><p>The overlap of miCLIP sites mapped in different studies is low. Examination of 81,519 sites identified across six different published miCLIP experiments in human cell lines revealed a median of only 1,500 sites shared between any two datasets<sup>7</sup>. This appears to be explained by sites modified at low stoichiometries that are stochastically identified in one miCLIP experiment, but not another, due to the low efficiency of UV cross-linking<sup>7</sup>.</p><p>We used miCLIP as an orthogonal technique here, using only wild-type material. Although we detect enrichment of miCLIP sites in 3’UTRs (Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 1D in the revised version of manuscript), the consensus sequence associated with miCLIP is oligo(A) – indicating either the identification of sites distinct from those written by the mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex, or cross- hybridisation of the antibody to epitopes other than m<sup>6</sup>A. We used the Synaptic Systems anti-m<sup>6</sup>A antibody for miCLIP studies because it is widely used in the field and because the errors induced in miCLIP sequencing libraries had already been established<sup>6</sup>. However, it has also previously been shown that this antibody cross-reacts with non-methylated purine-rich RNA sequences<sup>5</sup>, highlighting limitations to this approach.</p><p>We use nanopore DRS datasets to link m<sup>6</sup>A to changes in RNA abundance and processing (specifically in relation to 3’ end processing), in the same experiment. For an miCLIP-only approach to provide the same insight, further analysis would be required, such as (i) control procedures for mapping m<sup>6</sup>A sites in a methylation defective mutant that are not yet routinely established or accepted, (ii) different datasets of RNAseq to investigate changes in RNA levels, (iii) further datasets of specialised RNAseq to map 3’ ends (eg 3P-Seq<sup>12</sup>), (iv) since we demonstrate that some of the changes in pre-mRNA processing in the absence of VIRILIZER-dependent m<sup>6</sup>A (chimeric RNAs, for example) are distinct from events annotated in TAIR10, Araport11 and AtRTD2, long read sequencing of the <italic>vir-1</italic> transcriptome with PacBio, for example, would be necessary to establish an appropriate Reference Transcriptome to be used to quantify the different de novoRNA processing events identified in this study. Overall, nanopore DRS can give m<sup>6</sup>A positions in the context of full- length RNA reads which can be used for other analyses, but miCLIP cannot.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] The authors use cap-dependent ligation to enrich for capped mRNAs, reducing the 3' end bias observed in DRS. It would be of interest to discuss if the transcripts with early 5' ends result from technical artifacts (for example, degradation during RNA preparation) or represent transcripts present in the cell that lack a cap structure that is compatible with the ligation protocol. For example, the authors demonstrate that nanopore DRS can identify rare anti-sense transcripts. Could transcripts with early 5' ends, which are selected against in the cap dependent libraries, represent rare transcripts or degradation intermediary products?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their insightful comment. We had considered it difficult to clearly distinguish what might be biology from what might be experimental induced RNA decay aside from our RNA quality control measures. Consequently, we focused instead on capturing RNAs that did have a 5’ cap to establish which RNAs were full-length, by at least this criterion. However, in response to the reviewer's question, we looked at this in more detail.</p><p>To address what might be biology-dependent decay in the datasets that we had, we asked if there was an enrichment of 5’ nanopore DRS reads terminating in proximity to established miRNA cleavage sites in our datasets prepared without cap capture. We approached this question in a similar way to that used by Michael Nodine’s recent study using Illumina nanoPARE data<sup>3</sup>. Target sites for known Arabidopsis small (s)RNAs (miRNAs, tasiRNAs) in protein coding transcripts were predicted using GSTAr. To prevent false positives caused by poor alignments and full-length mRNAs, target sites spanning introns and in 5'UTRs were filtered out. For each putative target site, the number of nanopore DRS reads terminating in a 20 nt region upstream and downstream of the cleavage site was calculated and used to produce an enrichment score for reads terminating immediately downstream of the site. This method was used instead of measuring 5' ends precisely at the cleavage site, because as we demonstrated in our study, approximately 11 nt are lost from the 5' end of RNA reads in standard nanopore DRS. Enrichment scores and Allen scores for sRNA-target alignments were tested for significance using the same permutation testing method as in Schon et al.<sup>3</sup> sRNA sequences were shuffled 1,000 times and target sites for shuffled sequences were predicted. Null distributions for Allen scores and enrichments scores were then produced and used to generate <italic>p</italic> values for significance. Enrichment and Allen score <italic>p</italic> values were combined using Fisher's method and multiple testing correction was applied.</p><p>Using this approach, we were able to identify peaks of downstream cleavage products in a number of well-established target mRNA-miRNA interactions. For example, at mRNA encoding HAM1 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1H in the revised version of manuscript) and HAM2 (miR170/miR171); NAC1 (miR164); ARF proteins (miR160); and SPL domain containing proteins (miR156/7). Nanopore DRS reads aligning to the non-protein coding <italic>TAS</italic> genes also reveal clear evidence of established cleavage products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig8">Author response image 8</xref>). The full list of identified miRNA targets identified in nanopore is now included in the manuscript as Supplementary file 4.</p><fig id="respfig8"><label>Author response image 8.</label><caption><title>Nanopore DRS captures downstream products of miRNA cleavage at transcripts encoded by TAS genes.</title><p>Orange, 5’ coverage from capped nanoPARE reads; purple, 5’ coverage from uncapped nanoPARE reads; blue, nanopore DRS 5’ coverage; black miRNA target site alignment; black, Araport11 annotation.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49658-resp-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We conclude that, in principle, nanopore DRS can be used to reveal sites of internal mRNA (and <italic>TAS</italic> ncRNA) cleavage and we thank the reviewer for making this suggestion. Since we have shown that nanopore DRS does not sequence the extreme 5’ end of an RNA accurately, the ideal way to address this question in the future would be to compare adapter ligated libraries that were cap-dependent with those that were cap-independent in a conceptually similar approach to that used in Michael Nodine’s nanoPARE study<sup>3</sup>. In addition, the use of mutants defective in the Arabidopsis cytoplasmic 5’-3’ exonuclease XRN4 would be useful in revealing degradation intermediary products that are otherwise too unstable to be readily detected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the authors leverage DRS to expand the set of annotated transcripts and splicing isoforms. Can the authors use this data to describe new endogenous targets of NMD, poison exons, or find examples of proteins with new functional domains?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, our study suggests that nanopore DRS can provide a useful complementary approach to revealing new details of the Arabidopsis transcriptome. Consequently, this approach can be used in the analysis of the sequence features listed by the reviewer and possibly others too (e.g. identifying uORFs).</p><p>We can, for example, identify well-established examples of cassette exons, and alternative donor and acceptor sites which are known to be targets of the NMD pathway as indicated by upregulation in <italic>upf1</italic> mutants<sup>13</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="resptable3">Author response table 3</xref>). This includes, for example, mRNA encoding the splicing factor SR34a, in which inclusion of a cassette exon in the first intron has been suggested to introduce a destabilising uORF<sup>13</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="resptable3">Author response table 3</xref>). We also identified further examples of unannotated alternative splice isoforms which may introduce frameshifts, such as an exon skipping event at mRNA encoding the KH domain- containing protein AT5G56140 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C in the revised version of manuscript), and an alternative acceptor site at <italic>XRCC</italic> mRNA (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D in the revised version of manuscript), establishing the principle that nanopore DRS can be used to identify novel alternative splicing products which may be targets of NMD. We suggest that the best way to study these phenomena in the future would be to use biological material with genotypes that disrupt the processes of interest in order to provide a means to validate the events under study. For example, sequencing an NMD mutant such as <italic>upf1,</italic> as was previously done with Illumina RNAseq, would validate the discovery of potential new NMD substrates.</p><table-wrap id="resptable3" position="float"><label>Author response table 3.</label><caption><title>Known <italic>upf1</italic> sensitive alternative splicing events which are supported by nanopore DRS read alignments.</title><p>Table showing examples of NMD sensitive alternative splicing events taken from Table 1 of Kalyna et al.<sup>13</sup> which are supported by nanopore DRS reads.

For example, PTM is a plant homeodomain transcription factor with C-terminal transmembrane domains that sequester it to the chloroplast. PTM is cleaved from the membrane in high light conditions and the N-terminal fragment translocates to the nucleus, where it acts as a retrograde transcription factor positively regulating flowering through the control of <italic>FLC</italic><sup>14</sup>. We find that alternative polyadenylation in intron 10 of <italic>PTM</italic> mRNA is common and produces transcripts with a truncated open reading frame which removes the C-terminal transmembrane domains (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D in the revised version of manuscript). Translation of these APA transcripts would be predicted to produce transcription factors which have similar activity to the cleaved N-terminal fragment generated from full length PTM. Consequently, regulation of this APA site may provide an alternative mechanism for the production of active PTM that bypasses the retrograde signalling pathway.</p><p>This finding is now included in the Results section related to RNA 3’ end detection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One feature of the transcriptome the authors focus on is the localization and effect of m<sup>6</sup>A modification on RNA metabolism.

These findings were reported in Figure 6E of our originally submitted manuscript. In addition, our analysis of phasing, described in Essential Revisions section Point 6, revealed a clear directional shift to more proximal poly(A) site selection in transcript isoforms detected from the same gene in m<sup>6</sup>A defective mutant backgrounds compared to complemented line VIRc (see Figure 7C in the revised version of manuscript).</p><p>We have now also addressed this question in an orthogonal manner. We used the DaPars<sup>15</sup> algorithm which is designed to detect shifts in RNA 3’ end formation in Illumina RNAseq data. We used our Illumina RNAseq datasets that we carried out in parallel to nanopore DRS, comparing the <italic>vir-1</italic> mutant with the VIR complemented line. We find that DaPars analysis also identifies a global shortening of 3'UTRs in the <italic>vir-1</italic> mutant (Figure 7—figure supplement 1B in the revised version of manuscript).</p><p>We have incorporated the DaPars analysis (and the phasing analysis) into our revised manuscript.</p><p>Our interpretation is that there is not yet a clear consensus on all the possible interrelationships between m<sup>6</sup>A and 3’ end formation in published mammalian cell studies. For example, Ke et al.<sup>16</sup>, reported that dense methylation was associated with an inhibition of proximal poly(A) site selection and the use of more distal poly(A) sites. Therefore, our findings are consistent with the suggestion made by Ke et al.<sup>16</sup> that m<sup>6</sup>A could inhibit the use of proximal sites and hence favour longer 3’UTR transcript isoforms of the same gene. Moline et al. state the following in the Discussion of their publication:</p><p>“A recent study reported that genes with longer last exons have a higher density of m<sup>6</sup>A peaks. Consistent with this observation, we found that m<sup>6</sup>A levels of genes are positively correlated with maximum 3′-UTR lengths as measured in input steady-state RNAseq data (Supplementary Figure 5E). Detailed analyses showed that genes with higher proximal APA usage in the m<sup>6</sup>A-positive fraction (P/D; m<sup>6</sup>A+ &gt; m<sup>6</sup>A−) had significantly longer 3′UTRs (Supplementary Figure 5F) and lower ratios of proximal versus distal signals (Supplementary Figure 5G,H) in the input RNAseq data as compared to genes with higher distal APA usage in the m<sup>6</sup>A-positive fraction (P/D; m<sup>6</sup>A+ &lt; m<sup>6</sup>A−) or no change in APA usage between fractions (P/D; m<sup>6</sup>A+ = m<sup>6</sup>A−).”</p><p>The further analysis of 3’ end formation prompted by this reviewer’s question and the phasing analysis requested in Essential revisions point 6 led us to look more closely at the shift in 3’ formation. When we plotted the position of the most-frequently occurring motifs at differential error sites and the poly(A) signal AAUAAA (and single nucleotide variants) we detected a close overlap in position (Figure 7E in the revised version of manuscript). We have included this new finding into the Results section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, can the authors comment on the ability of detecting modifications other than m<sup>6</sup>A through DRS?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not yet examined other RNA modifications.
