Although recent studies have suggested positive effects of electrical stimulation for memory enhancement, its potential targets remain largely unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that spatially targeted deep brain stimulation of ventromedial prefrontal cortex enhanced memory functions in a middle-aged rat model. Our results show that acute stimulation enhanced the short-, but not the long-term memory in the novel-object recognition task. Interestingly, after chronic high-frequency stimulation, both the short- and long-term memories were robustly improved in the novel-object recognition test and Morris water-maze spatial task compared to sham. Our results also demonstrated that chronic ventromedial prefrontal cortex high-frequency stimulation upregulated neurogenesis-associated genes along with enhanced hippocampal cell proliferation. Importantly, these memory behaviors were strongly correlated with the hippocampal neurogenesis. Overall, these findings suggest that chronic ventromedial prefrontal cortex high-frequency stimulation may serve as a novel effective therapeutic target for dementia-related disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04803.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04803.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04803.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Memory loss in older people is a serious and widespread problem that affects up to 50% of those over the age of 85. It is a key symptom of dementia, but despite the growing impact of this disease on society, there are no treatments currently available that can effectively stop or delay the progression of the symptoms.</p><p>One therapy that may reduce memory loss is called deep brain stimulation. Electrodes are implanted into the brain and used to stimulate brain cells in particular areas of the brain to alter mental and emotional processes. Deep brain stimulation is already used to treat Parkinson's disease, depression and other conditions that affect how the brain works.</p><p>Liu et al. studied the effect of deep brain stimulation on memory in rats. The experiments show that middle-aged rats performed less well in short- and long-term memory tests than young rats. Next, Liu et al. investigated whether deep brain stimulation could improve memory in the middle-aged rats. The electrodes were positioned to stimulate a region near the front of the brain called the ‘ventromedial prefrontal cortex’; this region is important for the formation and recall of memories. Liu et al. then gave the rats a series of memory tasks that tested their recall after 90 minutes (to test their short-term memory), and after 24 hours (to test long-term memory).</p><p>The experiments reveal that a brief stimulation of brain cells in this region of the brain improved the rats' short-term memory, but not their long-term memory. However, more sustained stimulation of this region of the brain improved both the short-term and long-term memory of the rats. Furthermore, deep brain stimulation led to the formation of new brain cells in another region of the brain called the hippocampus, which is also involved in memory. The hippocampus had not been in direct contact with the electrodes so the increase in brain cells was due to its connections with the stimulated ventromedial prefrontal cortex.</p><p>Liu et al.'s findings suggest that deep brain stimulation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex has the potential to be developed into a therapy to treat dementia and other conditions that lead to memory loss in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04803.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04803.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>deep brain stimulation</kwd><kwd>learning and memory</kwd><kwd>ventromedial prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001475</institution-id><institution>Nanyang Technological University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lee Kuan Yew Research Fellowship (M4080846.080)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Lee Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High-frequency stimulation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which enhances memory and hippocampal neurogenesis, is a novel target for treatment of dementia-related diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Memory loss is the key symptom of dementia-related disorders along with impaired cognitive functioning such as language or reasoning. It is usually caused by Alzheimer's disease and other age-related dementia. Its prevalence doubles from a low rate in 60–64 age group to 40–50% of those older than 85 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lobo et al., 2000</xref>). Dementia is a progressive disease, which has a detrimental impact on the quality of life for patients. To date, pharmacological treatments for dementia have limited effects and there are no known treatments that cure or delay the progression of this memory impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doody et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Salloway et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, a novel non-pharmacological approach such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently considered as an alternative treatment to reduce the symptomatic and progression of this memory deterioration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hescham et al., 2013a</xref>).</p><p>DBS, a technique of minimally invasive surgical implantation of electrodes with delivering of electrical impulses into the brain, has been demonstrated to control a wide range of neurological disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sesia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Temel et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Temel and Lim, 2013</xref>). In line with these developments, evidence from recent studies suggests that DBS might enhance memory functions when particular brain areas are stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hamani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laxton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Suthana et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hescham et al., 2013b</xref>). Of particular interest, DBS of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex or the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) induced striking antidepressant activity in both patients and animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mayberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lozano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamani et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kennedy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Temel and Lim, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lim et al., 2015b</xref>). Despite encouraging results, no studies have shown the putative role of vmPFC DBS in learning and memory performance. In the realm of cognitive function, there is empirical evidence indicating that vmPFC plays an important role in the formation, consolidation, and retrieval of memory, as well as reward and decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maviel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Euston et al., 2012</xref>). Based on the human imaging and rodent studies, the vmPFC was significantly activated during the recall of remote memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bontempi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Takashima et al., 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gais et al., 2007</xref>), while its inactivation caused memory impairment when tested in the radial arm-maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maviel et al., 2004</xref>), the Morris water-maze (MWM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Teixeira et al., 2006</xref>), and the contextual fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frankland et al., 2004</xref>). In line with these studies, malfunctioning has also been reported in the hippocampus and the vmPFC (which received robust projections from the hippocampal formation) in early stages of Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and healthy aging-related memory impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Salat et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lindberg et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Given the potential mechanisms involved by DBS including the increase of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ying et al., 2012</xref>) and neurogenesis-related functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Toda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kadar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stone et al., 2011</xref>), we tested the hypothesis that vmPFC DBS-enhanced memory function by modulating the hippocampal neurogenic activity in the middle-aged rat model with aging-related memory impairment. The use of this animal model was supported by previous data that showed aged-related deficits in both the memory and the hippocampal functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rex et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaczorowski and Disterhoft, 2009</xref>). In acute DBS, animals were tested with either high- or low-frequency stimulation (HFS or LFS) at various amplitudes using the conventional novel-object recognition (NOR) test. Subsequently, another set of animals was used to assess the chronic stimulation effects on memory enhancement using the NOR and the MWM tests. For investigation of the underlying mechanism, we analyzed the effects of chronic stimulation on the molecular and cellular levels of hippocampal neurogenesis-related functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Memory deficits in middle-aged rats</title><p>Progressive age-related memory decline has been previously described for human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davis et al., 2003</xref>) and animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sloane et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ward et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaczorowski and Disterhoft, 2009</xref>).

We next conducted electrical stimulation in this animal model of memory deficit, using HFS and LFS with various stimulation current intensities in the NOR test. Our results showed that HFS at 200 μA and LFS at 50, 200, and 400 μA significantly enhanced the memory functions in the short-, but not the long-term memory retention interval when compared to the sham. We next carried out chronic stimulation in this middle-aged rat model. We hypothesized that chronic stimulation would increase both the short- and long-term memory functions via a mechanism of enhanced hippocampal neuroplasticity. Previous studies have shown that memory deficits were partly due to the disruption of the hippocampal neuroplasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deupree et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rex et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, our hypothesis was driven by findings that DBS in various brain targets increased BDNF level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ying et al., 2012</xref>) and enhanced neurogenesis-related functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Toda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kadar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stone et al., 2011</xref>) in the hippocampus. Further, this hypothesis was also supported by the fact that the increased BDNF level and neurogenesis function in the hippocampus were strongly correlated with the hippocampal-dependent memory tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drapeau et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erickson et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, after chronic stimulation, we found significant improvement in both the short- and long-term memories in the NOR test, as well as the spatial memory performances during the MWM task as compared to the sham.</p><p>In the acute stimulation experiment, we found that the behavioral effects of vmPFC stimulation were dependent on the stimulation frequency and current intensity. Although these findings are consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamani et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hescham et al., 2013b</xref>), the mechanisms of the stimulation parameter dependency in regulation of memory functions remain largely obscure. Nonetheless, it is postulated that the neurons in the vmPFC are highly sensitive to specific stimulation settings for induction of either long-term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD). This notion was highly supported by the findings in which the vmPFC synapses are potentially vulnerable to LTP or LTD strengthening after specific type of stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herry and Garcia, 2002</xref>). It has been found that the prefrontal cortex neurons could undergo LTP with rapid and stable potentiation in the prelimbic synapses after high-frequency tetanic stimulation of the hippocampal CA1/subicular region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laroche et al., 1990</xref>). Such a LTP-like plasticity in the vmPFC after hippocampal HFS has been shown to be dependent on α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor, which indicates a crucial role for the synaptic potentiation in the hippocampal-vmPFC pathway in rapid memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laroche et al., 2000</xref>). Although HFS and LFS at specific amplitudes were effective for memory enhancement, it is noteworthy that LFS induced negative effects on the anxiety-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lim et al., 2015b</xref>). Furthermore, HFS of the vmPFC has been shown to reduce conditioned fear and enhance the extinction of aversive memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Milad and Quirk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Milad et al., 2004</xref>), in contrast to LFS, which induced impairment in extinction of conditioned fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shehadi and Maroun, 2012</xref>). Since previous studies of vmPFC HFS produced robust antidepressant-like behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lim et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2015b</xref>), we therefore applied this stimulation parameter in the chronic stimulation experiment to test the hypothesis that it would restore the memory deficits for both the short- and long-term memory functions of the middle-aged rats.</p><p>As might be expected for the effects after chronic stimulation, there was an improvement on memory function in the short- but not the long-term memory retention interval when the animals were tested with no-HFS prior to the NOR task. Strikingly, we found a remarkable reversal of memory deficits in both the short- and long-term memory of the animals that received HFS prior to the NOR test as compared to the non-stimulated sham. Congruently, chronic vmPFC HFS significantly improved the spatial navigation performances when conducted in a hippocampal-dependent memory MWM test. In the present data, we clearly distinguished a role for the vmPFC in regulation of both the short- and long-term memory functions. In most studies, short-term memory is generally regarded as memory spanning from seconds to several minutes or hours, while long-term memory is usually last from hours to several days or longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nagai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Euston et al., 2012</xref>). Albeit many studies have indicated that vmPFC is involved in the expression of long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maviel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Teixeira et al., 2006</xref>), there are also findings supporting that vmPFC is involved in consolidation and retrieval of recently acquired memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blum et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leon et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the vmPFC HFS potentiated the initial hippocampal encoding during the acquisition phase, which was then followed by enhanced retrieval during the short- and long-term memory recalls. Taken together, these findings further implicate a specific role for the vmPFC HFS in facilitation of rapid consolidation and retrieval of the short- and long-term memory processes in the hippocampus.</p><p>HFS of the vmPFC has not only been demonstrated for memory enhancement in the middle-aged memory deficit rat model, but also induced profound antidepressant-like behaviors in the experimental animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lim et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2015b</xref>). Interestingly, the effects of memory improvement by vmPFC HFS, as characterized by the increased novelty seeking in the NOR and MWM tasks, were highly associated with the stimulation effects on reduction in anxiety behavior. These results confirm previous findings that animals with lower anxiety or fear level displayed higher novelty seeking behavior, particularly in the elevated plus-maze and light–dark box tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kabbaj et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stead et al., 2006</xref>). In consistent with the data found in the animal model of depression, rats undergoing chronic stress exhibited anxious and low exploratory behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lim et al., 2015b</xref>), as well as impairment in spatial memory task performances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conrad et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beck and Luine, 1999</xref>). Apparently, chronic stress produces pathological alterations on the molecular and morphological levels in the hippocampus that is involved in the regulation of both the spatial memory formation and emotional behaviors. Thus, our experiments found that the memory enhancement effect is likely to be accompanied by the vmPFC DBS-induced anxiolytic effects via the mechanisms of neurogenesis and dendritic remodeling in the hippocampal neurons.</p><p>Given the prominent anatomical connectivity between the hippocampus and vmPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jay and Witter, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cenquizca and Swanson, 2007</xref>), it was observed that vmPFC HFS drove the local neural activity as characterized by c-Fos-ir activation in the subiculum, DG, as well as a marginal increase in the CA1 field of the hippocampus. Although there is no direct connection from vmPFC to the hippocampus, it is possible that the effects of vmPFC HFS on the hippocampal neural activity are mediated by a reciprocal bisynaptic pathway through the nucleus reunions or the lateral entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burwell and Amaral, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vertes et al., 2007</xref>). Besides, the neural activity in the hippocampus could probably be activated by either antidromic or orthodromic stimulation that possibly achieved by a current spread from the vmPFC structure to the neighboring axon bundles—the minor forceps of the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lim et al., 2015b</xref>). As a result, the hippocampal regions would eventually be activated for an induction of LTP to strengthen its synaptic plasticity for memory processes. Of particular interest, a tractography analysis by diffusion tensor imaging provides evidence for this structural connectivity that HFS of the subgenual cingulate gyrus (generally considered to be homologue of the rat vmPFC), showed connections to the medial frontal cortex, anterior and posterior cingulate, and the anterior medial temporal lobe (i.e., amygdala-hippocampus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gutman et al., 2009</xref>). The connections of the hippocampus and amygdala to the vmPFC have been previously investigated by anatomical and electrophysiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laroche et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jay and Witter, 1991</xref>). It has been shown that the excitatory and inhibitory inputs from the amygdala and hippocampus were converged and interact in the vmPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ishikawa and Nakamura, 2003</xref>), implying that activation of the amygdalar-hippocampal neurons might be crucial for vmPFC neurons in memory regulation. More importantly, the electrophysiological studies have provided concrete evidence of functional interaction between the vmPFC and hippocampus in which their theta oscillations were highly synchronized as measured by both the spike-theta phase locking and local field potential coherence, during memory acquisition and retrieval in spatial tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones and Wilson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Siapas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benchenane et al., 2010</xref>). Based on this evidence, we suggested that the rapid encoding and retrieval of memory depend largely on the bidirectional regulation of synaptic connectivity between the vmPFC and hippocampus; while the disruption of its connection affect the learning and memory functions, which are commonly identified in patients suffering from dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Salat et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>In line with our findings, HFS of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus and the entorhinal cortex has been demonstrated to increase neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Toda et al., 2008</xref>) and memory functions, particularly spatial memory measured in the MWM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stone et al., 2011</xref>) and enhanced performance on a delayed non-matching to sample task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamani et al., 2011</xref>). In this study, we found that vmPFC HFS induced upregulation of neurogenesis-associated genes with increased neural progenitors cells and dendritic spines in the DG of the hippocampus. In agreement with our previous microarray data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kadar et al., 2011</xref>), chronic HFS has been shown to modulate the hippocampal genes that involved in the proliferation and neurogenesis-related functions, as well as genes supporting for neural differentiation, migration and maturation. Although we observed no differences for the Timp1 (neuroprotection), Ccl2 (neural differentiation), and BDNF (synaptic plasticity) gene expression, there was an overall increase in their fold-change with approximately 1.2–2 fold after chronic vmPFC HFS. Notably, we found a strong induction of upregulation in the Angpt2 gene (4.8-fold) that promotes neuronal differentiation, migration and neuroprotection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2009</xref>), as well as NeuN/Rbfox3 gene (2-fold), which plays an essential role for neural progenitor cells differentiation and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2013</xref>). Further, our present observations were also supported by earlier works demonstrating that vmPFC HFS induced significant increase of BDNF and serotonin (5-HT) levels in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamani et al., 2012</xref>). Recent studies have shown that the increase of 5-HT and BDNF expression in the hippocampus regulate synaptic plasticity, as well as cognitive and mood-related behaviors. It is well-known that both the 5-HT and BDNF promote neurogenesis by enhancing the synaptogenesis, neuronal differentiation, and survival particularly for memory acquisition and consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaspar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lu and Chang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pang et al., 2004</xref>). Although no microdialysis data were provided with regard to the extracellular levels of 5-HT and BDNF after chronic vmPFC HFS, the increased neurogenesis effects as obtained from this study clearly indicate that its plausible mechanism is facilitated by the release of 5-HT and enhanced BDNF levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamani et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, the vmPFC HFS effects on the behavioral observation of improved memory functions and the neurogenesis have indicated that a strong synaptic network circuitry has been established within the DG for integration of new information and memory storage. In support of this notion, previous studies have demonstrated that the increased neurogenesis was highly associated with enhanced learning and memory, while its decrease caused memory impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van Praag et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shors et al., 2001</xref>). Although the present study has identified the DBS-induced memory enhancement by neurogenesis, there is a possibility that these effects are mediated by other non-neurogenic mechanisms such as modulation of the neurotransmission (via acetylcholine, dopamine, 5-HT, etc), synaptic potentiation by the AMPA/NMDA receptor trafficking, and enhancement of the BDNF or CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stern and Alberni, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The above findings prompted us to further examine whether the increase of neurogenesis-related functions is associated with the effects of memory enhancement by vmPFC HFS. Our correlation analysis of gene expression revealed that the Syn was strongly associated with the Nes and Dcx genes, suggesting that vmPFC HFS might possibly cause an alteration of increased dendritic synaptogenesis, particularly in the hippocampal DG where transcriptional process for Nes and Dcx genes occurs. Consistent with this interpretation, we have demonstrated the increase of dendritic spines in the Golgi-impregnated cells of the hippocampal DG. This observation was supported by a previous study which showed that electrical stimulation affected the axonal path in cultured Xenopus neurons that was mediated by elevation of both cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ming et al., 2001</xref>). Importantly, our behavioral correlates show that the spatial memory performances were associated with the cell proliferation in the DG, indicating that neurogenesis in the DG is vital for the hippocampal-dependent learning and memory processes.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that chronic vmPFC HFS induces long-lasting effects on memory performances and its underlying mechanism is possibly mediated by an enhanced neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Despite the fact that this structure has been previously shown for antidepressant-like activities, it might as well serve as a new effective DBS target for aged-related memory deficits. Thus, this translational research provides an additional window for a possibility of future clinical trials on this potential brain target for memory enhancement.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Male Sprague–Dawley rats (12 month old, n = 144; and 4 month-old, n = 20; National University of Singapore, Singapore) were individually housed with ad libitum access to food and water.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, Howard Eichenbaum (Reviewing editor), and three reviewers, two of whom, Paul Frankland and Magdalena Sauvage, have agreed to share their identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and all three reviewers were enthusiastic about this study and cited several strengths, including the hypothesis driven design, parametric study of stimulation parameters, robust behavioral effects, and progress towards identifying at least one mechanism. At the same time, there are major concerns about some of the analyses and about the specific role of neurogenesis. Also, each reviewer had additional substantial concerns about the description of the study and potential addition of an experiment, about the breadth of interpretation of mechanisms, and other issues. These are included below.</p><p>Reviewing editor comments:</p><p>1) First, the data show the strongest enhancement at one HFS level, but also more consistent results with LFS. Thus the claim that HFS is optimal is really an overstatement, especially because they did not compare HFS and LFS on chronic stimulation, or water maze or cellular measures.</p><p>2) Second, it is curious that the loss of discrimination between familiar and novel stimuli in the novel object test is a decrease in exploration time for the novel stimulus more so that an increase in exploration time for the familiar stimulus. Forgetting should be apparent, conversely, in an increase in exploration of familiar stimuli, indicating the animal is treating the old stimuli as new. So, the results seems to be the opposite in that middle aged rats seem to treat the new stimuli as old rather than treat the old stimuli as new (also see also McTighe et al. Science 2010). Given that the animals must distribute their total exploration time between two stimuli, it seems might be too much to expect the animal to have high exploration times for both the new and old stimulus. Nevertheless, if the animals are forgetting, I would expect equal exploration of the old and new stimuli in test and in the original acquisition phase. Was this the case? They should show the acquisition phase data and compare scores between acquisition and test.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>The weaker part of the paper is linking the pro-cognitive effects of DBS to a mechanism. They provide lots of correlative evidence that neurogenesis changes, and might be a mechanism. However, presumably many, many things also change following DBS, and establishing that the DBS-induced memory improvements depend on DBS would move the paper into the publishable realm I think. Asking whether preventing the DBS-induced neurogenesis increase prevents the memory improvements has been done in other studies (including the Stone et al. paper cited in the current manuscript), and doing such an experiment here would greatly strengthen this paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>The description of the NOR study did not indicate whether the position of the new object and the familiar object are counterbalanced (so that the effect cannot be due to the animals preferring a certain location independently of the type of object placed in this location). If this was the case, the authors should describe this in the Material and methods section. If not, it should be discussed in the Discussion why this could not be the case and/or evidence for lack of spatial bias of the animals for the location where the new objects were placed should be provided (e.g. during the habituation, exploration time spent without object in the different quadrants should be measured and the time spent in the quadrant where will be placed the new objects shown not to be significantly different from that spent in other quadrants).</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>1) There were a few areas where I thought the paper could be made clearer. First, the use of English needs to be improved. Second, more information is needed about how the stimulation was administered. For the acute stimulation study, it appears that stimulation was given for 30min before testing; does that mean the 30 minutes immediately before the habituation phase, or before each of the test phases? If it were the latter, stimulation would presumably affect retrieval processes and not encoding. Also, in the chronic stimulation study, it would be useful to know when the 1h of stimulation was given—at a set time of day? When did the stimulation occur relative to behavioral testing? I also would like to see explained what the no-HFS and HFS conditions referred to- perhaps, this condition refers to whether the stimulation session occurred just before the behavioral testing? Given this was a behaviorally relevant variable it should be spelled out clearly. In short, I do not think the stimulation procedure was described in sufficient detail for replication. Perhaps a figure given the sequence of events of all behavioral procedures would be useful.</p><p>2) I felt that the presentation of the correlation data was a bit muddled. I did not see a lot of value in computing an entire correlation matrix on this dataset with a relatively low N. A more useful approach might be to simply explore hypothesis-driven correlations (e.g. neurogenesis measures with behavior). I also do not think it is useful to present correlations with both sham and stimulated animals. If the hypothesis is that the benefit of stimulation is related to the degree to which it enhances neurogenesis, there is no reason to include sham animals.</p><p>3) Finally, I had two conceptual issues. First, the study is strongly motivated as addressing memory impairments as a result of age-related dementia. However, the animal model used here (12 month old rats) would seem to be a better model of healthy age-related memory decline. In fact, it seems the hypothesized mechanisms may not be effective when significant neural degeneration is present. Second, it may be worth discussing the relationship between mood effects of chronic ventromedial prefrontal cortex stimulation and the memory effect reported here. It may be that the stimulation has an effect on reducing anxiety, which increases novelty seeking and reduces thigmotaxic behavior in the Morris water maze, both which would enhance performance. The authors may want to consider whether the effect of ventromedial prefrontal stimulation on memory could be mediated by its anxiolytic action.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Ventromedial prefrontal cortex stimulation enhances memory and hippocampal neurogenesis in the middle-aged rats” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>With respect to the authors’ response to Reviewer 1’s point 3, since the authors were unwilling to test whether blocking the DBS-induced enhancement in neurogenesis would prevent the memory enhancement, I would suggest they add a 1-2 sentence discussion noting that they have not excluded that these effects are mediated by non-neurogenic mechanisms and identify one or two possibilities.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04803.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) First, the data show the strongest enhancement at one HFS level, but also more consistent results with LFS. Thus the claim that HFS is optimal is really an overstatement, especially because they did not compare HFS and LFS on chronic stimulation, or water maze or cellular measures</italic>.</p><p>Given the editor’s assertion that HFS is an overstatement, we have adapted the statements accordingly. Although HFS and LFS at specific amplitudes were effective for memory enhancement, it is noteworthy that LFS induced negative effects on the anxiety-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lim et al. 2015b</xref>). Furthermore, HFS of the vmPFC has been shown to reduce conditioned fear and enhance the extinction of aversive memory (Milad et al., 2002), whereas LFS induced impairment in extinction of conditioned fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shehadi and Maroun, 2012</xref>). Since in previous studies, vmPFC HFS produced robust antidepressant-like behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43 bib44">Lim et al., 2015a, b</xref>), we applied this stimulation parameter (HFS) in the chronic stimulation experiment to test the hypothesis about its effect to restore the memory deficits for both the short- and long-term memory functions of the middle-aged rats. We have incorporated this comment into the Discussion (see second paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) Second, it is curious that the loss of discrimination between familiar and novel stimuli in the novel object test is a decrease in exploration time for the novel stimulus more so that an increase in exploration time for the familiar stimulus.

So, the results seems to be the opposite in that middle aged rats seem to treat the new stimuli as old rather than treat the old stimuli as new (also see also McTighe et al. Science 2010). Given that the animals must distribute their total exploration time between two stimuli, it seems might be too much to expect the animal to have high exploration times for both the new and old stimulus. Nevertheless, if the animals are forgetting, I would expect equal exploration of the old and new stimuli in test and in the original acquisition phase. Was this the case? They should show the acquisition phase data and compare scores between acquisition and test</italic>.</p><p>The editor has raised an intriguing question concerning the discrimination between familiar and novel stimuli in the novel object recognition test. The comments of the reviewer based on a recently published paper by McTighe et al. 2010 suggest that the middle-aged rats were possibly treating the novel item as familiar object, while the repeated object as novel item. Please see below the following three successive points with explanation in respect to the questions raised:</p><p>a) There are methodological differences with McTighe et al. 2010. One study by Albasser et al. 2011 demonstrated that rats with perirhinal damage were severely impaired in discriminating a novel object from a simultaneously presented familiar item. The latter study showed a normal exploration level for both the novel and the familiar objects, as opposed to the findings by McTighe et al. 2010, which revealed that rats with perirhinal damage perceive novel objects as familiar or perceive familiar objects as novel.</p><p>The discontinuous testing procedure performed in McTighe et al. (2010) study could be another possible factor contributing to the different findings. They conducted discrete study and test phases, separated by removal of the rat into a holding cage/different environment for 1h. In contrast, our testing procedure was continuous without interruption or placing the rats in different environments. In addition, many studies were not in favor of the longer retention period of the tests, particularly involving habituation of rats to objects after lengthy intervals (Mumby et al. 2007; Albasser et al. 2009, 2011).</p><p>Importantly, the study by McTighe et al. (2010) was performed with rats having perirhinal cortex damage; while the animal model used in our study was considerably healthy with merely aged-related memory decline (intact brain). Indeed, human and animal studies have shown that damage to the perirhinal cortex could result in severe impairments in object recognition (Winters et al., 2010; Alvarev et al., 1994). In the study of McTighe, brain damage can produce impairments in visual recognition memory tasks not because the repeated object looks novel, but instead the novel object looks familiar. Concerning object information itself, the perirhinal cortex is considered to be the most crucial structure (Winters et al., 2008), and its damage would lead to a reorganization of the whole memory system particularly for specific type of memory and stimulus representations in different brain regions. It is, therefore, notable that the animal model used in our study for memory evaluation appears to be very different from the perirhinal cortex damage model.</p><p>b) We have congruent data from MWM showing that effects on memory are consistent. The novel object recognition task has become a widely used model for the investigation into memory alterations. Albeit this task can be configured to measure the working memory and preference for novelty in rodents, validation of the results by other established behavioral tasks is advisable/obligatory. In this regard, we have conducted the Morris water maze test to further support our findings obtained from the novel object recognition test. Note. The results of both the novel object recognition and the Morris water maze tasks have consistently confirmed the memory enhancement effects of chronic vmPFC HFS. Thus, we can possibly rule out the probability of paradoxical false memory as found by McTighe et al. (2010) in the middle-aged animals.</p><p>c) New data are added as requested. As requested by the editor, for the acquisition phase data, we have included these results in the manuscript (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary File 2 A, B, and C</xref>). During the acquisition phase, no significant difference was obtained between the two identical objects, except for one particular case in Acute Stimulation study with low-frequency stimulation at 400μA, and the effect was marginally significant at p=0.045. Overall, our results clearly demonstrated the equal exploration duration for the familiar and novel objects in all the test phases for sham non-stimulated rats, indicating memory decline in the middle-aged animal model. Finally, all results were compared between the acquisition and test phases (please see the first paragraphs of the Results section)</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p><italic>The weaker part of the paper is linking the pro-cognitive effects of DBS to a mechanism. They provide lots of correlative evidence that neurogenesis changes, and might be a mechanism. However, presumably many, many things also change following DBS, and establishing that the DBS-induced memory improvements depend on DBS would move the paper into the publishable realm I think. Asking whether preventing the DBS-induced neurogenesis increase prevents the memory improvements has been done in other studies (including the Stone et al. paper cited in the current manuscript), and doing such an experiment here would greatly strengthen this paper</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the comment of the reviewer that linking the pro-cognitive effects of DBS to correlative evidence of neurogenesis changes might not necessarily reflect the mechanism of DBS-induced memory improvements in the middle-aged animals. Further, we also agree with the reviewer that conducting an additional experiment of preventing the DBS-induced neurogenesis increase for memory improvement would strengthen the hypothesis of this paper.</p><p>However, the relationship of neurogenesis with hippocampal memory has already been well established. After blocking hippocampal neurogenesis, spatial memory deficits have been reported in several studies (Fan et al. 2007; Synder et al. 2005); and indeed preventing loss of neurogenesis reversed memory deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stone et al. 2011</xref>; Encinas et al. 2011). Notably, many studies have shown that the newly-generated neurons, once sufficiently mature, are activated and expressed during memory formation (Kee et al. 2007; Tashiro et al. 2007).</p><p>In consideration of the time constraint and experimental duration (approximately 2 months for surgery and behavior) as well as the availability of middle-aged animals (12-months animal holding) to perform this study, it would take approximately 2 years to complete the entire experiment.</p><p>We recognize the importance of the suggested experiment to prove the effects of DBS-induced neurogenesis increase for memory enhancement, we have conducted alternative experiments of immunofluorescence double-labeling of c-Fos (one of the immediate early gene family markers for neuronal activity) with the Dcx and the BrdU labeled cells in the hippocampal region of the vmPFC stimulated middle-aged animal (see Figure 5L). We are convinced that this would provide strong evidence to show the effects of vmPFC HFS on the hippocampal neurogenesis-induced memory enhancement. For description of results, see the end of the subsection “Stimulation-induced changes from cell proliferation to dendritic spines modification” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>’s legend. For immunofluoresence staining methods, see Materials and methods (subsection headed “Immunofluorescence staining”). We hope that the data provided from the immunofluorescence experiments are convincible to the reviewer.</p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p><italic>The description of the NOR study did not indicate whether the position of the new object and the familiar object are counterbalanced (so that the effect cannot be due to the animals preferring a certain location independently of the type of object placed in this location). If this was the case, the authors should describe this in the Material and methods section. If not, it should be discussed in the Discussion why this could not be the case and/or evidence for lack of spatial bias of the animals for the location where the new objects were placed should be provided (e.g. during the habituation, exploration time spent without object in the different quadrants should be measured and the time spent in the quadrant where will be placed the new objects shown not to be significantly different from that spent in other quadrants)</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer commented the incomplete description of the novel object recognition task. During the test, rats were placed in the open-field with one familiar and one novel object (counter-balanced across tests and subjects) and given 3min to explore the two items. This description is covered in Materials and methods under the subsection headed “Behavioral Testing”.</p><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p><italic>1) There were a few areas where I thought the paper could be made clearer. First, the use of English needs to be improved. Second, more information is needed about how the stimulation was administered. For the acute stimulation study, it appears that stimulation was given for 30min before testing; does that mean the 30 minutes immediately before the habituation phase, or before each of the test phases? If it were the latter, stimulation would presumably affect retrieval processes and not encoding. Also, in the chronic stimulation study, it would be useful to know when the 1h of stimulation was given—at a set time of day? When did the stimulation occur relative to behavioral testing? I also would like to see explained what the no-HFS and HFS conditions referred to- perhaps, this condition refers to whether the stimulation session occurred just before the behavioral testing? Given this was a behaviorally relevant variable it should be spelled out clearly. In short, I do not think the stimulation procedure was described in sufficient detail for replication. Perhaps a figure given the sequence of events of all behavioral procedures would be useful</italic>.</p><p>In response to the two concerns highlighted by the reviewer, we have taken the following measures. First, the manuscript has been thoroughly revised and proofread by a fluent English speaker. In response to the second concern about the insufficient information of the behavioral experimental studies, we have addressed the related issues in the Materials and methods section. (For information of acute and chronic stimulation prior to testing and the stimulation time, see subsection “Behavioral Testing” and for the explanation of no-HFS and HFS conditions, see the third paragraph of the same subsection). Finally, a figure of event sequence for all behavioral procedures has been inserted into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) I felt that the presentation of the correlation data was a bit muddled. I did not see a lot of value in computing an entire correlation matrix on this dataset with a relatively low N. A more useful approach might be to simply explore hypothesis-driven correlations (e.g. neurogenesis measures with behavior). I also do not think it is useful to present correlations with both sham and stimulated animals. If the hypothesis is that the benefit of stimulation is related to the degree to which it enhances neurogenesis, there is no reason to include sham animals</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer commented that the data presentation of all correlation matrixes for both the sham and stimulated animals were seemingly not useful. Agreeing to this suggestion, we have removed the correlation on <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and explored only the hypothesis-driven correlations of neurogenesis measures with behavior.</p><p><italic>3) Finally, I had two conceptual issues. First, the study is strongly motivated as addressing memory impairments as a result of age-related dementia. However, the animal model used here (12 month old rats) would seem to be a better model of healthy age-related memory decline. In fact, it seems the hypothesized mechanisms may not be effective when significant neural degeneration is present. Second, it may be worth discussing the relationship between mood effects of chronic ventromedial prefrontal cortex stimulation and the memory effect reported here. It may be that the stimulation has an effect on reducing anxiety, which increases novelty seeking and reduces thigmotaxic behavior in the Morris water maze, both which would enhance performance. The authors may want to consider whether the effect of ventromedial prefrontal stimulation on memory could be mediated by its anxiolytic action</italic>.</p><p>In the first conceptual issue, we agree with the reviewer that the animal model used in this study would be an appropriate model of healthy aged-related memory decline instead of neural degeneration as described in our hypothesized mechanisms. We have revised and adapted the statements in the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>As for the second conceptual issue, the reviewer has suggested that the memory enhancement effects of ventromedial prefrontal cortex stimulation could be mediated by its anxiolytic action. In agreement with this suggestion, we have included these comments in the Discussion part.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>[…] With respect to the authors reply to Reviewer 1, since the authors were unwilling to test whether blocking the DBS-induced enhancement in neurogenesis would prevent the memory enhancement, I would suggest they add a 1-2 sentence discussion noting that they have not excluded that these effects are mediated by non-neurogenic mechanisms and identify one or two possibilities</italic>.</p><p>With respect to your request to add 1-2 sentence(s) concerning the non-neurogenic mechanism, we have now included this within the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
