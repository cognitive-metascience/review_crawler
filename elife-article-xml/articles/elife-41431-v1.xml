replication, and the identification of cellular factors targeted by viruses has led to key insights into both viral pathogenesis and cell biology. In this study, we develop an HIV reporter virus (HIV-AFMACS) displaying a streptavidin-binding affinity tag at the surface of infected cells, allowing facile one-step selection with streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads. We use this system to obtain pure populations of HIV-infected primary human CD4+ T cells for detailed proteomic analysis, and quantitate approximately 9000 proteins across multiple donors on a dynamic background of T cell activation. Amongst 650 HIV-dependent changes (q &lt; 0.05), we describe novel Vif-dependent targets FMR1 and DPH7, and 192 proteins not identified and/or regulated in T cell lines, such as ARID5A and PTPN22. We therefore provide a high-coverage functional proteomic atlas of HIV infection, and a mechanistic account of host factors subverted by the virus in its natural target cell.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>primary human CD4+ T cell</kwd><kwd>magnetic cell selection</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/P008801/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matheson</surname><given-names>Nicholas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009033</institution-id><institution>NHS Blood and Transplant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WPA15-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matheson</surname><given-names>Nicholas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>210688/Z/18/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehner</surname><given-names>Paul J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identification and characterisation of proteins and processes regulated by HIV in primary human CD4+ T cells using an HIV reporter virus for one-step, antibody-free magnetic selection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Remodelling of the host proteome during viral infection may reflect direct effects of viral proteins, secondary effects or cytopathicity accompanying viral replication, or host countermeasures such as the interferon (IFN) response. By defining time-dependent changes in protein levels in infected cells, and correlating temporal profiles of cellular and viral proteins, we have shown that it is possible to differentiate these phenomena, and identify direct cellular targets of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greenwood et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matheson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Weekes et al., 2014</xref>). To enable time course analysis and minimise confounding effects from uninfected bystander cells, pure populations of synchronously infected cells must be sampled sequentially as they progress through a single round of viral replication. In the case of HIV, we previously satisfied these conditions by spinoculating the highly permissive CEM-T4 lymphoblastoid T cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foley et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">O'Doherty et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Popovic et al., 1984</xref>) with Env-deficient NL4-3-ÎEnv-EGFP virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>) at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greenwood et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The utility of cancer cell line models (such as CEM-T4) is, however, limited by the extent to which they retain the characteristics of the primary cells from which they were derived, and cancer-specific and <italic>in vitro</italic> culture-dependent reprogramming are well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gillet et al., 2013</xref>). For example, the HIV accessory proteins Vif, Nef and Vpu are required for viral replication in primary T cells, but not in many T cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Neil et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rosa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sheehy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Usami et al., 2015</xref>), and HIV is restricted by type I IFN in primary T cells, but not CEM-derived T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goujon et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, whilst ensuring a high % infection, dysregulation of the cellular proteome at high MOIs may not be indicative of protein changes when a single transcriptionally active provirus is present per cell.</p><p>In this study, we therefore sought to apply our temporal proteomic approach to HIV infection of primary human CD4+Â T lymphocytes, the principle cell type infected <italic>in vivo</italic>, at an MOIÂ â¤Â 1. To this end, we have developed an HIV reporter virus encoding a cell surface streptavidin-binding affinity tag, allowing antibody-free magnetic cell sorting of infected cells (AFMACS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matheson et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This system allows rapid, scalable, affinity purification of HIV-infected cells from mixed cultures, bypassing the need for high MOIs or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). We use this system to generate a detailed atlas of cellular protein dynamics in HIV-infected primary human CD4+Â T cells, show how this resource can be used to identify novel cellular proteins regulated by HIV, and assign causality to individual HIV accessory proteins.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41431.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Antibody-free magnetic selection of HIV-infected primary T cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Workflow for AFMACS-based magnetic selection of HIV-infected primary T cells.Â (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic of HIV-AFMACS provirus (pNL4-3-ÎEnv-Nef-P2A-SBP-ÎLNGFR).

Cells expressing this marker may be selected directly with streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads, washed to remove unbound cells, then released by incubation with the naturally occurring vitamin biotin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matheson et al., 2014</xref>). To engineer a single round HIV reporter virus encoding SBP-ÎLNGFR, we considered three settings in the proviral construct: fused to the endogenous Env signal peptide (as a direct replacement for Env); or as an additional cistron, downstream of <italic>nef</italic> and either a P2A peptide or IRES. We used Env-deficient pNL4-3-ÎEnv-EGFP (HIV-1) as a backbone and, since increased size of lentiviral genome is known to reduce packaging efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kumar et al., 2001</xref>), tested each approach in constructs from which EGFP was removed and/or the 3â long terminal repeat (LTR) truncated. Further details relating to construct design are described in the Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>For initial screening, VSVg-pseudotyped viruses were made in HEK-293T cells under standard conditions, and used to spinoculate CEM-T4 T cells (CEM-T4s). Infected cells were identified by expression of EGFP and/or cell surface LNGFR, combined with Nef/Vpu-mediated downregulation of CD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guy et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Willey et al., 1992</xref>). Whilst infection is not truly âproductiveâ (because Env is deleted), Gag alone is sufficient for assembly and release of virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gheysen et al., 1989</xref>), and other structural and non-structural viral proteins are expressed in accordance with full length viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greenwood et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>As expected, all viruses tested expressed SBP-ÎLNGFR at the cell surface of infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), but the larger constructs resulted in lower infectious viral titres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1AâB</xref>). We therefore selected pNL4-3-ÎEnv-SBP-ÎLNGFR, pNL4-3-ÎENV-Nef-P2A-SBP-ÎLNGFR and pNL4-3-ÎEnv-Nef-IRES-SBP-ÎLNGFR-Î3 for further evaluation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Viruses generated from these constructs expressed high levels of SBP-ÎLNGFR 48 hr post-infection, and depleted CD4 and tetherin to a similar extent. However, only the pNL4-3-ÎENV-Nef-P2A-SBP-ÎLNGFR virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) expressed high levels of LNGFR 24 hr post-infection in both CEM-T4s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>) and primary human CD4+Â T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This is consistent with Nef-P2A-SBP-ÎLNGFR expression from completely spliced transcripts early in HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klotman et al., 1991</xref>), with the P2A peptide ensuring that translation of Nef and SBP-ÎLNGFR follow similar kinetics.</p><p>Since analysis of cells at early as well as late time points is essential for the generation of time course data, we focussed on pNL4-3-ÎEnv-Nef-P2A-SBP-ÎLNGFR (now termed HIV-AFMACS). To confirm that HIV-AFMACS virus could be used for cell selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), infected primary T cells were captured by streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads, released by incubation with excess biotin, then analysed by flow cytometry. Compared with unselected cells (input) or cells released during washing (flow-through), selected cells were markedly enriched for SBP-ÎLNGFR expression and CD4 downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In fact, from mixed populations containing approximately 20â40% infected cells, purities of â¥Â 90% were routinely achieved by AFMACS of both CEM-T4s and primary human CD4+Â T cells, with â¤Â 10% infected cells lost in the flow-through (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The full HIV-AFMACS sequence is available from GenBank (accession: MK435310) and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, and the proviral construct will be made available to the community via the National Institutes of Health (NIH) AIDS Reagent Program.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Time-dependent proteomic remodelling during HIV infection of primary T cells</title><p>To gain a comprehensive, unbiased overview of viral and cellular protein dynamics during HIV-infection of its natural target cell, we used the HIV-AFMACS virus to spinoculate activated, primary human CD4+Â T cells, sorted infected (SBP-ÎLNGFR positive) and uninfected (SBP-ÎLNGFR negative) cells by AFMACS 24 hr and 48 hr post-infection, and analysed whole cell lysates using tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâB</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greenwood et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Weekes et al., 2014</xref>).

To exclude these possibilities, we repeated the single time point proteomic experiment using primary T cells from three new donors and substituting WT and Vif-deficient HIV-AFMACS for two different control lentivectors expressing SBP-ÎLNGFR either as a single transgene (from the SFFV promoter; pSBP-ÎLNGFR) or in conjunction with HIV-1 Tat (from the HIV-1 LTR; pTat/SBP-ÎLNGFR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4AâC</xref>).</p><p>As expected, changes in transduced cells were far less extensive than changes induced by HIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4D</xref>, top and middle panels; compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

The HIV-AFMACS virus described in this study allows routine isolation of HIV-infected cells subjected to an MOIÂ â¤Â 1, avoiding artefacts associated with high MOIs and facilitating experiments in primary cells, where high levels of infection are difficult to achieve in practice.</p><p>To demonstrate the utility of this system and provide a resource for the community, we have generated the first high coverage proteomic atlas of HIV-infected primary human CD4+Â T cells. As well as identifying HIV-dependent changes in cells from multiple donors, viral regulation may be assessed against a background of endogenous regulation triggered by T cell activation. Unlike T cell lines, primary T cells express a full range of proteins relevant to HIV infection <italic>in vivo</italic>, and are not confounded by the genetic and epigenetic effects of transformation. Furthermore, proteins unique to primary T cells were significantly more likely to be regulated by HIV infection than proteins detected in both primary T cells and CEM-T4s (131/1252Â =Â 10.5% vs 519/7537Â =Â 6.9%; pÂ &lt;Â 0.0001, two-tailed Fisherâs exact test). Our data validate many, but not all, previously reported HIV accessory protein targets. For some Vpu/Nef substrates, such as NTB-A and CCR7, downregulation from the plasma membrane may occur in the absence of protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolduan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ramirez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shah et al., 2010</xref>). For others, such as ICAM-1/3, accessory protein expression may prevent upregulation, without reducing levels below baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sugden et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, and particularly where targets have been discovered using model cell line or overexpression systems, regulation may not be quantitatively significant at the protein level in the context and/or natural cell of HIV infection.</p><p>Previous temporal proteomic analyses of HIV-infected primary human CD4+Â T cells were hampered by extremely limited coverage of the cellular proteome (&lt;Â 2000 proteins), and did not detect regulation of known or novel HIV accessory protein targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nemeth et al., 2017</xref>). A more recent study quantitated 7761 proteins in FACS-sorted T cells at a single time point 96 hr post-infection with an R5-tropic, GFP-expressing Nef-deficient virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuo et al., 2018</xref>). Depletion of several accessory protein targets (including APOBEC3 and PPP2R5 families) was confirmed, and many proteins differentially regulated at 96 hr were also regulated at 48 hr in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplement 5A</xref>). In keeping with the late time point, changes were dominated by pathways involved in cell death and survival, and factors maintaining viability of HIV-infected T cells (such as BIRC5) were enriched. Conversely, the full dataset is not available, effect sizes were generally compressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplement 5A</xref>), and 413/650 (64%) of the HIV-dependent changes identified in our study were obscured, including depletion of ARID5A, PTPN22, DPH7 and 19/51 known accessory protein substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplement 5B</xref>).</p><p>Compared with other studies, the depth of proteomic coverage reported here not only increases the number of proteins identified, but also reduces the variability in quantitation (ânoiseâ). For example,Â &gt;Â 90% of proteins are quantitated using two or more unique peptides. Furthermore, the homogeneous populations of cells analysed (&gt;Â 90% infected) maximise effect sizes (âsignalâ), and ensure that proteins exhibiting the most statistically significant differences are also those with the biggest fold changes. Because the âsignal-to-noise ratioâ is high, positive controls (known viral targets) behave extremely consistently across our datasets (as shown, for example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), and it is possible to make predictions about other cellular proteins falling in the same regions of the volcano plots, and/or exhibiting similar temporal profiles. Our results are therefore useful as a resource (that is, general description of all protein changes), not just as a screen (to identify far outliers).</p><p>To enhance viral titers, avoid Env-dependent cytotoxicity, enable synchronous single round infections and bypass co-receptor-dependent targeting of T cell lineages with pre-existing proteomic differences, we used an Env-deficient proviral backbone and pseudotyped viruses with VSVg. Pseudotyping with VSVg redirects HIV viral entry away from the plasma membrane towards an endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aiken, 1997</xref>), and may abrogate Env-dependent integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arthos et al., 2008</xref>) and chemokine co-receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wu and Yoder, 2009</xref>) signalling early in infection. To limit the impact of these effects, we focussed our analysis on cellular proteins progressively regulated over 48 hr infection. Since only 1/650 HIV-dependent perturbations at this time point was also observed in cells transduced with control lentiviral particles, it is very unlikely that pseudotyping with VSVg per se caused significant artefactual proteomic changes in our datasets (false positives). Nonetheless, it is possible that the absence of Env-CD4/co-receptor interactions resulted in an underestimate of proteomic changes induced by full length HIV (false negatives), which may vary depending on tropism of the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wiredja et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wojcechowskyj et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Temporal profiling is particularly well suited to identifying and characterising host factors regulated directly by viral proteins. Because of the need for de novo synthesis of cell surface SBP-ÎLNGFR, it is not possible to perform AFMACS-based selection of HIV-infected primary T cells very early in infection. Nonetheless, even with a first time point 24 hr post-infection, we were able to successfully categorise cellular accessory protein targets according to their patterns of regulation in the time course proteomic experiment. In fact, as we show here, accessory proteins account for much or most of the proteomic remodelling in HIV-infected cells. The abundance of direct accessory protein targets likely explains why proteins and processes/pathways downregulated by HIV in primary T cells correlate so well with changes seen in T cell lines, and are robust to inter-individual variation. In comparison, upregulated proteins concord less well with changes in T cell lines, and functional effects are less homogeneous. This may be because upregulated proteins reflect indirect effects (for example, secondary changes in transcription), which are more likely to be cell-type specific.</p><p>Amongst the HIV accessory proteins, Vif was thought until recently to exclusively degrade APOBEC3 family cytidine deaminases. As well as confirming equivalently-potent Vif-dependent depletion of PPP2R5 family phosphatase subunits in primary T cells, our data revealed unexpected Vif-dependent depletion of DPH7 and FMR1. Further work will be required to confirm that these proteins are recruited directly for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, determine whether (like APOBEC3 and PPP2R5 proteins) they are antagonised by Vif variants from diverse primate and non-primate lentiviral lineages, and identify relevant <italic>in vitro</italic> virological phenotypes associated with target depletion. Nonetheless, FMR1 is already known to reduce HIV virus infectivity when over-expressed in producer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pan et al., 2009</xref>), and the other novel targets highlighted in this study also impact processes relevant for HIV replication, such as inflammatory cytokine signalling (ARID5A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Higa et al., 2018</xref>), T cell activation (PTPN22) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hasegawa et al., 2004</xref>) and translational fidelity (DPH7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carette et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ortiz et al., 2006</xref>). The diversity of these targets underscores the benefit of an unbiased, systems-level approach to viral infection, and the capacity of the resources presented in this study to reveal unsuspected aspects of the host-virus interaction in the natural target cell of HIV infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

This is the largest data set in using primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to-date and over half of the 600+ changes were dependent on Vpr and Vif/Nef/Vpu. This is a technically sound study and a potential resource for the community studying HIV/host interactions.</p><p>However, my main concern is novelty and overlap with prior and parallel work. For instance, an <italic>eLife</italic> paper a couple of years ago focused on Vif by the same group, a PLOS One paper focused on infected cell purification by the same group, and a sister paper (Greenwood, 2018) that describes the Vpr downregulated proteome. The authors indicate 40-60% Venn overlap with proteomic studies in CEM cells, and focus on novel cellular factors (ARID5A, PTPN22, DPH7, and FMR1) but the functional significance of these interactions is unclear.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Naamati et al., present a strategy for isolating HIV-infected primary cells for mass spec analysis based on infecting cells with modified virus bearing a genetically-encoded surface protein with a strong affinity to streptavidin. This virus (&quot;HIV-AFMACS&quot;) allows for one-step enrichment of infected cells using magnetic beads. The authors go on to show the utility of this strategy by measuring changes in cellular protein levels upon infection of primary cells with this construct at 24 and 48 hours post-infection, and by comparing changes in protein expression using WT and ÎVif viruses. The authors complete a thorough comparison of the resulting data in the context of previous studies in the literature. They also validate the changes in expression of two proteins that were specific to primary cells (as opposed to CEM-T4s) and two proteins that are potential new Vif substrates using immunoblot.</p><p>The paper is clearly written and presented, and its strengths include, in particular, (1) the technical innovation, (2) the emphasis on primary cells, and (3) the depth and stringency of the mass spec data obtained. Especially notable is the interactive spreadsheet that provides an easy-to-access and expansive resource.</p><p>Weaknesses of the study are, at a fundamental level, relatively minor. However, they are worth pondering in the context of the anticipated target audience.</p><p>First, it can be argued that there is not much new biological insight gleaned here, especially compared to the depth of the stories in these authors' other recent (Vif- and Vpu-focused) and concurrent (Vpr-focused) proteomics studies using CEMs. The major advance seems to be the technical achievement and comparison of primary T cells to cell lines, and while this is both compelling and innovative, there is rather limited validation of new or interesting hits and no characterization of why they (in particular the highlighted factors DPH7 and FMR1) are affected by HIV or the roles they might play in viral or cellular biology.</p><p>Second, it is unfortunate that ÎEnv viruses were chosen for the analysis considering the large impact Env-CD4/CoR binding can have on primary T cell responses, likely highly relevant to accurately modeling acute infection dynamics (e.g., see Wojcechowskyj et al., 2013). To their credit, the authors discuss the VSV-G issue (albeit briefly), saying that because of VSV-G they biased their focus to be on late stage accessory gene contributions (Discussion section). However, it seems reasonable that their viruses could have been pseudotyped with wild-type Envelope proteins instead of VSV-G. Indeed, again in the context of acute infection, it would have been even more compelling to compare R5 vs. X4 or TF to non-TF glycoproteins. Further discussion of this issue would be warranted.</p><p>Third, the authors did not include an evaluation of whether the expression of SBP-LNGFR and its display on the cell surface causes any changes in expression of cellular proteins, as an important negative control. Unless I missed it, the only cells that are expressing this protein are also infected with HIV, therefore it is not possible to fully distinguish which proteins are changing expression due to HIV infection or SBP-LNGFR expression alone. While the authors do discuss how their technique is superior to antibodies that might cross-link surface receptors, they should also explain the limitations of AFMACS-selection more thoroughly and whether or not the potential effects of LNGFR overexpression and bead binding can truly be disregarded.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study Naamati and colleagues measure the proteomic changes experienced by T cells after HIV infection. The study is compelling, appropriately controlled and the results are of significant interest to the community. I have some minor suggestions to improve clarity.</p><p>1) The authors make a lot of the MOI being low. Do they know that this is true? Permissivity is typically different between donors/experiments but typically one cannot infect all the cells, especially for primary T cells, even by spinoculation with VSV-G. In the case that only 40% of the cells are permissive an MOI of 50 would only infect 40% of the cells. In order to determine actual MOI one has to titrate the virus back to make sure that eg halving the dose halves the number of infected cells. In the experiments presented, do the authors know that reducing dose reduces infectivity or is their MOI of 0.5 really just an indication that only half of the cells are permissive. Did they test whether lower dose give predictably lower numbers of infected cells? This is important because it also speaks to whether the only difference between the infected and uninfected cells is chance, ie there is not enough virus to infect all the cells, or are the uninfected cells non permissive. In this case, gene expression differences between uninfected and infected cells may be as much to do with the cells being different as it is to do with viral gene expression. I think the experiments are OK and this has been taken into account but a more explicit discussion of this point and whether diluting the virus reduces infectivity as expected is important.</p><p>2) A key goal of this study is to provide a resource for examining which proteins are manipulated by HIV infection. With this in mind, could the authors annotate the data in Figure 3C with more detail. Each outlier circle could be numbered and a table of gene names provided. I appreciate that the authors are presenting all of their data and are not hiding anything. But I feel the outliers are what people really want to know about and these could be labeled here. In fact, any opportunity to label the volcano plots would enormously improve the accessibility and thus the likelihood that the field will chase these hits up mechanistically.</p><p>3) Itâs not immediately obvious what &quot;pos&quot; and &quot;neg&quot; mean in Figure 2A. For clarity, label &quot;HIV+&quot; and &quot;HIV-&quot; instead and change the text in subsection âTime-dependent proteomic remodelling during HIV infection of primary T cellsâ to &quot;whole cell lystates from both HIV positive and HIV negative populations using.â¦.</p><p>4) Provide key for blue and red lines in Figure 2C-E on Figure and in legend.</p><p>5) Subsection âDesign and construction of the HIV-AFMACS reporter virusâ submit the sequence of the construct to GenBank and provide accession number which is more useful than having the seq in a Figure.</p><p>6) Subsection âProteins and pathways regulated by HIV in primary T cells from multiple donorsâ, its useful to label the x for the constructs that didn't work. Knowing what didn't work is useful, particularly for those that were completely dead vs a bit defective. Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B.</p><p>7) Can the authors comment on the impact of T cell activation of HIV permissivity. Itâs not totally clear why T cells have to be activated to make them permissive for HIV infection. SAMHD1 has a lot to do with it and the authors make this point. In these experiments T cell receptor is crosslinked with anti-CD3, anti-CD28 dyna beads. This presumably doesn't happen <italic>in vivo</italic>, yet T cells are permissive. I imagine the authors have thought about this and I would be interested to hear their thoughts, perhaps in the Discussion section. Is there value in their data comparing unactivated and activated cells to consider what's driving permissivity? How do their data compare with any published literature on <italic>in vivo</italic> activated T cells, indeed is there any data on this? I'm interested to hear what they think and whether they think their data can be used to illuminate the changes that occur on TCR cross linking that drive permissivity. Would a figure considering this point be valuable?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41431.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>While there was discussion among the reviewers regarding the biological significance of your findings, all 3 were impressed with the magnitude of your data set using primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.

In that regard, and together with the proteomic atlas, the HIV-AFMACS virus certainly does facilitate experiments in primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells which have previously been very technically challenging (as demonstrated). As mentioned by the reviewer, we originally developed AFMACS to isolate cells transfected or transduced with expression vectors (Matheson et al., 2014), before appreciating the potential of the system for the study of HIV infection in its natural target cell.</p><p>Whilst supported by our work in CEM-T4s, we here identify 192 novel HIV-dependent changes in primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (30% of all dysregulated proteins), including the specific examples listed by the reviewer. These proteins are now all summarised for easy reference in Figure 3âsource data 1 (described in the responses to reviewer #3). It is of course reassuring (and important <italic>per se</italic>) that there is a strong correlation between primary T cell and cell line data. Conversely, we found proteins unique to primary T cells significantly more likely to be perturbed by HIV infection, and several previously reported direct and indirect HIV targets are not regulated at all in the primary T cell system, at least at the total protein level (illustrated in Figure 3âfigure supplement 3A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Naamati et al., present a strategy for isolating HIV-infected primary cells for mass spec analysis based on infecting cells with modified virus bearing a genetically-encoded surface protein with a strong affinity to streptavidin.

Whilst we have not focused on functional follow-up of individual âhitsâ here, we do think that biological insight can also be gained at a systems level. On our previous experience with this sort of study (alluded to by the reviewer), the follow-up often becomes the main story, distracting from the resource-value of novel reagents, techniques and datasets. By taking a different approach in this manuscript, we ultimately hope to facilitate more detailed functional follow-up by our lab and others.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, it is unfortunate that ÎEnv viruses were chosen for the analysis considering the large impact Env-CD4/CoR binding can have on primary T cell responses, likely highly relevant to accurately modeling acute infection dynamics (e.g., see Wojcechowskyj et al., 2013).

Indeed, again in the context of acute infection, it would have been even more compelling to compare R5 vs. X4 or TF to non-TF glycoproteins. Further discussion of this issue would be warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment, we agree that it merits more detailed discussion than originally provided. First, and most importantly, we considered it important to exclude the possibility of âfalse positiveâ proteomic changes, related to exposure to VSVg-pseudotyped viral particles, rather than HIV infection <italic>per se</italic> (analogous to a Type I error). We therefore performed a further large scale proteomic experiment to address this directly. The results are shown in new Figure 3âfigure supplement 4 (proteins regulated by transduction with control lentivectors) and Figure 3âsource data 1 (proteins regulated by HIV and/or control lentivectors) and described in the text (subsection âIdentification and characterisation of primary T cell-specific HIV targetsâ):</p><p>âWe have previously shown that expression of the SBP-ÎLNGFR selectable marker as a transgene does not impact the viability, activation or proliferation of primary T cells (Matheson et al., 2014). Nonetheless, some of the novel changes attributed to HIV in this study could theoretically be secondary to exposure to VSVg-pseudotyped viral particles, expression of SBP-ÎLNGFR and/or the AFMACS workflow, or reflect pre-existing proteomic differences in infected (permissive) cells, compared with the mock-infected bulk population. To exclude these possibilities, we repeated the single time point proteomic experiment using primary T cells from 3 new donors and substituting WT and Vif-deficient HIV-AFMACS for two different control lentivectors expressing SBP-ÎLNGFR either as a single transgene (from the SFFV promoter; pSBP-ÎLNGFR) or in conjunction with HIV-1 Tat (from the HIV-1 LTR; pTat/SBP-ÎLNGFR) (Figure 3âfigure supplement 4A-C).</p><p>As expected, changes in transduced cells were far less extensive than changes induced by HIV (Figure 3âfigure supplement 4D, top and middle panels; compare with Figure 3C). In fact, amongst 8,518 cellular proteins quantitated across 9 different conditions, only 37/8,518 (0.4%) were significantly perturbed by one or both lentivectors (q&lt;0.05), and are summarised in an interactive filter table (Figure 3âsource data 1). Interestingly, despite evidence of robust transactivation of the HIV LTR (resulting in high level expression of SBP-ÎLNGFR at the surface of cells transduced with pTat/SBP-ÎLNGFR), no Tat-dependent changes in cellular protein levels were identified (Figure 3âfigure supplement 4C, lower panels and Figure 3âfigure supplement 4D, middle and bottom panels). Most importantly, amongst the 650 proteins significantly regulated by HIV, 576 were quantitated in the SBP-ÎLNGFR control experiment, of which only 1 protein (MYB) was also significantly regulated by the control lentivectors (Figure 3âfigure supplement 4D, top and middle panels and Figure 3âsource data 1).â</p><p>Second, we agree that the use of VSVg-pseudotyped particles introduces the potential for âfalse negativeâ proteomic changes, because of the absence of potential HIV-Env dependent changes (analogous to a Type II error). To highlight this and the first point, we have therefore also extended the Discussion section as follows:</p><p>âTo enhance viral titers, avoid Env-dependent cytotoxicity, enable synchronous single round infections and bypass co-receptor-dependent targeting of T cell lineages with pre-existing proteomic differences, we used an Env-deficient proviral backbone and pseudotyped viruses with VSVg. Pseudotyping with VSVg redirects HIV viral entry away from the plasma membrane towards an endocytic pathway (Aiken, 1997), and may abrogate Env-dependent integrin (Arthos et al., 2008) and chemokine co-receptor (Wu and Yoder, 2009) signalling early in infection. To limit the impact of these effects, we focussed our analysis on cellular proteins progressively regulated over 48 hrs infection. Since only 1/650 HIV-dependent perturbations at this time point was also observed in cells transduced with control lentiviral particles, it is very unlikely that pseudotyping with VSVg <italic>per se</italic> caused significant artefactual proteomic changes in our datasets (false positives). Nonetheless, it is possible that the absence of Env-CD4/co-receptor interactions resulted in an underestimate of proteomic changes induced by full length HIV (false negatives), which may vary depending on tropism of the virus (Wiredja et al., 2018; Wojcechowskyj et al., 2013).â</p><p>Of note, Wojcechowskyj et al., 2013 (for example) quantitated early phosphoproteomic changes in resting primary T cells exposed to HIV virions without the need for cell selection (because all cells present were exposed to virions, even if not actively infected). Direct changes arising from the Env-CD4/co-receptor interactions could likely be assessed using a similar approach i.e. analysis of bulk populations. In fact, AFMACS is not possible at very early time points post-infection, because of the requirement for de novo synthesis of SBP-ÎLNGFR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, the authors did not include an evaluation of whether the expression of SBP-LNGFR and its display on the cell surface causes any changes in expression of cellular proteins, as an important negative control.

In addition, and as above, we note that the utility of AFMACS-based selection is limited at very early time points, because of the need for <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of SBP-dLNGFR. Accordingly, we have added the following to the Discussion section:</p><p>âTemporal profiling is particularly well suited to identifying and characterising host factors regulated directly by viral proteins. Because of the need for de novo synthesis of cell surface SBP-ÎLNGFR, it is not possible to perform AFMACS-based selection of HIV-infected primary T cells very early in infection. Nonetheless, even with a first time point 24 hrs post-infection, we were able to successfully categorise cellular accessory protein targets according to their patterns of regulation in the time course proteomic experiment.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this study Naamati and colleagues measure the proteomic changes experienced by T cells after HIV infection.

I think the experiments are OK and this has been taken into account but a more explicit discussion of this point and whether diluting the virus reduces infectivity as expected is important.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we agree that this is an important point, and it is something we were careful to account for when planning the experiments but did not describe in sufficient detail. We always titer our viruses in the relevant cell type, using a dilution series, to ensure that the number of infected cells is titratable around the range of infectious/transducing units used. We have now added a much more detailed description to the Materials and methods section, which specifically addresses this point:</p><p>âAll viruses and lentivectors were titered by infection/transduction of known numbers of relevant target cells with known volumes of viral stocks under standard experimental conditions, followed by flow cytometry for SBP-ÎLNGFR or EGFP plus/minus CD4 at 48 hrs to identify the fraction of infected cells (f) containing at least one transcriptionally active provirus (SBP-ÎLNGFR or EGFP positive plus/minus CD4 low). The number of infectious/transducing units present was then calculated by assuming a Poisson distribution (where f = 1-e<sup>-MOI</sup>). Typically, a dilution series of each viral stock was tested, and titer determined by linear regression of -ln(1-f) on volume of virus.</p><p>Unlike CEM-T4s, permissivity of infected primary T cells varies between donors/experiments, and the maximum fraction of infected cells in viral dilution series is often around 50% for single round infections, even at high MOI. In practice, we therefore aimed to use sufficient infectious/transducing units to achieve approximately 30% infection, corresponding to a ânominalâ MOI â¤0.5 (assuming a Poisson distribution). This ensured that, even if only 50% of cells were permissive, the âeffectiveâ MOI would still be â¤1.â</p><p>We have also reviewed every incidence of âmultiplicity of infectionâ or MOI in the manuscript and made some small textual alterations to ensure that the usage is clear, consistent and conservative (for instance, where appropriate, referring to âMOI â¤1â rather than âMOI &lt;1â).</p><p>Finally, and as per our responses reviewer #2, we agree that there is the potential for artefacts related to pre-existing proteomic differences in infected (permissive) cells, compared with the mock-infected bulk population.

Itâs not totally clear why T cells have to be activated to make them permissive for HIV infection. SAMHD1 has a lot to do with it and the authors make this point. In these experiments T cell receptor is crosslinked with anti-CD3, anti-CD28 dyna beads. This presumably doesn't happen in vivo, yet T cells are permissive. I imagine the authors have thought about this and I would be interested to hear their thoughts, perhaps in the Discussion section. Is there value in their data comparing unactivated and activated cells to consider what's driving permissivity? How do their data compare with any published literature on in vivo activated T cells, indeed is there any data on this? I'm interested to hear what they think and whether they think their data can be used to illuminate the changes that occur on TCR cross linking that drive permissivity. Would a figure considering this point be valuable?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an interesting area. Determinants of HIV permissivity are clearly not limited to SAMHD1, and may be underpinned by some of the proteomic changes described in this study e.g. associated with SAMHD1-independent metabolic reprogramming (Taylor et al., 2015). Unfortunately, it is difficult to identify individual, novel candidates from this sort of dataset, because (as alluded to by the reviewer) <italic>in vitro</italic> T cell activation typically results in very extensive proteomic remodelling. We have added a figure (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2) and additional text to illustrate this point (subsection âTime-dependent proteomic remodelling during HIV infection of primary T cellsâ):</p><p>âIn total, we quantitated 9070 cellular proteins across 10 different conditions. As previously reported (Geiger et al., 2016), T cell activation itself caused extensive proteomic remodelling, with relative abundances of 2677/9070 (29%) proteins changing by &gt; 2-fold in activated vs resting cells (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2).â</p><p>Rather like the reviewerâs suggestion, a very recent paper did seek to correlate transcriptional and metabolic differences in <italic>ex vivo</italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets with/without sub-maximal <italic>in vitro</italic> activation with differences in susceptibility to HIV infection, again identifying a dependency on levels of metabolic activity (Valle-Casuso et al., 2018). We are not aware of any conceptually similar, high coverage proteomic datasets for comparison with our own. In fact, notwithstanding HIV, we believe that the results presented in this study comprise the most accessible high coverage proteomic atlas of resting vs activated primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells currently available and may certainly be used as such.</p></body></sub-article></article>
