pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33033.001</object-id><p>Cell fate determination during development often requires morphogen transport from producing to distant responding cells. Hedgehog (Hh) morphogens present a challenge to this concept, as all Hhs are synthesized as terminally lipidated molecules that form insoluble clusters at the surface of producing cells. While several proposed Hh transport modes tie directly into these unusual properties, the crucial step of Hh relay from producing cells to receptors on remote responding cells remains unresolved. Using wing development in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> as a model, we show that Hh relay and direct patterning of the 3–4 intervein region strictly depend on proteolytic removal of lipidated N-terminal membrane anchors. Site-directed modification of the N-terminal Hh processing site selectively eliminated the entire 3–4 intervein region, and additional targeted removal of N-palmitate restored its formation. Hence, palmitoylated membrane anchors restrict morphogen spread until site-specific processing switches membrane-bound Hh into bioactive forms with specific patterning functions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33033.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Each cell in a developing embryo receives information that determines what type of body structure it will form. In fruit flies, this information is partly given by a protein called Hedgehog. In the embryo cells that receive it, Hedgehog can trigger a series of events which activate certain genes and thereby regulate structure formation.</p><p>The Hedgehog proteins are produced by a different organizing group of cells: from there they transport within the embryo, creating a gradient. Depending on where a responding cell is in the embryo, it receives a different amount of Hedgehog, which gives the cell its identity. For example, Hedgehog proteins form a gradient across a fruit fly’s developing wing, which creates a visible vein pattern. How Hedgehog proteins form gradients is enigmatic, however, because once produced, they cling to the cells that created them.</p><p>The reason for this unusual behavior is that the two ends of the Hedgehog protein are attached to a different fat molecule. In particular, one extremity is linked to a fat molecule called palmitate. These ends’ fatty additions anchor Hedgehog to the cells that produced them. Then, the tethered proteins gather together to form chain-like clusters where they inactivate each other: the extremity with the palmitate ‘hides’ the portion of the neighboring protein that binds to the receiving cells. It is still unclear how Hedgehog can be activated and released to reach these faraway cells.</p><p>One hypothesis is that an enzyme comes to the clusters and frees the proteins by cutting both of Hedgehog’s fatty anchors. Thanks to how the palmitate tethers Hedgehog to the cell, the protein is positioned in such a way that when the enzyme makes its snip, the binding site on the neighboring Hedgehog gets exposed: this protein is activated and, when also cut by the enzyme, released.</p><p>Here, Schürmann et al. create an array of mutant Hedgehog proteins – for example some without palmitate, some with palmitate that cannot be removed by the enzyme – and study how they affect the development of the wing’s pattern in the fruit fly. Coupled with the imaging of the clusters, these experiments support the hypothesis that the palmitate anchor is necessary so that Hedgehog proteins can be turned on before diffusing away.</p><p>The Hedgehog family of proteins is also present in humans, where it presides over the development of the embryo but is also involved in cancer. Understanding how Hedgehog works in the fruit fly could lead to new discoveries in humans too.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hedgehog</kwd><kwd>morphogen</kwd><kwd>patterning</kwd><kwd>wing</kwd><kwd>proteolysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK1549/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grobe</surname><given-names>Kay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GR1748/4-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grobe</surname><given-names>Kay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GR1748/5-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grobe</surname><given-names>Kay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cells-in-Motion Cluster of Excellence</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FF-2015-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galic</surname><given-names>Milos</given-names></name><name><surname>Grobe</surname><given-names>Kay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proteolysis of lipidated N-terminal peptides that tether Hedgehog morphogens to the surface of source cells is absolutely required for their coupled release and bioactivation in vivo in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hedgehog (Hh) morphogens are dually lipidated 19 kDa proteins that are firmly anchored to the cell membrane of producing cells. Production of all active Hhs begins with autocatalytic cleavage of a precursor molecule by its C-terminal cholesterol transferase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Porter et al., 1996b</xref>). This results in cholesteroylated vertebrate Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh. Next, Hh acyltransferase (Hhat, also designated Skinny hedgehog or Raspberry) attaches a palmitoyl group to a conserved N-terminal cysteine that becomes exposed after signal peptide cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chamoun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee and Treisman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Micchelli et al., 2002</xref>). Hh palmitoylation is critical for later signaling, demonstrated by mutation of the N-terminal cysteine to serine or alanine (C25 &gt; A/S in Shh<sup>C25A/S</sup>, C85 &gt;A/S in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh<sup>C85A/S</sup>) which abolishes palmitoylation and results in morphogen inactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chamoun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dawber et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goetz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kohtz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pepinsky et al., 1998</xref>). However, why N-palmitoylation is required for Hh signaling in vivo is still unclear.</p><p>Another unusual feature of all Hhs is their multimerization at the surface of producing cells which requires binding to the long, unbranched heparan sulfate (HS) chains of cell surface HS proteoglycans (HSPGs) called glypicans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ortmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vyas et al., 2008</xref>). The Hh cholesterol modification is sufficient to drive this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feng et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gallet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koleva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohlig et al., 2011</xref>). Despite membrane anchorage and cell-surface HS association, the multimeric Hhs initiate the Hh response in distant cells that express the Hh receptor Patched (Ptc). The question of how dual-lipidated Hh clusters manage to travel and signal to remote target cells is intensely investigated. The most current models propose lipidated Hh transport on filopodia called cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>) or on secreted vesicles called exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gradilla et al., 2014</xref>) to bridge the distance between Hh-producing and receiving cells.</p><p>Hh release through cell-surface-associated proteases, called sheddases, has also been suggested. In vitro, membrane-proximal shedding not only releases Hh ectodomains from their lipidated N-terminal peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dierker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohlig et al., 2011</xref>) but also activates Hh clusters. This is because N-terminal lipidated peptides block adjacent Hh-binding sites for the receptor Ptc and, thereby, render Hh at the cell membrane inactive. By cleaving these inhibitory peptides during release, sheddases unmask Ptc binding sites of solubilized clusters and thereby couple Hh solubilization with its bioactivation. In this model, the N-palmitate plays two indirect roles for Hh biofunction: first, it ensures reliable membrane-proximal positioning of inhibitory N-terminal peptides as a prerequisite for their efficient proteolytic processing, and second, by its continued association with the cell membrane, it ensures that only fully processed (=activated) Hh clusters are released. This model therefore predicts that inhibition of N-palmitoylation will result in release of inactive soluble proteins with masked Ptc-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jakobs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jakobs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohlig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ohlig et al., 2012</xref>). It also predicts that impaired or delayed processing of dual-lipidated Hh will strongly reduce its release and bioactivity in vivo.</p><p>By uncovering a dominant negative, cell-autonomous function of non-palmitoylated Hh<sup>C85S</sup> in endogenous Hh, we here support the first prediction. By using a series of transgenic <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> lines that express untagged Hh, biologically inactive Hh<sup>C85S</sup>, or N-truncated variants thereof in posterior and anterior wing disc compartments, we provide strong evidence that Hh clusters form by direct protein-protein contact and that unprocessed N-terminal peptides block Ptc binding of adjacent endogenous Hhs. As a consequence, we suggest that, due to their reduced activity, soluble clusters with masked Ptc-binding sites impair direct patterning of the 3–4 intervein region of the wing. Supporting this mechanism, targeted deletion on non-palmitoylated inhibitory peptides restores 3–4 intervein formation. We also show that impaired or delayed processing of lipidated Hh strongly reduces its solubilization, and hence its bioactivity, in vivo. We demonstrate that the HS-binding Cardin-Weintraub (CW) motif serves as the preferred N-terminal Hh processing site in vivo, and that impaired processing of this site completely abolishes direct 3–4 intervein wing patterning. Additional targeted deletion of N-palmitate restores wing patterning, demonstrating that one role of palmitoylated membrane anchors is to prevent the release of un- or incompletely processed Hh clusters in vivo. These genetic data are supported by the nano-structure of Hh clusters as revealed by immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) and provide new insights into how Hh relay from the producing cell membrane or between membranes could be achieved.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Visualization of Hh multimer nano-architecture by IEM</title><p>A first step in decoding possible Hh solubilization modes is to characterize the composition and organization of Hh substrates. It has been previously shown that Hh forms light microscopically visible clusters at the surface of producing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gallet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ortmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vyas et al., 2008</xref>). However, the nanoscale structure of these heteroprotein complexes has not been determined. We therefore expressed Shh together with Hh acyltransferase in HEK293-derived Bosc23 cells to produce authentic cell surface Hh clusters for IEM analysis. To this end, we used several different α-Shh antibodies and secondary antibodies conjugated to 5 nm or 10 nm gold particles. Three α-Shh antibodies detected Shh in variably sized cell surface clusters, with the largest complexes exceeding sizes of 100 nm. Notably, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, many clusters consisted of linear arrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–d</xref>) or contained linear arrays of closely packed gold particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f,g</xref>, arrowheads). Nearest-neighbour analysis of the angular distribution between the three most proximal gold particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>) confirmed that most arrangements were rectangular (90°) or linear (180°), the latter being consistent with Hh multimerization using linear HS chains of glypican HSPGs as templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vyas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schuermann et al., 2018</xref>). Hh linearization during cell-surface multimerization is further consistent with previous structural and biochemical data which suggest a zig-zag arrangement of Hh monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>) and variably sized <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh and vertebrate Shh, ranging from 80 kDa to 600 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jakobs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohlig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ohlig et al., 2012</xref>).

Here, we provide ultrastructural data showing that a significant fraction of Hh assembles into extended linear arrays, consistent with the long unbranched HS-chain structure that scaffolds Hh clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vyas et al., 2008</xref>), observed crystal lattice interactions of the vertebrate Shh ortholog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pepinsky et al., 1998</xref>) and functional in vitro data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohlig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ohlig et al., 2012</xref>). By exploiting the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing development model which is dependent on differential Hh signaling for the formation of distinct wing structures, we further show that N-terminal peptides can block Ptc-receptor-binding of Hh clusters in vivo. Consistent with this, expression of N-truncated Hh mutants in <italic>Drosophila</italic> revealed that inhibitory peptide removal unmasks Ptc-binding sites and mediates direct, high threshold tissue patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Strigini and Cohen, 1997</xref>). Yet, contrary to previous observations on N-truncated Shh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohlig et al., 2011</xref>), we note that all artificially truncated Hh<sup>C85S;Δ</sup> variants were functionally inert. We explain this inactivity by Hh<sup>C85S;Δ</sup> misfolding due to possible intramolecular chaperone function of the 84 amino acid N-terminal Hh pre-peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eder and Fersht, 1995</xref>) or unproductive Ptc binding of artificially truncated proteins as described for monomeric ShhN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Williams et al., 1999</xref>). We currently investigate these possibilities by insertion of a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition site into the putative Hh target site to allow for sequence-specific Hh<sup>C85S</sup> cleavage and activation after controlled TEV protease expression in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harder et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We previously showed that proteolytic conversion targets the N-terminal CW-site in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dierker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ohlig et al., 2012</xref>). We show here that insertion of HA peptides, which displaces this cleavage site distally without affecting Hh N-palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hardy and Resh, 2012</xref>) and HS-dependent multimerization, is sufficient to impair endogenous and transgenic Hh high threshold biofunction in vivo, apparently without affecting low threshold Dpp-mediated Hh activity. Rescue of Hh biofunction by the additional mutation of the cysteine acceptor shows that N-palmitate anchors the unprocessed peptide to the cell membrane to safeguard Hh release. These findings are consistent with enhanced <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh release upon RNAi-mediated knockdown of Hh acyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chamoun et al., 2001</xref>) and increased Shh tethering to cell membranes by palmitate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Konitsiotis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Levental et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, while S- and O-linked palmitate moieties are susceptible to enzymatic deacylation by palmitoyl-protein thioesterases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kakugawa et al., 2015</xref>), amide-linked Hh palmitate is thioesterase resistant. This suggests that Hh relay from posterior subcellular structures – at least at some point – requires proteolytic processing of sheddase-accessible, membrane-proximal terminal target peptides. Support for this idea comes from the published replacement of the C-terminal Hh target peptide with transmembrane-CD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Strigini and Cohen, 1997</xref>). Resulting Hh-CD2 fusion proteins remain permanently membrane associated and generate wings with one single central vein in the region normally occupied by veins L3 and L4, while leaving Dpp-mediated anterior and posterior wing patterning intact. We note that this phenotype is strikingly similar to the <italic>en &gt;<sup>HA</sup>Hh</italic> phenotype described here. Moreover, required Hh transfer between protruding cell-cell contact structures emanating from the Hh-sending and Hh-receiving compartments, called cytonemes, was recently indicated by impaired Ptc signaling and internalization at contact sites with Hh-CD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">González-Méndez et al., 2017</xref>). While the exact mechanism by which Hh is liberated from the posterior cytoneme membrane was not addressed, proteolytic Hh relay and reception at cytoneme contact sites was suggested by the authors, and is supported by the results shown in our work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>).</p><p>In addition to cytoneme contact sites, other subcellular structures of P-compartment cells release Hh from the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). It has been suggested that the Hh gradient in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal discs consists of apical and basolateral secreted pools formed as a consequence of initial apical Hh secretion, subsequent reinternalization, and apical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">D'Angelo et al., 2015</xref>) or basolateral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Callejo et al., 2011</xref>) resecretion, both depending on the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT). Pools of Hh and ESCRT proteins are then secreted together into the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gradilla et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matusek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vyas et al., 2014</xref>), Hh being transported on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>) or inside of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>) basolateral cytonemes, or apically released to promote Hh long-range activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayers et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). While Hh shedding may target several of these pools, timely and reliable paracrine Hh function through proteolytic release and extracellular apical diffusion alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12b’’</xref>) is difficult to envision for two reasons. First, patterning of folded epithelia, such as the <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal disc, poses a problem if spreading were to occur out of the plane of the epithelial cell layer through diffusion or flow, as this would result in morphogen loss into the peripodial space and loss of long-range Hh function. The second limitation is that it normally takes much time for diffusing molecules to travel long distances away from the source because the timescale of diffusion increases with the square of the distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berg, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Müller and Schier, 2011</xref>). Cytoneme- or exosome-mediated basolateral transport, followed by proteolytic Hh relay over short distances at membrane contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">González-Méndez et al., 2017</xref>), would effectively solve both problems, as would the idea of heparan sulfate proteoglycan ‘restricted’ Hh transport at the apical cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Han et al., 2004</xref>). Our future aim is to distinguish between these possibilities. We also aim to characterize the Hh release factor Shifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glise et al., 2005</xref>), a soluble protein with structural similarities to vertebrate Scube2 sheddase enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jakobs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jakobs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jakobs et al., 2017</xref>), to identify the elusive ‘Hh sheddase’. Finally, we are currently investigating the important question of whether C-terminal Hh processing contributes to its in vivo biofunction in the wing disc and in other developing tissues requiring Hh signaling over shorter ranges, such as in the developing eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ma et al., 1993</xref>).</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33033.022</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Model of membrane-dependent and membrane-independent Hh protein signaling from posterior producing cells to distant receiving cells and their potential congruency.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of a third instar wing disc with the Hh-producing posterior compartment labeled in green and the Ptc-receptor-producing anterior compartment labeled in orange.

Cytonemes can extend from posterior Hh-producing cells to deliver Hh to cell surface receptors on receiving anterior cells in their close vicinity, or can meet ‘receiving’ cytonemes extending from more distant anterior cells at defined contact sites (<bold>b′′′′</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">González-Méndez et al., 2017</xref>). Receiving anterior cytonemes that take up Hh from basal subcellular sites of expressing posterior cells for subsequent intracellular transport to the apical pole of anterior epithelial cells have also been described (<bold>b′′′′′</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). However, an explanation is needed about how lipidated Hh can ‘switch’ between sending and receiving cytonemes, or relay from vesicular or cytoneme membranes to their receptors. This problem may be solved by proteolytic Hh processing, resulting in its relay between cytonemes or from producing cell membranes to Ptc receptors on receiving anterior cells. We note that the findings presented in this work do not support the alternative possibility, that is, that different transport modes work in parallel, because HA insertion into the N-terminal Hh processing site abolished (most) Hh-dependent patterning of the L3-L4 intervein region in a dominant-negative manner.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-33033-fig12-v1"/></fig><p>In conclusion, we propose that palmitate-controlled quantitative Hh shedding from the cell surface constitutes an essential step in Hh transmission and high-threshold tissue patterning in vivo. While we have used <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing development to elucidate this molecular process, we expect our results to also be relevant to other Hh-dependent developmental programs and to Hh ligand-dependent cancer induction and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amakye et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Hedgehog; Hh</td><td valign="top">PMID 8252628</td><td valign="top">NCBI Reference sequence: <break/>NM_001038976.1</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Schneider 2</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_Z232">CVCL_Z232</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Bosc23</td><td valign="top">PMID: 11395778</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_4401">CVCL_4401</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct <break/>(Hedgehog)</td><td valign="top">Hh</td><td valign="top">PMID 8252628</td><td valign="top">NCBI Reference sequence: <break/>NM_001038976</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct <break/>(Sonic hedgehog)</td><td valign="top">Shh</td><td valign="top">PMID: 7916661</td><td valign="top">NCBI Reference sequence: <break/>NM_009170</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-Hh</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz</td><td valign="top">d300 catalog # sc-25759</td><td valign="top">2000-fold at 4°C over night</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-Shh</td><td valign="top">R and D Systems</td><td valign="top">Catalog # AF464</td><td valign="top">1000-fold at 4°C over night</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-en</td><td valign="top">DSHB</td><td valign="top">DSHB # 4D9</td><td valign="top">50-fold at 4°C over night</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-LacZ</td><td valign="top">Cappel, MP Biomedicals</td><td valign="top">Catalog # 08559761</td><td valign="top">50-fold at 4°C over night</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-HA</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">catalog # H9658</td><td valign="top">5000-fold at 4°C over night</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Ptc &gt; Gal4</td><td valign="top">Bloomington # 2017</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">En &gt; Gal4</td><td valign="top">FlyBaseID FBrf0098595</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Hh &gt; Gal4</td><td valign="top">Bloomington # 67046</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">34B &gt; Gal4</td><td valign="top">Bloomington # 1967</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly lines</title><p>The following fly lines were used: <italic>Ptc-Gal4</italic> (<italic>ptc&gt;</italic>): <italic>w[*]; P(w[+mW.hs]=GawB)ptc[559.1]</italic>, Bloomington stock #2017; <italic>En-Gal4e16E</italic> (<italic>En&gt;</italic>): <italic>P(en2.4-GAL4)e16E</italic>, FlyBaseID FBrf0098595; <italic>Hh-Gal4</italic> (<italic>hh</italic>&gt;): <italic>w[*];; P(w[+mC]=Gal4)hh[Gal4]</italic>, Bloomington stock #67046; <italic>en(2)</italic>-Gal4 (<italic>en(2)&gt;</italic>): <italic>w<sup>1118</sup>;; P(GMR94D09-Gal4)</italic>, Bloomington stock #48011; <italic>34B-Gal4</italic> (<italic>34B&gt;</italic>): <italic>y<sup>1</sup>w[*];; P(w[+mW.hs]=GawB)34B</italic>, Bloomington stock #1967.

The cells were obtained from C. Klämbt, University of Münster, Germany, and tested negative for mycoplasma. S2 cells were transfected with constructs encoding Hh and HhN variants together with a vector encoding an actin-Gal4 driver by using Effectene (Qiagen) and cultured for 48 hr in Schneider’s medium before protein was harvested from the supernatant. Shh constructs were generated from murine cDNA (NM_009170) by PCR (primers are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Hh acyltransferase cDNA (NM_018194) was obtained from ImaGenes and cloned into pIRES (ClonTech) for bicistronic Shh/Hh acyltransferase coexpression in the same transfected cells.

Bosc23 cells were transfected with PolyFect (Quiagen) and cultured for 48 hr, the medium was changed, and Shh was secreted into serum-free medium for the indicated times. All media were ultracentrifuged for 30 min at 125,000 g, and the proteins were TCA precipitated and analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and western blotting with polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blotted proteins were detected by α-HA antibodies (mouse IgG; Sigma), α-Shh antibodies (goat IgG; R and D Systems), or α-Hh (rabbit IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Incubation with peroxidase-conjugated donkey-α-goat/rabbit/mouse IgG (Dianova) was followed by chemiluminescent detection (Pierce).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Proteolytic processing of palmitoylated Hedgehog peptides specifies the 3-4 intervein region of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All the reviewers found the paper to be potentially interesting: it is well written and deals with an important topic. But after discussion the consensus view was that the conclusions are not yet well enough supported by the experimental data to justify publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. In addition to the need for the experiments described to be more rigorously performed, the proposed model makes several predictions that could be tested to provide further evidence.</p><p>The reviewers were keen to point out that although <italic>eLife</italic> has a policy of rejecting papers where it is judged that more than 2 months will be needed for revisions, were this work to develop into a more mature story, there is no barrier to resubmitting it in the future.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting paper that uses a combination of microscopy, cell biology and <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics to carefully dissect the mechanisms that underlie Hh release and intercellular trafficking. The aim is to resolve the mystery of how a dual lipidated extracellular protein, which oligomerizes and tightly associates with the cell surface of the producing cell, is nevertheless transported across an epithelial field of cells to act on cells at a distance. Several models have been proposed, including trafficking by exosomes or cytonemes, but the conclusion of this paper is that proteolytic shedding of the palmitoylated N-terminal of Hh is the key step.</p><p>This is a thought-provoking and carefully designed set of experiments that lead to some plausible and generally well supported conclusions. It's also an important topic, being a central issue about the regulation of a primary signaling pathway of relevance to development and disease. In general, I think it is appropriate for a journal like <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>It is, however, a complicated story, and one which still leaves quite a few questions: it will not be the last word on this topic.</p><p>Although the experiments are well planned and quite elegant, I found some are hard to follow. I'd suggest more use of diagrams to outline the logic of individual experiments. An example would be the use of Ptc&gt;Hh<sup>C85S</sup> to discriminate between autonomous and non-autonomous effects. People not used to fly developmental biology will find this difficult. Another case would be the Bosc23 cells expressing the differently tagged versions.</p><p>The tone of many of the results is quite definitive and I am not sure this is wholly justified. The results are clear and the interpretations plausible, but I am not convinced that in each case their interpretation is the only way of interpreting the data. The paper would be stronger if the current results were more clearly set in the context of other models, with more discussion about how these results challenge or support different views. Since there are already quite well discussed models of Hh trafficking, the current authors need to leave the reader with as clear as possible a view of what this new paper changes and what are the still outstanding questions.</p><p>One gap I detected was any discussion about the C-terminal cleavage. If I understand their model correctly, this is also essential for release of active Hh. Is the view that the clustering is also necessary for that? And do they envisage that the N- and C-terminal cleavages are done by the same or different proteases? Moreover, what is known about the identity of the proteases should also be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The maturation of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is very atypical as the final mature protein is dually lipid modified, by an N-term palmitic acid and a covalent link with a molecule of cholesterol on the C-terminus. How it is extracted from the plasma membrane bilayer and is transported to long-range targets is still enigmatic.</p><p>The laboratory of Kay Grobe has previously published that SHH is secreted as a multimer in which the lipidated N-term peptide inhibits each adjacent SHH molecule by masking its receptor binding site. The lab has proposed that SHH dual lipids are shed at the surface of producing cells, allowing SHH propagation and activation. The cleavage of these inhibitory peptides therefore unmasks receptor-binding sites of all SHH molecules present in the multimer and permits its propagation and activation of signaling (Ohlig et al., 2011). This last study was performed using in most cases the human kidney cell line HEK293 and its derivative the Bosc23 cell line, which is a model for cancer research. In this new manuscript, the authors use <italic>Drosophila</italic> transgenics to confirm their model. As appropriate controls are missing, I am overall not convinced about the accuracy of the conclusions proposed here. I highlight below my main critics:</p><p>Overexpression of the non-palmitoyled HH variant in wild type HH producing cells of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing discs reveals a dominant negative activity on the final adult wing pattern. The overexpression of this variant in HH receiving cells had only a weak effect. From this difference the authors came to the conclusion that the non-palmitoyled HH variant display a dominant negative effect only when expressed in the same cells with the wild type protein and forming a mixed cluster. This is the basis of the model but I believe several other hypothesis can be proposed (in addition, the fact that not HH target genes are presented in this study weaken the entire picture). For example, the authors do not show that the two drivers express the HH variant at the same level which could explain a differential dominant negative effect. It is also possible that upon forced expression of HH in anterior cells, the protein is not secreted at the correct pole (apical/basal) of the cell and thus cannot bind properly to its receptor. No staining of extracellular HH is provided here. Conventional and extracellular staining of the different HH variants is imperative to get a clearer picture of the behavior of these variants in vivo. One should note that overexpression of this variant has been published previously by several other groups in 2006 and showed an opposite result, with expansion of target genes in both embryos and wing imaginal discs. This is not commented by the authors.</p><p>The authors showed that N-terminal truncation of HH reversed the dominant negative activity of the non-palmitoyled HH variant when expressed in flies. These new variants are not forming multimere but monomere. From this, the authors proposed that the inhibitory effect of unprocessed N-terminal peptides is linked to its presence in the multimere. But it is also possible that these new variants cannot bind properly Hh receptor and thus are just &quot;neutral&quot; with no activity whereas the non-palmitoyled variant binds the receptor but do not activate signaling properly. There are numerous in vitro assays that could be performed to test the author's hypothesis, for example, why not analyze binding affinity of HH variants to Ptc with synthesized peptides?</p><p>Altogether, the authors propose a model in which Hh is secreted to the plasma membrane as dually lipidated molecule, assembled as multimer at the cell surface, and then cleaved for propagation. What is surprising with the author's model is that both lipids need to be cleaved to release Hh functional cluster from producing cells. This is intriguing as numerous labs have shown that expression of a HH variant without lipid is secreted as monomere with no activity. So, the authors would need to resolve two important questions to confirm their model. First, how the cleaved HH molecule is kept assembled as multimer, and second, how the putative multimer of non-lipidated HH proposed here is able to provide signaling activation when a monomeric non-lipidated HH cannot.</p><p>In conclusion, I did not find that the new data provide convincing data and progress for a firm evidence of the model proposed here. I also advise this team to take into more consideration many of the in vivo data already published by other labs, which in several cases appears to be contradictory to the author's own observation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Grobe and colleagues use the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing as the principal model system to analyse the functional role of protein palmitoylation in the N-terminal cysteine of Hedgehog (Hh) signalling molecule. Authors present evidence that mutant forms of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh unable to be palmitoylated (Hh-C85S) or proteolytically processed (HA-Hh) gives rise to a Hh-loss of function adult wing phenotype when overexpressed in Hh-expressing but not responding cells, and that truncation of the N-terminal region of Hh-C85S or a mutation of the N-terminal cysteine in HA-Hh restore these phenotypes. Authors propose that palmitoylation of Hh contributes to the clustering of Hh molecules at the cell membrane of Hh-expressing cells and to the tightly controlled-proteolytic processing and release of an active form of Hh able to bind to Ptc in nearby cells.</p><p>The paper is excellently written and the proposed working model is consistent with the results. Authors have done an excellent and thorough exercise by using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing together with EM data and cell culture experiments and propose a mechanistic model of the biological function of Hh-palmitoylation.</p><p>Major issue:</p><p>Authors conclude that the adult wing phenotype caused by expression of Hh-C85S or HA-Hh in the P compartment is caused by a dominant negative effect on the endogenous Hh molecule (as nicely depicted in their cartoons). Authors should present evidence (1) that the wing phenotype can be rescued by co-expression of a wild type form of Hh, (2) that release of a wild type form of Hh into the adjacent compartment is compromised by Hh-C85S or HA-Hh co-expression (by using available UAS-Hh-GFP transgenic flies), and (3) that anterior cells abutting the P compartment are still sensing Hh signalling (similarly to a tethered form of Hh). Thus, expression of a wild type form of Hh and Hh target genes should be analysed in wing primordia of all genotypes (en-gal4; UAS-Hh-C85S +/- UAS-Hh-GFP and en-gal4; UAS-Hh-A +/- UAS-Hh-GFP) to confirm their proposal. These experiments are feasible.</p><p>Other issues:</p><p>1) Were male of female wings used in their L3-L4/L2-L3 region measurements?</p><p>2) Authors should notice that en-gal4 is also expressed in the A compartment, although at lower levels and later in development. The ability of Hh-C85S and HA-Hh to cause a wing phenotype should be analysed also with the hh-gal4 driver (again available in the fly community).</p><p>3) Expression of Hh-C85S in the ptc domain has not phenotype (Figure 3H) while Hh-HA does Figure 6H, I). Why?</p><p>4) How certain are authors that veins in Figure 6B are L4 and L5 and not L2 and L5. The latter would be expected as these are the ones that depend on Dpp signalling.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Proteolytic processing of palmitoylated Hedgehog peptides specifies the 3-4 intervein region of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Naama Barkai (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p>The editors and reviewers have discussed your paper extensively. Our position is that your work is interesting, provocative and of potential broad significance. On the other hand, there is a clear consensus that you do not currently provide a clear enough description of the controversy and uncertainty that surrounds your interpretation. Your paper does not yet allow a definitive conclusion about the model.</p><p><italic>eLife</italic> is an appropriate journal for this kind of work, but only if the authors are able clearly and explicitly to describe their work in the wider context, allowing a reader to form a balanced picture of where the field stands. We would therefore like to give you one more opportunity to respond to remaining concerns but also – and even more importantly – to rewrite the Introduction and Discussion in a way that gives that broader context and describes to a non-expert reader the uncertainties that remain about your model. What would be a definitive experiment that might prove or refute it? Which areas are you least confident about? Do you have a plan about how to address them? How do you reconcile your ideas with previous apparently contradictory data?</p><p>Science is full of uncertainty and journals like <italic>eLife</italic> should not encourage this to be hidden behind unrealistic confidence or advocacy. If you can amend your paper to provide a fair and balanced description of how the field stands, and how your new data move it forward, but also where the uncertainties still lie, we would be happy to publish it. If you feel that this is not in your best interest and you prefer to argue for your model more directly, our decision would be not to accept it.</p><p>In addition to these general points there are still some remaining specific issues in the reviews below. We would encourage you to address these as fully as possible. Where necessary and appropriate, please acknowledge if they provide significant challenges to your model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>As it is the second time I review this work, I will directly follow the main comments I have put together for the first manuscript.</p><p>My previous comments: &quot;Overexpression of the non-palmitoyled HH variant in wild type HH producing cells of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing discs reveals a dominant negative activity on the final adult wing pattern. The overexpression of this variant in HH receiving cells had only a weak effect. From this difference the authors came to the conclusion that the non-palmitoyled HH variant display a dominant negative effect only when expressed in the same cells with the wild type protein and forming a mixed cluster. This is the basis of the model but I believe several other hypothesis can be proposed (in addition, the fact that not HH target genes are presented in this study weaken the entire picture).”</p><p>The authors made some effort (by providing target gene expression) to answer this first comment. Nevertheless, there are numerous examples in the literature showing that expression of the non-palmitoyled HH variant in the anterior cells of the wing disc leads to a strong dominant negative effect (see for example, Figure D in Lee et al., 2001, Treissman lab). In the same paper, the authors mentioned that overexpression of the non-palmitoyled SHH variant in the posterior region of the mouse limb have no inhibitory effect on endogenous Shh activity, which contradict the model proposed here.</p><p>So, the first proposal presented here, that, in producing cells, non-palmitoyled HH proteins associate in cluster with other HH protein in order to act as a dominant negative variant does not fit with published data. In addition, if this model was correct, one would expect a stoichiometric dominant negative effect of the non-palmitoyled HH variant, which again is not supported by the study of Williams et al., 1999.</p><p>Also, I still do not understand the model based on a &quot;model linear <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh cluster&quot;, which I assume is based on the published crystallographic structure of vertebrate Shh. Surprisingly, a non-palmitoyled SHH does not form multimers, whereas a non-palmitoyled <italic>Drosophila</italic> HH does so (Figure 7 in Chen et al., 2004, Pao-Tien Chuang lab). So it is not clear to me how one can use information from Shh and extrapolate to Hh behavior, knowing that these two proteins behave differently.</p><p>My previous comments: &quot;No staining of extracellular HH is provided here. Conventional and extracellular staining of the different HH variants is imperative to get a clearer picture of the behavior of these variants in vivo.&quot;</p><p>Authors: “As has been pointed out by Art Landers group in Irvine, reliable fluorescence microscopic visualization of free extracellular protein transport is close to impossible:</p><p>Using Dpp as an example, it was estimated that free extracellular protein is unlikely to account for more than 3% of total morphogen, and less than 1% of what is normally visualized by fluorescence imaging (Zhou et al., 2012). […] For all of these reasons, we refrained from trying to visualize extracellular Hh in vivo by fluorescence microscopy, and decided to use clear unambiguous genetic assays instead.”</p><p>I still believe that, a non-detergent staining at 4 °C with Hh and/or HA antibodies will provide information such as: are these Hh variants accumulating at the cell surface of producing cells, how do they distribute in anterior cells compared to wt Hh etc.? There are also tricks (with for example the expression of a Ptc variant which is not internalized) to increase and visualize accumulation of Hh at the cell surface of receiving cells. As previous studies demonstrated that Ptc-binding restricts Hh spreading, one would expect that HhC25S-containing Hh multimers would spread more anteriorly because they bind Ptc less well compared with wild type Hh as suggested by the present model. Also, there are Hh variants presented in this study which are likely not binding to Ptc, such as the HHC85S;delta86-100. Indeed, a deletion of the first 20 NH2 terminal residues of SHH leads to a protein that do not bind to Ptc anymore (Williams et al., 1999).</p><p>My previous comment: “One should note that overexpression of this variant has been published previously by several other groups in 2006 and showed an opposite result, with expansion of target genes in both embryos and wing imaginal discs. This is not commented by the authors.”</p><p>Authors: “We wonder which papers and which variant the reviewer does refer to. If it is HhC85S, we are not aware of any publication claiming that this form has any bioactivity; the general consensus is that non-palmitoylated invertebrate Hh is always completely inactive.”</p><p>Well, both studies described in Gallet et al., 2003 (Figure 2) and Callejo et al., 2006 (Figure 6) showed that embryonic wg, and larval dpp and iro expressions are expanded under overexpression of HhC85S.</p><p>Another issue which needs clarification regards the putative multimer of non-lipidated HH which is proposed in the model here (Figure 5A). How is this multimer able to provide signaling activation whereas a monomeric non-lipidated HH cannot? And how the Hh proteins is kept assembled in the multimer without lipids? This is difficult to understand for me. The authors might be right but their model of cell-surface shedding relies mainly on in vitro experiment in which Shh is expressed at a non-physiological level in cultured cells. So far, if I am correct, in all their &quot;Hh shedding&quot; studies, the authors used the human kidney cell line HEK293 and its derivative the Bosc23 cell line, which is a model for cancer research and which might not mimic physiological conditions.</p><p>Interestingly, the acyl transferase that catalyzes the transfer of a palmitoyl moiety to Hh has been identified in flies. When its homolog is mutated in mice (Chen et al., 2004), digit 3 to 5 (which depends on long range activity of Shh) still form, suggesting that, if Shh assembles in multimere in this mutant, the non-palmitoyled SHH is still able to bind Ptc and activate the pathway. How do the authors reconcile their data with this observation?</p><p>Furthermore, a wide variety of hydrophobic modifications have been shown to increase the potency of Shh when added at the N-terminus of the protein, ranging from long-chain fatty acids to hydrophobic amino acids (Taylor et al., 2001). I do not see how this fits with the authors model.</p><p>Overall, this is a story that is ultimately still not convincing for this reviewer. The model proposed here cannot explain many of the in vivo observations obtained by other labs, some of which are listed above.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Schuermann et al. provide evidence that Hh activity and spread depend on the proteolytic removal of the palmitoylated N-terminal peptide. The paper contains a huge amount of data but there is no &quot;killer experiment&quot; that definitively proves the proposed model. For example, most of the conclusions rest on the use of ectopic expression of mutant versions in a wild-type background instead of replacement of the endogenous hh gene. Moreover, no in vivo localization data is provided.

The aim is to resolve the mystery of how a dual lipidated extracellular protein, which oligomerizes and tightly associates with the cell surface of the producing cell, is nevertheless transported across an epithelial field of cells to act on cells at a distance. Several models have been proposed, including trafficking by exosomes or cytonemes, but the conclusion of this paper is that proteolytic shedding of the palmitoylated N-terminal of Hh is the key step.</p><p>This is a thought-provoking and carefully designed set of experiments that lead to some plausible and generally well supported conclusions. It's also an important topic, being a central issue about the regulation of a primary signaling pathway of relevance to development and disease. In general, I think it is appropriate for a journal like eLife.</p><p>It is, however, a complicated story, and one which still leaves quite a few questions: it will not be the last word on this topic.</p><p>Although the experiments are well planned and quite elegant, I found some are hard to follow. I'd suggest more use of diagrams to outline the logic of individual experiments. An example would be the use of Ptc&gt;Hh<sup>C85S</sup> to discriminate between autonomous and non-autonomous effects. People not used to fly developmental biology will find this difficult. Another case would be the Bosc23 cells expressing the differently tagged versions.</p></disp-quote><p>To improve the manuscript according to this suggestion, illustrations of results or schematics of Hh variants have been added: Figure 2 now shows wing disc stainings for engrailed (expressed in the Hh-producing posterior compartment) and the non-overlapping (anterior) ptc-expression domain to illustrate spatially connected / disconnected transgene expression. Figure 3 is added to the manuscript to confirm that Hh co-clustering constitutes the basis for dominant-negative activity of non-palmitoylated Hh (this is also illustrated). Finally, Figure 6 now contains schematics of the various Hh variants used including their detected cleavage sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The tone of many of the results is quite definitive and I am not sure this is wholly justified. The results are clear and the interpretations plausible, but I am not convinced that in each case their interpretation is the only way of interpreting the data. The paper would be stronger if the current results were more clearly set in the context of other models, with more discussion about how these results challenge or support different views. Since there are already quite well discussed models of Hh trafficking, the current authors need to leave the reader with as clear as possible a view of what this new paper changes and what are the still outstanding questions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that our conclusions sound strong, and we now toned them down and provided additional background, as requested. However, we suggest some words of caution should remain stated in the manuscript, especially that the cloning protocol for generating tagged, membrane tethered Hh-GFP from endosomes/exosomes/cytonemes (1-6) exactly matches a protocol to generate permanent GFP membrane markers (no Hh involved!) for the fluorescence microscopic visualization of cell membranes (7). This fact is important for the correct interpretation of published models that mostly derive from the microscopic analysis of Hh-GFP subcellular localization.</p><p>In addition to that, data from our lab indicates (please refer to our responses to concerns raised by reviewer 2,) that Hh-GFP used in the above publications undergo almost quantitative proteolytic processing in L3 discs in vivo. This proteolytic processing results in a major fraction of cholesteroylated GFP and free (bioactive) Hh. This adds another critical problem to the above models: while the subcellular route of (irreversibly membrane tethered and non-physiological) GFP was followed by fluorescence microscopy, released Hh may have taken an entirely different route that escaped visualization.</p><p>Moreover, we observed that Hh<sup>C85S</sup>-GFP does not behave like untagged Hh<sup>C85S</sup> in vivo, indicating additional problems associated with the tag. Despite these observations, which make us now even more sceptical of models derived from the study of Hh-GFP, and which make it hard for us to draw a useful and honest connection between these models and our data, we added a paragraph on the relevance of our results for these models (Discussion section).</p><p>Finally, we would like to state that additional ongoing studies of flies carrying various deletions, mutations and insertions into the N-terminal Hh target site all recapitulate the data shown in this manuscript, and that electron microscopic analysis detected Hh clusters not associated with the cell membrane in fly wing discs in vivo, indicating their solubilisation. These data can be provided upon request.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One gap I detected was any discussion about the C-terminal cleavage. If I understand their model correctly, this is also essential for release of active Hh. Is the view that the clustering is also necessary for that? And do they envisage that the N- and C-terminal cleavages are done by the same or different proteases? Moreover, what is known about the identity of the proteases should also be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed also study flies carrying deletions, insertions and mutations in the C- terminal Hh stem region (Four independent constructs, plus Hh-GFP used and published by others as mentioned above). In most cases, these mutations abolish all or most Hh bioactivity in vivo, as expected. This is consistent with published data demonstrating that non-steroylated Hh is present and highly active in vitro and in vivo (8). We also have indications that N- and C-terminal cleavages depend on different proteases, and (based on inhibitor studies) that Furin or related proteases target the N-terminal polybasic Hh Cardin-Weintraub-motif. These studies are all in progress, and we therefore ask that none of the preliminary data are to be included into the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] This is the basis of the model but I believe several other hypothesis can be proposed (in addition, the fact that not HH target genes are presented in this study weaken the entire picture).</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we provide en, ptc and dpp target gene expression for palmitoylated and non-palmitoylated Hh variants that is consistent with observed wing phenotypes (Figures 8 and 10) and the mechanism that we propose. Dominant-negative HAHh eliminates (almost) all anterior Hh-regulated en- and ptc-expression, as suggested by wing phenotypes lacking all L3/L4 intervein tissue, while <sup>HA</sup>Hh<sup>C85S</sup> represses target gene expression much less, if compared to HAHh and wild-type discs. This is consistent with the model that HAHh prevents the release of associated Hh from the producing cell surface. Moreover, we now also provide rescue data to confirm our model (please see comments to reviewer 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From this difference the authors came to the conclusion that the non-palmitoyled HH variant display a dominant negative effect only when expressed in the same cells with the wild type protein and forming a mixed cluster […] I believe several other hypothesis can be proposed […] For example, the authors do not show that the two drivers express the HH variant at the same level which could explain a differential dominant negative effect.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in stating that most different driver lines will express transgenes to different levels. Indeed, this is to be expected. In reply, we would like to point out the following:</p><p>First, in our first set of experiments, only one (the same) driver line is used for different Hh variants (cell-tethered <italic>versus</italic> soluble Hh (Figure 3), non-truncated <italic>versus</italic> N- truncated Hh (Figure 4). The reviewer’s criticism thus does not apply to these experiments.</p><p>In our second set of experiments, we indeed changed the expression domain for a given Hh variant (from posterior (en&gt;) to a stripe in the anterior region (Ptc&gt;)).</p><p>Therefore, to address this reviewers concern, we co-expressed both, active Hh and dominant negative <sup>HA</sup>Hh and <sup>HA</sup>Hh<sup>C85S</sup>, in the same compartment (using only one driver for the simultaneous expression of both constructs). As also described in the reply to reviewer 3, these experiments confirmed our model: Dominant negative <sup>HA</sup>Hh<sup>C85S</sup> activities under en-control were rescued by Hh co-expression (because more wt protein was now present in mixed clusters, increasing their activity), yet <sup>HA</sup>Hh dominant negative activities could not be rescued (more Hh was expressed, and relative numbers of membrane tethers of any given cluster reduced, but remaining tethers still prevented release). Along the same line, using the 34B-Gal4 driver for targeted Hh expression in anterior cells, Hh gain-of-function (as indicated by a <italic>Moonrat</italic>-like phenotype (9)) was fully reversed by <sup>HA</sup>Hh co-expression (by preventing Hh release).</p><p>Both experiments (Figure 9 in the revised manuscript) make clear that different driver activities are not the cause for the observed wing phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also possible that upon forced expression of HH in anterior cells, the protein is not secreted at the correct pole (apical/basal) of the cell and thus cannot bind properly to its receptor.</p></disp-quote><p>The hh<italic><sup>Moonrat</sup></italic> allele causes ectopic expression of the <italic>hh</italic> gene in the anterior wing compartment, where normally <italic>hh</italic> is not expressed (9). The resulting phenotype varies between clear overgrowth of the (usually distal) part of the wing to slight disorganization of the wing margin and the addition of extra vein material. The Hh<italic><sup>Moonrat</sup></italic> phenotype demonstrates that bioactive Hh is produced by anterior cells, and 34B-Gal4 driven expression of UAS-Hh in the anterior field (as described above and now shown in the revised manuscript, Figure 9, leading to the same phenotype) confirms this. We can thus not confirm any unspecific effect of anterior Hh expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>No staining of extracellular HH is provided here. Conventional and extracellular staining of the different HH variants is imperative to get a clearer picture of the behavior of these variants in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>As has been pointed out by Art Landers group in Irvine, reliable fluorescence microscopic visualization of free extracellular protein transport is close to impossible: Using Dpp as an example, it was estimated that free extracellular protein is unlikely to account for more than 3% of total morphogen, and less than 1% of what is normally visualized by fluorescence imaging (10). Most of the material that could be visualized is either receptor/surface-associated or internalized. This fact rules out the use of fluorescence microscopy to visualize released Hh. We also decided against visualization of GFP-tagged forms of Hh, because 1) the freely diffusible fraction cannot be visualized, as outlined above, but only the immobile fraction. 2) In our hands, GFP-tagged Hh and Hh<sup>C85S</sup> show extensive proteolytic processing and Hh<sup>C85S</sup>-GFP acts unlike untagged Hh<sup>C85S</sup> in vivo. For all of these reasons, we refrained from trying to visualize extracellular Hh in vivo by fluorescence microscopy, and decided to use clear unambiguous genetic assays instead.</p><p>However, in another project, conventional immuno-electron microscopy of <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing discs was performed that allowed for the specific discrimination between membrane-associated Hh (expressed under en-Gal4 control, large clustered groups, red/white arrowheads) and extracellular yet matrix-associated Hh. The in vivo detection of matrix-associated extracellular protein distant from membranes strongly supports Hh release via shedding, and also support data of others (8). The figure is planned to be part of another manuscript; it is therefore not included in this submission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One should note that overexpression of this variant has been published previously by several other groups in 2006 and showed an opposite result, with expansion of target genes in both embryos and wing imaginal discs. This is not commented by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We wonder which papers and which variant the reviewer does refer to. If it is Hh<sup>C85S</sup>, we are not aware of any publication claiming that this form has any bioactivity; the general consensus is that non-palmitoylated invertebrate Hh is always completely inactive. If the reviewer refers to non-palmitoylated yet (variably) bioactive Sonic Hh in vertebrates, we would like to refer to our recently published work on this topic (11).</p><p>Here, bioactivation of unpalmitoylated Shh is caused by Scube2-assisted N-terminal shedding, which for the first time explains the important yet variable role of N-palmitate for (vertebrate) Hh activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors showed that N-terminal truncation of HH reversed the dominant negative activity of the non-palmitoyled HH variant when expressed in flies. These new variants are not forming multimere but monomere.</p></disp-quote><p>This must be a misunderstanding. As shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1, all cholesteroylated Hh variants used in this study multimerize.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From this, the authors proposed that the inhibitory effect of unprocessed N-terminal peptides is linked to its presence in the multimere. But it is also possible that these new variants cannot bind properly Hh receptor and thus are just &quot;neutral&quot; with no activity whereas the non-palmitoyled variant binds the receptor but do not activate signaling properly. There are numerous in vitro assays that could be performed to test the author's hypothesis, for example, why not analyze binding affinity of HH variants to Ptc with synthesized peptides?</p></disp-quote><p>If we understand the comment correctly, the reviewer refers to the possibility of differential receptor binding/activation N-palmitoylated and non-palmitoylated Hh. However, we would like to point out that the design of all experiments shown in our submitted study is to assay the biofunction of the endogenous protein that is only indirectly affected by our transgenic forms without intrinsic activity – receptor binding of endogenous Hh, and not of our mutants, is therefore our read-out. The possibility of differential receptor binding/activation thus does not apply here. In our re-submitted manuscript, we extend these experiments to using bioactive transgenic Hh together with various palmitoylated and non-palmitoylated recombinant proteins expressed from posterior and ectopic anterior cells – again, this does not affect receiving cells, as it is always the endogenous / recombinant bioactive Hh that is assayed.</p><p>The possibility of non-productive “blockade” of receptors is also not the case, as shown by ptc&gt;Hh<sup>C85S</sup> expression shown in our work: Here, wing patterning is still unaffected. This is described in the original and resubmitted manuscript (Figures 2 and 3, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, impaired Hh binding to its receptor Ptc by unprocessed N-terminal peptides has extensively been demonstrated in the past (12-16), and has recently been confirmed by showing that proteolytic processing effectively truncates and activates non- palmitoylated inactive Sonic Hh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) (11). Palmitate or the N-peptide, therefore, are not directly required for signalling – palmitate merely controls that Sonic Hh clusters are completely N-processed during their release.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33033.025</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>N-terminal Shh processing activates Shh.</title><p>Center: Intermolecular interactions observed in the human Shh crystal structure (pdb:3M1N) (17). Analysis of crystal symmetry mates revealed that N-terminal peptides (amino-terminal amino acids 25-45, blue) wrap around the symmetry-related molecule (green) and interact with its zinc-coordination site, which is the Ptc receptor binding site. Zinc is shown as a black sphere, the yellow surface marks the Ptc-receptor binding site, and the putative sheddase target site (called CW motif) is marked in red. Proteolytic processing during release truncates the protein (bottom) and increases its electrophoretic mobility (left).

Yellow signals in merged blots thus denote N-unprocessed proteins bound by both antibodies, and green signals confirm the removal of N- terminal peptides (arrow).

The suggested experimental approach is therefore not usable, also because authentic multimeric Hh is required for the suggested tests that has never been produced and purified in sufficient amounts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Altogether, the authors propose a model in which Hh is secreted to the plasma membrane as dually lipidated molecule, assembled as multimer at the cell surface, and then cleaved for propagation. What is surprising with the author's model is that both lipids need to be cleaved to release Hh functional cluster from producing cells. This is intriguing as numerous labs have shown that expression of a HH variant without lipid is secreted as monomere with no activity. So, the authors would need to resolve two important questions to confirm their model. First, how the cleaved HH molecule is kept assembled as multimer, and second, how the putative multimer of non-lipidated HH proposed here is able to provide signaling activation when a monomeric non-lipidated HH cannot.</p></disp-quote><p>We note that there is no contradiction: published studies that the reviewer refers to describe HhN<sup>C85S</sup> that had never been lipidated, as it lacked the C-terminal autoprocessing/cholesterol transferase domain and the palmitate acceptor cysteine.</p><p>Such proteins are directly secreted in monomeric (inactive) form, like our protein now shown in Figure 3 of the resubmitted manuscript. Lipidated Hh proteins, in contrast, first associate with the cell surface as a prerequisite to form large multimeric complexes (18), and only then can get proteolytically processed and activated (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Thus, only Hh produced in lipidated form generates multimers, and proteolytic truncation makes the Ptc-binding site available. This has been published (12-14). Continued association of soluble clusters are best explained by the very large protein/protein interface of about 1000 Angström<sup>2</sup> (14).</p><p>The second question implies that the “putative” multimer (actually, it is firmly established that lipidated Hh multimerizes) cannot provide signalling activation, if the monomer cannot. The explanation is given above: Monomeric HhN<sup>C85S</sup> had never been lipidated, is soluble, and secreted without processing. Multimeric Hh had been dual- lipidated and – due to removal of inhibitory N-peptides, see above – becomes activated during release. The mechanism is described in detail in published papers and summarized under answer #7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript by Grobe and colleagues use the Drosophila wing as the principal model system to analyse the functional role of protein palmitoylation in the N-terminal cysteine of Hedgehog (Hh) signalling molecule. Authors present evidence that mutant forms of Drosophila Hh unable to be palmitoylated (Hh-C85S) or proteolytically processed (HA-Hh) gives rise to a Hh-loss of function adult wing phenotype when overexpressed in Hh-expressing but not responding cells, and that truncation of the N-terminal region of Hh-C85S or a mutation of the N-terminal cysteine in HA-Hh restore these phenotypes. Authors propose that palmitoylation of Hh contributes to the clustering of Hh molecules at the cell membrane of Hh-expressing cells and to the tightly controlled-proteolytic processing and release of an active form of Hh able to bind to Ptc in nearby cells.</p><p>The paper is excellently written and the proposed working model is consistent with the results. Authors have done an excellent and thorough exercise by using the Drosophila wing together with EM data and cell culture experiments and propose a mechanistic model of the biological function of Hh-palmitoylation.</p><p>Major issue:</p><p>Authors conclude that the adult wing phenotype caused by expression of Hh-C85S or HA-Hh in the P compartment is caused by a dominant negative effect on the endogenous Hh molecule (as nicely depicted in their cartoons). Authors should present evidence (1) that the wing phenotype can be rescued by co-expression of a wild type form of Hh, (2) that release of a wild type form of Hh into the adjacent compartment is compromised by Hh-C85S or HA-Hh co-expression (by using available UAS-Hh-GFP transgenic flies), and (3) that anterior cells abutting the P compartment are still sensing Hh signalling (similarly to a tethered form of Hh). Thus, expression of a wild type form of Hh and Hh target genes should be analysed in wing primordia of all genotypes (en-gal4; UAS-Hh-C85S +/- UAS-Hh-GFP and en-gal4; UAS-Hh-A +/- UAS-Hh-GFP) to confirm their proposal. These experiments are feasible.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for the very useful suggestion to conduct rescue experiments. The obtained results support our model, and are thus included in the re-submitted manuscript (Figures 9-10).</p><p>1) We now show that, under en-control, <sup>HA</sup>Hh<sup>C85S</sup>-induced wing mispatterning is rescued by transgenic Hh. These experiments confirm that “diluting” inhibitory peptides (by increasing relative amounts of Hh) compensates for the C85S mutation.</p><p>In notable contrast, en&gt;<sup>HA</sup>Hh leads to pharate lethality, and Hh co-expression did not rescue this phenotype (only very few flies hatched, these showed severe wing mispatterning). This is because <sup>HA</sup>Hh (even if “diluted”) still retains associated Hh at the surface of producing cells, confirming our model.</p><p>2) To show that release of a wild type form of Hh into the adjacent compartment is compromised by <sup>HA</sup>Hh<sup>C85S</sup> or <sup>HA</sup>Hh co-expression, we performed the same rescue experiment in the absence of any endogenous Hh expression in the anterior compartment. It is well-established that anterior Hh misexpression (caused by a natural mutation called <italic>moonrat</italic>) causes anterior wing overgrowth. Forced Hh expression in anterior cells under 34B-Gal4 control results in the same phenotype. The expression of inactive Hh<sup>C85S</sup> and HAHh alone do not cause <italic>moonrat</italic> phenotypes, as expected. However, 34B&gt;Hh induced anterior wing overgrowth is completely reversed by HAHh (again by retaining Hh at the surface of producing cells), but Hh<sup>C85S</sup> merely reduced the <italic>moonrat</italic> gain-of-function phenotype (by incomplete blockade of Hh Ptc-binding sites).</p><p>3) En/ptc/dpp target gene expression at the A/P border is consistent with the obtained phenotypes.</p><p>Please note that, for these experiments, we refrained from using suggested Hh- GFP constructs (2) for the reasons given above to reviewer 1 and 2. In our hands, tagged Hh<sup>C85S</sup>-GFP (a) fails to inhibit endogenous Hh function if expressed in the same compartment, indicating impaired function due to the large tag, and (b) undergoes extensive proteolytic processing in larvae. In our hands, Hh-GFP also has a much lower activity if compared to untagged Hh. We thus decided to modify the suggested experimental outline and included the results in the manuscript (Figures 9,10)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other issues:</p><p>1) Were male of female wings used in their L3-L4/L2-L3 region measurements?</p></disp-quote><p>10 male and 10 female (single) wings were analyzed per data set.

Stronger phenotypes were observed for some truncated C85S constructs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).

Our position is that your work is interesting, provocative and of potential broad significance. On the other hand, there is a clear consensus that you do not currently provide a clear enough description of the controversy and uncertainty that surrounds your interpretation. Your paper does not yet allow a definitive conclusion about the model.</p><p>eLife is an appropriate journal for this kind of work, but only if the authors are able clearly and explicitly to describe their work in the wider context, allowing a reader to form a balanced picture of where the field stands. We would therefore like to give you one more opportunity to respond to remaining concerns but also – and even more importantly – to rewrite the Introduction and Discussion in a way that gives that broader context and describes to a non-expert reader the uncertainties that remain about your model. What would be a definitive experiment that might prove or refute it? Which areas are you least confident about? Do you have a plan about how to address them? How do you reconcile your ideas with previous apparently contradictory data?</p><p>Science is full of uncertainty and journals like eLife should not encourage this to be hidden behind unrealistic confidence or advocacy. If you can amend your paper to provide a fair and balanced description of how the field stands, and how your new data move it forward, but also where the uncertainties still lie, we would be happy to publish it. If you feel that this is not in your best interest and you prefer to argue for your model more directly, our decision would be not to accept it.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the opportunity to revise our manuscript “Proteolytic processing of palmitoylated Hedgehog peptides specifies the 3-4 intervein region of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing” according to your suggestions and the final points raised by the reviewers. Following the line of a recently published paper in <italic>eLife</italic>, “Cytoneme-mediated cell-cell contacts for Hedgehog reception” by Gonzales-Mendez et al., we agree that our findings can – and should – be related to previous findings on Hh morphogen release and transport to provide a more balanced view of where the field currently stands. We also added a balanced view on the strengths and weaknesses of our concept and of ways to test them. Specifically, we changed the following parts of our manuscript and marked all changes in red in the related manuscript version called “Schuermann et al. marked changes”.</p><p>1) In the Discussion section, we added a paragraph describing the strengths and weaknesses of our concept of proteolytic Hh release, and we suggest experiments required to support our concept in other tissues. The greatest uncertainty we see in our concept is that N-truncation of non-palmitoylated Hh<sup>C85S</sup> rescues wild-type Hh activity in the wing disc, but does not lead to a gain-of-function (in contrast to the situation in cell culture, as described below). A possible experiment to test this problem is now discussed and (after we had been planning this long before) will be started in the lab.</p><p>2) We also discuss potential congruencies between our concept of proteolytic Hh release and activation and the concepts of others, specifically, the possibility that Hh shedding relays Hh at the cytoneme synapse. To this end, we added Figure 12 to illustrate and describe the various concepts of membrane-dependent and -independent Hh transport.</p><p>3) We reworded the Introduction and Discussion to make our results and conclusions less definitive, as requested by the editors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to these general points there are still some remaining specific issues in the reviews below. We would encourage you to address these as fully as possible. Where necessary and appropriate, please acknowledge if they provide significant challenges to your model.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Overall, this is a story that is ultimately still not convincing for this reviewer. The model proposed here cannot explain many of the in vivo observations obtained by other labs, some of which are listed above.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 1 stated that a paper by Lee et al. (2001) demonstrates that non-palmitoylated Shh variants expressed in the posterior region of the mouse limb have no inhibitory effect on Hh patterning. We were aware of this finding and the fact that ectopic overexpression of non-palmitoylated Shh in the mouse even induces significant gain-of-function phenotypes (Chen et al., 2004; Kohtz et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2001) and that loss of palmitoylase activity in Hhat mutants causes defects that are characteristic of defective Shh signaling, but are less severe than Shh loss-of-function phenotypes (Chen et al., 2004). However, we believe that our model of coupled N-terminal Hh processing and activation does not contradict these data, as claimed by the reviewer, but rather explains them. Non-palmitoylated full-length and inactive Shh<sup>C25S</sup> can be converted into bioactive proteins in vitro simply by their N-terminal processing (Jakobs et al., 2017; Ohlig et al., 2012) (Figure 1). A key facilitator of this conversion is the Shh release factor Scube2 (See supplement of Jakobs et al., 2017). Scube2-assisted N-terminal cleavage could thus help convert dominant negative Shh<sup>C25S</sup> activity in vivo (by blockade of adjacent Ptc-binding sites) into a gain-of-function-phenotype. Notably, <italic>Drosophila</italic> has no Scube orthologs, which may explain persistent Hh<sup>C85S</sup> dominant negative activity in the fly. Because these data and our interpretation have already been published by our group (Jakobs et al., PMID: 28778988), and because we extensively discussed them in a recently accepted review (Manikowski et al., http://www.mdpi.com/2221-3759/6/1/3/pdf), we prefer not to discuss them again in this manuscript.</p><p>We prefer not to discuss several points (mostly raised by reviewer 1) in our revised manuscript for the following reasons:</p><p>1) Reviewer 1 used Figure 4 of Lee et al. (2001) to demonstrate a weak inhibitory effect of anterior overexpression of non-palmitoylated Hh variants in the Drosophila wing. We explain the slight dominant negative ptc-Gal4, Hh<sup>C85S</sup> phenotype by the different integration sites used for transgene generation and the different ptc-driver line used. Yet, exactly as shown in our work, the ptc-Gal4 Hh<sup>C85S</sup> expression phenotype was much weaker than the phenotypes obtained from posterior HhC85S expression, or from <italic>omb</italic>-controlled expression at the a/p border. We thus believe that discussing the isolated ptc-Gal4;Hh<sup>C85S</sup> result out of its experimental context would be misleading.</p><p>2) A second criticism raised by the reviewer is based on a publication of Williams et al. (1999) that does not show stoichiometric suppression of wild-type protein function by non-palmitoylated Hh. We note that the Hhs analyzed in this study were monomeric variants intracellularly expressed in (and purified from) yeast (or <italic>E. coli</italic>). This system thus does not allow for physiological Hh multimerization at the surface of expressing cells and inhibitory interactions <italic>in trans</italic>, as required by our model. Therefore, we see no contradiction.</p><p>3) The reviewer also refers to Figure 7 in Chen et al. (2004), showing size exclusion results obtained from various expressed Hh, Shh, and variants lacking one or both lipidations. Hh<sup>C85S</sup> forms multimers, consistent with the results shown in our manuscript (Figure 1F, Figure 4—figure supplements 1 and 2, Figure 6—figure supplement 1) – and not contradicting them, as claimed. The linear Hh structure is also not extrapolated but supported by a) established Hh multimerization using linear cell-surface HS chains as scaffolds, and b) our IEM data (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). One side note: Most dual-lipidated Hh, Shh, and monolipidated Hh<sup>C85S</sup> and Shh<sup>C25S</sup> proteins analyzed by Chen et al. (2004, Figure 7) were monomeric, probably due to the extended (2-day) serum-free expression conditions used – this result should therefore be interpreted with care.</p><p>4) Williams et al. (1999) were again cited to suggest that N-truncated proteins are inactive, supposedly at odds with our model. Again, we note that only non-physiological <italic>Pichia</italic>- or <italic>E. coli</italic>-expressed monomeric proteins were used in this study. Still, the same paper shows that some N-truncated proteins were bioactive in some in vitro systems, and a non-palmitoylated version lacking 9 N-terminal amino acids was strongly active in vivo (in Ptc-reporter mice, Figure 7 in the work of Williams et al). This demonstrates that in Ptc-reporter mice a) N-palmitate is not directly required for Hh biofunction, consistent with our data, and b) N-truncated non-palmitoylated Hh is bioactive, again consistent with our model.</p><p>5) It was further claimed that full-length unlipidated Hh<sup>C85S</sup> is active, as supposedly shown in two reports (Gallet et al., 2003, Figure 2, and Callejo et al., 2006, Figure 6). If correct, this would be in contrast with our data and with reports of others (Chamoun et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2001). Gallet et al. show that Hh<sup>C85S</sup> retains signaling activity in a different in vivo system and by using the ubiquitous 69BGal4 driver. Still, if expressed under en-control at physiologically relevant sites, the potency of Hh<sup>C85S</sup> to activate <italic>rho</italic>, repress <italic>ser</italic>, and upregulate <italic>ptc</italic> is reduced, as also stated in their figure legend and consistent with our findings. The authors further show that an artificial, permanently membrane-tethered Hh form (Hh-CD2) is completely inactive, consistent with Strigini and Cohen (1997) and <sup>HA</sup>Hh results shown and discussed in our manuscript.</p><p>Figure 6 by Callajo et al. (2006) shows that Hh<sup>C85S</sup>, unlike Hh, fails to induce high-threshold <italic>ptc</italic>- and <italic>en</italic>-expression inside and outside of anterior clones, which is consistent with our findings. <italic>Dpp</italic> and <italic>iro</italic> expression are not expanded but strongly restricted. These two results are very different from the reviewer’s claim that “One should note that overexpression of this variant has been published previously by several other groups and showed an opposite result, with expansion of target genes in both embryos and wing imaginal discs.”</p><p>6) Finally, the reviewer cannot reconcile reported bioactivity of variably N-terminally lipidated Hhs (or Hhs carrying terminal isoleucines) with our model. Our model predicts that the exact nature of the Hh lipid is not crucial, because palmitate can be potentially replaced by any hydrophobic moiety as long as it tethers the protein to the membrane and does not interfere with shedding. Taylor et al. (2001, but also others: Long et al., 2015) show exactly that: As long as the Hh N-terminus is hydrophobic and the cleavage site accessible (unlike for Hh-CD2 and <sup>HA</sup>Hh), the protein is functional. This does not contradict our model but is in line with it (in contrast to the models of others, claiming that palmitate signals directly to the Ptc receptor (Tukachinsky et al., 2016)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Schuermann et al. provide evidence that Hh activity and spread depend on the proteolytic removal of the palmitoylated N-terminal peptide. The paper contains a huge amount of data but there is no &quot;killer experiment&quot; that definitively proves the proposed model. For example, most of the conclusions rest on the use of ectopic expression of mutant versions in a wild-type background instead of replacement of the endogenous hh gene. Moreover, no in vivo localization data is provided. I therefore encourage the authors to raise the possibility that there might be other interpretations of the data and discuss the need for follow up studies of Hh versions expressed from the endogenous locus and visualized in vivo. Despite these concerns, the findings are interesting, provocative and of broad interest.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 2 suggests a need for follow-up studies of Hh versions expressed from the endogenous locus and visualized in vivo. We will try this experiment in the future. We already tried Hh visualization in the Ptc-internalization-deficient ptc<sup>28</sup>TPT fly line from Gary Struhls lab; still, at least in our hands, direct Hh stainings in the wing disc were unsatisfactory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other concerns:</p><p>1) Is the packing seen in Figure 1 really due to Hh or could it be caused by the confirmation and size of the antibodies?</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 2 suggests that the packing seen in Figure 1 might be due to the conformation and size of the antibodies. In the original manuscript and the revised version, Figure 1—figure supplement 1 shows similar data obtained from three different antibodies alone and in combination. To the best of our knowledge, the observed conformations are therefore not a consequence of unspecific antibody clustering.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The evidence that the mutant versions are expressed at similar levels as wild-type Hh is sparse.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to reply that all constructs are present at the same insertion site and that their comparable expression was confirmed in vitro. In vivo confirmation of comparable expression was tried bud did not yield useful results due to excessive background and unspecific protein staining on Westerns. Transgene expression from endogenous sites, as suggested by the reviewer, is certainly a very good idea and will be performed in the future.</p></body></sub-article></article>
