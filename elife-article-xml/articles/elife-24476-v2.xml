whether MR1 can present alternative antigens to other T cell lineages. In healthy individuals we identified MR1-restricted T cells (named MR1T cells) displaying diverse TCRs and reacting to MR1-expressing cells in the absence of microbial ligands. Analysis of MR1T cell clones revealed specificity for distinct cell-derived antigens and alternative transcriptional strategies for metabolic programming, cell cycle control and functional polarization following antigen stimulation. Phenotypic and functional characterization of MR1T cell clones showed multiple chemokine receptor expression profiles and secretion of diverse effector molecules, suggesting functional heterogeneity. Accordingly, MR1T cells exhibited distinct T helper-like capacities upon MR1-dependent recognition of target cells expressing physiological levels of surface MR1. These data extend the role of MR1 beyond microbial antigen presentation and indicate MR1T cells are a normal part of the human T cell repertoire.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24476.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24476.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24476.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>White blood cells called T cells recognize germs and infected cells, and get rid of other cells in the body that look different to healthy cells – for example, tumor cells. These activities all depend on a molecule called the T cell receptor (or TCR for short), which is found on the surface of the T cells. Each TCR interacts with a specific complex on the surface of the target cell. One of the molecules recognized by the TCR is known as MHC class I-related (shortened to MR1). This molecule attracts TCRs to infected cells, but it was not know if the MR1 molecule could attract TCRs to cancer cells too.</p><p>Lepore et al. now show that there are indeed T cells in humans that recognize cancer cells through interaction with the MR1 molecules produced by the cancer cells. This new group of T cells has been named MR1T, and the cells can be easily detected in the blood of healthy individuals. The cells can be classified as a new cell population based on their capacity to recognize MR1 and how they react with different types of cancer cells.</p><p>Importantly, the MR1 that attracts these TCRs is the same in all people, and so the same TCR may recognize MR1-expressing cancer cells from different patients. The next challenge is to identify MR1T cells that recognize and kill cancer cells from different tissues. These studies will hopefully pave the way for new and broader strategies to combat cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

detect a diverse range of microbial and self-antigens, including lipids presented by non-polymorphic CD1 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zajonc and Kronenberg, 2007</xref>), and phosphorylated isoprenoids bound to Butyrophilin 3A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sandstrom et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vavassori et al., 2013</xref>), which stimulate TCR Vγ9-Vδ2 cells, the major population of TCR γδ cells in human blood. The heterogeneous phenotypic and functional properties of these T cells support specialized roles in host protection against infections, cancers, and autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mori et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tyler et al., 2015</xref>). The repertoire of T cells specific for non-peptide antigens was expanded to include mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, which are restricted to MHC I-related protein MR1 and were originally described within mouse gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Treiner et al., 2003</xref>). Elegant functional studies showed that MAIT cells react to different bacteria by recognizing non-proteinaceous antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gold et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Le Bourhis et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, the stimulatory antigens were identified as small riboflavin precursors produced by a wide range of yeasts and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corbett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kjer-Nielsen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soudais et al., 2015</xref>). MAIT cells display one of three alternative semi-invariant TCRs in which the TRAV1-2 gene is rearranged with genes encoding TRAJ33, J12 or J20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gold et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lepore et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reantragoon et al., 2012</xref>), and is combined with an oligoclonal TCR-β repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lepore et al., 2014</xref>). Cells expressing these evolutionary-conserved TCRs are frequent in human blood, kidney and intestine, and comprise a major fraction of T cells resident in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dusseaux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lepore et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tang et al., 2013</xref>). Following activation, MAIT cells release an array of pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines, and can mediate direct killing of microbe-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dusseaux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kurioka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Bourhis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lepore et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tang et al., 2013</xref>). MAIT cells react to a broad range of microbes, but it remains unknown whether the role of MR1 extends beyond presentation of microbial metabolites to MAIT cells.</p><p>MR1 is a non-polymorphic MHC I-like protein that is expressed at low to undetectable levels on the surface of many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miley et al., 2003</xref>). Following bacterial infection, antigen-presenting cells (APC) up-regulate surface expression of MR1 due to protein stabilization upon antigen binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McWilliam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miley et al., 2003</xref>). MR1 is highly conserved across multiple species, with human and mouse MR1 sharing &gt;90% sequence homology at the protein level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Riegert et al., 1998</xref>). To date, the MR1-bound ligands reported to simulate MAIT cells include three ribityl lumazines (RLs), microbial pterin-like compounds displaying a ribitol at carbon 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kjer-Nielsen et al., 2012</xref>), and two unstable adducts formed by non-enzymatic reaction of microbial 5-ribityl amino uracil (5-RAU) with either host-derived or bacterial carbonyls such as glyoxal or methyl-glyoxal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corbett et al., 2014</xref>). RLs bind to MR1 via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with amino acids in the antigen binding cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kjer-Nielsen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patel et al., 2013</xref>), whereas binding of unstable 5-RAU-derivatives requires covalent trapping within the MR1 pocket via formation of a Schiff base with Lysine 43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corbett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patel et al., 2013</xref>). While three additional molecules have also been demonstrated to bind MR1 via the same mechanism, including 6-formyl-pterin (6-FP), acetyl-6-formyl-pterin (Ac-6-FP), and acetylamino-4-hydoxy-6-formylpteridine dimethyl acetal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kjer-Nielsen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soudais et al., 2015</xref>), these compounds lack the ribityl moiety necessary for MAIT cell activation and instead inhibit stimulation by microbial ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corbett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kjer-Nielsen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soudais et al., 2015</xref>). A recent study reported that 6-FP and Ac-6-FP can also stimulate a second population of ‘atypical’ MR1-restricted T cells of unknown function in the blood of healthy human donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gherardin et al., 2016</xref>), but this population, did not express the canonical TRAV1-2 gene which defines MAIT cells. Together, these findings indicate a degree of MR1 plasticity in accommodating diverse chemical structures and suggest that other MR1-restricted T cell populations may exist in vivo.</p><p>Here we report a novel population of MR1-restricted T cells (hereafter termed MR1T cells) that is readily detectable in blood from healthy individuals. MR1T cells express diverse TCRα and β genes and were not able to recognize previously identified microbial or folate-derived ligands of MR1. Instead, MR1T cells recognized self-antigens presented by MR1 and expressed a broad selection of cytokines and chemokine receptors. Functionally, MR1T cells were capable of inducing dendritic cell (DC) maturation and promoted innate defense in intestinal epithelial cells. These findings demonstrate that MR1 can present non-microbial antigens to a novel population of functionally diverse human T cells with potentially wide-ranging roles in human immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MR1-reactive T cells are readily detectable in healthy individuals</title><p>During our previous study on the repertoire of human MAIT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lepore et al., 2014</xref>), we detected an atypical MR1-restricted T cell clone that did not react to microbial ligands. This T cell clone (DGB129) recognized cell lines constitutively displaying surface MR1 (CCRF-SB lymphoblastic leukemia cells, or THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) or A375 melanoma cells (A375-MR1) transfected with an MR1-β2m fusion gene construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lepore et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in the absence of any exogenously added antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Sterile recognition of MR1<sup>+</sup> target cells was fully inhibited by blocking with anti-MR1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and thus resembled the MAIT cell response to <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived antigens assessed in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, DGB129 T cells also failed to recognize the synthetic MAIT cell agonist 6,7-dimethyl-8-D-ribityllumazine (RL-6,7-diMe; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kjer-Nielsen et al., 2012</xref>), differently from a control MAIT cell clone, which instead was stimulated in MR1-dependent manner by this compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Unlike the canonical semi-invariant TCR typical of MAIT cells, DGB129 cells displayed a TCRαβ heterodimer comprising TRAV29/DV5 rearranged to TRAJ23 and TRBV12-4 rearranged to TRBJ1-1. Expression of these TCRα and β genes in a TCR-deficient cell line (SKW-3 T lymphoblastic leukemia) conferred MR1 reactivity in the absence of exogenous antigens comparable to that displayed by DGB129 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), while in control experiments, transduction of TCRα and β genes of a representative MAIT cell clone conferred the ability to recognize the same target cells in MR1-dependent manner only in the presence of <italic>E. coli</italic> antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Collectively, these data highlight a critical role of the TCR in mediating DGB129 cell recognition of MR1-expressing APCs and suggest that MR1 can present non-microbial antigens to T cells other than MAIT cells.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24476.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Recognition of non-microbial antigens by MR1-restricted T cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Surface expression of MR1 by CCRFSB, THP-1 and A375-MR1 cells.

Purified T cells from two healthy donors were labeled with the proliferation marker CellTrace violet (CTV) and stimulated with irradiated A375-MR1 cells in the absence of exogenous antigens. The choice of A375-MR1 cells relied on their potent capacity of inducing sterile DGB129 T cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and their high expression of surface MR1 molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which we reasoned could maximize the chance of stimulating and thus expanding DGB129-like MR1-restricted T cells present in the blood. Amongst the T cells of both donors, we observed a significant fraction of proliferating cells that expressed high levels of the activation marker CD137 following re-challenge with A375-MR1 cells. These activated T cells were sorted and cloned by limiting dilution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Individual T cell clones were then interrogated for their capacity to recognize A375-MR1 and A375 cells lacking MR1 (A375-WT). In both donors we found that a major fraction of T cell clones (126/195 and 37/57, respectively) displayed specific recognition of A375-MR1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>), which was potently inhibited by anti-MR1 blocking mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E</xref>). Staining with TCR Vβ-specific mAbs of 12 MR1-reactive T cell clones revealed that they expressed seven different TRBV chains (TRBV4-3, 6-5/6-6/6-9, 9, 18, 25–1, 28, 29–1) with some of the clones sharing the same TRBV gene. Furthermore, none expressed the TRAV1-2 chain, canonical for MAIT cells. These data suggested that MR1-restricted T cells other than MAIT cells exist in the blood of healthy donors, can express diverse TCRs and are able of clonal expansion following in vitro stimulation in the absence of microbial ligands.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24476.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Isolation of non-MAIT MR1-restricted T cell clones after stimulation with A375-MR1 cells in the absence of microbial antigens.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) FACS analysis of purified T cells previously expanded with irradiated A375-MR1 cells following overnight co-culture with A375-MR1 cells.

Therefore their frequency was estimated by combining flow cytometry analysis after very short-time in vitro stimulation and single T cell cloning experiments. Purified blood T cells from five healthy donors were co-cultured overnight with A375 cells either lacking or over-expressing MR1 and analyzed for the expression of the activation markers CD69 and CD137 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In all of the five donors screened, the percentage of CD69<sup>high</sup>CD137<sup>+</sup> T cells detected was consistently higher after stimulation with A375-MR1 cells (range 0.034–0.072% of T cells) than after co-culture with A375-WT cells (range 0.015–0.032%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). As the two types of APCs differed for MR1 expression, we assumed that MR1-reactive T cells might account for the increased numbers of activated T cells after stimulation with MR1-positive APCs. Using this approach, we estimated that the circulating T cell pool of the analyzed individuals contained A375-MR1-reactive T cells at frequency ranging between 1:2500 (0.072–0.032 = 0.04%) and 1:5000 (0.034–0.015 = 0.019%). This estimated frequency, although representing an approximation, is within the range of the frequency of peptide-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after antigen exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lucas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Su et al., 2013</xref>).

Indeed, 31 out of 96 screened T cell clones (32%) displayed specific reactivity to A375-MR1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which was inhibited by anti-MR1 mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Accordingly, we calculated that the frequency of A375-MR1-responsive T cells among blood T cells of this donor was 1:5000 (0.065 × 0.32 = 0.02%), a value consistent with the previously estimated range. Detailed analysis of representative T cell clones derived from three donors confirmed that they displayed diverse TCRα and β chains and indicated differential expression of CD4, CD8 and CD161 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24476.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Non-MAIT MR1-restricted T cells are readily detectable in the blood of healthy individuals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow cytometry analysis of purified T cells from a representative donor (Donor C) after overnight co-culture with A375 WT or A375-MR1 cells.

Cells were washed daily before being used to stimulate DGB129 MR1T cells and the T cell activation assays were performed in PBS. Both THP-1 and A375-MR1 cells grown in RPMI 1640 or in PBS showed the same stimulatory capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>), thus indicating that medium constituents are not responsible for MR1T cell activation. To directly investigate whether the stimulatory antigens were present in target cells, we performed T cell activation assays using as source of antigen two types of lysates. The first lysate was obtained from in vitro cultured THP-1 cells, while the second one was prepared from mouse breast tumors immediately after resection. Two hydrophobic and four hydrophilic fractions were obtained and tested using as APCs THP-1 cells that constitutively express low levels of MR1. The DGB129 clone reacted only to fraction N4, containing highly hydrophilic compounds isolated from both freshly explanted mouse tumor and in vitro cultured THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>).

The variable combinations and quantities of cytokines expressed by MR1T cells suggested considerable functional plasticity within this population. For example, clone DGA4 secreted large quantities of IL-17A, IL-6, TNF-α and GM-CSF, but failed to secrete the prototypic Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 or IL-13, and thus displayed an ‘atypical’ Th17-like phenotype. In contrast, clone TC5A87 released substantial amounts of VEGF and PGDF-AA, but only little Th1 or Th2 cytokines, and no IL-17A. Notably, four of the seven clones studied (DGB129, CH9A3, DGB70, JMA) displayed a Th2-skewed profile of cytokine release.

While the structure of MR1 resembles that of MHC class I and related proteins, this molecule also displays various unique properties. A key distinguishing feature is the presence of a bulky antigen-binding pocket that binds small molecules via either hydrophilic or hydrophobic interactions. The total volume of the MR1 antigen-binding pocket is far larger than any of the MR1 ligands reported to date, suggesting capacity to bind a wider repertoire of antigens than that known so far. A direct consequence of this is the likely existence of other T cell populations that recognize MR1-presented antigens distinct from the known riboflavin precursors or folate-derivatives. Our study indicates the existence of an unpredicted population of MR1-restricted T cells (designated MR1T cells) outside of the MAIT cell compartment. Human MR1T cell clones displayed differential recognition of a variety of target cells expressing constitutive levels of MR1. The different recognition of target cells might reflect different antigen presentation capacity, although they equally presented microbial antigens to MAIT cells, or the presence of different antigens. Indeed, preliminary antigen purification from a representative target cell line identified two diverse fractions that each stimulated only one of two MR1T cell clones, both derived from the same donor. Although the nature of these molecules remains to be determined, they do not derive from RPMI 1640 culture medium and are present in tumor cells grown in vivo. Furthermore, initial characterization of the molecules showed that they formed stable complexes with plastic-bound MR1 without forming a Schiff base and activated specific MR1T cells without need of APC processing.</p><p>Using as APCs A375 cells expressing high levels of MR1, we estimated that MR1T cells represent between 1:2500 and 1:5000 of total circulating T cells. These frequency estimates could not be determined by direct ex vivo identification of MR1T cells due to lack of specific markers, and were obtained using two approaches. In the first, frequencies were calculated after overnight stimulation and subtracting the frequency of T cells responding to MR1-negative APC to the frequency of cells responding to MR1-positive APC. In another set of experiments the overnight-stimulated T cells were immediately cloned without previous in vitro expansion and individual MR1T cell clones were identified with functional assays. These observations indicated that MR1T cell are readily detectable in the blood of healthy individuals with a size that resembles that of MHC-restricted memory T cells recognizing pathogen-derived peptides in pathogen-exposed individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bacher and Scheffold, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lucas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Su et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). The calculated range of MR1T cell frequency could however be underestimated as A375 cells utilized for the frequency studies might lack some MR1T cell antigens and therefore fail to stimulate a fraction of MR1T cells. Collectively, our data suggest that MR1T cells are not rare T lymphocytes in human blood.</p><p>In some respects, MR1T cells resemble another population of autoreactive T cells restricted to non-polymorphic antigen presenting molecules and present at high frequency in human blood. These T cells react to self-lipids presented by CD1 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Jong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Lalla, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dellabona et al., 2015</xref>). In analogy to MR1T cells, CD1-self-reactive T cells display a polyclonal TCRα and β usage, and are functionally heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Jong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Lalla, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dellabona et al., 2015</xref>). The physiological role of self-reactive T cells restricted by CD1 and MR1 molecules is not well characterized. It is tempting to speculate that these cells might be activated upon metabolic changes in target cells induced by environmental signals, infection or cell transformation.</p><p>It is currently unclear whether MR1T cells can be classified into distinct subgroups based on phenotype, gene expression and function. Since MR1T cells exhibit non-invariant TCRs with diverse antigen specificities, express a wide range of different surface markers and release multiple soluble effector molecules, it will be challenging to identify these cells using MR1 tetramer staining combined with conventional phenotypic analyses. Interestingly, some activated MR1T cell clones also displayed atypical functions for T cells, including the release of growth factors VEGF and PDGF, which support mesenchymal cell proliferation, vasculogenesis, and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carmeliet, 2003</xref>), suggesting a potential role in tissue remodeling processes.</p><p>The functional variety of MR1T cells was also accompanied by differential expression of selected chemokine receptors, suggesting that this population may exert multiple functions at various sites throughout the body. By comparing the transcriptomes of two select MR1T cell clones, we observed that certain transcription factors were expressed in common by both cell types, whereas others were only expressed in a clone-specific fashion. The DGB70 clone was distinguished by expression of the regulator of T cell polarization and proliferation factor <italic>EGR-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thiel and Cibelli, 2002</xref>), the mediator of lymphocyte functional differentiation <italic>JUN-B</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 1999</xref>), and the <italic>SREBF1</italic>, a member of the <italic>SREBP</italic> gene family that regulates sterol synthesis, coordinates tissue-specific gene expression and controls T cell metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kidani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shao and Espenshade, 2012</xref>). In contrast, transcription factors unique to the DGB129 clone were the proliferation and apoptosis regulator <italic>MYC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kress et al., 2015</xref>), involved in metabolic programming of effector T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hough et al., 2015</xref>), and the cAMP responsive element binding factor <italic>CREM,</italic> which modulates T cell effector functions and cytokine gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rauen et al., 2013</xref>). DGB129 cells also uniquely upregulated the <italic>HSP90AB1</italic> heat shock protein gene, which mediates quality control of cytoplasmic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taipale et al., 2010</xref>) and is involved in the regulation of diverse cell surface receptor expression in T and NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2013</xref>). These clear distinctions between the transcriptional profiles of the two MR1T cell clones indicate the use of different strategies for metabolic programming, cell cycle control and functional polarization and suggest specific roles for these cells. As sorted cells expressed equivalent levels of CD25 and CD137 after Ag stimulation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), and released comparable amounts of IFN-γ (not shown) we excluded a different strength of antigen stimulation as possible explanation of the diverse transcriptional profiles observed. Given that the two clones were isolated from the same donor, maintained in identical culture conditions and stimulated with the same type of APC, these divergent gene signatures could reflect unique priming events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boltjes and van Wijk, 2014</xref>).</p><p>A key finding of our study is the reactivity of a large fraction of MR1T cell clones to diverse types of target cells expressing constitutive low MR1 surface levels. These results indicated the capacity of MR1T cells to be activated in physiologic conditions, when limiting amounts of MR1-antigen complexes are available on the target cell surface. As consequence, these data raised the issue of what influence MR1T cells could exert on these target cells. Several MR1T clones tested recognized monocyte-derived DCs, thus suggesting that MR1-restricted reactivity to these APCs is quite frequent among MR1T cells. In addition, experiments performed with a representative MR1T cell clone revealed its capacity to promote monocyte-derived DCs maturation. These data suggest that MR1T cells may modulate DC functions as it has already been reported for other T lymphocyte populations including TCR γδ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Devilder et al., 2006</xref>) and CD1-restricted T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bendelac et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vincent et al., 2002</xref>). Some MR1T cell clones were also stimulated by human intestinal epithelial LS 174 T cells. In co-culture experiments, we observed reciprocal MR1-dependent activation of both MR1T and LS 174 T cells, with the first releasing IFN-γ, IL-8 and IL13, and the latter up-regulating mucin 2 gene expression. These data suggested that some MR1T cells might influence epithelial cell function at mucosal sites, perhaps promoting innate defense and/or inflammation.</p><p>In conclusion, we report that in addition to microbial metabolite-sensitive MAIT cells, human blood contains a novel population of MR1-restricted T cells that can recognize different antigens present in distinct target cells and exhibits a variety of effector functions. Based on the diversity of effector molecules they release following antigen stimulation, MR1T cells might drive inflammatory responses, support B cell function, mediate DC licensing, promote tissue remodeling, and contribute to mucosal homeostasis by enhancing innate defenses at the epithelial barrier. Future studies are therefore likely to uncover the roles of MR1T cells in human diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells</title><p>The following cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection: A375 (human melanoma), THP-1 (myelomonocytic leukemia), J.RT3-T3.5 (TCRβ-deficient T cell leukemia), HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney), CCRF-SB (acute B cell lymphoblastic leukemia), Huh7 (human hepatoma), HCT116 (human colorectal carcinoma), LS 174T (goblet-like cells from colon adenocarcinoma), and EMT6 (mouse breast carcinoma).

The β2m-MR1A and IgG1 PCR products were joined together using two-step splicing with overlap extension PCR and the resulting construct subcloned into the XhoI/NotI sites of the BCMGSNeo expression vector. CHO-K1 cells were transfected with the final construct using Metafectene Pro (Biontex), cloned by limiting dilutions and screened by ELISA for the production of β2m-MR1-Fc fusion protein. Selected clones, adapted to EX-CELL ACF CHO serum-free medium (Sigma), were used for protein production and β2m-MR1-Fc was purified using Protein-A-Sepharose (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer instructions. Protein purity was verified by SDS-PAGE and Western Blot. Protein integrity was assessed by ELISA, using anti-β2M mAb (HB28) as capture and the conformation-dependent anti-MR1 mAb 25.6 as reveling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kjer-Nielsen et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Flow cytometry and antibodies</title><p>Cell surface labeling was performed using standard protocols.

In contrast to current concepts of MR1-restricted T cells, termed mucosal associated invariant T cells that are also MR1-restricted, the MR1-reactive T cells studied here appear to be specific for non-microbial ligands. While the ligands have not been identified at the molecular level, the data presented appear to be quite convincing for this conclusion. As such, the paper provides an advance for understanding of MR1-restricted T cells because they now appear to be specific for non-microbial antigens.</p><p>The manuscript was evaluated by a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors and external referees. After a thorough online discussion, they came to the consensus that the paper is interesting but the authors need to address several major points as outlined below. As is often the case, specific critiques become more apparent with discussion. In any event, the full reviews of the referees are shown for completeness but the authors should be encouraged to submit a revised manuscript that addresses all of the major concerns in the consensus review.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Address the level of MR1 on the APCs that you used. It seems that the A375-MR1 cell expresses very high levels that may explain why others have not seen MR1-restricted stimulation previously.

It seems that the A375-MR1 cell expresses very high levels that may explain why others have not seen MR1-restricted stimulation previously. What happens when you use an APC with lower MR1 expression?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important issue that we realized was not sufficiently clear in the submitted manuscript. We have changed the revised manuscript to clarify this issue (Results subsection “MR1-reactive T cells are readily detectable in healthy individuals” and Discussion, second paragraph).</p><p>It is very important to note that one of the major findings of our study is the reactivity of a large fraction of MR1T cell clones to APCs expressing constitutive, and indeed low, MR1 surface levels, including monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and some tumor cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). These results strongly indicated the capacity of MR1T cells to be activated in physiologic conditions, when limiting amounts of MR1-Ags complexes are exposed on the surface of APCs.</p><p>To test the hypothesis whether MR1-autoreactive non-MAIT T cells exist in peripheral blood, we used as stimulatory cells <italic>ad hoc</italic> APC that do not express classical MHC class I and CD1 molecules and instead express MR1. This approach was chosen, as there was no information in the literature about the existence of MR1-autoreactive T cells and there are no reagents allowing their direct identification, i.e.antigen-loaded tetramers.</p><p>in vitrostimulation of T cells with APC expressing high levels of antigen-presenting molecules or high doses of self-antigens is instrumental to reveal the existence of self- reactive T cells and this aspect has been recently discussed (1). Furthermore, the use of APC expressing large amounts of CD1 molecules was necessary to reveal self-reactive T cells restricted to CD1a and CD1c molecules (2-5).</p><p>In addition, several studies investigating MR1-restricted T cells utilized MR1- overexpressing APCs, which have been also important for the characterization of MAIT cell reactivity and the identification of the recognized antigens (6-8).</p><p><italic>2) Address why CD137 was used as an activation marker. This seems to be atypical as with CD69 expression only, the MR1 specific response was undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</italic> </p><p>The activation marker CD137 (4-1BB) is widely used to selectively identify antigen- specific T cells (9). CD69 also represents a very sensitive surface marker to detect early T cell activation, but if not analyzed in combination with other markers its high sensitivity may have some limitations (9). Firstly, some T cell subsets repetitively stimulated in vivo, i.e.NKT, MAIT cells and some TCR γδ cells, display constitutive high level of CD69 (10-12), which may mask specific stimulation of other less abundant T cell populations. Secondly, CD69 up-regulation by T cells can also occur in response to environmental stimuli, independently of T cell receptor-mediated antigen recognition (13, 14), and therefore it might give false positive results if used to study T cell antigen specificity (9). Thirdly, CD69 expression remains high on T cells repetitively stimulated in vitro(see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> of the revised manuscript), thus becoming poorly informative in revealing antigen-dependent activation.</p><p>By contrast, CD137 expression is highly dependent on recent activation driven by T cell receptor engagement (15) and therefore is more restrictive than CD69 up-regulation to identify antigen-specific T cells (9, 16). In addition, CD137 expression allows selective detection of antigen-specific T cells belonging to CD8<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, and CD8<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>-</sup> subsets, differently from CD40L, which instead limits this capacity to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The reliability of CD137 has been successfully exploited also to identify rare T cells reactive to weak antigens, such as self- or tumor-associated antigens, both ex vivoand following in vitrostimulation (17). We selected the combination of CD69 and CD137 markers because of their complementary properties, the first being more sensitive the second more restrictive.</p><p><italic>3) Describe the epitope recognized by the anti-MR1 blocking antibody. Verify its monospecificity.</italic> </p><p>The specificity of 26.5 anti-MR1 monoclonal antibodies utilized in this study was extensively characterized in two studies (18, 19), although the epitope recognized was not entirely mapped. This antibody cross-reacts with mouse, rat and bovine MR1, because of the high degree of MR1 conservation across these species, but not with any other known antigen-presenting molecules (18, 19). The 26.5 mAbs recognizes a conformation-depend epitope present only on properly loaded, and thus T cell stimulatory, MR1 molecules (18, 19). Importantly, specific mutations of residues present on the α-helices forming the MR1 groove prevent or impair the antibody binding to MR1 (18, 19). The authors interpreted the results as evidence that the binding occurs on the MR1 surface nearby the region interacting with MAIT TCR. This interpretation is in agreement with the mAb capacity of blocking MR1-mediated T cell activation (18, 19). The conformation-dependent specificity of 26.5 mAb has also been confirmed in ELISA using recombinant MR1 proteins by us (Materials and methods, subsection “Soluble recombinant β2m-MR1-Fc fusion protein”) and others (7). The 26.5 mAbs have been largely used to study specific MR1-dependent T cell stimulation. In some of our experiments, not included in the manuscript, we also utilized the 12.2 anti-MR1 mAbs (18, 19), which recognize a different conformation-dependent epitope of MR1. Also this mAb blocked both MAIT and MR1T cell activation similarly to 26.5 mAbs (our unpublished data).</p><p><italic>4) Address the limitations of the transcriptional and cytokine profiles. They appear to have been done on clones in culture for some time.</italic> </p><p>The T cell clones used for the transcriptome studies are derived from the same donor, were kept in culture in identical conditions and stimulation was performed with the same antigen presenting cells on the same day. Despite these identical conditions, important differences were observed, indicating true differences among analyzed cells.</p><p>Great diversity in cytokine release following antigen stimulation was observed, confirming the divergent functions of the tested MR1T cell clones. A concern of the reviewers might be that in vitroexpansion could induce biases in the cytokines released by the clones. According to other studies (20), these biases affect the secretion of IFN-γ and not of other soluble factors. Indeed, T cell clones derived from ex vivosorted Th1, Th2 or Th17 cell populations, retained cytokine secretion patterns typical of the sorted functional subset and acquired the capacity of releasing IFN-γ upon in vitroexpansion (20). Accordingly, our MR1T clones, which were cultivated using conditions similar to those used in other studies (20), maintained differential patterns of cytokine release, and also secreted IFN-γ upon antigen stimulation.</p><p>The transcriptome analysis was performed by comparing T cell clones both in resting state and sorted following stimulation with the same APCs, according to equivalent expression levels of CD25 and CD137 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we also measured the amounts of IFN-γ released by the T cell clones in the same experiments and it was comparable (not shown). Therefore, we are confident that a different strength of antigen stimulation might be excluded as possible explanation of the diverse transcriptional profiles observed.</p><p>The transcriptome analysis was performed using three biological replicates using three MR1T cell clones. We reasoned that with this approach it would have been possible to identify a common transcriptional signature unique to MR1T cells. Unfortunately, the data relative to the third clone did not pass the quality control and were excluded from the analysis. Importantly, despite highly stringent cut-off criteria (FDR&lt;0.05, minimum log<sub>2</sub> fold change &gt;2) great differences were observed.</p><p><italic>5) There are concerns about the accuracy of the precursor frequency estimates. Caveats should be more fully discussed. Also discuss more fully the significance of the estimates.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the method used to estimate MR1T cell precursor frequency has intrinsic limitations, being based on the assumption that the differences in the percentage of CD69<sup>high</sup>CD137<sup>+</sup> activated T cells after stimulation with APCs expressing or lacking MR1 approximate the frequency of MR1T cells. We were aware that some of the T cells included in this gate might not be true MR1T cells. For this reason, we performed a second type of frequency evaluation in which single cell cloning was made after sorting of CD69<sup>high</sup>CD137<sup>+</sup> T cells stimulated overnight with MR1-expressing A375 cells. The analysis of the clones showed that the sorted CD69<sup>high</sup>CD137<sup>+</sup> T cells were enriched in MR1T cells. This second approach revealed similar frequency estimates.</p><p>Other methods are needed to exactly define MR1T cell frequencies. The use of MR1- tetramers is hampered by current lack of knowledge of nature and repertoire size of MR1T stimulatory antigens.</p><p>In conclusion, we are confident that the frequency estimates we obtained, although being approximations, indicated that MR1T cells are readily detectable ex vivoin all the donors analyzed without the need of in vitroexpansion, and therefore suggested that they are not a rare T cell population in the blood of healthy individuals. The revised manuscript has been modified (Results, subsection “MRI-reactive T cells are readily detectable in healthy individuals”, last paragraph and Discussion, second paragraph) to thoroughly discuss these issues.</p><p><italic>6) We expect that the TCR sequences will be submitted if the manuscript is published.</italic> </p><p>The MR1T TCR sequences are subject of a pending patent application. We will make them available for collaborative studies.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there is one quite significant issue that must be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>Although the authors have responded to most of the reviewers' comments, the reviewers and Editors are particularly concerned that the sequences of the TCR are being withheld because of a patent application.
