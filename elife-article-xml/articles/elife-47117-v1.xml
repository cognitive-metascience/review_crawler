pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47117.001</object-id><p>Symbiotic microbes impact the function and development of the central nervous system (CNS); however, little is known about the contribution of the microbiota during viral-induced neurologic damage. We identify that commensals aid in host defense following infection with a neurotropic virus through enhancing microglia function. Germfree mice or animals that receive antibiotics are unable to control viral replication within the brain leading to increased paralysis. Microglia derived from germfree or antibiotic-treated animals cannot stimulate viral-specific immunity and microglia depletion leads to worsened demyelination. Oral administration of toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands to virally infected germfree mice limits neurologic damage. Homeostatic activation of microglia is dependent on intrinsic signaling through TLR4, as disruption of TLR4 within microglia, but not the entire CNS (excluding microglia), leads to increased viral-induced clinical disease. This work demonstrates that gut immune-stimulatory products can influence microglia function to prevent CNS damage following viral infection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47117.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Trillions of bacteria, fungi and viruses live inside us, forming what is known as our microbiota. Far from causing problems, these microbes benefit our health in many ways. Most of our microbiota lives in our gut, yet there is increasing evidence that it can influence how our central nervous system works.</p><p>In particular, these communities of microbes could have a role in multiple sclerosis, a disease that emerges when the immune system attacks the insulating sheath which protects neurons, slowly leading to paralysis. What causes multiple sclerosis is still unknown, but scientists believe that a viral infection could trigger the condition. In the gut, the microbiota helps the immune system to fight off harmful microbes. It is still unclear whether it performs the same role in the central nervous system, and if it can participate in diseases where the immune system harms nerve tissues. Previous studies in mice have looked into how gut microbes influence the development of illnesses similar to multiple sclerosis, but they did not use the type of live viral infection that is thought to trigger the condition.</p><p>In rodents, a strain of mouse hepatitis virus (or MHV) causes symptoms similar to the ones observed in patients with multiple sclerosis: the animals become paralyzed and their neurons’ protective sheaths get damaged. Brown, Soto et al. compared how mice that have their normal microbes, that were raised to be free of microbes, or that were given antibiotics responded to this virus. Animals that were germfree or had received antibiotics had weakened immune responses and failed to clear MHV. These mice also showed worse paralysis. Further experiments revealed that gut microbes protected against paralysis by switching on a cascade of molecular events in a specific type of immune cell in the nervous system. These findings suggest that in the central nervous system, the microbiota is critical to quickly clear viruses and to stop symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis from emerging.</p><p>Our own genetic background, but also lifestyle changes such as diets, antibiotics or sanitation can influence our microbiota. In parallel, in the past decades there has been an increase in the number of diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, in which the immune system turns against the body. The work by Brown, Soto et al. therefore emphasizes the need to maintain a diverse microbial community. For example, species of gut bacteria should be replaced or maintained after antibiotic treatments. However, future work is necessary to understand which of these microbes are protective, and whether they operate during specific timeframes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microbiota</kwd><kwd>TLR 4</kwd><kwd>Neurological damage</kwd><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>JHMV</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000381</institution-id><institution>Multiple Sclerosis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Center Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lane</surname><given-names>Thomas E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator of Pathogenesis</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Round</surname><given-names>June L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HD007491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>D Garrett</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG047956</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Connell</surname><given-names>Ryan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006415</institution-id><institution>Ben B. and Iris M.

Indeed, multiple viruses including Zika and West Nile virus have been associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome and memory deficits, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vasek et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, while Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, narcolepsy and other chronic neurologic diseases have unknown etiologies, initiation by CNS viral infection has been implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Itzhaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kakalacheva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stoessl, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tesoriero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Virtanen and Jacobson, 2012</xref>). Viral infection of the CNS presents unique challenges to the immune system with regard to controlling and eliminating the invading pathogen. Resident cells of the CNS are often targets for infection and are critical in induction of distinct pro-inflammatory signatures that function to attract virus-specific lymphocytes into the CNS. Consequently, a significant hurdle encountered by infiltrating antigen-specific lymphocytes is to eliminate virus from infected cells while limiting damage that may have long-term detrimental consequences to the host. Therefore, defining antiviral host defense mechanisms within the CNS might highlight novel therapeutic interventions to prevent or treat many of these viral-induced neurologic disorders.</p><p>Microglia are resident tissue phagocytes of the CNS that function in host defense and tissue homeostasis. Recent studies have shown that despite their location within the CNS, microglia are impacted by the gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erny et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sampson et al., 2016</xref>). This is consistent with the known function of the microbiota on both immune cell composition and functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belkaid and Hand, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hooper et al., 2012</xref>). Several studies have shown that resident commensal species can instruct the development of regulatory and inflammatory immune cell subsets that aid to limit viral replication at mucosal sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Robinson and Pfeiffer, 2014</xref>). However, while the microbiota inhibits infection by some viruses, it can also enhance the infectivity of other viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Robinson and Pfeiffer, 2014</xref>). Thus, the contribution of the microbiota during viral infection may be distinct for each virus and might be determined by the location of infection. Despite advancements in this area, it remains unclear if microbial commensals impact either host defense and/or disease in response to CNS viral infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The microbiota protects from neurologic damage associated with viral infection</title><p>To characterize the role of the microbiota in a model of viral-induced neurologic disease, 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 specific-pathogen-free (SPF) or germ-free (GF) mice were infected intracranially (i.c.) with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV). JHMV infection results in an acute encephalomyelitis characterized by viral replication in astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bergmann et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greenberg et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blanc et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carbajal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schrauf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stiles et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Virus-specific T cells control viral replication through secretion of anti-viral cytokines and cytolytic activity. Sterile immunity is not achieved and virus persists within white matter tracts in surviving mice that subsequently develop an immune-mediated demyelinating disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bender and Weiss, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bergmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lane and Hosking, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Libbey et al., 2014</xref>). As is typical in this model, infected SPF mice reach peak clinical disease by day 10–11 post-infection (p.i.) followed by a reduction of symptoms that plateaus around day 15–16 p.i. In contrast, GF mice developed worsened clinical disease that peaks at day 13 and is maintained through 21 days p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While GF mice had slightly lower titers of virus within the brain at 7 days p.i., control of viral replication was impaired at 14-days p.i. and virus was still present in GF mice at 21 days p.i., a time point where SPF animals have almost undetectable levels of infectious viral particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Importantly, GF mice displayed enhanced neurologic damage, as there was significantly more demyelination in the spinal cord when compared to SPF animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Immune cells traffic to the CNS in response to JHMV infection and viral clearance is dependent on both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Fewer total cells were recovered from the CNS of GF mice during peak viral infection (day 7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Moreover, there was a reduced frequency of total CNS-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>) and fewer viral-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in GF mice at day 7 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>). These differences are diminished at a chronic timepoint (day 21), as reductions in only total CD8+ and viral-specific CD8+ T cells are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). Inflammation is controlled by the presence of CD4+, FoxP3+ T regulatory (Tregs) cells and previous reports have shown a critical role for these cells in controlling neuroinflammation in response to JHMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anghelina et al., 2009</xref>). GF mice have increased CNS infiltrating Tregs during the acute phase of infection (7 p.i); however, there is a paucity of Tregs in infected GF mice during the chronic demyelinating phase of disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47117.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Perturbations to the microbiota leads to enhanced viral persistence and neuro-autoimmunity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Clinical scoring (left) and the associated area under the curve (right) of SPF (n = 14) or GF C57BL/6 mice (n = 11) following intracranial (i.c.) infection with 150–300 PFU JHMV.

Yet, the effect of commensal microbes on microglial responses to CNS viral infection has yet to be well-tested. Flow cytometric analysis from homogenized brains followed by percoll gradient purification did not demonstrate significant differences in the frequencies of microglia from GF and SPF mice under homeostatic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). One role for microglia is to activate antigen-specific T cell responses through presentation of antigens via MHC molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mack et al., 2003</xref>). We identified a lower frequency of MHC class II + microglia in uninfected GF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Disruption to the microbiota with antibiotics decreases both the percentage of total microglia and the number of MHC expressing microglia in uninfected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>).

However, the effect of microglia depletion on neurologic damage and demyelination remains unclear. To address this, we reduced the number of microglia using a colony-stimulating factor one receptor (CSFR1) inhibitor drug, PLX-3397 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Elmore et al., 2014</xref>).

Feeding TLR ligands to GF mice suggests that these microbial products are sufficient to decrease neurologic disease, and our results show that TLR4 exposure may play a more prominent role than TLR2 signaling in this process. A previous report demonstrated that there is no difference in the morphology of microglia from TLR deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erny et al., 2015</xref>), but antigen presentation in these mice was not evaluated in these studies. Therefore, we infected TLR2<sup>-/-</sup> and TLR4<sup>-/-</sup> animals with JHMV and assayed for neurologic damage.

Importantly, TLR4<sup>-/-</sup> animals had significantly increased demyelination, indicating that TLR4 signals are important for protection from neurologic damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>).

However, these experiments cannot differentiate between TLR4 signals exerting activity within the gut or by directly priming microglia themselves. Indeed, we and others have detected TLR4 agonists within the blood of mice and humans, suggesting that microbial products could be circulating within the blood and thus be available to prime cells at sites distant from mucosal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clarke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Soto et al., 2017</xref>). One study, however, has suggested that LPS is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier; therefore, it is unclear how TLR4 signals derived from the gut microbiota could influence microglia within the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banks and Robinson, 2010</xref>). To initially address this, we performed a bone marrow chimera experiment. Radiation of animals followed by a bone marrow transplant readily replaces cells of the hematopoietic system in most compartments; however, microglia are known to be radio-resistant and therefore, during these experiments the majority of microglia are still from the recipient animal. Based on this, we performed bone marrow chimeras where we transplanted either WT or TLR4<sup>-/-</sup> bone marrow into WT recipients. Similarly to our previous results, we find that TLR4<sup>-/-</sup> animals develop significantly worsened clinical disease compared to WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Moreover, animals receiving either WT or TLR4<sup>-/-</sup> bone marrow, where most of the systemic hematopoietic system is replaced by TLR4 deficient cells, still develop disease similar to WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). To address this using a genetic approach, we crossed TLR4-floxed animals to either a nestin-Cre (CNS<sup>ΔTLR4</sup>) driver or an inducible CX3CR1<sup>CreER</sup> driver (CX3CR1<sup>ΔTLR4</sup>). Nestin is expressed in neural progenitor cells that give rise to neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes of the CNS; however, its expression in microglia has been contentious. To verify that Nestin is not expressed in microglia, we crossed the nestin-Cre driver to a Rosa-lox-stop-lox-eYFP animal, allowing us to fate map nestin (and thus YFP) expressing cells. While we could readily detect YFP expression within the CNS, we were unable to detect YFP+ cells in the microglia fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), further corroborating that nestin-Cre will not drive recombination in microglia. CX3CR1 is expressed in microglia, but also in other immune cells such as dendritic cells in the gut; however, since microglia are long-lived, the use of an inducible system allows for depletion of a gene within microglia, while other immune cells that might be affected by the tamoxifen treatment will rapidly turn over and revert back to a WT status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goldmann et al., 2013</xref>). This is currently the most widely used method to knock genes out within microglia. We verified that this treatment lead to disruption of TLR4 within microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Based on this, CX3CR1<sup>ΔTLR4</sup> animals were tamoxifen treated and subsequently infected 1 month post-tamoxifen treatment. While infection of CNS<sup>ΔTLR4</sup> animals did not demonstrate a difference in clinical disease compared to WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), disruption of TLR4 specifically within microglia, lead to worsened paralysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

However, more recent studies have uncovered that other viruses take advantage of the microbiota to enhance infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Robinson and Pfeiffer, 2014</xref>). Many human neurotropic viral pathogens are associated with the development of neurologic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koyuncu et al., 2013</xref>), yet little is known about the functional contribution of bacterial symbionts in host defense and disease following infection of the CNS. We demonstrate that products from the microbiota are sufficient to prime microglia within the CNS that aid in control of viral replication through microglia-intrinsic TLR4 signaling. Reductions in microbial stimulation through increased antibiotic use and sanitation, has been suggested to contribute to the significant increase in obesity, autoimmunity and even some neurologic disorders in the western world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blaser, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Strachan, 2000</xref>). Supporting this hypothesis, our findings demonstrate that loss of immune stimulation by the gut microbiota leads to failure to control viral replication within the CNS leading to enhanced neuropathy. Thus, loss of protective resident microbes can lead to CNS dysfunction.</p><p>There is an emerging interest in how gut commensals can influence diverse processes within the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fung et al., 2017</xref>). The microbiota influences serotonin production, microglia gene expression patterns, and disease pathology in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erny et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reigstad et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sampson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yano et al., 2015</xref>), yet little is known about the mechanisms by which the microbiota govern these processes. Recent studies have demonstrated that SCFAs are able to influence the gene expression pattern and activation state of microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erny et al., 2015</xref>); however, it is likely that other molecules exist that could influence the maturation of the CNS. We identify that bacterial cell wall products, such as LPS, are sufficient to prime microglia for antigen presentation to effectively clear virus. While microglia have long been known to express TLRs, this family of receptors has been primarily thought to function only during infection. Here, we show that the microbiota regulates microglia function through TLR4, priming these cells to respond to infection. Microglia develop early in embryogenesis from yolk sac progenitors; however, in contrast to macrophages, microglia are long-lived without any significant input from circulating blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prinz et al., 2014</xref>). How TLR ligands signal to cells within the CNS is unclear, however, there is evidence that gut microbial products are found circulating within the blood and could reach the CNS through this route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clarke et al., 2010</xref>). This requires further investigation as some reports have shown that LPS is not able to penetrate the blood–brain barrier. While our data demonstrate that TLR4 signaling by microglia is, in part, responsible for orchestrating microglia activation, the possibility exists that gut microbiota signals can be transmitted to the CNS from the enteric nervous system. Indeed, enteroendocrine cells have been reported to contain neuropods that are directly linked to neuronal cells and are able to transmit signals to the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bohórquez et al., 2015</xref>). It should also be noted that many of our experiments do not differentiate effects of the gastrointestinal microbiota from commensals occupying other niches. Our data from orally administered LPS likely limits effects to gastrointestinal exposure, but oronasalpharyngeal and pneumonic exposure may be occurring as well. Relatedly, differences observed between feeding mice LPS alone, and in combination with Pam3CysK4 suggest that more research could be performed investigating the interaction between multiple TLR ligands on microglia function and response to infection. Moreover, we cannot completely rule out a contribution from gut-resident CX3CR1 cells to this phenotype or other migrating DC populations. Recent studies have demonstrated that cells from the gut can migrate to the brain and there exist a population of long-lived CX3CR1 cells within the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shaw et al., 2018</xref>). As these gut cells are still radio-sensitive (microglia are not), our bone marrow chimera studies argue, that these cells likely only play a minor role, if any. Future investigations using animal models that allow tracking of specific populations from the gut will aid in parsing out these details. Therefore, additional work remains to be performed to identify how gut microbes influence distal CNS processes.</p><p>The clinical implications of this work further support that maintenance of a complex microbial community is important to protect from diseases that plague the western world. Indeed, there are several examples of cell wall molecules from the microbiota that are sufficient to treat disease in various animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mazmanian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vatanen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings support that immunostimulatory LPS is one of these microbial cell wall products. There are several different types of LPS that are derived from the microbiota, indeed LPS from <italic>Bacteriodes</italic> is less stimulatory than LPS derived from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vatanen et al., 2016</xref>); therefore, the composition of the microbiota and the type of immune stimulatory products being delivered by the microbiota likely dictate maturation of microglia within the CNS. Additionally, fatty acids that can be produced by the microbiota are also capable of binding TLR4, and might constitute other relevant agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wong et al., 2009</xref>). As microglia are also known to influence the function of neurons, these results suggest that microbial control of microglia could influence neuronal activity and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Parkhurst et al., 2013</xref>). Much remains to be explored regarding the mechanisms by which gut microbes influence the brain; however, our findings highlight that appropriate microbial stimulation is critical to steady state development of the CNS and optimum neurologic health.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>SPF C57BL/6J, birth antibiotic C57BL/6J, <italic>Rag</italic>1<sup>-/-</sup>, nestin-Cre, <italic>Il1r</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, I<italic>l18</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, <italic>Tlr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, TLR4-floxed, <italic>Cx3xr</italic><sup>CreER</sup>, and <italic>Tlr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were originally purchased from Jackson Labs and reared in the SPF facility at the University of Utah.

Mice were given 1 month after tamoxifen administration to allow for myeloid cell turnover before infection with JHMV.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>TLR2 and 4 detection</title><p>HEK-Blue mTLR2 or mTLR4 cells (InvivoGen) were used according to manufacturer’s instruction to determine serum concentrations of TLR2 and TLR4 and if JHMV signals through TLR4. After passaging according to manufacturer instruction, a flat-bottom 96-well plate was loaded with 25,000 cells per well. Then, 20 μL of PBS, mouse serum, varying dilutions of JHMV or serial dilutions of 0.1 μg/ml LPS added to each well. Cells were incubated for 6 hr, spun down and supernatant isolated. 20 μL of supernatant was then incubated with 180 μL of QUANTI-Blue solution (InvivoGen) for 15 min. Optical density at 620 nm was then measured using a Biotek Synergy H1M plate reader.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Sample size estimation</title><p>No a priori power analyses were used to determine sample size. Sample size was determined by availability of germ-free mice and age/sex matched controls (when applicable). The sample sizes reported here are similar to those in previous literature utilizing the JHMV model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ireland et al., 2008</xref>). Sample sizes are provided within the legend of each figure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistics</title><p>Pair-wise comparison of experimental groups were performed with an unpaired two-tailed Student’ t-test or one-way ANOVA or Mann-Whitney test for viral titers. JHMV disease curves were analyzed using two-way ANOVA or area under the curve analysis. Outlier testing was performed using Grubb’s test for outliers. If an outlier was detected (p&lt;0.05), that data point was omitted from any analysis. All statistics were performed using Prism six software (GraphPad Software).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Dan Carr (Reviewer #1); Susan R Weiss (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Brown et al., have used a murine coronavirus model of central nervous system (CNS) disease, primarily demyelination, to investigate the role of gut microbiota to protect from neurologic damage. This is a thorough study in which much of the data are derived from comparing wild type specific pathogen free (SPF) mice with germ-free (GF) mice as well as SPF mice treated with antibiotics providing two models of comparing disease in mice with a 'normal' microbiota with those microbiota free or with reduced microbiota. The data in this manuscript support the authors’ conclusion that signals from microbiota can activate microglia via TLR4, to increase microglial antigen presentation and subsequent antiviral T cells and protect from virus-induced CNS pathogenesis.</p><p>While the impact of the microbiota on the immune system and the immune response to infection has been described for a variety of pathogen insults, the current undertaking addresses an understudied area – CNS infection and neuroimmunology. Together, the results described herein provide a clear demonstration of the importance of the gut microbiota and a strong foundation for understanding the mechanistic basis through which microbial factors impact CNS disease.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers did not feel that additional experiments are mandatory prior to resubmission. However, the did raise a number of points requiring clarification and discussion prior to publication.</p><p>1) Figure 1 is quite telling as to the impact of the microbiota of the host in minimizing damage associated with MHV infection of the CNS. The authors seem to associate the pathology with the significant reduction in Treg cells residing in the brain. In the latter part of the paper, there is reasonable effort to clearly associate the performance of effector Th1 cells and microglia but there is no explanation as to why there is an early increase in Tregs residing in the brain (day 7 p.i.) and a loss in this cell population during the chronic stages of disease. Also, do germ-free mice ever clear the viral pathogen from the brain as shown in panel B?</p><p>2) In reference to Figure 1—figure supplement 1, although it is likely antibiotic treatment of SPF breeder mice significantly reduced the microbiota in the gut, there is no evidence shown as to how much of the bacterial burden was reduced.</p><p>3) Figure 2 is an important addition to the Results section and demonstrates the critical component to be independent of effector T cell performance in the sensitivity of germ-free mice to MHV CNS infection.</p><p>4) Defining the aberrant immune response in germ-free animals to MHV infection to be at the level of the microglia in results presented in Figures 3-4 especially with the use of the PLX-3397 reagent. A subpopulation of dendritic cells is also found to express CSF1R. Was there a loss of CSF1R-expressing cells in organized lymphoid tissue (e.g., spleen or cervical lymph nodes) in PLX-3397-treated mice? Does the loss of PLX-3397 result in an alteration in the number and frequency of Treg cells in the brain thus, providing more information as to demyelination, loss of microglia, and reflected changes in the Treg cell population as observed in Figure 1?</p><p>5) In Figure 5C and Figure 7A, is there a reason why the authors stopped the experiment at day 9 p.i.? It seems to be inconsistent with that reported in Figure 1 in which the clinical disease does not reach a plateau until 12 days p.i.</p><p>6) The role of TLR4 ligands in reducing the exacerbation of neurologic disease in germ-free mice is impressive. One aspect the authors considered was whether there was a direct activation of TLR4 by JHMV using a reporter line. However, it is unclear whether JHMV killed the HEK-blue reporter cells and therefore, lead to spurious results as reported in Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><p>7) The results included in Figure 7 strongly underscore the critical role of TLR4 in microglia in reducing the severity of disease following JHMV CNS infection. As a side note, it is also nice to see confirmation of nestin expressing cells do not differentiate to microglia.</p><p>8) The murine coronavirus JHM model is well characterized and appropriate for the questions asked. However, since there are many variants of JHM, the authors should briefly describe the pathogenesis of the strain used (JHMV-34; while the publication referenced uses JHMV strain J2.2v-1) and the scale they are using for clinical signs. More specifically does this strain cause damage other than demyelination and is the clinical score a reflection only or mainly of demyelination? Furthermore, microglia are both protective and also a target for viral infection; how does deleting this target of infection effect the pathogenesis? More explanation is needed also of the &quot;DM-MHV&quot; strain that is used for immunization.</p><p>9) Using a mouse microglia cell line to screen the authors identified TLR ligands as the source of priming microglia and found that feeding these ligands to mice resulted in increased T cells in the CNS and reduced disease. The authors should briefly describe the BV2 microglia cell line. They further showed using KO mice and that TLR4 signaling by microglia as a requirement for virus induced demyelination since KO of TLR4 (either global or in in microglia) but not in nestin expressing CNS cells only lead to increased CNS disease.</p><p>10) Re: Figure 5, it is not stated whether there was any difference in response between mice fed LPS and Pam3CysK and LPS alone? Also, it is stated in the subsection “Oral administration of TLR ligands is sufficient to enhance microglia activation and protect from neurologic disease”, that high levels, but not low levels of cytokines etc. could promote increased frequency of MHCII on BV2 cells. The levels actually used in vitro and in vivo are somewhat unclear. Materials and methods describes concentrations ug/ml while Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B (titration) is in molarity. What concentration is used in Figure 5B and Figure 5—figure supplement 1C?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47117.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers did not feel that additional experiments are mandatory prior to resubmission.

Increases in Tregs of GF mice were also reported during the EAE model (Lee et al., 2011). We have not looked past day 21 p.i. to determine if infected GF mice ultimately reduce viral titers below the level of detection. Focused future studies will be necessary to carefully understand a role for microbiota induced Tregs in this model. We have changed our wording to soften the claims that our phenotype is due to changes in Tregs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In reference to Figure 1—figure supplement 1, although it is likely antibiotic treatment of SPF breeder mice significantly reduced the microbiota in the gut, there is no evidence shown as to how much of the bacterial burden was reduced.</p></disp-quote><p>The same antibiotic course was utilized in Soto et al., 2017 (Soto et al., 2017) in which bacterial populations were reduced approximately 100-fold.

In this study, we provide data that CD45+Cdllb+ cells are not diminished in the spleen of PLX3392 treated animals (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), however we did not look at the effects of PLX3397 treatment on sub-populations of DCs within either the brain or secondary lymphatic tissue. Regarding Tregs, we did not evaluate the how PLX3397 influenced Treg infiltration into the CNS of MHV-infected mice. We intend to carry out a focused study on microbiota induced Tregs in future studies using this model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 5C and Figure 7A, is there a reason why the authors stopped the experiment at day 9 p.i.?

However it is unlikely that JHMV killed the HEK-blue reporter cells as MHV strains do not infect human cells. In further support of this, the human protein atlas database also finds little to no expression of CEACAM1 (the receptor for JHMV) on HEK293 cells also</p><p>(<underline>https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000079385-CEACAM1/cell</underline>).

In addition, we acknowledge the reviewer’s concerns on the numerous MHV strains employed by investigators within the field and nomenclature differences. In brief, for this study we used the JHMV strain J2.2v-1 which we have used in the majority of studies published from the Lane laboratory over the previous 20 years. Following intracranial inoculation with this virus into C57BL/6 mice, animals will develop an acute encephalomyelitis characterized by widespread infection of glial cells (with relative sparing of neurons) followed by an immune-mediated demyelinating disease characterized by viral persistence in white matter tracts, glial activation accompanied by infiltration of activated T cells and macrophages into the CNS. The DM-MHV strain of virus was originally developed in the laboratories of Dr. Stephen Stohlman and Dr. Cornelia Bergmann and provided to Dr. Lane. Dr. Lane, along with Drs. Stohlman and Bergmann (Bergmann et al., 2004) have used this virus for induction of robust T cell responses following peripheral injection (Dickey et al., 2016; Glass et al., 2004; Glass and Lane, 2003; Plaisted et al., 2014). We have clarified these issues in both the Results section and Materials and methods and provided additional references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Using a mouse microglia cell line to screen the authors identified TLR ligands as the source of priming microglia and found that feeding these ligands to mice resulted in increased T cells in the CNS and reduced disease.

In both cases, we observed more leukocytes in the brains of infected mice. We also saw more CD4+ T cells in both cases. However, only when feeding both ligands did we observe increased frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and increased numbers of CD8+ T cells. When feeding mice only LPS, we observed increased number and frequency of MHCII+ microglia, this was not observed when feeding both ligands, however. The text has been altered to address this.</p><p>Figure 5B and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 report the effects of treating microglia with 0.10 μg/mL of each SCFA or TLR ligand or 0.25 μg/mL of cytokine. Legends for these Figures have been modified to address this.</p></body></sub-article></article>
