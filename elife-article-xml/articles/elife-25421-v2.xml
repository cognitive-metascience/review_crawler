In female mice, mating creates a long-lasting sensory memory for the pheromones of the stud male that alters neuroendocrine responses to his chemosignals for many weeks. The cellular and synaptic correlates of pheromonal learning, however, remain unclear. We examined local circuit changes in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) using targeted ex vivo recordings of mating-activated neurons tagged with a fluorescent reporter. Imprinting led to striking plasticity in the intrinsic membrane excitability of projection neurons (mitral cells, MCs) that dramatically curtailed their responsiveness, suggesting a novel cellular substrate for pheromonal learning. Plasticity was selectively expressed in the MC ensembles activated by the stud male, consistent with formation of memories for specific individuals. Finally, MC excitability gained atypical activity-dependence whose slow dynamics strongly attenuated firing on timescales of several minutes. This unusual form of AOB plasticity may act to filter sustained or repetitive sensory signals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25421.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25421.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25421.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To navigate social situations, humans and other animals need to remember who they have interacted with and how it went, and adjust their behavior in future encounters accordingly. For example, your physical actions, and even your body’s physiological responses, will be very different when you encounter the last person you kissed instead of the last person you fought with (assuming this is not the same person!).</p><p>Memories of social interactions can have dramatic consequences. For instance, male mice often kill the offspring of other males. Female mice appear to have adopted a countermeasure to avoid losing a litter of pups to such aggression: they will spontaneously abort a pregnancy when exposed to chemicals called pheromones from unfamiliar males. However, when the female mouse is exposed to the pheromones of the male she mated with she maintains her pregnancy. Exactly how the memories of previous social interactions with the males affect the female’s pheromone responses is not fully understood.</p><p>To investigate how the female is able to respond differently to different males, Gao et al. recorded the activity of individual neurons taken from the brain tissue of female mice who had recently mated. The recordings showed that previous social experiences produce learning-related changes in the brain of the female mouse that reduce how sensitively pheromone-detecting neurons respond to the chemical cues of the male mate. This suppresses the signals that the neurons would otherwise send to trigger an abortion in response to male pheromones.</p><p>Gao et al. also used fluorescent tags to identify which neurons in the female’s brain had been activated during mating. This revealed that only those neurons that had been activated by the mate become unresponsive when the cells again encountered his pheromones. This suggests that a set of neurons in the female’s brain records the chemical ‘fingerprint’ of the mate, and can then selectively filter out that mate’s pheromone signals.</p><p>Many other social interactions, such as parenting, are also strongly shaped by experience. The results presented by Gao et al. may therefore offer wider lessons for understanding how the brain targets different behaviors toward specific individuals. It will also be important to investigate how highly arousing experiences cause such powerful memories to form. This could ultimately help us to better understand – and potentially treat – conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25421.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25421.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>olfactory</kwd><kwd>pheromone</kwd><kwd>learning</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>social</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC013894</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davison</surname><given-names>Ian G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Esther A. and Joseph Klingenstein Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davison</surname><given-names>Ian G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006221</institution-id><institution>United States - Israel Binational Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015099</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davison</surname><given-names>Ian G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006221</institution-id><institution>United States - Israel Binational Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013314</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davison</surname><given-names>Ian G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>After mating, female mice form a sensory memory of the stud male's pheromones that correlates with striking changes in responsiveness of the specific neural ensemble activated by her partner.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemical cues detected by the vomeronasal system convey vital social information, influencing diverse behaviors such as reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bruce and Parrott, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kimchi et al., 2007</xref>), pair bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Young and Wang, 2004</xref>), parental care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dulac et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kendrick et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lévy et al., 2004</xref>), individual recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hurst, 2009</xref>), and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chamero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stowers et al., 2002</xref>). Vomeronasal pathways directly access the limbic system, consistent with their powerful role in guiding behavior, and also influence neuroendocrine centers to modify physiological and hormonal status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dulac and Torello, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tirindelli et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>While vomeronasal circuits often elicit stereotyped behavioral and neuroendocrine responses, they can also be highly plastic. In one striking example, female mice imprint on the pheromones of the stud male after mating, where a single salient sensory experience drives long-term changes in both behavior and the flow of sensory information to central targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keverne and Brennan, 1996</xref>). During the first few days after fertilization, chemosignals from unfamiliar males typically block pregnancy by altering the female’s neuroendocrine state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bruce and Parrott, 1960</xref>). However, mating opens a plasticity window that creates a recognition memory for the stud's pheromones, so that they lose their potency and no longer disrupt embryo implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brennan and Keverne, 1997</xref>). Memories are formed within hours, yet last weeks or longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaba and Keverne, 1988</xref>). Sensory imprinting thus offers an opportunity to test the neural basis of a natural form of social learning in a circuit intimately coupled with intraspecies behaviors.</p><p>While social experience acts on diverse neural circuits throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wallace et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2014</xref>), mating-dependent learning is strongly linked to plasticity in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). Imprinting in females leads to local neurochemical changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brennan et al., 1995</xref>), is affected by local lesions or pharmacological interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brennan and Keverne, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaba et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaba and Keverne, 1988</xref>), and can be artificially induced by manipulating AOB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaba et al., 1994</xref>). Pheromonal cues are encoded in AOB by the firing of mitral cells (MCs), whose activity signals gender, hormonal status, and in particular, strain and/or individual identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Shaul et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tolokh et al., 2013</xref>). Well-established theories propose that learning selectively suppresses the firing of the MCs encoding the stud male so that his pheromones no longer drive neuroendocrine responses, precluding pregnancy block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brennan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brennan et al., 1990</xref>). MC suppression is further proposed to depend on strengthening of local inhibitory circuits in AOB, consisting largely of granule cells (GCs) that supply feedback inhibition to MCs through unique dendrodendritic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Isaacson and Strowbridge, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shepherd and Greer, 1998</xref>). Inhibitory plasticity is consistent with both microdialysis data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brennan and Binns, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brennan et al., 1995</xref>) and ultrastructural changes in local interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matsuoka et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2004</xref>).</p><p>Despite well-established models of learning in AOB, many key features of plasticity remain untested. To date, direct measurements of either synaptic plasticity or changes in MC output are lacking. Furthermore, while the selectivity of recognition memories for different individual or strains is thought to rely on changes in specific groups of MC, there are no data linking plasticity to functionally defined cell populations. More broadly, the nature of the neural changes that allow for adaptive changes in social behavior remain poorly understood.</p><p>Here, we examined how mating affects local AOB microcircuits using targeted whole-cell recordings of identified neurons activated by the stud male in ex vivo brain slices. We found pronounced reductions in the sensitivity of AOB neurons, which unexpectedly were mediated by changes in intrinsic excitability rather than synaptic strength, suggesting a novel cellular basis for encoding sensory memories in AOB. MC firing was selectively attenuated in stud-activated neurons, suggesting a potential basis for the specificity of pheromonal learning. Changes in MC responsiveness emerged only when they were activated with repetitive patterns, suggesting that after learning the AOB may dynamically filter repetitive sensory signals from the stud male, lessening their impact on neuroendocrine status on long timescales.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Slow, powerful self-inhibition in AOB MCs</title><p>While inhibitory circuits are intensively studied in main olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Isaacson and Strowbridge, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shepherd and Greer, 1998</xref>), their role in shaping AOB output is not well characterized. We thus began by characterizing self-inhibition in AOB projection neurons, mitral cells (MCs). MC self-inhibition arises from specialized dendrodendritic synapses shared with local interneurons, primarily granule cells (GCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We assessed self-inhibition by driving MC firing with current injection and examining the resulting synaptic feedback from interneurons. Brief, high-frequency spike trains generated only modest feedback inhibition in AOB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>), comparable but smaller on average than reported in main olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abraham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Margrie et al., 2001</xref>). However, pronounced inhibition appeared when we drove MCs with prolonged stimuli similar in duration to chemosensory responses, which can last for tens of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luo et al., 2003</xref>). Extended MC spike trains elicited slowly emerging but robust barrages of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) that contributed to a strong decline in firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). In contrast, the same protocol generated little detectable inhibition in MCs of the main olfactory bulb, where high firing rates were sustained throughout the train. To confirm that synaptic self-inhibition shapes MC output, we eliminated dendrodendritic feedback pathways by blocking fast synaptic transmission with NBQX, APV, and gabazine (5, 25, and 10 µM respectively). Pharmacologically eliminating feedback inhibition typically increased MC firing as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, our results suggest that MC self-inhibition is substantially stronger in AOB than in main olfactory bulb, but also unusually slow to manifest, consistent with the prolonged sensory responses characteristic of this brain area. Such powerful self-inhibition by single MCs could potentially provide a basis for cell-specific control over AOB output, as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brennan and Keverne, 1997</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25421.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>AOB MCs express robust, slowly emerging self-inhibition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of dendrodendritic self-inhibition pathway in MCs.

We compared three groups: (i) mating plus sensory experience with a freely moving male; (ii) sensory-exposed controls without mating; and (iii) naïve mice with no prior male exposure, housed overnight in a fresh cage. We measured GABAergic input onto MCs by recording miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). IPSCs were pharmacologically isolated with 5 µM NBQX, 25 µM APV, and 1 µM TTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The frequency of mIPSCs was strongly increased in mated animals vs. naïve and sensory-exposed groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>; 2.45 ± 0.37 Hz vs. 1.48 ± 0.21 Hz and 1.28 ± 0.17 Hz respectively). The mean amplitude of mIPSCs was similar for all three conditions, suggesting little change in the postsynaptic sensitivity of inhibitory synapses onto MCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>; 56.8 ± 3.5 pA, 54.5 ± 3.8 pA, and 65.8 ± 6.1 pA for naïve, sensory-exposed and mated mice respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). The distribution of amplitudes was shifted towards higher values, however, indicating that a subset of inhibitory synapses may be strengthened. Overall, mating experience substantially increased inhibitory input onto MCs, consistent with prior microdialysis results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brennan et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Because imprinting may act on other elements of the self-inhibition pathway, we also asked whether mating alters excitatory input to granule cells, the most numerous interneurons in AOB. Using current clamp recordings from GCs, we measured the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials (sEPSPs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The frequency of sEPSPs was elevated in mated relative to naïve and sensory-exposed females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–I</xref>; 4.25 ± 0.71, 3.57 ± 0.56, and 6.61 ± 0.63 Hz for naïve, exposure and mated groups respectively). EPSP amplitude was also slightly enhanced in mated compared to naïve animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–K</xref>, 1.08 ± 0.08, 1.18 ± 0.10, and 1.44 ± 0.10 mV for naïve, exposed, and mated groups respectively). These differences were consistent across a wide range of EPSP detection criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Overall, learning also increased excitatory drive onto GCs, enhancing both presynaptic and postsynaptic elements of glutamatergic synapses. Together, our data suggest that imprinting upregulates both the excitatory and inhibitory components of the pathways for MC self-inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Synaptic plasticity lacks cellular selectivity</title><p>Pheromonal recognition memories are specific to particular individuals or strains, implying that learning may act selectively on the particular AOB neurons activated by the stud’s chemosignals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keverne and Brennan, 1996</xref>).

Similarly, there was no significant relationship between the intensity of GFP expression and either amplitude or frequency of EPSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>). These data suggest that mating globally increased synaptic drive onto inhibitory GCs without apparent specificity to the neurons activated by the stud male.</p><p>AOB output is relayed to behavioral and neuroendocrine centers by MCs, suggesting that memory specificity ultimately relies on changes in these neurons. Because MCs were only weakly labeled by Arc-GFP, we used an alternative Fos-GFP reporter line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reijmers and Mayford, 2009</xref>). Fos-GFP levels were low in MCs from naïve females, but were robustly elevated in a subset of MCs after mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Fos-GFP also provided more extensive labeling of GCs, suggesting that it captured similar sets of activated neurons, but at a lower threshold. As in Arc-GFP animals, we found no systematic differences in MC labeling in anterior vs. posterior AOB. In mated females, approximately 28% of detected MCs were classified as GFP(+) (intensity 4X greater than neuropil), but this is likely an overestimate due to difficulty in detecting unlabeled cells with live tissue imaging.</p><p>To correlate inhibitory plasticity with activation of MCs by the stud male, we repeated our measurements of GABAergic input using fluorescence-guided recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). This second dataset revealed a similar two-fold increase in mIPSC frequency in mated vs. naïve animals, with no change in amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–H</xref>; frequency, 0.86 ± 0.14 vs.1.68 ± 0.17 Hz; amplitude, 58.02 ± 5.59 vs. 63.21 ± 5.53 pA for naïve vs. mated respectively). We evaluated the cellular specificity of synaptic changes within mated females by subdividing the second MC dataset into stud-activated GFP(+) neurons and a corresponding GFP(-) population. Similar to interneuron results, there was no significant difference in mean amplitude and frequency of mIPSCs between GFP(-) and GFP(+) MCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I and J</xref>; amplitude, 65.98 ± 8.15 vs. 57.86 ± 3.15 pA for unlabeled and labeled cells respectively; frequency, 1.43 ± 0.18 vs. 1.83 ± 0.31 Hz). Furthermore, there was no apparent correlation between GFP levels and properties of mIPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K and L</xref>). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that a larger sample may have revealed differences. Together, these results further indicate that imprinting drives synaptic plasticity in AOB inhibitory circuits.

To approximate repeated activation of vomeronasal inputs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), we probed MCs with repetitive stimuli spanning several minutes (ten current injections, 20 s in duration, repeated every 60 s). Surprisingly, in mated females MC firing often declined dramatically across successive trials, so that even neurons initially responding with hundreds of action potentials ceased firing entirely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). While firing also declined in some neurons from naïve animals, MC attenuation was greatly enhanced after imprinting, so that average spike counts in mated females dropped to less than half than that of controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–G</xref>; 80 ± 11% vs. 36 ± 8%). Together, our data indicate that mating leads to an unusual form of plasticity in MC membrane properties, where firing gains a striking dependence on recent history of activity.

Together, these results provide the first direct evidence of targeted, cell-specific changes in the AOB ensembles activated by conspecifics during social experience.</p><p>MC firing could potentially be shaped directly by changes in intrinsic membrane properties per se, or by prolonged synaptic inhibition that outlasts the stimulus. To distinguish between these possibilities, we tested MCs after blocking fast synaptic transmission with NBQX, APV, and bicuculline (10, 50, and 10 µM respectively). MC suppression was intact even after eliminating local circuit interactions, indicating that it did not depend on persistent inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We further probed the source of reduced MC firing by examining membrane properties over the course of stimulus trains. Repeated stimulation led to a progressive hyperpolarization of MC membrane potential, both in randomly selected MCs in mated Arc-GFP females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and in GFP(+) MCs in mated Fos-GFP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>).

We used ex vivo recordings to characterize changes in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in AOB, and found broad enhancement of inhibitory circuits consistent with previous findings. However, using targeted measurements from identified mating-activated ensembles, we found that synaptic plasticity lacked the specificity thought to be required for recognition memories. Surprisingly, we also found a striking reduction in intrinsic excitability in MCs, suggesting a novel basis for storing sensory experience in AOB. Notably, this loss of responsiveness was confined to the set of MCs activated during mating, consistent with a stud-selective recognition memory. MC excitability also showed unusual dynamics, where output was initially unchanged, but instead progressively decreased depending on recent activity. Slow MC dynamics may selectively filter repetitive vomeronasal inputs over extended timescales, preserving sensitivity at the onset of behavioral encounters while reducing their longer-term impact on neuroendocrine centers that control hormonal status and pregnancy. Our data are broadly consistent with the selective MC plasticity proposed by existing learning models, but also suggest a new and unanticipated cellular mechanism that complements changes in synaptic strength.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Inhibitory circuits in AOB</title><p>AOB inhibitory circuits had several unique properties. First, we found that MCs could strongly suppress their own firing via pronounced self-inhibition, consistent with robust GABAergic circuits in AOB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Castro et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hendrickson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shpak et al., 2012</xref>). Self-inhibition in MOB MCs, in contrast, had much weaker effects on firing. Self-inhibition in AOB also emerged surprisingly slowly, building over several seconds so that it was strongest during prolonged MC firing on the timescales of natural sensory-evoked responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Shaul et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luo et al., 2003</xref>). The basis for differences in self-inhibition in AOB and MOB are unclear, but may be linked to the prominent role of mGluRs in AOB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Castro et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Our data suggest that mating acts on multiple cell types and synaptic elements in AOB inhibitory circuits. Increased frequency of excitatory input to GCs implies upregulation of release sites in MC dendrites, and enhanced amplitude suggests strengthening of postsynaptic contacts, consistent with the ultrastructural enlargements seen in the postsynaptic density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ichikawa, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matsuoka et al., 2004</xref>). Increased frequency of mIPSCs in MCs also suggests enhanced release of GABA from GCs, which could result either from changes in existing contacts or addition of new synapses via spine growth or recruitment of adult-born interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mak and Weiss, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shingo et al., 2003</xref>). Overall, however, this inhibitory plasticity appeared to have little effect on MC output driven by current injection. Increased release of GABA may be counterbalanced by short-term dynamics during extended firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dietz and Murthy, 2005</xref>), or alternatively changes in mIPSCs may reflect top-down inputs to AOB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fan and Luo, 2009</xref>) that would contribute to spontaneous but not recurrent inhibition.</p><p>Memory formation has long been proposed to rely on inhibitory plasticity, selectively targeting the stud-activated MC population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brennan and Keverne, 1997</xref>). In contrast, we found that synaptic changes were widely distributed across both MCs and GCs with no observable dependence on activation during mating. While non-specific plasticity runs counter to existing models, our data do not exclude a role for inhibition in learning or sensory processing. GABAergic circuits may be differentially recruited in vivo, where complex natural cues activate larger MC populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Shaul et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meeks et al., 2010</xref>). Inhibition strongly shapes MC firing in the intact brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hendrickson et al., 2008</xref>), and descending pathways targeting AOB are likely to further shape sensory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fan and Luo, 2009</xref>). Overall, however, the nonspecific nature of inhibitory plasticity suggests it may act in concert with other, more targeted changes in the AOB circuit.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Plasticity of intrinsic membrane excitability in MCs</title><p>Unexpectedly, imprinting had the most striking effects on intrinsic rather than synaptic properties, suggesting an alternative cellular mechanism for storing sensory experience in AOB. MC suppression was largely absent in naïve females, but was strongly increased by mating in two separate datasets, indicating that it is was generated de novo by learning rather than reflecting pre-existing AOB populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yassin et al., 2010</xref>). Experience-dependent changes in excitability often accompany synaptic modifications in both mammalian and invertebrate systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Daoudal and Debanne, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang and Linden, 2003</xref>). Altered intrinsic properties support homeostatic regulation in cortical circuits, scaling cellular excitability to match long-term changes in sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Desai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Turrigiano, 2011</xref>). Often, learning acts to enhance excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barkai and Saar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang and Linden, 2003</xref>), acting to amplify responses to trained sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mozzachiodi and Byrne, 2010</xref>), or to select neural populations encoding the learned cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yiu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). Here, in contrast, MC excitability was strongly reduced by pheromonal learning. This sign reversal is consistent with the fact that imprinting leads to the suppression of an otherwise default neuroendocrine response to sensory input. Notably, whereas other paradigms lead to static effects on excitability that are immediately apparent on testing, changes in MCs were dynamic and only emerged after strong activation. The excitability of control and ‘imprinted’ neurons was initially indistinguishable, and responses only diverged after cells had experienced substantial firing. MC hyperpolarization accumulated after each trial and lasted for at least 30 min after the offset of stimulation, suggesting that MCs display an unusual and highly integrative form of intrinsic membrane plasticity.</p><p>What are the potential advantages of intrinsic versus synaptic plasticity in AOB? Membrane excitability offers a simple way to selectively control the output of specific MC populations, whereas inhibitory plasticity would need to be coordinated across large sets of GCs, and further targeted to the specific synapses onto stud-encoding MCs. Intrinsic excitability may be particularly well suited to mediating learning in dedicated sensory pathways coupled to stereotyped behavioral responses. Interestingly, firing was similar for labeled and unlabeled MCs after mating, and only diverged after extended activity bouts. Thus, learning does not cause simple, static changes in MC excitability per se, but instead leads to metaplastic effects that impart sensitivity to recent firing levels. In metaplasticity of synaptic strength, experience shifts thresholds for potentiation and depression via changes in NMDA subunit composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Metaplasticity in the intrinsic excitability of MCs may rely on similar changes in composition of membrane conductances. Prolonged hyperpolarization and lowered membrane resistance are consistent with changes in potassium channels such as HCN or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> currents, which are present in main olfactory bulb and linked to learning in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nolan et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stackman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). MC firing is also modulated by intrinsic conductances such as CAN currents, which boost synaptic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shpak et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2012</xref>) and likely contributed to accelerated firing rates seen over the first few seconds of stimulation in our study. Interestingly, this current opposes the MC hyperpolarization we describe here, which appeared to dominate after more prolonged firing bouts and was most readily apparent only after mating. AOB MCs thus appear to express multiple activity-dependent conductances that dynamically modulate their firing depending on the strength, duration, and biological context of activity. The specific conductances responsible for slow MC attenuation remain to be established.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Dynamic MC output and sensory representations</title><p>Dynamic, activity-dependent changes in excitability were a unique feature of AOB MCs.

One potential role is to high-pass filter vomeronasal input, preserving responsiveness at the onset of social interactions for appropriate selection of aggressive, reproductive, or parental behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burns-Cusato et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clancy et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stowers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tachikawa et al., 2013</xref>), while selectively attenuating the long-lasting, repetitive AOB activity required for the neuroendocrine changes that block pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rosser et al., 1989</xref>). Similarly, slow activity dynamics may help reduce interference between memories of different individuals. Different males have similar chemical signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harvey et al., 1989</xref>), suggesting that they may also have overlapping neural representations in AOB. Eliminating the responses of stud-encoding MCs could therefore also disrupt representations of other, non-imprinted animals. Delayed changes in MC output may help minimize the impact of plasticity on overlapping sensory codes.</p><p>Fos-GFP labeling was transient, limiting our measurements to a period of several hours following mating. The effects of mating on pregnancy block, however, can last for many weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brennan et al., 1990</xref>). It will be important to determine whether effects on MC excitability are maintained for similar time periods. Other, more permanent labeling strategies may allow plasticity to be tested at later time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guenthner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sakurai et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, sensory memories could be stored initially in AOB and then transferred to other areas, as seen in other memory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Preston and Eichenbaum, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ross and Eichenbaum, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Mating is one of several biological contexts where animals show flexibility in vomeronasal-guided behaviors. Interestingly, many of these involve the loss of an otherwise default response, similar to the effects of mating. Males shift from attack to parental behaviors towards pups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tachikawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2014</xref>), and regulate aggression towards other males to form dominance hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Behavioral responses to fear-inducing cues such as predator odors can also habituate with repeated presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Takahashi et al., 2005</xref>). It is currently unclear whether the behavioral plasticity seen in other paradigms relies on similar cellular mechanisms in AOB, and it will be important for future work to test this possibility.</p><p>Overall, our data reveal a novel form of cellular plasticity that emerges after mating in females, where slowly emerging, activity-dependent changes in intrinsic excitability dramatically attenuate the output of the MC ensemble activated by the stud male. It will be important for future work to test how this plasticity shapes sensory representations and neuroendocrine responses in behaving animals during social encounters. Changes in MC excitability could also contribute to flexibility in other vomeronasal-mediated behaviors, which often involve suppression of otherwise default sensory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tachikawa et al., 2013</xref>). While the AOB is a critical node in the vomeronasal pathway, MC plasticity likely acts in parallel with broader changes across the extended network of brain regions that couple chemosensory input to behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dulac et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All experiments were performed in sexually mature adult female mice 8–14 weeks of age. Reporter lines were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Arc-GFP, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:007662">IMSR_JAX:007662</ext-link>; Fos-GFP, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:018306">IMSR_JAX:018306</ext-link>) and bred in a C57BI/6J background. Experimental Arc-GFP animals were heterozygous, maintaining a functional Arc allele. Animals were group housed in the Boston University animal care facility on a 12 hr light/dark cycle with <italic>ad lib</italic> access to food and water. Mice were anesthetized ≥5 days prior to experiment and received bilateral ovariectomies followed by implantation of estradiol capsules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakker et al., 2003</xref>). On the experimental day, estrus was induced with progesterone injection (16 µg/g), confirmed by vaginal smears and histological examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caligioni, 2009</xref>). At estrus onset, 3–4 hr after the beginning of the light cycle, females were paired with a sexually experienced male in their home cage for an additional 4 hr for mating and subsequent sensory exposure required for imprinting. Males typically attempted copulation within 20–30 min. Cases where males did not mount females were used as controls for sensory experience without mating. Sedated males were also used for sensory-exposure controls; activity-dependent labeling in the corresponding females was indistinguishable and these data were grouped together. Females in both mated and sensory-exposed groups were ovariectomized and progesterone-primed, while naïve females were unmanipulated. While mating success could not be evaluated in electrophysiology experiments, in a parallel group this protocol resulted in pregnancy in 9 of 11 gonadally intact females. Reproductive encounters were video recorded and scored to quantify mating and behavioral interactions. All procedures were approved by the Boston University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and followed guidelines set by the US National Institutes of Health.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Activity-dependent labeling</title><p>Activity-dependent labeling was visualized in each slice prior to electrophysiological recordings using a two-photon microscope (Prairie Ultima) with 920 nm excitation and a 20X NA 0.95 objective (Olympus), using consistent acquisition settings for laser power and detector gain across sessions. Immediately prior to establishing recordings, we acquired additional image stacks of GFP labeling for the field of view at each recording location (250 µm X 250 µm) using a 40X NA 0.8 objective (Olympus). Intensity was quantified for all detectable neurons using a circular region of interest centered on the soma. GFP intensity was continuously distributed, presumably reflecting graded levels of prior activity. Cells were classified as unlabeled or labeled using a threshold of ≤2 or≥4 times background neuropil fluorescence respectively. For electrophysiological analysis, we performed similar analyses comparing the brightest third and dimmest 50%, 33%, and 25% of our recorded sample. Results were robust to classification threshold and comparison groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Sagittal brain slices of AOB (300 μm thick) were prepared from female mice using a vibratome (VT1200S, Leica, Buffalo Grove IL). To preserve tissue health in adult animals, mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and perfused transcardially with ice-cold modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing, in mM: 124 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO3, 75 sucrose, 10 glucose, 1.3 ascorbic acid, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Slices were maintained using ACSF containing, in mM: 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 20 sucrose, 2 CaCl2 and 1.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, continuously oxygenated with 95/5% O2/CO2. Slices were visualized with a two-photon microscope (Ultima, Prairie Technologies, Middleton WI) using a 40x water immersion objective and Dodt contrast imaging. Whole cell electrodes were pulled to tip resistances of 3–8 MΩ and contained the following internal solutions (in mM): current clamp, 135 K-gluconate, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 0.4 EGTA, 2 MgATP, 0.5 Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, 10 phosphocreatine disodium; voltage clamp, 115 CsCl, 25 TEA-Cl, 5 QX314-Cl, 0.2 EGTA, 4 MgATP, 0.3 Na<sub>3</sub>GTP and 10 phosphocreatine disodium. Alexa 594 was added to the internal solution to confirm cell identity in targeted recordings. Membrane voltage was not corrected for liquid junction potential. Electrophysiological data was collected at 29.5°C with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and digitized at 10 kHz (National Instruments PCI-6321) using custom Matlab routines (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Action potential detection and analysis was performed using custom Matlab routines detecting zero-crossing membrane potentials. Changes in firing with repeated stimulation were quantified as a suppression index, calculated as the ratio of firing on the 10th vs. first trial. Synaptic currents and EPSPs were detected and analyzed in Igor Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, Oregon) using Taro Tools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sites.google.com/site/tarotoolsmember/">https://sites.google.com/site/tarotoolsmember/</ext-link>). Thresholds were chosen to maximize detection of synaptic events while excluding false positives due to recording noise. Thresholds were set at 10 pA for mIPSCs in MCs, and 0.25 mV for EPSPs in GCs. In both cases we estimate we detected at least 95–98% of events while limiting false positives to &lt;1%, determined by visual inspection. GC results were consistent across a wide range of detection criteria. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma/Aldrich (NBQX), Tocris (BMI), and Alomone Labs (TTX). Receptor antagonists (APV, NBQX and Gabazine) were applied by bath perfusion.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Naoshige Uchida (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have also agreed to reveal their identity: Tim Holy (Reviewer #2) and Joseph F Bergan (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary</p><p>Gao and colleagues examine neuronal plasticity in the context of &quot;pregnancy block&quot; (a.k.a. the &quot;Bruce effect&quot;), which involves a form of olfactory learning thought to be localized to the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). A long-held view is that the critical change occurs at the synapses between granule cells (GCs) and mitral cells (MCs) in the AOB. Specifically, it has been hypothesized that mating causes a long-lasting increase in GC-to-MC inhibitory synapses in the AOB, and this suppresses the MC output transmitting the information about the mated male mouse. Although this hypothesis has been popular in the field, an important assumption -- whether this change occurs specifically in MCs signaling the mated male -- has not been tested experimentally.</p><p>The present study addresses this question by using transgenic mice (Arc-GFP and cFos-GFP) that allow for activity-dependent labeling of neurons with GFP. The authors first show that the frequency of mIPSPs increases in MCs in female mice that underwent mating, compared to naïve female mice or female mice that are exposed to a male mouse but did not mate. Importantly, the authors show that this change occurs similarly in mated and other control animals, and GFP-positive and -negative mitral cells did not differ in mIPSPs. The most significant finding is that the intrinsic excitability of MCs decreases in mated mice but not in naïve mice, as tested by their response to repeated, prolonged stimulations (10 repetitions of a 20-sec current injection). Furthermore, the authors show that this change occurs only in GFP-positive but not in GFP-negative MCs. Finally, they present evidence that the decrease in excitability occurs due to progressive membrane potential hyperpolarization of MCs across the repeated stimulations.</p><p>All the reviewers thought that the methods employed in this study are elegant and the results are highly significant. These findings provide a novel potential mechanism for the pregnancy block. Although all the reviewers were positive about the work, they raised important concerns or questions as described below. Most importantly, this study does not establish a causal link between the observed change in intrinsic excitability and behavior. To narrow this gap, additional information or experiments exploring some experimental parameters would be very informative. The essential points include some suggested experiments that may address these points. If the authors decide not to perform these experiments or the available data do not address these points, these issues should be discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential points for revision</p><p>1) Is the change in MC intrinsic excitability specific to mating? It seems plausible that the change in MC intrinsic excitability is a general phenomenon not directly related to mating, except that mating is a behavioral stimulus that drives the AOB strongly and is therefore capable of revealing this mechanism. Do the authors have some data that addresses the question of whether other stimulus conditions (stimulation with pups or predators) also lead to similar changes or there is something special about mating?</p><p>2) The difference in MC excitability is revealed using &quot;repetitive stimuli spanning several minutes (ten current injections, 20 sec in duration, repeated every 60 sec)&quot;. Can the authors justify this stimulation parameter (interval) based on the inter-bout interval between bouts of nasal contact during social encounters? Additionally, have the authors explored stimulation parameters that are effective or ineffective in causing the plasticity? How does the suppression depend on inter-trial interval? How does this compare to the interval between bouts of nasal contact during social encounters? This might involve some additional electrophysiology experiments and a more extensive and systematic analysis of video (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>3) How long does the change in intrinsic excitability last and is it sufficient to explain the long-lasting effect at the behavioral level? Please comment on how the duration for which the change in intrinsic excitability lasts compare to the duration for which the effect can be observed at the behavioral level.</p><p>4) We would like to know whether the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (as well as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3——figure supplement 1</xref>) are sensitive to the choice of event criterion. First, it would be helpful if the authors explicitly explain their criteria for event detection, and indicate detected events in the figures. Second, please discuss whether the results are insensitive to a particular choice of event criterion.</p><p>5) Mitral cells were analyzed in Arc-GFP and cFos-GFP mice in different experiments. The authors mention that mitral cells were only weakly labeled by Arc-GFP mice. Is there evidence that Arc and cFos label a similar or overlapping population(s) of MCs? In other words, can the authors ensue that different experiments are looking at a similar set of MCs?</p><p>6) The authors compare between mated mice and mice with sensory experience without mating. The authors describe that &quot;males typically attempted copulations within 20-30 minutes. Cases where males did not mount, females were used as control for sensory experience without mating&quot;. Can the authors provide evidence that other behaviors than mating, such as sensory explorations and locomotor activity, were similar between mated and non-mated mice? In particular, ensuring that the times spent for exploration of female mice are equivalent between the two groups appears to be very important. It would be helpful to compare the behavior of mice during the co-incubation period in a quantitative manner beyond <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. It would be also helpful if the authors analyze the data after matching the time for exploration of female mice.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25421.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential points for revision</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) Is the change in MC intrinsic excitability specific to mating?

Do the authors have some data that addresses the question of whether other stimulus conditions (stimulation with pups or predators) also lead to similar changes or there is something special about mating?</italic> </p><p>As the reviewers note, our data do not address whether this form of plasticity is mating-specific. Plasticity could be unique to mating alone, or could reflect a cellular mechanism common to other forms of social learning, a possibility we favor. Alternatively, plasticity may simply be engaged by activity, which is presumably highly elevated during mating. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive. Excitability may change slowly in response to activity alone, but be altered more dramatically by highly arousing events like mating, perhaps facilitated by modulators such as noradrenaline that gate this form of learning. We have begun probing MC plasticity in other forms of social experience, and initial data suggest that other behavioral contexts also change MC excitability. However, MCs also appear to express multiple forms of plasticity in their intrinsic properties. Furthermore, different stimulus classes could have divergent effects depending on biological significance. For example, it may be advantageous to filter sensory input from social partners but not from predators. Addressing all of these points experimentally is impractical in the scope of this manuscript. We feel that these points are best addressed here by expanding the Discussion to explore these ideas.</p><p> <italic>2) The difference in MC excitability is revealed using &quot;repetitive stimuli spanning several minutes (ten current injections, 20 sec in duration, repeated every 60 sec)&quot;. Can the authors justify this stimulation parameter (interval) based on the inter-bout interval between bouts of nasal contact during social encounters? Additionally, have the authors explored stimulation parameters that are effective or ineffective in causing the plasticity? How does the suppression depend on inter-trial interval? How does this compare to the interval between bouts of nasal contact during social encounters? This might involve some additional electrophysiology experiments and a more extensive and systematic analysis of video (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</italic> </p><p>Intervals of 1 min were chosen on the basis of both behavioral observations and practical constraints on recording length. We have added a more extensive analysis of behavioral interactions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> showing that, although widely distributed, the mean interval between bouts of investigation during pairing is indeed very close to 1 minute, and median values are even shorter (~15 sec). Thus, we believe that our in vitro paradigm is a reasonable approximation of physiological conditions. Behavioral investigation can be variable, and may also differ during the post-mating, pre-implantation period when pregnancy block typically occurs. To allow for reduced investigatory behaviors, we have also added substantial new data showing MC output is similarly attenuated by stimuli at longer intervals of 2 min and 3 min. Hyperpolarization and suppression are cumulative and appear to depend on the integral of past firing, so that low activity levels produce low amounts of suppression. Other than using low activity levels, however, we have not established parameters (such as long intervals, see below) that are ineffective at generating MC suppression.</p><p> <italic>3) How long does the change in intrinsic excitability last and is it sufficient to explain the long-lasting effect at the behavioral level? Please comment on how the duration for which the change in intrinsic excitability lasts compare to the duration for which the effect can be observed at the behavioral level.</italic> </p><p>Our new experiments also show that loss of MC sensitivity lasts for a period of &gt;15-35 min after stimulation, indicating that MC responsiveness is regulated by integrating activity history over extremely long periods. This cellular mechanism thus has the potential to implement changes in AOB output on behaviorally relevant timescales of an hour or more.</p><p>The behavioral and physiological effects of mating persist for up to several weeks. Our Fos-GFP approach gives transient labeling that limits our measurements to a period of a few hours after sensory experience. We cannot currently address whether changes in MC responsiveness last beyond this period on the scale of days to weeks. More permanent labeling methods may allow testing of this idea in future work. Alternatively, our data reflect the initial stage of a dynamic memory process where information is stored at different sites at different time points. We have added a paragraph exploring these ideas in the Discussion.</p><p> <italic>4) We would like to know whether the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (as well as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) are sensitive to the choice of event criterion. First, it would be helpful if the authors explicitly explain their criteria for event detection, and indicate detected events in the figures. Second, please discuss whether the results are insensitive to a particular choice of event criterion.</italic> </p><p>The Material and methods are expanded to include detection criteria. In GCs, we used a threshold of 0.25mV, which gave maximal sensitivity while avoiding false positives. In the revised manuscript we reanalyzed our GC data by adding an adaptive baseline, which further increased sensitivity. Thresholds were set initially by visual inspection of raw data and confirmed by extensive spot-checking. We estimate we detect 95-98% of events with negligible (&lt;1%) false positives. This increased sensitivity gave small changes in quantification of GC EPSPs, which is updated in the text and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>. We cannot lower thresholds further without introducing substantial noise contamination, but we have also repeated analyses using two additional, less sensitive thresholds (0.45 and 0.65 mV). Our conclusions are consistent across this wide range of detection criteria.</p><p> <italic>5) Mitral cells were analyzed in Arc-GFP and cFos-GFP mice in different experiments. The authors mention that mitral cells were only weakly labeled by Arc-GFP mice. Is there evidence that Arc and cFos label a similar or overlapping population(s) of MCs? In other words, can the authors ensue that different experiments are looking at a similar set of MCs?</italic> </p><p>We have added text to the Results section clarifying differences between the two reporters. We used Arc and Fos to label different cell types (granule and mitral cells respectively). We initially planned to use Arc-GFP for both, but after finding poor MC labeling with the Arc reporter we performed GC recordings in this line while importing the Fos reporter for MCs. Because Arc and Fos were used to label distinct cell types in separate experiments, our conclusions do not depend on the two reporters labeling the same populations. Fos gave more extensive labeling than Arc for both MCs and GCs in AOB, and for other brain regions as well, consistent with a lower activity threshold for Fos-GFP expression. The simplest interpretation is that Arc-GFP(+) cells are a subset of the Fos-GFP(+) population, consistent with studies showing overlapping expression of these immediate-early genes (refs). We have not directly tested overlap in AOB, so it remains possible that these reporters mark distinct populations. Again, however, our conclusions do not depend on this assumption.</p><p> <italic>6) The authors compare between mated mice and mice with sensory experience without mating. The authors describe that &quot;males typically attempted copulations within 20-30 minutes. Cases where males did not mount, females were used as control for sensory experience without mating&quot;. Can the authors provide evidence that other behaviors than mating, such as sensory explorations and locomotor activity, were similar between mated and non-mated mice? In particular, ensuring that the times spent for exploration of female mice are equivalent between the two groups appears to be very important. It would be helpful to compare the behavior of mice during the co-incubation period in a quantitative manner beyond <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. It would be also helpful if the authors analyze the data after matching the time for exploration of female mice.</italic></p><p>We have performed further analysis of sensory investigation during the pairing period. Most females in sensory-exposed groups were paired with a sedated male. Females engaged in qualitatively similar behaviors, including intense investigation of facial and anogenital regions, huddling alongside the male, and general locomotion and exploratory behavior. While investigation was robust, it was performed at lower levels for sedated males relative to the mated group (e.g. lower number of investigatory bouts and total investigation time; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), likely due to the lack of reciprocal behavior in the males. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that the MC plasticity we observe is due to differences in total sensory-evoked activity. In cases where males were alert but failed to mate, however, GFP labeling was similar to naïve and sedated-male groups despite investigatory behavior comparable to the mated group. Unfortunately in these cases we characterized GFP labeling but not electrophysiological effects, so we are unable to directly address the. We have added text to the Results section describing the differences in investigation times between groups. We note that this form of sensory learning is known to depend on noradrenaline release in AOB driven by vaginocervical stimulation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
