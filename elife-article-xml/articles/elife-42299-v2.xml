We addressed this question by using two-photon imaging of resting-state microvascular oxygen partial pressure (PO<sub>2</sub>) and flow in the whisker barrel cortex in awake mice. Our measurements in layers I-V show that the capillary red-blood-cell flux and oxygenation heterogeneity, and the intracapillary resistance to oxygen delivery, all decrease with depth, reaching a minimum around layer IV, while the depth-dependent oxygen extraction fraction is increased in layer IV, where oxygen demand is presumably the highest. Our findings suggest that more homogeneous distribution of the physiological observables relevant to oxygen transport to tissue is an important part of the microvascular network adaptation to local brain metabolism. These results will inform the biophysical models of layer-specific cerebral oxygen delivery and consumption and improve our understanding of the diseases that affect cerebral microcirculation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebral cortex</kwd><kwd>capillary oxygenation</kwd><kwd>capillary blood flow</kwd><kwd>two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy</kwd><kwd>partial pressure of oxygen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS091230</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakadžić</surname><given-names>Sava</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH111359</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Devor</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EB018464</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vinogradov</surname><given-names>Sergei A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS092986</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vinogradov</surname><given-names>Sergei A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS055104</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakadžić</surname><given-names>Sava</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AA027097</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yaseen</surname><given-names>Mohammad A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Resting-state capillary blood flow and oxygenation are more homogeneous in the deeper cortical layers, underpinning an important mechanism by which the microvascular network adapts to an increased local oxidative metabolism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Normal brain functioning is critically dependent on the adequate and uninterrupted supply of oxygen to brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Attwell and Laughlin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Raichle and Gusnard, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Raichle et al., 2001</xref>). Significant efforts have been made over the years to investigate the regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF), including auto-regulation of CBF in response to the changes in cerebral perfusion pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aaslid et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Paulson et al., 1990</xref>) and the processes underlying neurovascular coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anenberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Girouard and Iadecola, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Iordanova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Vazquez et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, neuronal and microvascular densities vary greatly between cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blinder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Sakadžić et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Weber et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting a laminar variation of tissue metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Kock et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hyder et al., 2013</xref>). However, it is still not well understood <italic>how blood flow and oxygenation are distributed through the microvascular network to support an adequate tissue oxygenation across the closely spaced, but morphologically and metabolically heterogeneous cortical layers</italic>. Answering this question is important to improve our understanding of the normal brain physiology as well as brain diseases that affect cerebral microcirculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berthiaume et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Iadecola, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Iadecola, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pantoni, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Zlokovic, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The recent development of tools for in vivo microvascular oxygen imaging enabled investigation of brain oxygen delivery and consumption within the arteriolar, venular and capillary domains over large tissue volumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chong et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lecoq et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parpaleix et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sakadzić et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sakadžić et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Yaseen et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, distributions of microvascular blood flow and oxygen in mice at rest have been assessed in several studies using optical coherence tomography, two-photon microscopy and photoacoustic imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chong et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gutiérrez-Jiménez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyons et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Moeini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Sakadžić et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Sakadžić et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Santisakultarm et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Santisakultarm et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Srinivasan et al., 2015</xref>). However, only in few previous studies blood flow properties at rest have been considered as a function of cortical depth, but without information about capillary oxygenation and branching order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gutiérrez-Jiménez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kleinfeld et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Merkle and Srinivasan, 2016</xref>). These studies in anesthetized mice showed that capillary red-blood-cell (RBC) flux and/or speed slightly decreased with cortical depth at rest, and that smaller transit time heterogeneity occurred in the deeper cortical layers. By using two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy (2PLM) of oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Finikova et al., 2008</xref>), distributions of capillary oxygen concentration were reported in both anesthetized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lecoq et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parpaleix et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Sakadžić et al., 2014</xref>) and awake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyons et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Moeini et al., 2018</xref>) mice. The use of anesthesia in some of these studies could have significantly affected both brain CBF and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alkire et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goldberg et al., 1966</xref>). Moreover, all earlier studies using 2PLM were limited by smaller sample size and insufficient imaging penetration depth due to limitations of the applied oxygen probe – PtP-C343 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Finikova et al., 2008</xref>). Lyons et al. for the first time measured the distributions of capillary blood flow and PO<sub>2</sub> as a function of cortical depth in the somatosensory cortex in awake mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyons et al., 2016</xref>). However, the measurements were performed in less than 100 capillaries across n = 3 mice with the imaging depth of ≤410 µm. Due to these limitations, a detailed layer-specific analysis with the acquired data would be challenging. Moeini et al. conducted imaging study with 2PLM in awake mice through a thinned-skull cranial window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Moeini et al., 2018</xref>). This procedure was less invasive, but it further limited imaging depth.</p><p>In addition to the experimental observations, several recent studies using numerical modeling based on the realistic and artificial vascular anatomical networks (VANs) predicted layer-dependent blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hartung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Schmid et al., 2017</xref>) and oxygen distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gagnon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gould and Linninger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gould et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Linninger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lücker et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lücker et al., 2018b</xref>). Developing and using accurate biophysical models of oxygen advection and diffusion based on large-scale realistic VANs is a key component in our quest to better understand the regulation of microvascular blood flow. However, current numerical models need to be improved, and their predictions need to be validated by more comprehensive experimental measurements of the physiological observables involved in microvascular oxygen transport to tissue.</p><p>The development of 2PLM of oxygen also enabled measurements of erythrocyte-associated transients (EAT) in cortical capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lecoq et al., 2011</xref>). EAT were first theoretically predicted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hellums (1977)</xref> and extensively investigated over the last four decades using analytical and numerical approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Federspiel and Popel, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hellums, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lücker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lücker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Popel, 1989</xref>). Originally, they were experimentally observed in peripheral capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Golub and Pittman, 2005</xref>), but the full confirmation within the more challenging three-dimensional cortical capillary network was made possible only recently with advent of 2PLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lecoq et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parpaleix et al., 2013</xref>). Since EAT is tightly related to the intravascular resistance to oxygen transport to tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Golub and Pittman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hellums, 1977</xref>), their direct measurements are critical for better understanding of the oxygen delivery through the capillary network. However, the dependence of EAT on cortical layer has not been fully explored.</p><p>To this end, in the present work, we applied 2PLM to measure the absolute intravascular PO<sub>2</sub> in a large number of arterioles, venules and capillaries, as well as RBC-PO<sub>2</sub>, InterRBC-PO<sub>2</sub>, EAT and RBC flow properties in capillaries as a function of cortical depth within the range of 0–600 µm. We used a new phosphorescent oxygen probe – Oxyphor2P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Esipova et al., 2019</xref>). Compared to its predecessor – PtP-C343 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Finikova et al., 2008</xref>), Oxyphor2P exhibits longer excitation and emission wavelength maxima, higher quantum yield and a larger two-photon absorption cross-section, facilitating simultaneous mapping of microvascular PO<sub>2</sub> and capillary RBC flux in cortical layers I-V in mice and making it possible to significantly increase both the sample size and imaging penetration depth in comparison to the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lecoq et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyons et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Moeini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parpaleix et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sakadzić et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Sakadžić et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, our measurements were performed in head-restrained awake mice, and thus were free of the confounding effects of anesthesia on neuronal activity, CBF and brain metabolism. With the results, we report that 1) in the whisker barrel cortex in awake mice the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), measured at different cortical depths (i.e., depth-dependent OEF), reaches its maximum at the depth range of 320–450 µm, corresponding to cortical layer IV, where the neuron and capillary densities are the largest, and, presumably, oxygen consumption is the highest; and 2) the increased OEF is accompanied by the more homogenously distributed capillary PO<sub>2</sub> and RBC flux, as well as by a decrease in the intracapillary resistance to oxygen delivery (inferred from the EAT magnitude). These experimental results enabled quantification of parameters of importance for oxygen transport to tissue and put forward a potential mechanism, by which the microvascular networks at rest may adapt to the heterogeneous metabolic demands in different cortical layers. We anticipate that our results will improve our understanding of the normal brain function as well as of diseases that affect the cerebral microcirculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Girouard and Iadecola, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Iadecola, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Müller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pantoni, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Wardlaw et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Zlokovic, 2011</xref>).

In this work, we assumed a constant RBC longitudinal size (6 µm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Unekawa et al., 2010</xref>) when estimating the RBC speed (please see Materials and methods section for details). However, the RBC longitudinal size may vary with capillary diameter, RBC speed and hematocrit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chaigneau et al., 2003</xref>). To better understand this limitation, we performed line-scan measurements in 58 capillaries in two awake C57BL/6 mice (3–5 months old, female, 20–25 g, Charles River Laboratories). The cranial window was prepared following the same protocol as described in the Materials and methods section. The blood plasma was labeled by dextran-conjugated Sulforhodamine-B (0.1 ml at 5% W/V in saline, Sigma R9379). The line-scans (2-s-long acquisition in each capillary with 2 kHz line-scan rate) were performed within the cortical depth of 0–200 µm. The RBC speed was calculated from the line-scan images with the procedures described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kleinfeld et al. (1998)</xref>. In addition, we extracted the fluorescence intensity time courses from the same parallel line-scan images, and then the RBC speed was calculated by using the procedures described in the Methods section (i.e. by the ‘point-scan’ or ‘RBC-passage’ method). Furthermore, we investigated the dependence of RBC longitudinal size on capillary diameter, RBC speed, and linear-density. (<bold>a</bold>) The capillary RBC speed values estimated simultaneously by both the line-scan and point-scan methods. The RBC speed values obtained by the two methods in each capillary (green circles) are connected by green lines. Boxplots of the line-scan and point-scan RBC-speed values indicate the median values, the 1st and 3rd quartiles, and the maximum and minimum values. (<bold>b</bold>) and (<bold>c</bold>) Correlation between the line-scan and point-scan RBC speed values from the same n = 58 capillaries used in <bold>a</bold>), grouped by the capillary diameter: 2–3 µm (<bold>b</bold>) and 3–5 µm (<bold>c</bold>). In panels <bold>b</bold> and <bold>c</bold>, we also presented the corresponding linear regression lines (orange), as well as their slopes and coefficients of determination (<bold>R<sup>2</sup></bold>). (<bold>d-f</bold>) Dependence of the RBC longitudinal size on capillary diameter (<bold>d</bold>), RBC speed (<bold>e</bold>), and line-density (<bold>f</bold>). For each of the 58 capillaries, we estimated the capillary diameter by fitting the transversal intensity profile to a Gaussian model. The diameters were calculated as the full width at half maximum of the Gaussian profiles. The RBC line-density and longitudinal size were calculated by following the procedures described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chaigneau et al. (2003)</xref>. By averaging over all the RBCs identified in each capillary and then across the 58 capillaries, we obtained the mean RBC longitudinal size (6.9 ± 3.0 µm; Mean ±STD). The mean RBC longitudinal size in the capillaries with smaller diameter (2–3 µm; panel <bold>d</bold>) was just slightly (statistically not significantly) larger than in the capillaries with larger diameter (4–6 µm). This result can be expected as the RBCs in the smaller capillaries may be squeezed to a greater extent. We further observed that the RBC longitudinal size increased with RBC speed (<bold>e</bold>), where the RBC longitudinal size in the fastest group of capillaries (1–1.5 mm/s) was statistically significantly larger than in the other two lower speed groups. Finally, the capillaries with lower-line-density had more elongated RBC size than the capillaries with median- and higher-line-density (<bold>f</bold>), although the difference was not statistically significant. The statistical comparison in <bold>d</bold>) was conducted using Student’s t-test. The statistical comparisons in <bold>e</bold>) and <bold>f</bold>) were conducted using ANOVA followed by a Tukey-HSD post-hoc test. The asterisk symbol indicates p&lt;0.05. Data from 58 capillaries were used for the analysis in <bold>a</bold> and (<bold>d-f</bold>) and data from 25 and 19 capillaries were used for the analysis in <bold>b</bold> and <bold>c</bold>, respectively. In addition, we analyzed the temporal fluctuation of the RBC longitudinal size during the 2-s-long acquisition. For each capillary, we computed the standard deviation (STD) and coefficient of variance (CV) of the RBC longitudinal size from the individual RBC measurements acquired during the 2-s-long acquisition. Then, we obtained the mean STD (2.3 ± 0.6 µm) and CV (0.4 ± 0.1) values averaging over the 58 capillaries. Based on presented results, RBC longitudinal size may be different from capillary to capillary as a function of capillary diameter, RBC speed, and line-density, and may vary over time within the same capillaries. The RBC longitudinal size was especially large at high RBC speed (<bold>e</bold>). In addition, the average temporal fluctuation of the RBC longitudinal size was moderate (STD = 2.3 ± 0.6 µm). Finally, pairwise comparisons between the RBC speed values obtained by the two methods (<bold>a–c</bold>) reveal variability, especially at the high RBC speed. Therefore, instantaneous RBC speed obtained by the point-scan method may have larger measurement error, which needs to be considered when interpreting the data. On the other hand, the small difference between the mean RBC speed obtained in the paired measurements (<bold>a</bold>) did not reach statistical significance (Student’s t-test), and the linear regression slopes in panels <bold>b</bold> and <bold>c</bold> are reasonably close to 1. Therefore, for the purpose of providing mean values for group comparison, the RBC speed measurements based on the point-scan method, while limited by assuming the constant RBC longitudinal length, may still be reasonably accurate. Please note that regarding the extreme values of the estimated RBC longitudinal size (<bold>d–f</bold>), they were calculated as the product of the fitted temporal width of the shadows and the RBC speed, both of which were extracted from the line-scan images. Measurements of both these parameters have limitations. The line-scan method is less accurate for high RBC speed, while estimation of the shadow width sometimes may be influenced by the stacked RBCs, and the fluorescence intensity time courses may be noisier when acquired with the line-scan method (due to shorter dwelling time per time-point) than with the point-scan method.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-42299-fig1-figsupp2-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42299.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cortical layer-dependent distributions of the arteriolar and venular intravascular PO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Intravascular PO<sub>2</sub> in the diving arterioles (red symbols) and venules (blue symbols) across cortical layers I-V (11 arterioles, 14 venules, from n = 7 mice).

Therefore, this vascular path (<bold>A–B</bold>) is short in both number of capillary segments and physical length.

Similar trends were observed in the SO<sub>2</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), but the levels of SO<sub>2</sub> changes were different from those of PO<sub>2</sub> due to the sigmoidal shape of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Uchida et al., 1998</xref>). The SO<sub>2</sub> in the diving arterioles decreased slightly from 90.9 ± 0.8% in layer I to 87.1 ± 1.0% in layer V (∆SO<sub>2,A</sub> = 3.8 ± 1.2 %), while the SO<sub>2</sub> change in the surfacing venules was larger, from 53.5 ± 1.0% in layer V to 61.8 ± 0.8% in layer I (∆SO<sub>2,V</sub> = 8.3 ± 1.1 %). Consequently, the layer-specific difference between SO<sub>2</sub> in the diving arterioles and that in the surfacing venules increased toward deeper layers, and the depth-dependent OEFs (DOEF) in layers IV (39.9 ± 3.2%) and V (38.7 ± 3.3%) were larger than in more superficial layers, for example, layers I (32.0 ± 2.7%) and II/III (33.3 ± 2.7%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p>The observed increase in the DOEF with cortical depth suggests that surfacing venules received more oxygenated blood in the upper cortical layers than in the deeper layers, and that SO<sub>2</sub> in the pre-venular capillaries (or ‘downstream capillaries’) was higher for the capillaries joining venules in the upper cortical layers than for those in the deeper layers. We revisit this observation in the later section. In addition, the relation between blood flow, oxygen extraction, and the observed SO<sub>2</sub> changes across cortical layers was discussed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Capillary RBC flux and PO<sub>2</sub> are more homogenous in the deeper cortical layers</title><p>To better understand how the distributions of the capillary RBC flow and oxygenation change in order to support the heterogeneous demand for oxygen across cortical layers, we assessed both the spatial distributions and the temporal fluctuations of the resting capillary RBC flux and Mean-PO<sub>2</sub> in layers I-V. The spatial distributions for both the mean value and heterogeneity (quantified by STD and CV across capillaries) of capillary RBC flux and Mean-PO<sub>2</sub> in cortical layers I-V are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The RBC flux in layers IV (36 ± 4 RBC/s) and V (38 ± 6 RBC/s) were slightly lower than in layers I (41 ± 2 RBC/s) and II/III (41 ± 1 RBC/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The decrease in the RBC flux in the deeper layers might be due to the redistribution of RBCs over a denser capillary network, especially in layer IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blinder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Sakadžić et al., 2014</xref>), causing the RBC flux to be lower in individual capillaries. Importantly, both the STD and CV of RBC flux were lower in layers IV-V than in layers I-III, reaching a minimum in layer IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,c</xref>); and the STD and CV of RBC flux in layer IV were significantly lower than their counterparts in layer I. This result suggests that RBC flux in the deeper cortical layers is more homogeneous, which may facilitate oxygen extraction as theoretically predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hartung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jespersen and Østergaard, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Schmid et al., 2017</xref>).

All these parameters were simultaneously measured in each assessed capillary (n = 373 capillaries). The correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic> between the temporal fluctuations of the RBC flux and Mean-PO<sub>2</sub> (median value = 0.71) was higher than between the RBC speed and Mean-PO<sub>2</sub> (median value = 0.37), and between line-density and Mean-PO<sub>2</sub> (median value = 0.29).

According to the modeling studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Golub and Pittman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hellums, 1977</xref>), larger EAT was associated with higher intracapillary resistance to oxygen transport to tissue from capillaries. Since cortical layers exhibit differences in the neuronal and vascular densities and possibly in oxygen metabolism, we examined whether EAT would differ in different cortical layers. Benefitting from the superior properties of Oxyphor2P, we were able to measure PO<sub>2</sub> in the blood plasma as a function of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>) and distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) from the center of the nearest RBC in a larger number of capillaries. In this work, PO<sub>2</sub> gradients were measured in a larger number of capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>; 373 capillaries across n = 7 mice) and with greater imaging depth (from cortical surface to 600 μm) in comparison to the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lecoq et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyons et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parpaleix et al., 2013</xref>). Averaging over all the assessed capillaries, PO<sub>2</sub> (black curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>) decreased from 56.8 ± 0.4 mmHg at t = 0 ms to 28.6 ± 2.6 mmHg at t = 50 ms.

The median values of capillary Mean-PO<sub>2</sub>, RBC-PO<sub>2</sub>, InterRBC-PO<sub>2</sub> and EAT were 39.4 mmHg, 49.2 mmHg, 36.3 mmHg and 11.7 mmHg, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>).

For this analysis, capillaries in the top 300 μm of the cortex (layers I-III) were grouped based on their branching orders into two main groups: 1) ‘upstream’ capillaries with branching orders A1-A3, which are closer to the arteriolar side of the network, and 2) ‘downstream’ capillaries with branching orders V1-V3, which are closer to the venular side of the network. Due to the limited number of capillary segments with assigned branch orders, A1-A3 and V1-V3 capillaries were grouped together to enable group comparisons with stronger statistical power.</p><p>The average values of Mean-PO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, EAT, RBC flux and line-density from the combined A1-A3 (upstream) and V1-V3 (downstream) capillaries are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a–e</xref>. The average Mean-PO<sub>2</sub> in the A1-A3 capillaries (64.4 ± 2.4 mmHg) in layers I-III was, as expected, significantly higher than that in the V1-V3 capillaries (41.8 ± 0.9 mmHg; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>), suggesting that a large fraction of oxygen has been extracted along the capillary paths (i.e. from A1 to V1). Indeed, the average SO<sub>2</sub> in the A1-A3 capillaries (77.6 ± 1.7%) was significantly higher than that in the V1-V3 capillaries (67.3 ± 1.2%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Provided that the average SO<sub>2</sub> in the A1 capillary segments was 81.0 ± 2.3%, and that the SO<sub>2</sub>’s in the arterioles (SO<sub>2,A</sub>) and venules (SO<sub>2,V</sub>) at cortical surface were 91.0 ± 0.8% and 62.0 ± 0.8%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), we estimated that the decrease in SO<sub>2</sub> from the pial arterioles to the A1 capillary segments in the upper 300 μm of the cortex accounted for 34% (or 1/3) of the total extracted oxygen. Here, the total extracted oxygen was calculated as the A-V difference in SO<sub>2</sub> at the cortical surface (ΔSO<sub>2,A-V</sub> = 30 %; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Therefore, 66% (or 2/3) of the oxygen extraction in awake mice took place after the arterioles. This is in contrast to our previous study in anesthetized mice, which reported that ~ 50% of the oxygen delivered to brain tissue was extracted after the arterioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Sakadžić et al., 2014</xref>). The average V1 capillary SO<sub>2</sub> in layers I-III was 65 ± 1.9%, higher than that in the ascending venules, both in layer I (62 ± 0.8%) and layer II/III (59 ± 0.4%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Accordingly, capillaries that feed the surfacing venules in layers I-III apparently do so with more oxygenated blood, contributing to the increase in the venular SO<sub>2</sub> toward brain surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p>The RBC flux in the A1-A3 capillaries (97 ± 6 RBC/s) was ~2.7 times higher than that in the V1-V3 capillaries (36 ± 2 RBC/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). Since blood flow obeys the principle of mass conservation (i.e. the numbers of RBCs entering the capillary paths per unit time on the arteriolar side and exiting from the venous side must be equal), this result is in agreement with the previously observed ~3 fold-greater number of V1 than A1 capillaries in mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nguyen et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the RBC speed in the A1-A3 capillaries (1.9 ± 0.2 mm/s) had a similar ratio (~3.2 times) to that in the V1-V3 capillaries (0.6 ± 0.1 mm/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is also consistent with the strong correlation between RBC flux and speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Desjardins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kleinfeld et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>We found strong positive correlations between the capillary RBC flux and both Mean-PO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> in the downstream (V1-V3) capillaries, but not in the upstream (A1-A3) capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f,g</xref>), suggesting that a positive correlation between the RBC flux and oxygenation may be gradually building up along the capillary paths. In addition, we observed very heterogeneous distributions of both Mean-PO<sub>2</sub> (from ~11 mmHg to ~68 mmHg) and RBC flux (from ~30 RBCs/s to ~110 RBCs/s) in the V1 capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7h,i</xref>).

Therefore, heterogeneous oxygen delivery was taking place along different capillary paths, such that V1 capillaries had various levels of RBC flux and PO<sub>2</sub>. However, the V1 capillaries with higher RBC flux were better oxygenated, contributing more to the increase in the PCV oxygenation.</p><p>Finally, EAT observed in the A1-A3 capillaries (10.9 ± 1.9 mmHg) was noticeably smaller than in the V1-V3 capillaries (16.6 ± 2.3 mmHg; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>), although this difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.09). From both this work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>) and a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyons et al., 2016</xref>), EAT did not exhibit any obvious dependence on the Mean-PO<sub>2</sub>, RBC flux or speed, but they were correlated negatively with line-density. Nevertheless, the observed trend that the average EAT in the A1-A3 capillaries was smaller than that in the V1-V3 capillaries is unlikely to be related to line-density, as the difference between the upstream and downstream line-density is insignificant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have performed measurements of absolute intra-vascular PO<sub>2</sub> in arterioles, venules and a large number of capillaries (6544 capillaries across n = 15 mice), as well as EAT, RBC flux, speed and line-density in a subset of capillaries (978 capillaries across n = 15 mice). These parameters were measured simultaneously in the whisker barrel cortex in head-restrained awake C57BL/6 mice and thus were free of the confounding effects of anesthesia on neuronal activity, CBF and brain metabolism.</p><p>A new two-photon-excitable phosphorescence oxygen probe – Oxyphor2P was used in this study. Oxyphor2P belongs to the class of dendritically protected oxygen probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lebedev et al., 2009</xref>), and it is built around a newly developed Pt tetraarylphthalimidoporphyrin (PtTAPIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Esipova et al., 2017</xref>). In comparison to its predecessor (PtP-C343) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Finikova et al., 2008</xref>), Oxyphor2P exhibits red-shifted two-photon excitation and emission maxima, higher phosphorescence quantum yield and larger two-photon absorption cross-section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Esipova et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, in contrast to PtP-C343 the phosphorescence decay of Oxyphor2P exhibits well-defined single-exponential kinetics, which helps improve the accuracy of PO<sub>2</sub> calculation. These improvements of Oxyphor2P facilitated large-scale sampling of both capillary RBC flow and PO<sub>2</sub> deeper in the brain, for example, 600 µm vs. 450 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyons et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Sakadžić et al., 2014</xref>), and with higher signal-to-noise ratios, which, in turn, powered the statistical analyses beyond what could be achievable with PtP-C343 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Devor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lecoq et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyons et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parpaleix et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sakadzić et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Sakadžić et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, the very high phosphorescence quantum yield of Oxyphor2P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Esipova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Esipova et al., 2019</xref>) enabled detection of RBC-passages in capillaries based on phosphorescence alone, without the need to enhance the signal from the blood plasma using additional chromophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyons et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We first assessed oxygenation in the diving arterioles and surfacing venules and observed a decrease in PO<sub>2</sub> with cortical depth for both vessel types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The PO<sub>2</sub> decrease in the diving arterioles between layer I and V was about 15 mmHg, equivalent to the difference in SO<sub>2</sub> of 3.8%. This modest oxygen extraction along the diving arterioles implies that much more oxygen was extracted from the rest of the microvascular network, including arteriolar branches, capillaries and potentially venules. Previous measurements performed in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kisler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Moeini et al., 2018</xref>) and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Devor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Sakadžić et al., 2016</xref>) reported pronounced PO<sub>2</sub> gradients in the periarteriolar tissue around the cortical diving arterioles, implying extraction of oxygen from cortical diving arterioles. Specifically, a significantly steeper decrease in PO<sub>2</sub> with cortical depth was observed directly in diving arterioles in isoflurane-anesthetized mice by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kazmi et al. (2013)</xref> and indirectly, based on the depth dependence of the extravascular (tissue) PO<sub>2</sub> measured immediately next to the diving arterioles, in α-chloralose anesthetized rats by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Devor et al. (2011)</xref>. The most likely reason for these discrepancies is the higher suppression of CBF than CMRO<sub>2</sub> under different anesthesia regimes. In awake mice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyons et al. (2016)</xref> measured approximately constant PO<sub>2</sub> in the diving arterioles over cortical depth of 0–400 µm. This result is consistent with our current observation that in awake mice, the amount of oxygen extracted along the diving arterioles over depth represents a small fraction of the total amount of oxygen transported by these arterioles.</p><p>In contrast to the moderate PO<sub>2</sub> decrease along the penetrating arterioles, the decrease in the venular PO<sub>2</sub> from layer I to V was much smaller (~6 mmHg), but resulted in a larger fractional decrease in SO<sub>2</sub> (8.3%) than in the penetrating arterioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). An increase in PO<sub>2</sub> in ascending venues towards the cortical surface has been previously observed in isoflurane-anesthetized mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sakadzić et al., 2010</xref>). However, the PO<sub>2</sub> values, measured previously along the ascending venules in the fore-paw and hind-paw regions of the somatosensory cortex in awake mice, were reported to be nearly constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyons et al., 2016</xref>). The difference between these observations may be attributed to the difference in the studied cortical regions and/or to the lower measurement accuracy associated with the old probe – PtP-C343, because of its lower brightness and inability to resolve small PO<sub>2</sub> changes. In addition, some discrepancies in the absolute baseline PO<sub>2</sub> in arterioles and venules at different depths were observed between our present and some previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kazmi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lecoq et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyons et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parpaleix et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sakadzić et al., 2010</xref>). Different anesthesia regimes, different cortical areas and, most importantly, use of anesthetized vs. awake animals would be the most obvious factors underlying the observed discrepancies. Furthermore, cortical temperature typically was not controlled in the previous studies, while the presence of a cranial window can cause reduction in the cortical temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Shirey et al., 2015</xref>), especially when imaging is carried out using a non-heated water-immersion objective. Temperature affects all physiological parameters and chemical properties, including O<sub>2</sub> diffusion and solubility, hemoglobin affinity to O<sub>2</sub>, CBF, CMRO<sub>2</sub> and the triplet decay time of the oxygen probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benesch et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Croughwell et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Finikova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hanks and Wallace, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jones and Siegel, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Pray, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Rosomoff and Holaday, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Rossing and Cain, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Soukup et al., 2002</xref>) – all of which may affect the experimental results.</p><p>A faster decrease in SO<sub>2</sub> with cortical depth in the ascending venules than in the penetrating arterioles resulted in a higher depth-dependent OEF in the deeper cortical layers, reaching the maximum in layer IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In addition, the total blood flow may be higher in layer IV than in layer I, as suggested by the measurements of capillary RBC flux (~13% lower in layer IV than in layer I; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) and capillary segment density (~50% higher in layer IV than in layer I; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gould et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Sakadžić et al., 2014</xref>). Altogether, this implies that oxygen extraction was higher in the deeper cortical layers, which would be in agreement with the findings that layer IV of mouse cortex has the highest neuronal and capillary densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blinder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Patel, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), and that the cells in layer IV exhibit the highest cytochrome oxidase labeling activity, suggestive of the highest oxidative metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Land and Simons, 1985</xref>). We estimated the depth-dependent OEF, which implies existence of a laminar flow pattern in the brain cortical microvascular network. This was recently confirmed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Schmid et al. (2017)</xref>, who applied numerical modeling of blood flow and tracking of the trajectories of individual RBCs in realistic mouse cortical vasculature, which led to conclusion that RBCs predominantly flow in plane and no significant RBC flow in the direction of cortical depth takes place. Since oxygen extraction depends on both total blood flow and arterio-venous oxygen saturation difference, it will be important in the future to further experimentally investigate the total blood flow differences across different cortical layers.</p><p>The mean capillary RBC flux decreased only slightly with cortical depth, without reaching statistically significant difference across layers I-V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). This might be due to the redistribution of the blood flow over the denser capillary network in the deeper cortical layers, especially in layer IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blinder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Sakadžić et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), causing the RBC flux to be lower in individual capillaries. The observed mean capillary RBC flux (41.5 ± 1.2 RBCs/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) is in good agreement with the value of 41.9 ± 1.8 RBCs/s, reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyons et al. (2016)</xref>, and somewhat lower than ~48 RBC/s reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Moeini et al. (2018)</xref> for somatosensory cortex in awake mice. The average capillary Mean-PO<sub>2</sub> increased slightly by ~7 mmHg from layer I to V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), which is in agreement with the previously reported increase in capillary Mean-PO<sub>2</sub> in both awake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyons et al., 2016</xref>) and isoflurane-anesthetized mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Sakadžić et al., 2014</xref>) across the upper 400 µm of the cortex. One potential explanation for this increase could be related to the finding by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blinder et al. (2013)</xref>, who reported that, in the upper 600 µm of somatosensory cortex, the probability of penetrating arterioles giving off side branches increased with cortical depth, whereas the probability for the ascending venules decreased with depth. This suggests that the ratio between the number of the more oxygenated (upstream) capillary branches and that of the less oxygenated (downstream) capillary branches increases with depth, contributing to the higher capillary PO<sub>2</sub> at greater depth.</p><p>Importantly, we found that the distributions of capillary RBC flux, speed and Mean-PO<sub>2</sub> were more homogeneous in cortical layers IV and V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The layer-dependent homogeneity of blood flow has been predicted by modeling the blood flow distribution in large-scale mouse brain microvasculature covering the whisker barrel cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hartung et al., 2018</xref>). Both analytical and numerical models of oxygen advection and diffusion in microvascular networks predict that more homogenous capillary blood flow facilitates oxygen delivery to tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jespersen and Østergaard, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Østergaard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Østergaard et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Østergaard et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Rasmussen et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, capillary blood flow homogeneity, measured by the distribution of capillary transit time or RBC flux during functional activation in the brain in healthy anesthetized animals, have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gutiérrez-Jiménez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Stefanovic et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, capillary flow homogeneity was absent in the mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gutiérrez-Jiménez et al., 2018</xref>), while increased capillary blood flow heterogeneity was found in patients of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eskildsen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Nielsen et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting a possible link between disturbed capillary flow patterns, reduced oxygen supply to tissue, and the progression of neurodegeneration. Our observations are in agreement with the previously reported lower capillary transit time heterogeneity in cortical layers IV and V than in the upper layers in anesthetized mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Merkle and Srinivasan, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, capillary Mean-PO<sub>2</sub> also exhibited a similar homogeneous trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e,f</xref>). This could be expected since capillary RBC flow is correlated positively with Mean-PO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyons et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The temporal resolution of our measurements (0.6 s) ensured that the blood flow and PO<sub>2</sub> fluctuations due to cardiac and respiratory cycles, as they occurred to awake mice, were averaged out, but it is sufficient to capture the dynamics related to the rate of oxygen consumption, which could be estimated as the time for tissue PO<sub>2</sub> to drop to zero after blood flow stoppage. As reported in cats, that time was at least several seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acker and Lübbers, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Whalen and Nair, 1975</xref>). In addition, blood flow responses to neuronal activation could typically be resolved with such temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Uhlirova et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is important to note that our experiments probed just one frequency window within a wide range of both faster and slower fluctuations present in the microvascular network. The cause of the dampening of the temporal fluctuations with depth is unclear. It may be related to the anatomical and functional differences between cortical layers; it also can be due to the expected dampening along the vascular paths if the temporal fluctuations originate from the upstream arteriolar blood flow.</p><p>We observed strong positive correlations between the temporal fluctuations of capillary RBC flux and Mean-PO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This observation is in agreement with the previously reported positive correlation between the fluctuations of RBC flux and extravascular (tissue) PO<sub>2</sub> measured adjacent to the capillaries in rat tumor, although the latter occurred at a lower frequency range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Braun et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kimura et al., 1996</xref>). Importantly, the fluctuation of capillary Mean-PO<sub>2</sub> was found to be correlated positively with the fluctuation of RBC flux significantly stronger than with the fluctuations of RBC speed or line-density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b,c</xref>), although these three variables are closely related as RBC flux is proportional to the product of RBC speed and line-density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kleinfeld et al., 1998</xref>). This result could be expected, since most oxygen in the blood is bound to the hemoglobin inside RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Pittman, 2011</xref>). We also observed strong positive correlation between the fluctuations of RBC flux and speed, but the fluctuations of line-density was poorly correlated with both of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These correlations between the temporal fluctuations are in agreement with the trends measured using the populations of capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) as well as with the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kleinfeld et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Santisakultarm et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">VanTeeffelen et al., 2008</xref>). Despite poor correlation between the RBC flux and line-density, we observed reasonably positive correlation between the temporal fluctuations of capillary Mean-PO<sub>2</sub> and line-density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Similarly, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyons et al. (2016)</xref>, capillary Mean-PO<sub>2</sub> and line-density, measured in the populations of capillaries, were also positively correlated, emphasizing the specific role of RBC line-density in oxygen transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lücker et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Capillary PO<sub>2</sub> gradients were measured to assess the intracapillary resistance to oxygen delivery to tissue and to calculate capillary SO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). For measuring EAT, we followed the previously developed methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lecoq et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyons et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parpaleix et al., 2013</xref>). Compared to the previous studies performed with the old probe – PtP-C343 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lecoq et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyons et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parpaleix et al., 2013</xref>), the superior properties of Oxyphor2P enabled us to measure PO<sub>2</sub> gradients in a much larger number of capillaries over a greater cortical depth (down to 600 µm below the cortical surface) and using a shorter acquisition time (9 s) per measurement location. In agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyons et al. (2016)</xref>, we observed EAT in capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), although the magnitude was lower than previously reported. EAT did not appear to depend significantly on RBC flux, speed or Mean-PO<sub>2</sub>, but were correlated negatively with the line-density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Our measurements are in agreement with the previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyons et al., 2016</xref>) as well as with the theoretical predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hellums, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lücker et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, we detected a significant decrease in EAT towards the deeper cortical layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Since EAT is directly related to the intravascular resistance to the diffusive oxygen transport from RBCs to tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hellums, 1977</xref>), reduced EAT in the deeper layers represents another example of the adaptation of the microvascular network in order to facilitate local oxygen delivery in cortical regions with higher oxygen demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Pries et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Pries et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Reglin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Reglin et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is important to note that mechanisms that govern EAT are multifactorial. EAT may be affected by multiple parameters, such as RBC spacing, shape and wall-to-RBC spatial clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Golub and Pittman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lücker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Popel, 1989</xref>). In addition, our EAT measurements provide average values based on multiple RBC-passages. Therefore, they do not account for fluctuations of the parameters that affect EAT, which may differ between cortical layers and/or proximal and distal capillaries, and differentially affect the EAT measurements. Smaller difference between RBC-PO<sub>2</sub> and InterRBC-PO<sub>2</sub> and, consequently, smaller EATs at greater depths are likely a consequence of more narrowly distributed capillary blood flow and oxygenation. However, it is less clear why the mean RBC-PO<sub>2</sub> and InterRBC-PO<sub>2</sub> are increasing with depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The observed increases in the mean RBC-PO<sub>2</sub> and InterRBC-PO<sub>2</sub> may be in part due to the potential change in proportion of the more oxygenated upstream capillaries to the less oxygenated downstream capillaries. Our measurement protocol (i.e., measuring PO<sub>2</sub> in most of the capillaries identified within the field of view at each imaging plane) together with the large number of capillaries interrogated at each depth, ensured 1) that the upstream and downstream capillaries were sampled proportional to their number densities, and 2) that the mean PO<sub>2</sub> values were properly estimated, but could not guarantee an equal sampling of the upstream and downstream capillaries unless the equal distributions of the upstream and downstream capillaries are naturally occurring. Other mechanisms, such as the effect of the increased homogeneity of capillary RBC flux and PO<sub>2</sub> on the mean intravascular PO<sub>2</sub>, may also contribute.</p><p>The elevated SO<sub>2</sub> in the surfacing venules in layers I-III suggests that in the upper cortical layers (e.g. layers I-III) the downstream capillaries and post-capillary venules that feed the surfacing venules are more oxygenated compared to the surfacing venules in the deeper layers (e.g. layers IV and V). We therefore assigned branching orders to the capillary segments in cortical layers I-III and investigated the distributions of capillary RBC flow and oxygenation along the capillary paths. We found that the average SO<sub>2</sub> in the V1 capillaries selected across layers I-III was indeed higher than the SO<sub>2</sub> in the ascending venules in both layers I and II/III, confirming that high oxygen content in the superficial capillaries contributed to the increase in the venular SO<sub>2</sub> toward brain surface. This result is in line with the recent experimental and theoretical findings that capillary transit time is shorter in the surface cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gutiérrez-Jiménez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Schmid et al., 2017</xref>), causing less efficient release of oxygen by the RBCs, thus elevating the SO<sub>2</sub> in the surfacing venules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Schmid et al., 2017</xref>). This result also suggests that the baseline oxygen extraction may be different between the cortical layers, which has been predicted by several theoretical studies using realistic vascular anatomical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gould and Linninger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gould et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Linninger et al., 2013</xref>). If true, this may have implications on the interpretation of results from different imaging modalities such as BOLD fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blockley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Griffeth and Buxton, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Siero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Silva and Koretsky, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Vazquez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). Secondly, approximately 1/3 of the total oxygen extraction took place along the paths from the pial arterioles to the A1 capillary segments in layers I-III. This observation differs from our previous study in isoflurane-anesthetized mice, where we found, based on the measurements in the upper 450 µm of somatosensory cortex, that ~50% of the oxygen delivered to brain tissue was extracted from arterioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Sakadžić et al., 2014</xref>). The discrepancy might be due to the effect of anesthesia, which suppressed cerebral oxygen metabolism and possibly increased both CBF and arteriolar surface area due to vasodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alkire et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goldberg et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ogawa et al., 1990</xref>). As a result of these perturbations, oxygen extraction could be shifted towards the upstream microvascular segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Sakadžić et al., 2014</xref>). Based on the observed difference in oxygen extraction and the assumed difference in oxygen metabolism between cortical layers, we anticipate that in cortical layers IV and V, the fraction of the extracted oxygen from arterioles may be smaller than in layers I-III, but still significant.</p><p>Our data provided additional evidence that the distributions of capillary flow and oxygenation were highly heterogeneous and strongly positively correlated with one-another, in particular in the downstream capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This implies that the mixed venous blood oxygenation was, therefore, a result of the contributions from the wide distribution of capillary paths, carrying blood that was both more and less oxygenated than the blood in the postcapillary venules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). At the extreme ends of this distribution are capillary paths with very low and very high oxygenation and blood flow. The paths with very low oxygenation may be the first sites of coupling of microvascular dysfunction and progression of various brain pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erdener et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lücker et al., 2018a</xref>). Indeed, it has been recently reported that only ~0.4% of the cortical capillaries in healthy mice had ‘stalled flow’, but in transgenic mice of Alzheimer’s disease the fraction was as high as 2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cruz Hernandez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Momjian-Mayor and Baron, 2005</xref>). As an example of such poorly oxygenated/perfused capillaries, we identified a capillary segment with PO<sub>2</sub> of ~15 mmHg and no detectable RBC flow during the 9-s-long acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). In contrast, the paths with very high oxygenation and blood flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>) may be especially good sites for implementing blood flow control in response to locally increased oxygen demand, since increasing their resistance to flow may quickly redistribute blood over the nearby capillary network. However, the prevalence of such highly oxygenated/perfused capillaries in the cortical microvascular network and the existence of mechanisms of their site-specific control are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hudetz et al., 1996</xref>). Further studies should address these questions in relation to both normal and pathological brain conditions.</p><p>One potential limitation of this study is that the assignment of the cortical layers as a function of the cortical depth was performed based on the literature data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blinder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>), as opposed to identification of the layer-specific anatomical landmarks. Nevertheless, while slight shifts in the layer boundaries, which may have resulted from such an assignment, may have affected the exact values, it is unlikely that the observed general trends and significant differences in the observables between the layers would have changed. In addition, layer V in mouse barrel cortex spans the depth range of 450–700 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blinder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>), so that the range of 450–600 μm, interrogated in this study, likely overlaps the best with the upper part of layer V (i.e., layer Va) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blinder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Another limitation is that at greater cortical depths, expanding shadows below large pial vessels, partial obstruction of the optical paths by the edge of the cranial window, and gradual loss of resolution, contributed to the smaller sampling size. It is possible that due to the smaller number of measured capillaries in the deeper cortical layers (e.g., 104 capillaries in layer V vs. 400 capillaries in layer I; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), some investigated variables did not show statistically significant difference between cortical layers.</p><p>The capillaries were identified based on their morphology, without taking into account the smooth muscle cell coverage and pericyte types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Attwell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hartmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hill et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Mishra et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Peppiatt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Secomb, 2017</xref>), and the assignment of capillary branching order indices was performed manually, which may be operator-dependent. In principle, misclassifying vessel types and/or branching orders could potentially influence our analysis. However, based on the overwhelmingly larger number of capillaries compared to the non-penetrating arterioles and venules, our conclusions in general are unlikely to be different. Furthermore, identification of capillaries based on the biochemical staining of smooth muscle cells and pericytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hartmann et al., 2015</xref>) will add significant complexity to the study, especially considering a large sample size used in our analysis, but in the end may not provide more accurate results, as the debate on what is a proper classification of vessel-types based on staining is still ongoing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hill et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The RBC speed was calculated by assuming a constant RBC size (6 µm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Unekawa et al., 2010</xref>) along the capillary axis, without considering its potential variations with RBC speed, line-density and capillary diameter. In a separate set of experiments, we performed line-scan measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kleinfeld et al., 1998</xref>) in 58 capillaries (2-s-long acquisition, 2 kHz line-scan rate) in n = 2 awake mice, and obtained close mean RBC speed values by processing the data by using two methods: by the line-scan method described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kleinfeld et al. (1998)</xref> (mean RBC speed = 0.61 mm/s) and by the RBC-passage (or point-scan) method used in this work (mean RBC speed = 0.69 mm/s). The mean RBC longitudinal size was estimated by following the procedures described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chaigneau et al. (2003)</xref>, and it did not vary significantly as a function of RBC speed, line-density and capillary diameter, except for the fast RBCs (&gt;1 mm/s), which were also associated with the noisier measurements by both techniques. However, the mean fluctuation of the RBC longitudinal size over the 2-s-long acquisition was moderate (STD = 2.3 ± 0.6 µm). Therefore, group comparison of the mean RBC speed values measured by the RBC-passage method may be conducted with reasonable accuracy, but the instantaneous speed of individual RBCs obtained by this method may have larger measurement errors (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and text for additional details). These limitations of the technique should be considered for particular experimental designs.</p><p>The RBCs that are touching each other might be counted mistakenly as a single RBC, causing underestimation of RBC flux and speed. We estimated that approximately 6% of the ‘valleys’ might be caused by the passing of multiple RBCs through the optical focus. However, as no difference in RBC line-density across different cortical layers was observed, we do not anticipate that our layer-specific analysis is affected as it is unlikely that the RBCs-touching phenomenon differentially affects the measurements in different cortical layers.</p><p>We would also like to mention that some discrepancy exists between the EAT magnitudes measured using 2PLM by different groups. For example, rather large EAT was reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lecoq et al. (2011)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyons et al. (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parpaleix et al. (2013)</xref> with the PtP-C343 probe. Much smaller EAT (only a few mmHg) were measured previously using also PtP-C343 (unpublished data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Sakadžić et al., 2014</xref>), and moderate EAT are reported in the present work with Oxyphor2P. It should be mentioned that the data underlying the EAT measurements are typically noisier than those used to derive mean intravascular and tissue PO<sub>2</sub>'s, since to quantify EAT the signals have to be split into multiple distance or time bins. In addition, the previously used probe PtP-C343 has intrinsically non-single-exponential phosphorescence decay and much lower emission quantum yield. These limitations, in combination with potentially slightly different implementations of acquisition protocols and algorithms for fitting the phosphorescence decay data, are likely to be the dominant factor contributing to the differences in the reported EAT magnitudes. By using Oxyphor2P, which has much stronger signal and much better defined single-exponential decay, making data analysis much more robust, here we greatly reduced uncertainty in the EAT measurements, which was inherent to the previous probe PtP-C343. Nevertheless, we still would like to emphasize the importance of aligning the acquisition and data analysis protocols across the labs as well as using the same data acquisition protocols during measurement as used for probe calibration.</p><p>We averaged all the phosphorescence decays within the valleys (i.e. RBC-passages) in the segmented phosphorescence intensity time courses to calculate RBC-PO<sub>2</sub>. This approach does not consider that within the valley PO<sub>2</sub> may vary as a function of distance to the center of the valley, and the extent of this variation may be different among capillaries of different diameter and/or RBC speeds.</p><p>In conclusion, we have experimentally mapped the distributions of microvascular flow and oxygenation in the whisker barrel cortex in awake mice using two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy. We have found evidence that oxygen was extracted differently in different cortical layers, and that the distributions of microvascular blood flow and oxygenation were adjusted across layers in a way that facilitated oxygen delivery in the deeper layers. Specifically, the depth-dependent OEF was measured higher in cortical layers IV and V, where the oxidative metabolism is presumably the highest in the cortex. This increase was accompanied by the more homogenous capillary RBC flow and oxygenation, as well as by the reduction of intracapillary resistance to oxygen diffusion to tissue (inferred from the EAT changes). In addition, we have found that arterioles in the superficial cortical layers (e.g. layers I-III) contributed significantly to the oxygen extraction from blood (34%) even in awake mice. We anticipate that our results and analysis will help better understand the normal brain physiology, and the progression of brain pathologies that affect cerebral microcirculation. They will also inform more accurate biophysical models of the cortical layer-specific oxygen delivery and consumption, as well as improve the interpretation of the results from other brain imaging modalities.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal preparation</title><p>We used n = 15 C57BL/6 mice (3–5 months old, 20–25 g, female, Charles River Laboratories) in this study.

After surgery, mice were given 5 days to recover before starting the habituation training. The training was conducted while mice were resting on a suspended soft fabric bed in a home-built platform, under the microscope. Mice were gradually habituated to longer periods (from 10 min to 2 hr) of head-restraint with the head slightly rotated (~35°) to make the cortical surface perpendicular to the optical axis. All mice were rewarded with sweetened milk every 15 min during both training and experiments. While head-restrained, the mice were free to readjust their body position and from time to time displayed natural grooming behavior. All animal surgical and experimental procedures were conducted following the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Subcommittee on Research Animal Care (Protocol No.: 2007N000050).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Two-photon microscope</title><p>In this study, we employed our previously developed home-built two-photon microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sakadzić et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Yaseen et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, a pulsed laser (InSight DeepSee, Spectra-Physics, tuning range: 680 nm to 1300 nm,~120 fs pulse width, 80 MHz repetition rate) was used as an excitation source. Laser power was controlled by an electro-optic modulator (EOM). The laser beam was focused with a water-immersion objective lens (XLUMPLFLN20XW, Olympus, NA = 1.0), and scanned in the X-Y plane by a pair of galvanometer scanners. The objective was moved along the Z axis by a motorized stage (M-112.1DG, Physik Instrumente) for probing different cortical depth. Oxyphor2P was excited at 950 nm. The emitted phosphorescence, centered at 760 nm, was directed toward a photon-counting photomultiplier tube (H10770PA-50, Hamamatsu) by a dichroic mirror (FF875-Di01−25 × 36, Semrock), followed by an infrared blocker (FF01-890/SP-25, Semrock) and an emission filter (FF01-795/150-25, Semrock).

During the experiments, the objective lens was heated by an electric heater (TC-HLS-05, Bioscience Tools) to maintain the temperature of the water between the cranial window and the objective lens at 36–37°C. In addition, we attached the sensor of an accelerometer module to the suspended bed of the mouse platform to record the signals induced by mouse motion.

We first recorded a CCD image of the mouse brain surface vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) under green light illumination to guide the selection of a region of interest for the subsequent functional imaging. The two-photon microscopic measurements were collected at different X-Y planes, perpendicular to the optical axis (Z). The imaging planes were separated in depth by 50 µm. Starting from the cortical surface, up to 13 planes were interrogated per mouse, spanning the depth range of 600 µm. At each imaging depth, we first performed a raster scan of phosphorescence intensity, which revealed the locations of the micro-vessels within a 500 × 500 µm<sup>2</sup> field of view (FOV). Then, we manually selected the measurement locations inside all the vascular segments captured within the FOV. At each selected location, Oxyphor2P in the focal volume was excited with a 10-µs-long laser excitation at 950 nm gated by the EOM, followed by a 290-µs-long collection of the emitted phosphorescence. Typically, at each location, such 300-µs-long excitation/decay cycle was repeated 2000 times (0.6 s) to obtain an average phosphorescence decay with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for an accurate lifetime calculation. In some mice, longer acquisition (30,000 cycles; 9 s) was applied to enable measurement of EAT and temporal fluctuations of PO<sub>2</sub> and RBC flux (please see the following subsection for details).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Measurement of RBC-PO<sub>2</sub>, InterRBC-PO<sub>2</sub>, EAT, and RBC flow in capillaries</title><p>In the capillaries in n = 7 mice, we repeated the 300-µs-long excitation/decay cycle 30,000 times, corresponding to a 9-s-long acquisition per capillary.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Serge Charpak as the guest Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has also agreed to reveal his identity: Andreas Linninger (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another. All appreciated the quality of the data, however several analysis, hypothesis and statistical problems were raised, casting doubts on the article conclusion. As the amount of work required to improve the manuscript in a 2-month time period seems too important, the Reviewing and Senior Editors have taken the decision to reject the manuscript.</p><p>Please find below the detailed reviewer comments:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Li's paper reports 2PLM measurements of PO2 in cortical vessels distributed from layer I-5, in awake mice. Using the new 2P phosphorescence probe PtTAPIP, synthesized by the group of S. Vinogradov (one of the co-authors) and which has an excellent 2PA cross section, the authors succeed in detecting all capillary parameters: mean-PO2, RBC flux and velocity and also erythrocyte-associated transients i.e. RBC PO2, Inter RBC-PO2. These measurements are reported for each layer of the cortex.</p><p>The work is interesting but lacks novelty and the analysis is not rigorously done. The Introduction requires a paragraph describing previous theoretical and experimental demonstrations of EATs and the scientific reasons for which the authors could not detected EATs previously. The community of 2PLM users is now expanding and it is important to mention all the flaws the initial labs working with this approach have been through. The introduction should properly describe previous 2PLM works reporting PO2 in mouse cortical layers. Surprisingly, the statistical tests are not adapted to the data preventing the interpretation of most comparisons. To conclude, the new dye is certainly a technical improvement, but the present manuscript requires major rewriting, analysis and does not reach the standards of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Technical comments:</p><p>Subsection “Calculation of capillary RBC flux, speed, and hematocrit”: The authors estimate RBC velocity as &quot;v = ø/Δt, where Δt is the time for the RBC to pass through the focal zone, and ø is RBC diameter, assumed to be 6 μm (Unekawa et al., 2010). RBC diameter cannot assume to be 6 µm: in capillaries, RBC orientation and thus &quot;RBC size&quot; varies with capillary diameter, RBC density and velocity. As the shadow size in time, Δt, depends on the &quot;RBC size&quot;, and thus velocity, it cannot be used to calculate velocity. All velocity measurements should be removed from the paper.</p><p>This also raises a problem in the way EATs are defined, as v.Δt is used to determine the distance to the nearest RBC center. I suggest that the authors reanalyze their data considering time and not distance to extract EATs.</p><p>Subsection “Calculation of capillary RBC flux, speed, and hematocrit”: The authors make the same mistake as Parpaleix et al., (2013) and Lyons et al., (2016) in the way they estimate hematocrit, which is normally a measure of blood volume percentage: &quot;Hematocrit was estimated as the ratio of the combined duration of all valleys associated with the RBC passages to the duration of the entire time course.&quot; Because RBC elongation varies with velocity (see first comment), the hematocrit calculated in the paper will depend on velocity. The authors should name differently what is actually measured.</p><p>It is difficult to understand how RBC PO2 was determined. Could the authors elaborate on their approach: did they consider the first bin (&quot;micron&quot;) or an average several bins to determine RBC PO2? Additionally, the use of the criterion of &quot;the central 40% of the peaks in the binary segmented time course&quot; to extract InterRBC-PO2 could be prone to error. Given that the InterRBC-PO2 is defined at the lowest value of plasma PO2 reached between the passage of RBCs, when the RBC flux is low, the use of the central 40% criterion could yield an accurate value of the this parameter, but is likely to become less accurate with increasing RBC flux, as the period when the plasma PO2 is at its minimum will be shorter, and the inflection will be sharper. The use of this criterion should be validated, comparing the InterRBC-PO2 value it provides with those values that are extracted from more restricted windows at greater distance from the RBCs.</p><p>All statistics are based on Student's t-test whereas in almost all comparisons, ANOVA test with multiple comparison analysis should be used.</p><p>Subsection “Calculation of capillary PO2 gradients and EATs” and subsection “Accumulated oxygen extraction fraction increases in deeper cortical layers” The authors estimate layer-specific oxygen extraction fraction by comparing the PO2 in arterioles and venules at a given depth. This approach tacitly assumes that a layer-specific network of microvessels connects arterioles and venules in this layer, and that all RBCs which leave arterioles in the given FOV and layer flow into venules in that same field of view and layer. The authors should cite which theoretical and experimental papers support the hypothesis. In addition, as they have the tools to reconstruct easily the vascular angiograms, they should trace a series of pathways from the pre-capillary arteriole to the post-capillary venule in order to verify the hypothesis, which is key for the paper. They could potentially limit their investigation to layer I and IV pathways, which are likely to differ.</p><p>Is the mouse's head rotated around the rostro-caudal axis during the 2PLM sessions? If not (and unless the objective lens can be inclined, thought this doesn't appear to be the case in Supplementary Figure 1(b)), due to the inclination of the cortical surface at the coordinates of the barrel field it is probable that there is a discrepancy between the reported measurement depths and the true depth of measurement in the cortex. As illustration, the approximately 40-45 degree inclination of the cortex relative to the horizontal at the level of the S1 barrel field (as per Paxinos and Watson), would mean that the maximum reported imaging depth of 600 micros would infact correspond to a true cortical depth of approximately 460 microns. Thus, the assignation of the measurements to different layers will be compromised. Conversely, if the mouse head is rotated, could the authors note this and comment on the likely effect on the comfort and behavioural state of the mouse during the imaging sessions.</p><p>Biological:</p><p>3D projections of PO2 maps (Figure 1G) are made with acquisitions lasting only 0.6 seconds (2000 decays). This is really short as PO2 varies with time. It is clearly shown in Figure 5. PO2 may change by more than a factor 2 within 9 s. Therefore, PO2 maps using such brief acquisitions will change dramatically from one acquisition to the other. What is the scientific value of such 3D map? In addition, it artificially increases the number of vessels imaged.</p><p>If this approach was also used to build Figure 2, it strongly decreases its significance.</p><p>In the absence of proper statistics, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7 cannot be interpreted.</p><p>In their 2014 paper, the authors reported that PO2 decreases with the capillary order. Could the author verify if their findings hold true in the awake mouse? This would require a simple analysis regrouping A1, A2 and A3 capillaries.</p><p>Given the concerns raised above about the definition of RBC-PO2 in capillaries and the method for estimation of OEF by comparing arterioles and venules (and indeed A1-A3 and V1-V3 capillaires) in the same layer, it follows that the estimation of the relative contribution of different vascular compartments and the related conclusions (Subsection “Low oxygen extraction along the superficial capillary paths contributes to an increase in the mean venular SO2 towards cortical surface”) are questionable.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The article presents novel data on hemodynamic states in the different layers of the whisker barrel cortex of awake mice. in vivo data are acquired using a novel oxygen probing technique with two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy. Specifically, steady averaged oxygen pressures and red blood cell (RBC) flux counts were acquired. In addition, temporal variations within a 9s observation window were collected. A detailed statistical analysis of the layer dependence of oxygenation and RBC fluxes is presented. The main conclusions include the experimental observation of depth dependence of oxygen extraction, and a reduction in the RBC flux variability with increasing cortical depth. This study presents an invaluable experimental body of work that will help to elucidate oxygen extraction mechanisms in the mouse cortex and create in vivo data for mechanistic models to explain the physiochemical principles that drive and control cerebral blood flow and metabolism. This is a significant piece of work which I highly recommend for publication after modifications listed below:</p><p>Technical comments:</p><p>Introduction. The EAT is used to characterize the heterogeneity of the oxygen extraction within capillaries. What is the physical rationale for correlating oxygen point measurements to intracapillary resistance to oxygen delivery? Are these measurements for erythrocyte bound versus unbound oxygen in plasma? How is this EAT related to oxygen saturation?</p><p>It appears that measurements of RBC fluxes (RBC counts) assume that signals are generated from individual RBCs that are sharply separated. Figure 1C shows signals with different durations (and intensity). Is it possible that two aligned RBCs (two or more RBCs in file) may cause a longer signal that is indistinguishable from a single slow RBC? How would this affect the analysis of RBC fluxes?</p><p>In the Introduction, the authors cite the next generation of biophysical models, which with the exception of Gagnon's 2016 paper do not correspond to the anatomical detail presented in this study. Layer specific oxygen consumption has been predicted by recent biophysical models that match the detailed anatomical scope and three-dimensional resolution of the proposed experimental study. For example, three dimensional predictions of depth dependent oxygen gradients in mouse are given in Gould et al., 2017. Biophysical models to predict depth dependent oxygen gradients in humans are presented in Linninger et al., 2013 and Gould and Linninger, 2015. These studies have been successful in solving oxygen delivery to brain tissue coupled with biphasic blood flow in a realistic cortical microanatomy and are therefore perfectly aligned with the scope of the current study. These advancements should therefore be incorporated and discussed.</p><p>Subsection “Accumulated oxygen extraction fraction increases in deeper cortical layers”. The data in Figure 2 seem to refer to steady magnitudes or levels, the use of the word &quot;amplitudes&quot; seems ambiguous.</p><p>Subsection “Capillary RBC flux and oxygenation homogenize in deeper cortical layers”. The prediction that homogenization of RBC flow velocity enhances the oxygen extraction is made based on a single segment analysis in the cited biophysical model. Here, experiments are presented for a three-dimensional vascular network. I am uncertain whether the two scopes are really &quot;in line&quot; with each other as suggested in the current text.</p><p>Figure 5. The trend line in Figure 5 does not intersect at zero. What does the non-zero intercept of roughly 16-18mmHg pO2 mean? Should the trend have a zero intercept?</p><p>Subsection “Capillary RBC flux and oxygenation homogenize in deeper cortical layers”. The number of segments in layer IV and V have only half the segments than layer I-III. Could this affect the statistics? If not, this observation should be listed in the limitations.</p><p>The assignment of upstream capillaries A1-A3 and downstream capillaries V1-V3 was done manually. Is it hard to imagine that roughly hundred segments (=according to subsection “Low oxygen extraction along the superficial capillary paths contributes to an increase in the mean venular SO2 towards cortical surface”, the analysis included 97 segments for all mice specimen) were identified by hand without the aid of image filters (e.g. Blinder et al., 2013; Hsu et al., 2017) in combination with automatic segmentation.</p><p>In subsection “Low oxygen extraction along the superficial capillary paths contributes to an increase in the mean venular SO2 towards cortical surface” it is argued that the manual method provides statistical power. It is not clear what statistical power is referred to? I suspect that the results could come out quite differently, if labels were assigned differently. Is there any data on operator dependence of the labeling method? I recommend to consider writing the discussion section more cautiously to reflect that results are based on an operator dependent method with high uncertainty in segmentation, and that major results would not be affected by uncertainty associated with operator dependence in upstream and downstream labeling. This point is optional to the discretion of the authors.</p><p>Subsection “Low oxygen extraction along the superficial capillary paths contributes to an increase in the mean venular SO2 towards cortical surface”. The hematocrit changes were reported between upstream (A1-A3) and downstream capillaries (V1-V3). Why did the study not explore layer dependence or branch hierarchy dependence (Strahler order analysis) of hematocrit?</p><p>Discussion section. The RBC flux is equal to the product of bulk flow rate and hematocrit (volume fraction). How should we understand the variance reduction in RBC flux without any relation to variations in hematocrit, since the quantities are directly related?</p><p>Discussion section. The wide variability of hemodynamic states (high heterogeneity of capillary flow and oxygenation) was predicted previously in a biophysical model by Gould et al.,.2017. It would be helpful if the experimental results could be aligned with already completed theoretical work that aims at addressing the same points as those that are here so elegantly presented experimentally.</p><p>In the same vein, it is worth mentioning that a main finding of the reduced variance of RBC fluxes was just recently predicted covering the whisker barrel mouse cortex with extension to the entire MCA territory (Hartung et al., 2018). The experiments confirm several findings so that the predictive model results are highly relevant for this study and should be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The work addresses highly relevant questions (depth-dependent difference, homogeneity/heterogeneity of microvascular flow and oxygenation). The amount of measurements performed is significant and the capabilities of the new oxygen probe PtTAPIP to measure a variety of blood flow characteristics in large cortical depths is nicely demonstrated. However, we have major concerns regarding some of the analysis performed and some of the conclusions drawn (listed below). Furthermore, there is a significant shortcoming in referencing earlier work. It remains unclear, where the current work goes beyond what was published before.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Calculation of capillary RBC flux, speed and hematocrit (subsection “Calculation of capillary RBC flux, speed, and hematocrit”):</p><p>As the authors are well aware, the methods presented to compute RBC flux, RBC speed and hematocrit are only valid in vessels where single file flow persists. The authors write that those measurements were performed in &quot;capillaries&quot;. However, it remains unclear how capillaries were identified as capillaries. Were diameter measurements performed? As the RBC diameter of the mouse is 6 µm, single file flow can only be expected for vessel diameters &lt; 6 µm. This aspect is key for the validity of the results. We propose that the authors come up with a table describing the measured vessels (type, depth, number) for clarity.</p><p>1a) Additional Concern regarding velocity calculations (subsection “Calculation of capillary RBC flux, speed, and hematocrit”):</p><p>Characteristics Mouse RBC: Diameter 6 µm, Volume: 45.5 µm3 (Windberger et al., 2013), Thickness: 1.6 µm.</p><p>Assuming that each RBC is 6 µm is not correct. Especially, in larger vessels the RBC orientation makes a significant difference in the proposed velocity calculation (by a factor of ~4).</p><p>For vessel diameters &lt;5.5 µm the applied velocity calculation is more suitable, because here RBCs need to squeeze into the vessel. However, also here we need to account for changes in RBC length depending on the vessel diameter.</p><p>In summary, the presented approach gives at best a rough estimate of the RBC velocity and it remains unclear, why the authors have not chosen line scans that would be so much more appropriate.</p><p>1b) Additional Concern regarding hematocrit calculations (subsection “Calculation of capillary RBC flux, speed, and hematocrit”):</p><p>The hematocrit computation is based on the assumption that plasma and RBCs have the same velocity. However, RBCs travel on average faster than plasma (Fahraeus effect). This velocity difference can cause an underestimation of hematocrit. Even so this approach is used frequently this assumption should be described and the term &quot;line-density&quot; should be used instead of &quot;hematocrit&quot;.</p><p>1c) Additional Concern regarding flux and velocity calculation (subsection “Calculation of capillary RBC flux, speed, and hematocrit”):</p><p>For the flux and velocity computation it is crucial that individual RBCs can be distinguished from another. Can this be guaranteed for all hematocrit levels? Some discussion/comments should be added.</p><p>1d) Selection of vessels for analysis (Subsection “Capillary RBC flux and oxygenation homogenize in deeper cortical layers”, subsection “Imaging of EATs and capillary RBC flow”):</p><p>The selection criterion for the vessels that have been chosen to analyse flow properties are not described. Moreover, it remains unclear why the number of vessels investigated per layer differs so significantly (400, 356, 118, 104).</p><p>2) Quantification of the temporal fluctuations of capillary Mean-PO2, RBC flux, speed and hematocrit (subsection “Quantification of the temporal fluctuations of capillary Mean-PO2, RBC flux, speed, and hematocrit”, Discussion section):</p><p>On the one hand, the chosen measurement time is rather short for a good averaging of the readouts. On the other hand, an averaging interval of 0.6 s is too large to resolve fluctuations in the capillary bed. An RBC with an average velocity of 1mm/s would travel 600 µm during that time. So, for the overall statistics, longer periods should be measured, but for describing the fluctuations over time, those segments should be split up into smaller than 0.6 s intervals, so that the fluctuations are dampened too much due to the averaging.</p><p>The arguments given in the discussion for the chosen interval seem to be motivated by dynamics on a larger scale but not by microvascular fluctuations. Why is the rate of oxygen consumption relevant for the capturing microvascular flow dynamics?</p><p>Alternatively, it has to be described more clearly that only fluctuations on the time scale of seconds are analysed and that faster fluctuations persist but are not of interest in the current study.</p><p>3) Analysis of EATs:</p><p>Intracapillary resistance of oxygen transport to tissue decreases in deeper cortical layers (subsection “Intracapillary resistance of oxygen transport to tissue decreases in deeper cortical layers”) and Low oxygen extraction along the superficial capillary paths contributes to an increase in the mean venular SO2 towards cortical surface (subsection “Low oxygen extraction along the superficial capillary paths contributes to an increase in the mean venular SO2 towards cortical surface”):</p><p>In order to understand the observed EAT trends, it is crucial to also analyse RBC-PO2 and interRBC-PO2. This aspect has been neglected for most EAT results. As such, possible reasons for the observed EAT drop in Figure 6C and the EAT increase in V1-V3 segments have not been analysed sufficiently (Based on Figure 3—figure supplement 1ARBC-PO2 does not drop? Thus interRBC-PO2 should rise for deeper layers to explain the EAT drop? How can a rise in RBC-PO2 and interRBC-PO2 for deeper cortical layers be explained? A higher interRBC-PO2 would however suggest a &quot;higher intercapillary resistance to oxygen transport&quot; instead of a lower one.)</p><p>Moreover, the EAT strongly depends on the distance of the capillary to the arteriole/venule (see Figure 7C). This impact should be discussed, e.g. how do you make sure that your depth-dependent EAT average is not affected by a larger number capillaries close to arterioles?</p><p>In an earlier work by the same authors, they did not observe EATs. The authors should discuss in detail where this discrepancy originates from.</p><p>4) Depth-dependent oxygen extraction (subsection “Accumulated oxygen extraction fraction increases in deeper cortical layers”, Discussion section):</p><p>We generally agree with the idea to use the difference in oxygen saturation as an indicator of oxygen extraction. However, as also shown in this work here, many factors have an impact on the oxygen saturation. Thus, saturation difference is not always equal to oxygen extraction. For example, higher blood flow in layer I leads to a higher oxygen availability in layer I and thus to higher SO2 values in the venules, even if the oxygen extraction is constant over depth.</p><p>&quot;Benefitting from the improved sensitivity of the new oxygen probe, we were able to measure intracapillary longitudinal PO2 gradients in a larger number of capillaries…&quot; why does the application of the improved probe help to increase the number of vessels measured?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;More homogeneous capillary flow and oxygenation in deeper cortical layers correlate with increased oxygen extraction&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Serge Charpak as the guest Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has also agreed to reveal his identity: Andreas Linninger (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. All reviewers believe that the work is interesting. They however raised a number of questions that I ask you to address and which would clarify the manuscript. No new data is required. I have summarized the key questions:</p><p>1) The demonstration that RBC size can be estimated from the 2PLM measurements is still not convincing. The way you analyzed your new data is not informative: Comparing the mean RBC values from 58 capillaries measured with Line-Scan and Point-Scan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>) does not solve the problem, in particular as the variability is large. Please show the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2A</xref>, with lines joining each values, capillary per capillary. It is important as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2B and C</xref> already seem to demonstrate that RBC longitudinal size varies a lot. The 3 reviewers believe that if your new analysis reveals that RBC size cannot be accurately estimated, all RBC velocity data should be removed from the paper and the resulting uncertainty of RBC PO2 measurements be carefully addressed in the discussion.</p><p>2) Please address in the discussion the issue that a saturation difference may depend on several factors.</p><p>3) Add the plot for interRBC-PO2 over depth to the supplementary figures.</p><p>4) Add in the Impact Statement that the measurements are done at the steady state.</p><p>The reviewers have added some comments (see the full reviews attached below) to which you could briefly answer.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors have made new experiments, new analysis and the text has improved. Previous works are now better described and discussed. The statistics are more appropriate.</p><p>The new experiments and analysis done in response to comments #2 and #3 are interesting but they do not fully address the issues raised. This concerns primarily RBC velocity measurements. The good news is that it could be easily done with simple analysis without any further experiment.</p><p>The authors initially used the assumption of an identical average size of RBCs to base other calculations, in particular RBC speed. They now show new experiments which results are summarized in several &quot;R1&quot; plots. The plots show that RBC longitudinal size is very variable, increasing very significantly with RBC speed and spreading from 3 to 14 µm (R1C1261 c plot (&lt;30% RBC line-density)). This clearly indicates that RBC shadows measured during PO2 acquisitions cannot be used to estimate RBC speed. Note that the authors should give the &quot;n&quot; for each of the groups of capillaries in all the new &quot;R1&quot; plots.</p><p>This variability of RBC size is unfortunately masked in the R1C2-2 plot. This plot needs to show paired measurements in specific capillaries, the question being whether or not similar values of RBC velocity are recorded by the two methods when (presumably) similar real RBC velocities are measured. Showing population averages for the 58 capillaries assessed occludes the similarity/difference on a capillary by capillary basis. The important point here is that all the data are already acquired, for capillaries of known diameters. So the authors could now easily compare RBC values for paired measurements (with the 2 methods) in capillaries of different diameters. Please indicate the &quot;n&quot; for each of the groups of capillaries and plot, for each group, all RBC speed values measured with the 2 methods. I suspect that the authors will find differences with the two techniques. This would invalidate all RBC measurements obtained with point scan PO2 acquisitions.</p><p>It is important that the authors clarify the point as fluctuations of RBC shadows, whether measured in distance or time from the center of the shadow, will modify the RBC PO2 value. In fact, it will decrease RBC PO2 and thus the EAT amplitude. Could the authors measure the decays as a function of time, but after an alignment at the RBC border? This would solve the problem.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors have addressed all previous concerns and submitted a more concise revised manuscript. Well done.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic> </p><p>To the editors:</p><p>Overall the authors improved their manuscript by clarifying various methodological issues and by providing a more detailed introduction and discussion. Nonetheless, some major issues remain. In my opinion the evidence for some of the major results is not strong enough or to put it differently the claims are currently too strong for the presented results. To be more precise: (1) I am still not convinced by the RBC speed calculation (comment #1a). (2) Oxygen extraction and saturation difference are not necessarily equivalent (comment #4). (3) The analysis of the depth dependent EATs should be more rigorous (comment #3). Nonetheless, I believe that this work is relevant and builds onto a large body of experimental work. It can be further improved by a more rigorous analysis of the available data and a more concise discussion of the uncertainties in the presented results. However, this may require that some of the conclusions of the manuscript are slightly weakened/adapted. More details on the major issues are provided in the detailed reply, which follows below.</p><p>I thank the authors for the additional explanations and the adjustments made. Below I list the comments where additional clarification is necessary in order to answer the initial question. Only the comments where further adjustments are necessary are listed. The ones where major issues remain are highlighted and positioned at the beginning.</p><p>I also read the comments of reviewers 1 and 2 as well as the subsequent changes to the manuscript. As some of the points raised by the other reviewers are very relevant, I added an additional comment for some of them.</p><p>The additional studies are an important step to judge the accuracy of the RBC velocity measurements.</p><p>However, the following major concerns remain:</p><p>- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2: a</xref> scatter plot that directly compares the RBC velocity from the line-scan and the point measurement would be more appropriate. Additionally, the average relative difference between the two measurements should be provided.</p><p>- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig7">Author response image 7</xref>: The results clearly show that there is significant variability in the longitudinal RBC size (CV = 0.4, longitudinal sizes ranging from 4-14 µm). Moreover, the RBC longitudinal RBC size is correlated with the RBC speed and the RBC Line-Density. It is impossible to estimate the impact of these dependencies on the presented RBC speed results.</p><p>I thank the authors for the additional explanations regarding IVR and I believe that the changes in the discussion are very valuable. However, some aspects of my initial comment have not been addressed.</p><p>The EAT is computed from the RBC-PO2 and the interRBC-PO2. As such I believe that EAT, RBC-PO2 and interRBC-PO2 should always be analysed and discussed hand in hand. Thus, it would be valuable for the manuscript to add the plot for the interRBC-PO2 over depth to the supplementary figures and to discuss RBC-PO2 and interRBC-PO2. Moreover, I suggest to add and discuss the EAT STD &amp; CV plots over depth as it is done for all other quantities.</p><p>As stated in my original comment it is a surprising results that RBC-PO2 increases over depth and I don't know which mechanism could explain this increases (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). The same holds for interRBC-PO2 (which has to increase more than RBC PO2 in order to explain the EAT drop over depth). I do not ask for additional experiments, but I believe that is important to discuss these trends.</p><p>In my initial question I asked how the author's ensured that the depth-dependent differences are not affect by the position of the chosen capillaries along the capillary pathway or to put it differently how the capillaries were chosen over depth to guarantee an equal distribution of &quot;upstream&quot; and &quot;downstream&quot; capillaries. I kindly ask the author to describe if this has been considered in some way? If it has not been considered the possible impact on the depth dependent results should be discussed.</p><p>The EAT drop over depth is one of the major results of this manuscript and as the authors state in the discussion &quot;EAT measurements are typically much noisier&quot; (Discussion section). Consequently, I believe that the available data should be analysed as rigorously as possible.</p><p>I disagree with the given explanations why RBC flux in layer IV is supposed to be higher than in layer I. What matters here is not the average RBC flux and the higher capillary density per layer but the flux into the capillary bed per layer or to put it differently the flux out of the diving arterioles per layer.</p><p>The given arguments connecting average RBC flux and capillary density are not plausible. I try to explain this with a simplified example. Imaging two similar tissue volumes: One with a single vessel and flow rate q1 through that vessel. The second one also has an inflow rate of q1 but the vessel splits in two vessels. In both cases the inflow (and thus the oxygen availability) per tissue volume is the same. The vessel density is however higher in the second one. The authors now argue that the macroscopic flow rate would be larger in the second example, which is not true.</p><p>Of course, higher vessel density, i.e. more flow pathways, might have an effect on the overall flow rate. However, many open questions remain regarding these issues and simply relating RBC flux and capillary density to estimate the overall flow is not correct.</p><p>The referenced figures (Suppl. Figure 7b in Sakadazic et al., 2014 and Figure 2c in Gould et al., 2017) show the number of capillary segments, which is not the same as vessel density.</p><p>In the original work from Blinder et al., 2013 Figure 2c the capillary density increased from ~4% in layer I to ~5% in layer IV, which is an increase by ~20% but not by 50%.</p><p>Taken together, my initial question remains, i.e. the depth-dependent blood flow/oxygen availability has a strong impact on the actual oxygen extraction per layer. This should be discussed properly. Maybe it would good to change the variable name to depth-dependent saturation difference or comparable, because the term oxygen extraction seems to be misleading.</p><p>I believe the impact statement should be improved. &quot;Homogenization&quot;, &quot;Mechanism&quot; and &quot;adapts&quot; suggest that the presented study looks at active mechanisms or dynamic changes. However, the work is a detailed description of the steady state flow and oxygen distribution.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested before acceptance, as shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;More homogeneous capillary flow and oxygenation in deeper cortical layers correlate with increased oxygen extraction&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Using the new 2P phosphorescence probe PtTAPIP, synthesized by the group of S. Vinogradov (one of the co-authors) and which has an excellent 2PA cross section, the authors succeed in detecting all capillary parameters: mean-PO2, RBC flux and velocity and also erythrocyte-associated transients i.e. RBC PO2, Inter RBC-PO2. These measurements are reported for each layer of the cortex.</p><p>The work is interesting but lacks novelty and the analysis is not rigorously done. The Introduction requires a paragraph describing previous theoretical and experimental demonstrations of EATs and the scientific reasons for which the authors could not detected EATs previously. The community of 2PLM users is now expanding and it is important to mention all the flaws the initial labs working with this approach have been through. The introduction should properly describe previous 2PLM works reporting PO2 in mouse cortical layers. Surprisingly, the statistical tests are not adapted to the data preventing the interpretation of most comparisons. To conclude, the new dye is certainly a technical improvement, but the present manuscript requires major rewriting, analysis and does not reach the standards of eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following text to the Introduction to include more details about the previous EATs modeling and measuring:</p><p>“The development of 2PLM of oxygen also enabled measurements of erythrocyte-associated transients (EATs) in cortical capillaries (Lecoq et al., 2011). EATs were first theoretically predicted by Hellums (Hellums, 1977) and extensively investigated over the last four decades using analytical and numerical approaches (Federspiel and Popel, 1986; Hellums, 1977; Lücker et al., 2015, 2017; Popel, 1989). Originally, they were experimentally observed in peripheral capillaries (Barker et al., 2007; Golub and Pittman, 2005), but the full confirmation within the more challenging three-dimensional cortical capillary network was made possible only recently with advent of 2PLM (Lecoq et al., 2011; Lyons et al., 2016; Parpaleix et al., 2013). Since EATs are tightly related to the intravascular resistance to oxygen transport to tissue, their direct measurements are critical for better understanding of the oxygen delivery through the capillary network. However, the dependence of EATs on cortical layer has not been fully explored.”</p><p>We respectfully disagree with the comment about the novelty. Our measurements not only probed deeper cortical layers than previously reported, but, importantly, we have found evidence that several parameters relevant for O<sub>2</sub> transport to tissue are more homogeneous in deeper, presumably more energy demanding cortical layers, at rest. This has been proposed as a mechanism that facilitates O<sub>2</sub> transport to tissue by several recent theoretical works. In addition, several new types of measurements in awake mice are presented in our manuscript, including O<sub>2</sub> extraction in different cortical layers, arteriolar contribution to O<sub>2</sub> delivery, and correlations between the fluctuations of capillary blood flow parameters. Having said that, we do agree with the reviewer that Introduction and Discussion section should be updated to better clarify these points as well as to provide better referencing and comparison with the previous findings. For the related changes in the manuscript text, please see our response to comment #7 by reviewer 3, who had similar requests for updating the text.</p><p>In the revised manuscript we applied ANOVA test to all the data whenever appropriate. The new statistical analysis did not change most important conclusions from the original submission. We revised the text in the Method section, subsection Statistical analysis, and it now reads:</p><p>“Statistical comparisons were carried out using ANOVA or t-test (MATLAB, MathWorks Inc). P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Details about the statistical analysis and measurement information are provided in the figure legends and/or text, where relevant.”</p><p>We agree that it is helpful to provide more details about the differences between previous EATs measurements by using the same imaging technology. The following sentences were added to Discussion section:</p><p>“We would also like to mention that some discrepancy exists between the magnitudes of EATs measured using 2PLM by different groups. For example, rather large EATs were reported in (Lecoq et al., 2011; Lyons et al., 2016; Parpaleix et al., 2013) with the PtP-C343 probe. Much smaller EATs (only a few mmHg) were reported in (Sakadžić et al., 2014) using the same probe, and moderate EATs are reported in the present work based on the measurements using the new probe – Oxyphor2P. It should be mentioned that the data underlying the EATs measurements are typically much noisier than those used to derive mean intravascular and tissue PO2's, since to quantify EATs the signals have to be split into multiple bins at different spatial or temporal distances from RBCs. In addition, the previously used probe PtP-C343 has intrinsically non-single-exponential phosphorescence decay and much lower emission quantum yield. These limitations, in combination with potentially slightly different implementations of acquisition protocols and algorithms for fitting the phosphorescence decay data, are likely to be the dominant factor contributing to the differences in the reported EATs magnitudes. By using Oxyphor2P, which has much stronger signal and much better defined single-exponential decay, making data analysis much more robust, here we greatly reduced uncertainty in the measurements of EATs, which was inherent to the previous probe PtP-C343. Nevertheless, we still would like to emphasize the importance of aligning the acquisition and data analysis protocols across the labs as well as using the same data acquisition protocols during measurement as used for probe calibration.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Technical comments:</p><p>Subsection “Calculation of capillary RBC flux, speed, and hematocrit”: The authors estimate RBC velocity as &quot;v = ø/Δt, where Δt is the time for the RBC to pass through the focal zone, and ø is RBC diameter, assumed to be 6 μm (Unekawa et al., 2010). RBC diameter cannot assume to be 6 µm: in capillaries, RBC orientation and thus &quot;RBC size&quot; varies with capillary diameter, RBC density and velocity. As the shadow size in time, Δt, depends on the &quot;RBC size&quot;, and thus velocity, it cannot be used to calculate velocity. All velocity measurements should be removed from the paper.</p><p>This also raises a problem in the way EATs are defined, as v.Δt is used to determine the distance to the nearest RBC center. I suggest that the authors reanalyze their data considering time and not distance to extract EATs.</p><p>In addition, in response to the Appeal Letter, the editors provided suggestions closely related to the above technical comments.</p><p>“The Reviewing Editor and the Senior Editor have carefully read your appeal letter and agreed that you could send a revised version of your manuscript provided that you succeed in responding to all the points raised by the reviewers. Still, the reviewing editor stresses that in view of the strong concerns raised about your estimation of RBC velocity, you should perform a series of experiments that could be easily done and would test the validity of your hypothesis: you should select several groups of capillaries, with large (5-6 m) and small (2-3 m) diameters, with low (0.2-0.5 mm/s) and high (1-1.5 mm/s) velocities (for both small and large capillaries), and measure the instantaneous longitudinal size of RBC shadows using the line scan approach. This would allow you to verify the extent to which the RBC shadow size varies with time, as well as with the capillary type and velocity (and density, if possible) (See the study in rats by Chaigneau et al., 2003). Depending of your findings, i.e. the level of RBC &quot;size&quot; stability, you should be able to conclude whether your estimation of RBC velocity and its use to detect EATs will remain valid. You could also perform paired point-scan based measurements and line scan measurements in capillaries with stable flow and directly compare whether a similar value of mean RBC velocity is obtained. Note that this latter approach would not tell whether fast (instantaneous) changes of RBC shadow are too frequent to allow the use of RBC velocity to detect EATs.”</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer that the point-scan based RBC speed measurement (also referred to as the <italic>RBC-passage</italic> method) has limitation imposed by assuming the constant RBC diameter and thank the reviewer for suggesting the appropriate experiments to better clarify this issue. Below, we followed the reviewer’s suggestion to validate the point-scan-based RBC speed estimation with additional measurements.</p><p>We performed line-scan measurements in two awake C57BL/6 mice (3-5 months old, female, 20-25 g, Charles River Laboratories). The cranial window was prepared following the same protocol as described in the manuscript. We injected dextran-conjugated Sulforhodamine-B (0.1 ml at 5% W/V in saline, Σ R9379) to label the blood plasma. The RBC speed was measured in 58 capillaries by the line-scan technique (2-s-long acquisition in each capillary with the line-scan frequency 2000 Hz). In addition, we extracted the fluorescence intensity time courses from the same parallel line-scan images, and then the RBC flux and speed were calculated with the procedures described in the manuscript. For each capillary, we also estimated the capillary diameter by fitting the transversal intensity profile to a Gaussian. The diameters were calculated as the full width at half maximum of the Gaussian profiles. Data with R<sup>2</sup>&lt;0.5 were not considered for analysis. The RBC line density and RBC longitudinal size were calculated by following the procedures described in (Chaigneau et al., 2003).</p><p>By averaging over all RBCs in each capillary and then across all 58 capillaries, we obtained the mean RBC longitudinal size (6.9 ± 3.0 µm; Mean ± STD). We also quantified the variation of the longitudinal sizes of RBCs passing through the capillary during 2 s. First, we computed for each capillary the standard deviation (STD) and coefficient of variance (CV) of the longitudinal sizes of all the RBCs measured during the 2-s-long acquisition, where CV was calculated as the ratio of STD to mean RBC longitudinal size within the capillary. Then, we averaged obtained STD and CV values across the 58 capillaries (mean STD = 2.3 ± 0.6 µm; mean CV = 0.4 ± 0.1).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42299.025</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>RBC longitudinal size vs. capillary diameter, RBC speed, and line-density, respectively.</title><p>The measurements were performed in 58 capillaries in two awake mice, within the cortical depth of 0-200 µm.

The mean RBC longitudinal size in capillaries with smaller diameter (2-3 µm) was just slightly larger than in capillaries with diameters equal 4-6 µm, which may be expected due to more squeezing of the RBCs in the thinner capillaries, although the difference was not statistically significant in our measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). Here, the larger-diameter group included capillaries with diameters equal 4-6 µm instead of suggested 5-6 µm.

The differences between the mean RBC longitudinal sizes when measurements were grouped by capillary diameter, RBC line-density, and RBC speed were generally not large, reaching statistical significance only in the case of the high RBC speed group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>), although with the limited sample size of our measurements. However, the fluctuation of the RBC longitudinal size over time in each capillary was moderate (STD = 2.3 ± 0.6 µm). Therefore, we believe that for the purpose of providing mean values and conducting group comparisons, our RBC-passage based RBC speed measurements, while limited by assuming the constant RBC longitudinal length, are still reasonably accurate, as evidenced by the small difference between the mean RBC speed obtained in paired measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). However, as Reviewer correctly pointed out, instantaneous RBC speeds obtained by the RBC passage method may have larger measurement error.</p><p>Since the major findings related to Figure 3 and Figure 4 are sufficiently supported by the RBC flux measurements alone, in the revised manuscript we present the RBC speed measurements from these figures in the Supplementary data, as we believe that they represent a valuable additional support to our findings and may also be of general interest to the research community interested in cortical capillary blood flow distributions.</p><p>Regarding the effect of the RBC speed measurements on the EATs estimation, we would like to clarify that RBC-PO2, InterRBC-PO2 and EATs were calculated without involving RBC speed (e.g., the results in Figure 6B,C and Figure 7C in the original manuscript). Instead, peaks and valleys of the phosphorescence intensity recordings (Figure 1C) were directly used such that RBC-PO2 was calculated with all the phosphorescence decays in the valleys (RBC-passages) in the segmented phosphorescence intensity time course (Figure 1C), InterRBC-PO2 was calculated with the decays in the central 40% of the peaks (plasma), and EATs were calculated as RBC-PO2 – InterRBC-PO2. In the revised manuscript, we better clarified this in subsection “Calculation of capillary PO2 gradients and EATs”, by stating that:</p><p>“RBC-PO2 was calculated with all the phosphorescence decays in the valleys (RBC-passages) in the segmented phosphorescence intensity time course (Figure 1C). InterRBC-PO2 was calculated with the decays in the central 40% of the peaks (plasma). EATs were calculated as RBC-PO2 – InterRBC-PO2.”</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that, because EATs were estimated based on average RBC-PO2 and InterRBC-PO2 from the passage of multiple RBCs (Lecoq et al., 2011), EATs estimation represents an average EATs value from the file of RBCs passing through the capillary segment during measurement.</p><p>Finally, Figure 6A in the original manuscript presented the only EATs-related data that was dependent on the RBC speed measurements. As suggested, we replaced it with the equivalent figure where PO2 was presented as a function of time from the RBC center (instead of distance that relies on instantaneous RBC speed measurement). Two versions of the Figure 6A are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref> for comparison. The earlier version of Figure 6A is now presented in the Supplementary data, as we believe it presents a valuable complementary view on the PO2 distributions between RBCs. The potential effect of the instantaneous RBC speed measurement error on the presented data was discussed in the Supplementary text that accompanies the figure.</p><p>The following text was added to Discussion section to better clarify the use of RBC speed measurements by the RBC passage method:</p><p>“Besides, the RBC speed was calculated by assuming a constant RBC size along the capillary axis, without considering its potential variation due to RBC speed, hematocrit and capillary diameter. In a separate set of measurements (n = 2 awake mice), we performed line-scan measurements (Kleinfeld et al., 1998) in 58 capillaries (2-s-long measurements, 2 kHz line-scan rate) and obtained very close mean RBC speed values by processing the data using two methods: by estimating the angle of the RBC-shadow stripes (mean RBC speed = 0.61 mm/s) and by the RBC-passage technique used in this manuscript (mean RBC speed = 0.69 mm/s). The mean RBC longitudinal size was estimated by following the procedures described in (Chaigneau et al., 2003), and it did not vary significantly as a function of RBC speed, line-density and capillary diameter, except for the fast RBCs (&gt;1 mm/s), which are also associated with the noisier measurements by both techniques. However, the fluctuation of the RBC longitudinal size over time in each capillary was moderate (STD = 2.3 ± 0.6 µm). Therefore, group comparison of the mean RBC speed values measured by the RBC-passage method may be performed with the reasonable accuracy, but instantaneous RBC speeds obtained by this method may have larger measurement errors. These limitations of the technique should be considered for particular experimental designs.”</p><fig id="respfig3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42299.027</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-42299-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Calculation of capillary RBC flux, speed, and hematocrit”: The authors make the same mistake as Parpaleix et al., (2013) and Lyons et al., (2016) in the way they estimate hematocrit, which is normally a measure of blood volume percentage: &quot;Hematocrit was estimated as the ratio of the combined duration of all valleys associated with the RBC passages to the duration of the entire time course.&quot; Because RBC elongation varies with velocity (see first comment), the hematocrit calculated in the paper will depend on velocity.

This approach tacitly assumes that a layer-specific network of microvessels connects arterioles and venules in this layer, and that all RBCs which leave arterioles in the given FOV and layer flow into venules in that same field of view and layer. The authors should cite which theoretical and experimental papers support the hypothesis. In addition, as they have the tools to reconstruct easily the vascular angiograms, they should trace a series of pathways from the pre-capillary arteriole to the post-capillary venule in order to verify the hypothesis, which is key for the paper. They could potentially limit their investigation to layer I and IV pathways, which are likely to differ.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important question. In some of our previous publications we have done the reconstruction of vascular angiograms (i.e. segmentation and graphing), but this procedure and the analysis needed to validate this hypothesis are not easy, and it may take long time to complete. However, in a recent theoretical paper by Schmid et al., (Schmid et al., 2017), it was shown based on large mouse brain microvascular angiograms acquired by David Kleinfeld’s group at UCSD that RBCs are predominantly moving in-plane and that “no significant movement in the direction of the cortical depth takes place.” In the same work, Schmid et al., found layer-specific differences in the flow and pressure distributions in the cortical vasculature. To better clarify this important point, we added the following text into Discussion section:</p><p>“We estimated the depth-dependent OEF, which implies existence of a laminar flow pattern in the brain cortical microvascular network. This was recently confirmed by Schmid et al. (Schmid et al., 2017), who applied numerical modeling of blood flow and tracking of the trajectories of individual RBCs in realistic mouse cortical vasculature, which led to conclusion that RBCs predominantly flow in plane and no significant RBC flow in the direction of cortical depth takes place.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the mouse's head rotated around the rostro-caudal axis during the 2PLM sessions? If not (and unless the objective lens can be inclined, thought this doesn't appear to be the case in Supplementary Figure 1(b)), due to the inclination of the cortical surface at the coordinates of the barrel field it is probable that there is a discrepancy between the reported measurement depths and the true depth of measurement in the cortex. As illustration, the approximately 40-45 degree inclination of the cortex relative to the horizontal at the level of the S1 barrel field (as per Paxinos and Watson), would mean that the maximum reported imaging depth of 600 micros would in fact correspond to a true cortical depth of approximately 460 microns. Thus, the assignation of the measurements to different layers will be compromised. Conversely, if the mouse head is rotated, could the authors note this and comment on the likely effect on the comfort and behavioural state of the mouse during the imaging sessions.</p></disp-quote><p>In our experiments, the mouse head was rotated to make the cortical surface perpendicular to the optical axis. The center of the cranial window in our preparation is 2 mm posterior from Bregma and 3 mm lateral from the midline. We estimated that the rotation angle was ~35°. However, mice were habituated during training to such rotation and they exhibit normal and relaxed behavior during experiments. Therefore, we do not expect that head rotation had adverse effect on the results of our experiments. In the revised manuscript, we clarified this point in subsection “Animal preparation”, which now reads:</p><p>“The training was conducted while mice were resting on a suspended soft fabric bed in a home-built platform, under the microscope. Mice were gradually habituated to longer periods (from 10 minutes to 2 hours) of head-restraint with the head slightly rotated (~35°) to make the cortical surface perpendicular to the optical axis. All mice were rewarded with sweetened milk every 15 minutes during both training and experiments. While head-restrained, the mice were free to readjust their body position and from time to time displayed natural grooming behavior.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Biological:</p><p>3D projections of PO2 maps (Figure 1G) are made with acquisitions lasting only 0.6 seconds (2000 decays).

Specifically, steady averaged oxygen pressures and red blood cell (RBC) flux counts were acquired. In addition, temporal variations within a 9s observation window were collected. A detailed statistical analysis of the layer dependence of oxygenation and RBC fluxes is presented. The main conclusions include the experimental observation of depth dependence of oxygen extraction, and a reduction in the RBC flux variability with increasing cortical depth. This study presents an invaluable experimental body of work that will help to elucidate oxygen extraction mechanisms in the mouse cortex and create in vivo data for mechanistic models to explain the physiochemical principles that drive and control cerebral blood flow and metabolism. This is a significant piece of work which I highly recommend for publication after modifications listed below:</p><p>Technical comments:</p><p>Introduction. The EAT is used to characterize the heterogeneity of the oxygen extraction within capillaries. What is the physical rationale for correlating oxygen point measurements to intracapillary resistance to oxygen delivery? Are these measurements for erythrocyte bound versus unbound oxygen in plasma? How is this EAT related to oxygen saturation?</p></disp-quote><p>Our EATs measurements were conducted with the goals to: (i) enable SO<sub>2</sub> estimation in the capillaries, for which we needed RBC-PO2 measurements, (ii) explore the capabilities of the novel oxygen probe to provide faster and/or more accurate EATs measurements, and (iii) explore EATs dependence on the capillary branch order, RBC line density, cortical layer, etc. The particulate or discrete nature of RBC flow in capillaries causes EATs. Modelling studies (Hellums, 1977; Golub and Pittman, 2005; Barker et al.,. 2007) showed that larger difference between RBC-PO2 and InterRBC-PO2 (i.e., larger EATs) is associated with an increase in the intracapillary resistance to oxygen transport to tissue from capillaries. Due to non-zero EATs, mean capillary PO2 cannot be used in the Hill equation to compute capillary SO2. Instead, RBC-PO2 measured in the plasma in close proximity of the RBCs was used for that purpose, as an approximation of the mean PO2 inside the RBC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It appears that measurements of RBC fluxes (RBC counts) assume that signals are generated from individual RBCs that are sharply separated.

For example, three dimensional predictions of depth dependent oxygen gradients in mouse are given in Gould et al., 2017. Biophysical models to predict depth dependent oxygen gradients in humans are presented in Linninger et al., 2013 and Gould and Linninger, 2015.

In addition, capillary may be close to one or several more oxygenated vessels (arterioles or capillaries), creating the oxygen influx from the tissue into the capillary.

Is there any data on operator dependence of the labeling method? I recommend to consider writing the Discussion section more cautiously to reflect that results are based on an operator dependent method with high uncertainty in segmentation, and that major results would not be affected by uncertainty associated with operator dependence in upstream and downstream labeling.

We wanted to say that grouping data from 3 consecutive branching orders (e.g., A1-A3 and V1-V3), instead of individual ones, helped with reducing the data variance in the presence of limited sample sizes for individual branching orders. In the revised manuscript, we rephrased the sentences in subsection “Low oxygen extraction along the superficial capillary paths contributes to an increase in the 251 mean venular SO2 towards cortical surface” in the original manuscript, which reads now:</p><p>“Due to a limited number of capillary segments with assigned branch order, A1-A3 and V1-V3 capillaries were grouped together to enable group comparisons with stronger statistical power.”</p><p>We verified the results in Figure 7 by randomly choosing 2 branching orders from A1-A3 and 2 branching orders from V1-V3, e.g. A1,2 vs. V1,2, A1,3 vs. V1,2, A1,3 vs. V2,3, etc. The final values were slightly different, but the main conclusions were the same. We discussed how the manual selection was done and the operator dependence.

The authors write that those measurements were performed in &quot;capillaries&quot;. However, it remains unclear how capillaries were identified as capillaries. Were diameter measurements performed? As the RBC diameter of the mouse is 6 µm, single file flow can only be expected for vessel diameters &lt; 6 µm. This aspect is key for the validity of the results.</p><p>We propose that the authors come up with a table describing the measured vessels (type, depth, number) for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>The capillary size permitting single-file flow may not be limited to &lt;6 µm, due to the glycocalyx thickness and, possibly, an additional plasma layer between RBCs and glycocalyx ((Kim et al., 2009; Fedosov et al., 2010), SfN 2018 poster presentation 318.14/VV10). Variability of reported capillary diameters is relatively high, while some measurements estimate even the mean cortical capillary diameter of a mouse above 7 µm (Cai et al., 2018). Such variability in measurements, to some extent, may be attributed to a problem of defining a capillary (Hall et al., 2014; Mishra et al., 2014; Hartmann et al., 2015; Hill et al., 2015; Attwell et al., 2016; Secomb, 2017). Selection of capillaries based on identification of smooth muscle cells and pericytes (and their subtypes) was not performed in our study due to significant complexity that such procedure will add, especially considering a large sample size used in our analysis. Importantly, it may not provide more accurate results, as the debate on what is a proper classification of vessel-types is still ongoing. Instead, we relied on vascular morphology as a guide. Capillaries were typically identified starting one or two segments away from the diving arterioles and surfacing venules based on their morphology (i.e. smaller diameters and higher tortuosity). Importantly, the deep modulation of the phosphorescence intensity time courses indicate that RBCs are flowing in a single-file in capillaries we selected for measurement of PO2 and RBC flux (e.g., Figure 1C). The segmentation of the phosphorescence intensity time courses was evaluated by the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) between the experimental and fitted time course, and the data with R<sup>2</sup>&lt;0.5 was rejected according to the previously established protocol (Lee et al. 2013). We updated the Methods section to better describe selection of capillaries and processing of the phosphorescence intensity time courses.</p><p>In the legend of each figure, we provided the information about animal number, sample size, and imaging depth.

On the other hand, an averaging interval of 0.6 s is too large to resolve fluctuations in the capillary bed. An RBC with an average velocity of 1mm/s would travel 600 µm during that time. So, for the overall statistics, longer periods should be measured, but for describing the fluctuations over time, those segments should be split up into smaller than 0.6 s intervals, so that the fluctuations are dampened too much due to the averaging.</p><p>The arguments given in the discussion for the chosen interval seem to be motivated by dynamics on a larger scale but not by microvascular fluctuations. Why is the rate of oxygen consumption relevant for the capturing microvascular flow dynamics?</p><p>Alternatively, it has to be described more clearly that only fluctuations on the time scale of seconds are analysed and that faster fluctuations persist but are not of interest in the current study.</p></disp-quote><p>It is correct that both faster and slower fluctuations are present in the microvascular network. For example, resting state connectivity studies typically probe frequencies below 0.1 Hz, and respiration and heartbeat introduce frequency components that were smoothed out by our measurements. The temporal resolution and recording interval of our measurements are therefore limited to capturing fluctuations at a rate of oxygen consumption, as described in the original submission, and it is also sufficient for resolving the blood flow transient responses to short neuronal activation (typically within a few seconds for a short stimulus). In the revised manuscript, we expanded the Discussion section to better explain the scope of measurements of temporal fluctuations:</p><p>“The temporal resolution of our measurements (0.6 s) ensured that the blood flow and PO2 fluctuations due to cardiac and respiratory cycles, as they occurred in awake mice, were averaged out, but it is sufficient to capture the dynamics related to the rate of oxygen consumption, which could be estimated as the time for tissue PO2 to drop to zero after blood flow stoppage. As reported in cats, that time was at least several seconds (Acker and Lübbers, 1977; Whalen and Nair, 1975). In addition, blood flow responses to neuronal activation could typically be resolved with such temporal resolution (Uhlirova et al., 2016). However, it is important to note that our experiments probed just one frequency window within a wide range of both faster and slower fluctuations present in the microvascular network.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Analysis of EATs:</p><p>Intracapillary resistance of oxygen transport to tissue decreases in deeper cortical layers (subsection “Intracapillary resistance of oxygen transport to tissue decreases in deeper cortical layers”) and Low oxygen extraction along the superficial capillary paths contributes to an increase in the mean venular SO2 towards cortical surface (subsection “Low oxygen extraction along the superficial capillary paths contributes to an increase in the mean venular SO2 towards cortical surface”):</p><p>In order to understand the observed EAT trends, it is crucial to also analyse RBC-PO2 and interRBC-PO2. This aspect has been neglected for most EAT results. As such, possible reasons for the observed EAT drop in Figure 6C and the EAT increase in V1-V3 segments have not been analysed sufficiently (Based on &quot;Supplementary Figure 3a&quot; RBC-PO2 does not drop? Thus interRBC-PO2 should rise for deeper layers to explain the EAT drop? How can a rise in RBC-PO2 and interRBC-PO2 for deeper cortical layers be explained? A higher interRBC-PO2 would however suggest a &quot;higher intercapillary resistance to oxygen transport&quot; instead of a lower one.)</p><p>Moreover, the EAT strongly depends on the distance of the capillary to the arteriole/venule (see Figure 7C). This impact should be discussed, e.g. how do you make sure that your depth-dependent EAT average is not affected by a larger number capillaries close to arterioles?</p><p>In an earlier work by the same authors, they did not observe EATs. The authors should discuss in detail where this discrepancy originates from.</p></disp-quote><p>The increase in interRBC-PO2 may not necessarily mean higher intravascular resistance (IVR) to oxygen transport to tissue. For example, increase in RBC line-density reduces IVR (Federspiel and Popel, 1986), but it is associated with an increased interRBC-PO2 (Lyons et al., 2016). The EATs may be affected by multiple parameters, such as RBC spacing, shape, and wall-to-RBC spatial clearance (Popel, 1989; Golub and Pittman, 2005; Lücker et al., 2017). In addition, our measurements provide average values from multiple RBC passages, not accounting for fluctuations of parameters influencing EATs, which may differ between cortical layers and/or proximal and distal capillaries and differentially affect the EATs measurements. The EATs did show a trend of dependency on the branching order (Figure 7C in the original manuscript), but the difference between EATs (as well as the RBC line-density) in proximal and distal capillaries did not reach statistical significance in our measurements. Altogether, this leaves a number of possibilities to address in order to understand the detailed mechanisms behind EATs changes across cortical layers and capillary branches. We believe that such work goes beyond the scope of this manuscript, but we are very interested to pursue it in the future studies. We added the following sentences at the end of the paragraph about EATs findings in the Discussion section to better address these points:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“However, it is important to note that mechanisms that govern the EATs values are multifactorial. The EATs may be affected by multiple parameters, such as RBC spacing, shape, and wall-to-RBC spatial clearance (Popel, 1989; Golub and Pittman, 2005; Lücker et al., 2017). In addition, our EATs measurements provide average values based on multiple RBC passages. Therefore, they do not account for fluctuations of parameters that are affecting EATs, which may differ between cortical layers and/or proximal and distal capillaries, and differentially affect the EATs measurements.”</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the previous measurements of EATs by us and other groups, please see our response to comment #1 By reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Depth-dependent oxygen extraction (subsection “Accumulated oxygen extraction fraction increases in deeper cortical layers”, Discussion section):</p><p>We generally agree with the idea to use the difference in oxygen saturation as an indicator of oxygen extraction. However, as also shown in this work here, many factors have an impact on the oxygen saturation. Thus, saturation difference is not always equal to oxygen extraction. For example, higher blood flow in layer I leads to a higher oxygen availability in layer I and thus to higher SO2 values in the venules, even if the oxygen extraction is constant over depth.</p><p>&quot;Benefitting from the improved sensitivity of the new oxygen probe, we were able to measure intracapillary longitudinal PO2 gradients in a larger number of capillaries…&quot; why does the application of the improved probe help to increase the number of vessels measured?</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we did not directly measure total blood flow in different cortical layers. Without knowing the blood flow, as reviewer suggested, it is difficult to tell how much oxygen was extracted. It is also worth pointing that hypothetical case that reviewer created to illustrate his point, namely that blood flow is higher in layer I than, presumably, in layer IV, is probably opposite in the mouse whisker barrel cortex. While our experimental results do indicate that capillary RBC flux is somewhat (~13%) smaller in layer IV than in layer I (Figure 3A), measurements by us and others reported significantly higher capillary density in layer IV than in layer I (~83% higher based on Suppl. Figure 7b in Sakadzic et al., 2014; &gt;50% higher based on Figure 2C, Gould et al., 2017). Combined, these measurements suggest that macroscopic blood flow in layer IV is higher than in layer I, which may be expected as other indicators imply higher oxygen metabolic rate in layer IV. Then, higher blood flow and OEF in layer IV than in superficial cortical layers suggest that oxygen extraction may be much larger in layer IV than closer to the cortical surface. We updated the text in the Discussion section to better clarify these points, which now reads:</p><p>“A faster decrease in SO2 with cortical depth in the ascending venules than in the penetrating arterioles resulted in a higher depth-dependent OEF in the deeper cortical layers, reaching the maximum in layer IV (Figure 2B). In addition, the total blood flow may be higher in layer IV than in layer I, as suggested by the measurements of capillary RBC flux (~13% lower in layer IV than in layer I; Figure 3A) and capillary density (&gt;50% higher in layer IV than in layer I; (Sakadzic et al., 2014; Gould et al., 2017)). Altogether, this implies that oxygen extraction was higher in deeper cortical layers, which would be in agreement with the finding that layer IV has the highest neuronal and capillary density in mouse cortex (Blinder et al., 2013; Lefort et al., 2009; Patel, 1983; Wu et al., 2016), and that the cells in layer IV exhibit the highest cytochrome oxidase labeling activity, suggestive of the highest oxidative metabolism (Land and Simons, 1985).”</p><p>Comparing to the old version of the probe, Oxyphor2P (Esipova et al., 2019) has more red-shifted 2-photon excitation and emission, higher quantum yield, larger 2-photon absorption cross-section (overall, it is ~100X brighter probe), and more single-exponential decay. These improved properties enabled deeper imaging, reduced rejection of data with poor SNR, faster selection of capillaries due to improved contrast of survey scan images, and shorter acquisition times (we collected 30,000 phosphorescence decays per capillary to extract EATs, comparing to the 40,000-60,000 phosphorescence decays per capillary using PtP-C343).</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. All reviewers believe that the work is interesting. They however raised a number of questions that I ask you to address and which would clarify the manuscript. No new data is required. I have summarized the key questions:</p><p>1) The demonstration that RBC size can be estimated from the 2PLM measurements is still not convincing. The way you analyzed your new data is not informative: Comparing the mean RBC values from 58 capillaries measured with Line-Scan and Point-Scan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) does not solve the problem, in particular as the variability is large. Please show the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2A</xref>, with lines joining each values, capillary per capillary. It is important as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B and C</xref> already seem to demonstrate that RBC longitudinal size varies a lot. The 3 reviewers believe that if your new analysis reveals that RBC size cannot be accurately estimated, all RBC velocity data should be removed from the paper and the resulting uncertainty of RBC PO2 measurements be carefully addressed in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous response, we presented <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> (Comparison between the RBC speed measurements by the line-scan and point-scan methods), where the mean values were reasonably close, but the instantaneous speeds differed sometimes significantly, and the interquartile ranges were large. Therefore, our conclusion was that for the purpose of conducting group comparisons with the mean values, our RBC-passage based RBC speed measurements are still reasonably accurate. However, in agreement with reviewers, we concluded that instantaneous RBC speeds obtained by the RBC-passage method may have larger measurement error. While this conclusion about the instantaneous RBC speed measurements was reasonable and based on the differences between the simultaneously measured RBC speeds by the two methods, we agree that only the box-plot presentation of the data may not be the most appropriate in this case since large interquartile ranges may possibly result from perfectly pairwise-matched measurements, which was not the case here. As suggested by reviewers, we now provide both pairwise connections between RBC speed data points obtained by the two methods and the corresponding box plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig6">Author response image 6</xref>). We hope that this figure can help with clarifying the issue. Some additional results are also provided in the response to the comment #2 raised by the reviewer #1.</p><fig id="respfig6"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42299.032</object-id><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>Comparison between the RBC speed measurements by the line-scan and point-scan method.</title><p>The individual RBC speed values estimated by two methods from each capillary (green circles) are connected by green lines.

We agree with reviewers, as we did in the previous response, that instantaneous RBC speed measurements may have larger measurement errors. Pairwise comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig6">Author response image 6</xref>) demonstrate this variability, which seems to be larger for larger RBC speeds (please note that line-scan method also has reduced accuracy at larger RBC speeds). Our RBC speed results may be of general interest to the research community interested in cortical capillary blood flow distributions and we would like to keep them in the Supplementary data. In the revised manuscript, the original Figure 7E that presents the mean RBC speed values in the upstream and downstream capillary branches was moved into the figure supplement. The limitation of the RBC speed estimation was previously explained in the Discussion section and, to further clarify it, we added the following sentence in the Results section:</p><p>“Here, please note that the RBC speed calculation was model-based by assuming a constant RBC size (6 µm) (Unekawa et al., 2010).”</p><p>Regarding the ‘resulting uncertainty of the RBC-PO2 measurements,’ we would like to clarify that, in this study, RBC-PO2 was calculated using the phosphorescence decays corresponding to the valleys (RBC-passages) in the phosphorescence intensity time course. The measured temporal width of the valleys is dictated by the instantaneous size of the RBC passing through the optical focus. The temporal width was estimated by directly fitting for a simple binary pattern, and it doesn’t involve assumption of the constant RBC size used in calculation of the RBC speed.The only EAT-related PO2 result that involved RBC-speed estimation is the distance-resolved PO2 gradients (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Please note that the PO2 gradients and assumption about constant RBC size were not used to calculate any other PO2-related properties (e.g., Mean-PO2, RBC-PO2, InterRBC-PO2 and EAT).</p><p>Some uncertainty of the RBC-PO2 estimation may come from the fact that within each valley in the phosphorescence intensity time course, plasma PO2 likely continuously decreases as a function of distance from the RBC center (valley center). Due to spatial dimensions of the RBC and the excitation beam, when the excitation beam overlaps with the RBC center, measured PO2 likely best represents the PO2 in the space between the RBC and the capillary wall. As the RBC center moves away from the beam focus, the excited volume fraction of plasma region that is more distant from the RBC surface continually increases (assuming very simplistic ellipsoid shape of the RBC). In addition, the thickness of the plasma layer between the RBC and the capillary wall may be slightly different in capillaries with different diameter and for different RBC speeds, which may result in slightly different PO2 in this plasma layer. While the PO2 at the center of the valley likely best represents the PO2 at the surface of the RBC, measurement of PO2 when using the current imaging tools will be noisier if we consider only a very narrow central valley range.</p><p>As we previously described, we averaged the decays in the entire valley to calculate RBC-PO2. However, the PO2 change from the center to the edge of the valley may not be large, as evidenced by a PO2 plateau in the vicinity of the RBC (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Importantly, prompted by the previous reviewer 1’s comment, we compared the RBC-PO2 calculations using the phosphorescence decays from the entire valley (mean RBC-PO2 calculated from 373 capillaries across n = 7 mice is 54.0 ± 4.0 mmHg (mean ± SEM)) and by following the protocol used in (Parpaleix et al. 2013), where PO2 was calculated using the decays at the border of the valley (mean RBC-PO2 = 52.3 ± 4.0 mmHg). The observed small PO2 difference is not statistically significant, it is inconsequential for the results presented in this manuscript, and further confirms that PO2 change across the valley is not large. Therefore, both approaches (averaging across the entire valley or close to its edge) may provide valid results.</p><p>We further clarified these points in the Discussion section by adding the following text:</p><p>“We averaged all the phosphorescence decays within the valleys (i.e., RBC-passages) in the segmented phosphorescence intensity time courses to calculate RBC-PO2. This approach does not consider that within the valley PO2 may vary as a function of distance to the center of the valley, and the extent of this variation may be different among capillaries of different diameter and/or RBC speeds.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please address in the discussion the issue that a saturation difference may depend on several factors.</p></disp-quote><p>We expanded the discussion about the oxygen extraction change across the cortical layers by adding the following sentence:</p><p>“Since oxygen extraction depends on both total blood flow and arterio-venous oxygen saturation difference, it will be important in the future to further experimentally investigate the total blood flow differences across different cortical layers.”</p><p>Please also see our answer to the comment #4 raised by reviewer 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Add the plot for interRBC-PO2 over depth to the supplementary figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion.

In the revised version, the impact statement was updated, and it now reads:</p><p>“Resting-state capillary blood flow and oxygenation are more homogeneous in the deeper cortical layers, underpinning an important mechanism by which the microvascular network adapts to an increased local oxidative metabolism.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have added some comments (see the full reviews attached below) to which you could briefly answer.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have made new experiments, new analysis and the text has improved. Previous works are now better described and discussed. The statistics are more appropriate.</p><p>The new experiments and analysis done in response to comments #2 and #3 are interesting but they do not fully address the issues raised. This concerns primarily RBC velocity measurements. The good news is that it could be easily done with simple analysis without any further experiment.</p><p>The authors initially used the assumption of an identical average size of RBCs to base other calculations, in particular RBC speed. They now show new experiments which results are summarized in several &quot;R1&quot; plots. The plots show that RBC longitudinal size is very variable, increasing very significantly with RBC speed and spreading from 3 to 14 µm (R1C1261 c plot (&lt;30% RBC line-density)). This clearly indicates that RBC shadows measured during PO2 acquisitions cannot be used to estimate RBC speed. Note that the authors should give the &quot;n&quot; for each of the groups of capillaries in all the new &quot;R1&quot; plots.</p><p>This variability of RBC size is unfortunately masked in the R1C2-2 plot. This plot needs to show paired measurements in specific capillaries, the question being whether or not similar values of RBC velocity are recorded by the two methods when (presumably) similar real RBC velocities are measured. Showing population averages for the 58 capillaries assessed occludes the similarity/difference on a capillary by capillary basis. The important point here is that all the data are already acquired, for capillaries of known diameters. So the authors could now easily compare RBC values for paired measurements (with the 2 methods) in capillaries of different diameters. Please indicate the &quot;n&quot; for each of the groups of capillaries and plot, for each group, all RBC speed values measured with the 2 methods. I suspect that the authors will find differences with the two techniques. This would invalidate all RBC measurements obtained with point scan PO2 acquisitions.</p><p>It is important that the authors clarify the point as fluctuations of RBC shadows, whether measured in distance or time from the center of the shadow, will modify the RBC PO2 value. In fact, it will decrease RBC PO2 and thus the EAT amplitude. Could the authors measure the decays as a function of time, but after an alignment at the RBC border? This would solve the problem.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that only box-plot representation of the data in the previous response may not be sufficient to assess pairwise differences in the RBC speed measurements by the two methods. Please see our response to the summary comment #1 for additional details and the updated plot that includes pairwise connections between measurements. We believe that the previous written response addressed this limitation and hope that updated plot will provide additional clarification.</p><p>Regarding the extreme values of estimated RBC longitudinal sizes, please note that they were obtained from the fitted widths of the shadows and the RBC speeds, both of which were extracted from the line-scan images. Measurements of both these parameters have limitations. The line-scan method is less accurate for high RBC speeds, while RBC shadows sometimes may be due to stacked RBCs (as we pointed out previously) and they were noisier when acquired with the line-scan method (due to shorter dwelling time per time-point) than with the point-scan method. This is still not negating that there is an increased error of the instantaneous RBC speed measurements by the point-scan method. However, we contend the mean RBC speed values from the population of capillaries obtained by the two methods are reasonably close. We hope our explanation of this limitation in the manuscript is clear so that readers can be well aware of it while still having a benefit of assessing these measurements in the Supplementary data.</p><p>As reviewer requested, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig7">Author response image 7</xref> we compare the RBC speed values estimated by the two methods.

Smaller difference between RBC-PO2 and InterRBC-PO2 and, consequently, smaller EATs at greater depths are likely a consequence of more narrowly distributed capillary blood flow and oxygenation. It remains unclear to us how EAT STD and CV are related to oxygen delivery, and as a result, we are hesitant to include extensive comments on these parameters in the manuscript. Nevertheless, we are happy to provide these results as figure supplements.</p><p>We can only hypothesize as to why the mean capillary RBC-PO2 and InterRBC-PO2 increase with depth was observed. As reviewer mentioned, change in proportion of upstream to downstream capillaries with depth may contribute. The observed increase in mean values may be in part due to more homogeneous flow and PO2, since in the networks in which vascular oxygen content and blood flow are strongly positively correlated (which is the case here), mean vascular segment PO2 may be higher when PO2 and blood flow distribution is more homogeneous even for the same total blood flow and total oxygen flux through the tissue volume. Other mechanisms may also contribute, but we are not sure that discussion based on our available data will be insightful.</p><p>Regarding the proper sampling of the upstream and downstream capillaries, we believe that our measurement protocol (i.e., measuring PO2 in all capillaries identified within the field of view at each imaging plane) together with the large number of capillaries interrogated at each depth, ensured that upstream and downstream capillaries were sampled equally proportional to their natural number densities. Consequently, by following our measurement protocol, we could not guarantee an equal distribution of interrogated upstream and downstream capillaries unless the equal number of upstream and downstream capillaries is already naturally occurring across the cortical layers. However, regardless of the potential depth-dependent differences in the densities of upstream and downstream capillaries, we believe that our approach (i.e., sampling a large fraction of segments without discriminating them by branching order) is appropriate for obtaining the mean values at different depths. Please see our response to comment #1d from reviewer 4 and the updated subsection “Measurement of RBC-PO2, InterRBC-PO2, EAT, and RBC flow in capillaries” for clarification of the sampling protocol. Please also note that the ratio of the number of upstream to downstream capillaries may contribute to the mean value across all the capillaries at one depth, and that this ratio may be changing with depth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I disagree with the given explanations why RBC flux in layer IV is supposed to be higher than in layer I. What matters here is not the average RBC flux and the higher capillary density per layer but the flux into the capillary bed per layer or to put it differently the flux out of the diving arterioles per layer.</p><p>The given arguments connecting average RBC flux and capillary density are not plausible. I try to explain this with a simplified example. Imaging two similar tissue volumes: One with a single vessel and flow rate q1 through that vessel. The second one also has an inflow rate of q1 but the vessel splits in two vessels. In both cases the inflow (and thus the oxygen availability) per tissue volume is the same. The vessel density is however higher in the second one. The authors now argue that the macroscopic flow rate would be larger in the second example, which is not true.</p><p>Of course, higher vessel density, i.e. more flow pathways, might have an effect on the overall flow rate. However, many open questions remain regarding these issues and simply relating RBC flux and capillary density to estimate the overall flow is not correct.</p><p>The referenced figures (Suppl. Figure 7b in Sakadazic et al., 2014 and Figure 2c in Gould et al., 2017) show the number of capillary segments, which is not the same as vessel density.</p><p>In the original work from Blinder et al., 2013 Figure 2c the capillary density increased from ~4% in layer I to ~5% in layer IV, which is an increase by ~20% but not by 50%.</p><p>Taken together, my initial question remains, i.e. the depth-dependent blood flow/oxygen availability has a strong impact on the actual oxygen extraction per layer. This should be discussed properly. Maybe it would good to change the variable name to depth-dependent saturation difference or comparable, because the term oxygen extraction seems to be misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that what matters is the total blood flow that supplies the cortical layer. We also agree with the conceptual example that reviewer presented, but we believe that flow parameters used by reviewer in this example do not agree with our measurements. To better clarify it, let’s consider the same example with two similar tissue volumes: One with a single vessel and the flow rate q1, and the second one in which the vessel splits in two vessels but each of these two vessels has the flow rate q1 identical as in the single vessel in the first tissue volume. In this case the inflow (and thus the oxygen availability) per tissue volume is two-fold higher in the second sample. We believe that this example more closely represents the blood flow and capillary density in cortical layers I and IV. We measured only a small to moderate decrease (~13%) of the mean capillary RBC flux from layer I to layer IV, but capillary segment density in layer IV is much higher than in layer I (~50%, as measured by us and others). We believe that this supports our statement made in the manuscript that blood flow may be higher in layer IV than in layer I.</p><p>Regarding the measurements of the capillary densities in layers I and IV, probability density of capillary segments as a function of depth was presented in Figure 2C in (Gould et al., 2017) and number of capillary segments as a function of depth was presented in Suppl. Figure 7B in (Sakadzic et al., 2014), which are both directly proportional to the density of the capillary segments. It is correct that the capillary segment density is not the same as the vessel density, but we believe that capillary segment density is even more relevant for considerations of the relation between the mean capillary flow and the total flow (i.e. that considering the length of individual segments may be less important than the number of branching segments off the main supplying vessel). Nevertheless, in Figure D2 in (Blinder et al., 2013), average of the first two bars (layer I extends to ~100 µm depth in the mouse barrel cortex) is close to 50% smaller than the bars in the layer IV.</p><p>While we believe that measurements of the capillary RBC flux and segment density provide strong indication that blood flow in layer IV is larger than in the superficial layers, it will be important to validate this conclusion in the future by direct layer-dependent CBF measurements. Prompted by the reviewer’s comments, we expanded the Discussion section to better clarify that blood flow, oxygen extraction, and arterio-venous saturation difference are mutually dependent observables, and to point out that future direct measurements of CBF in different cortical layers will further strengthen our conclusions (please see the answer to summary comment #2 for details about the inserted text).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I believe the impact statement should be improved. &quot;Homogenization&quot;, &quot;Mechanism&quot; and &quot;adapts&quot; suggest that the presented study looks at active mechanisms or dynamic changes.
