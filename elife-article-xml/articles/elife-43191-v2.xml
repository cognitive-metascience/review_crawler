It is debated whether delay-period neural activity in sensory regions is important for the active maintenance of information during the delay period. Here, we tackle this question by examining the anterior piriform cortex (APC), an olfactory sensory cortex, in head-fixed mice performing several olfactory working memory tasks. Active information maintenance is necessary in these tasks, especially in a dual-task paradigm in which mice are required to perform another distracting task while actively maintaining information during the delay period. Optogenetic suppression of neuronal activity in APC during the delay period impaired performance in all the tasks. Furthermore, electrophysiological recordings revealed that APC neuronal populations encoded odor information in the delay period even with an intervening distracting task. Thus, delay activity in APC is important for active information maintenance in olfactory working memory.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>working

function of the brain that supports the active maintenance and manipulation of information over a delay period of several seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baddeley, 2012</xref>). A buffer between recent external inputs and immediate behavioral outputs, WM is a critical component of cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jonides et al., 2008</xref>). Originally the prefrontal cortex was thought to be the specific site for WM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jacobsen, 1935</xref>). However, later results suggested that parallel distributed circuits are responsible for WM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D'Esposito and Postle, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eriksson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christophel et al., 2017</xref>). Previously, we have shown that the delay-period activity of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice is only important during the learning but not the well-trained phase in an olfactory WM task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we seek to elucidate the contribution of a sensory cortex to WM after mice are well-trained.</p><p>The role of sensory cortices in working memory is debated. On the one hand, the ‘essential theory’ stressed the importance of sensory cortices in WM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pasternak and Greenlee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scimeca et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gayet et al., 2018</xref>), arguing that it is more parsimonious to receive, process, and maintain information in the same regions. Some recording and functional imaging experiments supported the hypothesis that sensory cortices can exhibit information-selective delay-period activity in WM tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pasternak and Greenlee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fuster and Jervey, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miyashita and Chang, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harrison and Tong, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mendoza-Halliday et al., 2014</xref>).Furthermore, perturbation of neural activity in sensory areas can impair WM performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pasternak and Greenlee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colombo et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seidemann et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, the ‘unessential theory’ stressed that sustained activity emerges as a property of association cortices, but is not present in early sensory cortices, at least in the visual, somatosensory, and auditory domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mendoza-Halliday et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Kerkoerle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leavitt et al., 2017</xref>). More importantly, a distractor presented during the delay period diminished delay-period sustained activity in sensory cortices without changing performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bettencourt and Xu, 2016</xref>), arguing that sensory cortices may not be important for WM tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The two theories make opposite predictions in perturbation and recording experiments. If a sensory cortex is important, behavioral performance should be impaired following suppression of delay-period activity in a sensory region in a temporally precise manner. Moreover, in a task with distractors during the delay, the neuronal activity of sensory regions should be able to maintain information even following a distractor. If a sensory cortex is not important, both experiments should produce negative results. In the current study, we specifically tested these predictions in the olfactory domain in behaving mice, using optogenetic perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fenno et al., 2011</xref>) and electrophysiological recordings with the necessary temporal specificity.</p><p>To engage active WM maintenance, we trained mice to perform several WM tasks, including a dual-task paradigm. In this task, we inserted a distracting task into the delay period of an ongoing WM task. To perform the dual task successfully, mice need to maintain the sample information of the outer WM task while performing the distracting task. Such a dual-task design explicitly challenges the central executive control ability of a subject (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baddeley, 2012</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Watanabe and Funahashi, 2018</xref>). A hallmark of the dual task is that performance in either of the component tasks is reduced relative to that trained in isolation, termed dual-task interference. Previously, the neural correlates of dual-task interference have been reported in the neuronal activity of monkey prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watanabe and Funahashi, 2014</xref>) and in results from human functional imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D'Esposito et al., 1995</xref>). Patients with a frontal-cortex lesion are also impaired in this type of task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baddeley et al., 1997</xref>), but the functional role and neural correlates of sensory cortices in dual-task performance remain unknown.</p><p>In the current study, we focused on the anterior piriform cortex (APC) for olfactory WM. The APC is a good candidate because it is directly connected with the olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miyamichi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bekkers and Suzuki, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Price and Powell, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davison and Ehlers, 2011</xref>), encodes odor information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bekkers and Suzuki, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schoenbaum and Eichenbaum, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poo and Isaacson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stettler and Axel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shusterman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Courtiol and Wilson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhan and Luo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gire et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iurilli and Datta, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolding and Franks, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Otazu et al., 2015</xref>), and is important for olfactory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bekkers and Suzuki, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Courtiol and Wilson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2011</xref>). The rich recurrent connectivity within the APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bekkers and Suzuki, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolding and Franks, 2018</xref>) is also well suited for generating reverberating activity that outlasts sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Major and Tank, 2004</xref>). In addition, activity patterns of the APC neurons are critically dependent on olfactory experience, indicating an active involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Courtiol and Wilson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saar et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roesch et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, the piriform cortex is also activated in a human olfactory WM task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zelano et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we addressed the role of the APC in olfactory WM using a combination of optogenetics and electrophysiology methods. We found that the APC plays a prominent role in this task and that its neural activity reflects the maintenance of task parameters through the WM delay.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The design and performance of a delayed non-match to sample task</title><p>To temporally dissociate information maintenance from perception and decision making, we first trained head-fixed mice to perform an olfactory delayed non-match to sample (DNMS) task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), using an automatic training system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2018</xref>). In this task, two odors (S1, n-butanol; or S2, propyl formate) were presented to mice, separated by a delay period (5–40 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The first odor residue was briskly cleared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, the delay-period residual concentration is lower than the sensory threshold for this task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2014</xref>]) at the beginning of the delay period. Licking following the non-match trials (S1-S2, or S2-S1) led to water reward. No explicit punishment was applied for the error trials.

To test the potential role of the APC in the well-trained phase, we optogenetically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fenno et al., 2011</xref>) suppressed the delay-period activity of APC pyramidal neurons after mice were well-trained (defined as correct rate above 80% in 40 consecutive trials). Transgenic mice expressing channel-rhodopsin (ChR2) only in GABAergic neurons [with the promoter of the <italic>Slc32a1</italic> gene that encodes vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), referred to as VGAT-ChR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>)] were used as the experimental group, whereas the ChR2-negative littermates were used as the control group in a blind design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, see Materials and methods). The VGAT-ChR2 mice have been used extensively in many studies to suppress local excitatory neurons (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). The expression and effectiveness of ChR2 were verified by immunostaining and by op-tetrode single-unit recording, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a and b</xref>). The specificity of optogenetic suppression was verified by c-<italic>Fos</italic> labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>). The majority of the APC neurons (79%, 82 out of 104) were suppressed during the optogenetic stimulation, while a small fraction (12%, 12 out of 104) were activated; the optogenetic effect diminished within 1 s after laser-offset (see the third dotted line marked 1 s after laser-offset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>; spike-sorting quality in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; and example single neurons showing activity modulation induced by optogenetic perturbation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Activity suppression was achieved by step-laser illumination (473 nm, 2 mW) during laser-on trials, each followed by a laser-off trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Performance was impaired following optogenetic suppression of the APC delay-period activity in the VGAT-ChR2 mice, with delay duration of 5, 8, or 12 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h–j</xref>; for effect size and complete ANOVA statistics, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5i–m</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">2</xref>). Moreover, optogenetic suppression in trials with longer delay duration resulted in larger deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h–j</xref>).Note that the performance of control mice could also be affected by light illumination with longer duration, for example 10 s laser-on condition in the DNMS task with 12 s delay, probably through distraction by visual illumination. However, this was controlled by the ANOVA interaction statistics. Behavioral deficits were reflected as an increased false-alarm rate and a decreased discriminability (<italic>d'</italic>) (false alarm rate for all delay durations, <italic>d’</italic> for 8 s and 12 s delay durations, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l,n</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5, b,f and h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">2</xref>). Similarly, the lick efficiency (the percentage of successful licks with reward) was impaired in laser-on trials in the VGAT-ChR2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1m</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5, c and g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">2</xref>). The ability of the mice to lick during the response window, as well as outside the response window, was otherwise not affected by laser illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6, a–e</xref>). Note that the mice exhibited transient anticipatory licking only in the trials with fixed association between laser-offset and test-onset. The differences are small and transient, and are unlikely to affect the quantification of behavioral response during the response window.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Statistical interaction between duration of delay period and timing of optogenetic suppression</title><p>To further clarify the interactions among delay duration, laser duration, and laser onset/offset, we performed two more sets of optogenetic experiments. In the first set of experiments, the delay duration of the DNMS task was fixed at 12 or 20 s but the laser onset and duration were systematically changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b–c</xref> for 12 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,e</xref> for 20 s delay duration). Specifically, optogenetic suppression of APC neuronal activity was varied in both duration (3, 6, 10, or 12 s) and temporal position (early, mid or late in the delay period) in a trial-by-trial fashion. A visual mask was applied to diminish the visual distraction induced by laser illumination (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>). Optogenetic suppression significantly impaired the DNMS task performance in VGAT-ChR2 mice, especially for laser illumination during the late-delay period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">2</xref>). False alarm rate was also significantly increased in the VGAT-ChR2 mice in similar conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,e</xref>). Miss rate was not affected by the optogenetic suppression in both VGAT-ChR2 and control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">2</xref>). Furthermore, in the laser-on trials for VGAT-ChR2 mice, the duration and timing of laser illumination had a significant interaction in determining the task correct rates, false alarm rates and miss rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">2</xref>). The effect size of the above results is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>.

To exclude this possibility, we suppressed APC activity before odor delivery in three tasks. The logic of the experiments was to recruit perception in similar tasks that do not require delay-period WM. If no behavioral deficit was observed by silencing APC activity, any impaired performance in the DNMS task should not be due to processes unrelated to delay-period WM maintenance. In all three tasks, we observed intact behavioral performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">2</xref>; effect size, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>). First, we optogenetically suppressed APC activity before the sample-delivery period (baseline) for 3 s (delay duration 5 s), 6 s and 10 s (delay duration 12 s) in the DNMS task, matching the delay-period optogenetic suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–c</xref>). Second, mice were trained to perform a sensory-discrimination Go/No-go (GNG) task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). The APC activity before the test odor was optogenetically suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d and e</xref>). Third, mice were trained to perform a non-match-to-sample without delay (NMS-WOD) task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). The essence of the design of this task is that the decision is based on matching the relationship between sample and test odors, as in the DNMS task. The third task takes longer to train (~300 trials) than the Go/No-go task, which can be learned within 100 trials in one day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting a higher level of attention and effort. However, there is a minimal delay between odors, and therefore no requirement for information maintenance. APC activity before and after test-odor delivery was suppressed in the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d and f</xref>). The lack of behavioral impairment in all three control experiments excluded the perception-impairment hypothesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">2</xref>).

A good model should exhibit a high coefficient of determination in explaining performance (r-squared) and a low Akaike information criterion (AIC, see Materials and methods), which punishes a higher number of free parameters. Such formal model comparison can quantitatively reveal the relative contributions of different behavioral parameters in determining performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hwang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We started with the null-hypothesis that no task parameter affects performance (#1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g,h</xref>).

The genotypes, laser on/off, and the perturbation in delay/baseline period did not further improve the model if added individually (#4). However, the interaction among all these terms improved the model (#5), consistent with impaired performance by optogenetic suppression during the delay-period for the VGAT-ChR2 mice, but not during the baseline period or for the control mice. By eliminating less-predictive variables, we obtained the optimal model (#6, AIC value significantly smaller than all other models; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g–i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata4">4</xref>), which contained only four key parameters and the interactions among them: optogenetic suppression or not during the delay period, match or non-match relationship, and the delay duration (coupled with laser-on duration). This association between the WM delay perturbation and the delay duration is consistent with the important role of APC delay activity in information maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3j</xref>). Quantitatively, the impact of optogenetic perturbation out-weighted that of delay duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3j</xref>). The above analysis further demonstrated the importance of APC delay-period activity for WM in the olfactory DNMS task.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The importance of the APC delay-period activity in an olfactory delayed paired association task</title><p>The specificity of the DNMS task in testing WM maintenance can be disputed, especially in relation to sensory cortices. For example, it has also been suggested that the DNMS task in monkeys can be performed through a recency effect and with little selective memory maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wittig and Richmond, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the activity of a sensory cortex can be suppressed or enhanced following the repetition of a sensory stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miller et al., 1993</xref>). Therefore, one can argue that sensory adaptation, but not WM, may be perturbed by optogenetic manipulation in this task. To eliminate the involvement of repeating sample cues, we trained mice to perform an olfactory delayed paired association (DPA) task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). In each trial of this task (modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schoenbaum and Eichenbaum, 1995</xref>), a sample odor (S1, ethyl acetate; or S2, 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol) was presented, followed by a delay period (13 s), then a test odor (T1, n-butanol; or T2, propyl formate). Mice were rewarded with water if they licked within the response window in the paired trials (S1-T1 or S2-T2), but not in the unpaired trials (S1-T2 or S2-T1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Successful performance of the task required WM maintenance and learning of the arbitrary association between the odor pairs. Importantly, repetition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miller et al., 1993</xref>) or recency effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wittig and Richmond, 2014</xref>) cannot be used to solve the task, because the sample odor is not repeated within a trial. Mice readily learned the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, black curve). Critically, optogenetic suppression of APC delay-period activity impaired DPA performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">2</xref>).

To test this ability in mice, we added a distracting GNG task during the delay period of the DPA task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). This paradigm belongs to the dual-task designs that have been used to study central executive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baddeley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Watanabe and Funahashi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watanabe and Funahashi, 2014</xref>), because mice are required to split attention in the middle of the delay period in order to perform the GNG task, while simultaneously maintaining the sample information of the DPA task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). The design of this task also ensured that any lingering residual sample odor would be flushed by the concentrated olfactory cues of the inner task, therefore the WM but not residual odor is required for the outer-task performance. Mice were trained to perform the DPA task, then the dual-task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d,e</xref>; red and blue curves). After the initial drop in DPA performance, mice learned to perform dual-task well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d,e</xref>). DPA performance in the dual-task paradigm was worse than that in the simple DPA task even in the well-trained phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d,f</xref>), consistent with the dual-task interference observed in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baddeley, 2012</xref>) and monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watanabe and Funahashi, 2014</xref>). Moreover, interference was dependent on the trial types inserted in the DPA delay, with the worst performance for the Go-distractor trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). We then optogenetically suppressed the delay-period activity of APC pyramidal neurons after the distracting GNG task. The DPA false-alarm rate within the dual task increased significantly in the laser-on trials in the VGAT-ChR2 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). The overall performance also tended to differ (genotype-laser interaction p=0.07 in a mixed-between-within-ANOVA). As a negative control, optogenetic suppression before sample delivery did not affect performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1i–n</xref>). The effect size of the above results is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>.

Recording electrodes were advanced daily (approximately 50 µm/day after recording sessions). After 2–4 days into the training, the delay duration was increased to 8 s. We recorded 204 neurons from 19 mice while they performed the task with 4 s delay duration and 156 neurons from 20 mice with 8 s delay duration.

Because the electrodes were generally positioned at different depths during the 4-s and 8-s recording sessions (estimated 200 μm apart), the difference in decoding power for the different delay durations could be due to different layers or learning experience. It is nonetheless interesting to see that the fraction of sample selective neuron in the APC was greater in the 8s-delay task than in the 4s-delay task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3f</xref>), both in the total fraction of selective neurons (sample-selective for more than 0.5 s) and in the subpopulation that showed longer persistent selectivity (sample-selective for more than 5 s). Furthermore, the dynamics of the decoding accuracy in the 8s-delay-tasks was not a passive continuation of the decoding accuracy in the 4 s task, as the decoding accuracy at 5 s since sample onset was much higher in the 8 s task (~85%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5k</xref>) than in the 4 s task (~70%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5j</xref>), consistent with the active recruitment of neurons for the maintenance of information in accordance with task requirements.</p><p>To further assess whether APC activity could stably maintain WM during the delay period, we performed a population cross-temporal discrimination (CTD) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meyers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stokes et al., 2013</xref>). The essence of this analysis is to use the activity at a given time to decode the maintained information (the sample odor) at other time points systematically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5l</xref>, see Materials and methods).

Using optogenetic manipulation in a series of behavioral tasks that temporally isolated the retention of sensory information during the delay period from decision making, we demonstrated that WM performance can be impaired in WM tasks with or without distraction. The control experiments suggested that the behavioral defects of optogenetic perturbation during the delay period may be due to impaired information maintenance. The APC population activity exhibited statistically significant mutual information and decoding power for the odor samples during the odor-delivery and delay periods. We observed that only about 10% of APC neurons carried WM information during the late delay period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g and i</xref>). The small percentage of APC neurons that are involved in coding the maintained information is consistent with the sparse coding previously observed in piriform cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poo and Isaacson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stettler and Axel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miura et al., 2012</xref>) (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolding and Franks, 2017</xref>). Therefore, although the APC activity is constantly updated by ongoing sensory inputs, this sensory cortex could resist overwriting and could maintain information through population activity in the WM tasks, even when a distracting task is performed during the delay period.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Debate about the necessity of delay-period activity in sensory cortices for WM</title><p>There is an ongoing debate concerning the necessity of delay-period activity of sensory cortices in WM.

Perturbation during the delay period specifically is a key experiment that can disentangle the debate. For example, in the thought experiment proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scimeca et al. (2018)</xref>, temporal suppression of the delay-period activity of an early sensory region should produce behavioral defects if sensory regions are essential for WM maintenance. Our experimental data are consistent with this latter prediction, suggesting that a sensory region can be important for olfactory WM.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Effect size of optogenetic suppression</title><p>We observed a small effect of optogenetic suppression on behavioral performance with shorter duration of optogenetic suppression. For example, the effect size was −0.8 and −0.68 for 5 s and 8 s delay duration, respectively, which were statistically smaller than the effect size of −1.62 observed for the 12 s delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h–j</xref>). Also, there was no significant drop in performance when the APC was suppressed in early delay period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b and d</xref>). Furthermore, in the fixed optogenetic suppression varied delays task, the effects of the optogenetic suppression of APC were also quite variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). One possibility may be that our optogenetic suppression was quite focal and spared large areas of APC, as shown by the reduction in <italic>c-Fos</italic> stained active neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Therefore the simpler tasks with shorter-delay duration imposed less demand on APC delay-period activity, and the remaining unaffected areas within APC might be sufficient to maintain the information. Another possibility is that there could be a loop of activity involving APC and other regions (see below for more discussion). Thus, suppression of activity in other parts of the brain might contribute to our observations. Moreover, the partial optogenetic suppression could act like a damper on recurrent activity, with a slow decay rate. This would produce the observed larger effect of the longer illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1h–j</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2b</xref>). The observation of a smaller optogenetic effect for a short delay duration is consistent with other studies. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolkan et al. (2017)</xref> showed that optogenetic silencing of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) impaired spatial WM performance in a task with 60 s but not 10 s delay duration.</p><p>The optogenetic silencing impairment in DPA performance is smaller than that in the DNMS task (comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The designs of the two tasks are quite different, for example, the DPA task requires the association between sample and test odors, which is not required for the DNMS task. Therefore, the neural circuit for the DPA task might be different from that for the DNMS task, which remains to be determined in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Distributed network interaction</title><p>The olfactory pathway downstream from the olfactory bulb is organized in a highly parallel manner, as mitral/tufted neurons in the olfactory bulb project to multiple brain regions, including the APC, the anterior olfactory nucleus, the cortical amygdala, the olfactory tubercle, and the lateral entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miyamichi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Price and Powell, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davison and Ehlers, 2011</xref>).

Therefore, it is pertinent to examine the roles of different brain regions in learning and well-trained mice. The results of our optogenetic and recording experiments demonstrated that the APC delay activity was important in the well-trained phase. Thus, the functional role of memory maintenance may be partially transferred from the mPFC to the APC through learning. The underlying mechanisms of the transfer and the potential involvement of other brain regions remain to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Involvement of APC in active maintenance in the dual-task WM design</title><p>The dual-task design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) explicitly challenges the central executive control ability of a subject (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baddeley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Watanabe and Funahashi, 2018</xref>). It is an important tool to study the distributed nature of WM maintenance, which could depend on task complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christophel et al., 2017</xref>). A simpler sensory memory task could be more dependent on a sensory cortex than a more complex task. Thus, if suppressing the delay activity of a sensory cortex in the dual task could impair WM performance, it will certainly implicate this sensory region in active information maintenance in WM. Most of the previous studies have focused on prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watanabe and Funahashi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D'Esposito et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baddeley et al., 1997</xref>). Here, we show that the delay-period activity of a sensory cortex can maintain sample information after the distracting task, and that suppressing this activity resulted in performance impairments (e.g. significantly increased false-alarm rate). Therefore the delay-period activity of this sensory cortex is involved in dual-task performance.</p><p>Neuronal activity in the APC is associated with olfactory perception, but it also varies depending on brain states, task design, or learning experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Courtiol and Wilson, 2017</xref>).

Consistent with this notion, our results demonstrated the importance of the APC activity beyond sensory perception. In summary, our results underscore the importance of the olfactory sensory cortex in memory maintenance beyond immediate sensory processing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">VGAT-CHR2:B6.Cg-Tg(<italic>Slc32a1</italic>-COP4*H134R/EYFP)8Gfng/J</td><td valign="top">Dr. Guoping Feng (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>)</td><td valign="top">VGAT-ChR2-EYFP line 8</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">goat polyclonal anti-GFP (FITC)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_305635">AB_305635</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">rabbit polyclonal anti-<italic>c-Fos</italic></td><td valign="top">Synaptic Systems</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2231974">AB_2231974</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Cy5 goat polyclonal anti-rabbit</td><td valign="top">Jackson</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2338013">AB_2338013</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">DAPI</td><td valign="top">Beyotime</td><td valign="top">catalog number: C1002</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">propyl formate</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">catalog number: 245852</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">butyl formate</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">catalog number: 261521</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">methyl butyrate</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">catalog number: 246093</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">catalog number: W364703</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">1-butanol</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">catalog number: B7906</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">1-pentanol</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">catalog number: 398268</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">ethyl propionate</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">catalog number: 112305</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">propyl acetate</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">catalog number: 133108</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">MATLAB</td><td valign="top">MathWorks</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">LIBSVM</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/">https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_010243">SCR_010243</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were performed in compliance with the animal care standards set by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Neuroscience, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China).

Mice were allowed to perform up to 300 trials each day, a consecutive combination of 10 miss and correct rejection trials also triggered the end of the session. Only the trials within well-trained performance windows (no less than 80% correct rate within consecutive 40 unperturbed trials) were included in the data analysis, unless stated otherwise. In the fixed delay, varied optogenetic stimulation tasks, the well-trained window was reduced to 20 consecutive unperturbed trials because of the reduced number of unperturbed trials in each block. In the fixed optogenetic stimulation, varied delay task, the well-trained window is defined as no fewer than six correct trials in eight unperturbed trials in a 32-trial block. In the increasing delay duration experiment, the mice were trained to perform the DNMS task with 5 s delay to the well-trained criterion, then the delay duration was increased every day; the first 100 trials were included in the the analysis to accomplish direct parallel comparison. An inter-trial interval twice as long as the delay duration separated consecutive trials.</p><p>In the DPA task, one of two sample odors was presented for 1 s at the start of a trial, followed by a delay duration of 13 s, then one of two different test odors was presented for 1 s. One of the sample odors and one of the test odors formed a rewarded pair, while the other two odors formed another rewarded pair. After a 1-s pre-response-delay, mice were trained to lick in the 0.5-s response window only in paired trials. <italic>Hit</italic> or <italic>False alarm</italic> was defined as the detection of lick events in the response window in a paired or non-paired trial, respectively. Similarly, <italic>Miss</italic> or <italic>Correct rejection</italic> were defined as absence of a lick event in the response window in a paired or non-paired trial, respectively. A reward of 5 μl water was triggered immediately only after <italic>Hit </italic>responses; mice were neither rewarded nor punished following other responses. Mice were allowed to perform up to 300 trials each day, a consecutive combination of 10 miss and correct rejection trials also triggered the end of the session. Only the trials within well-trained performance windows (no fewer than 80% correct rate within consecutive 40 unperturbed trials) were included in the data analysis, unless stated otherwise. An inter-trial interval as long as the delay durations separated consecutive trials.</p><p>The multiple sample DPA (MS-DPA) task is like the DPA task described previously, except that the number of candidate sample odors was increased to six; three of the samples and one test formed rewarded pairs (e.g., S1, S2, S3 and T1), and the other three samples and the other test formed the remaining rewarded pairs (e.g., S4, S5, S6 and T2). The delay duration in the MS-DPA task is 5 s.</p><p>In the dual-task, a secondary Go/No-go task was inserted into the delay duration of the DPA task. Delivery of the olfactory cue for the Go/No-go task started 3 s into the DPA task delay period and continued for 0.5 s. After a 0.5 s pre-response-delay, mice were trained to lick in the 0.5-s response window after the Go stimulus. <italic>Hit</italic> or <italic>False alarm</italic> of the Go/No-go task was defined as the detection of lick events in the response window in a Go or No-go trial, respectively. Similarly, <italic>Miss</italic> or <italic>Correct rejection</italic> were defined as absence of a lick event in the response window in a Go or No-go trial. A reward of 5 μl water was triggered immediately only after <italic>Hit </italic>responses; mice were neither rewarded nor punished following other responses. The sample and test stimuli in the DPA task and the stimulus in the Go/No-go task were arranged independently in a pseudo-random fashion. Mice were allowed to perform up to 288 dual-task trials each day, a consecutive combination of 10 miss and correct rejection trials also triggered the end of the session. For the well-trained phase studies, only the trials within well-trained performance windows (no fewer than 80% DPA correct rate within consecutive 40 unperturbed trials) were used for data analysis; for the learning phase, all trials were included in the analysis, unless stated otherwise. An inter-trial interval as long as the delay duration of the DPA task separated consecutive trials. The Go/No-go task is omitted in one third of all trials. The performance in the 4<sup>th</sup> day of the dual-task learning stage was used to estimate dual-task interference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>).</p><p>Mice were water restricted for 48 hr before the start of training, followed by habituation, shaping and learning phases, before well-trained optogenetic sessions. In the habituation phase, mice were head-fixed in the olfactometry apparatus for 2 hr and allowed to lick water from the water port, encouraged by program-controlled water delivery. Typically in 1 to 2 days, mice could learn to trigger more than 100 water rewards spontaneously. In the shaping phase, only non-match or paired trials were presented, and water was pseudo-randomly and programmatically delivered after 1/3 of the <italic>Miss</italic> responses to encourage task engagement. The shaping phase ended once the mice could perform more than 32 <italic>Hit</italic> responses in 40 consecutive trials (80% performance). In the learning phase, both match and non-match, paired and non-paired trials were presented, and each four consecutive trials that consisted of four balanced sample-test-reward combinations was shuffled. The learning phase ended when the mice were able to perform more than 32 <italic>Hit</italic>/<italic>Correct Reject</italic> responses in 40 consecutive trials (80% performance). The performance (referred to as the ‘correct rate’ in the labels of figures) was defined as the total fraction of hit and correct rejection responses. The sensitivity index (<italic>d′</italic>) was defined as <italic>d'</italic>=<italic>norminv (Hit rate) – norminv (False choice rate)</italic>. The lick efficiency was defined as the number of rewarded licks divided by the sum of rewarded and unrewarded licks in the response window. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>For all experiments with blind design, RQ Hou, HM Fan and ZQ Chen labeled the mice with unique numbers without revealing the genotype; they did not participate in the behavior or optogenetic experiments. The genotype of mice would only be revealed after the experiments and statistical analysis of individual mice had been finished. Furthermore, all of the mice participated in the same behavior studies in identical sequences in the task design, so there is no need for further randomization of samples in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Stereotaxic implantation of optical fiber</title><p>Implantation of optical fiber was carried out in a manner similar to that described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, mice were anaesthetized and placed in a stereotaxic instrument (Stoelting Co. Wood Dale, IL). After removal of the scalp, periosteum and other associated soft tissues, a custom designed steel plate was fixed onto the skull using tissue adhesive (1469 SB, 3M, Maplewood, MN) and dental cement. Craniotomies of roughly 1 mm in diameter were made bilaterally above the anterior piriform cortex (APC). For optical fiber implantation, two optic fibers (200 μm in diameter, Leizhao Biotech., Shanghai, China) with ceramic ferrule were implanted at A.P. 1.78 mm, M.L. 2.60 mm and D.V. 3.40 mm. A thin layer of silicone elastomer (Kwik-Sil, WPI, Sarasota, FL) was applied to protect the brain tissue, then dental cement was applied to connect the skull, plate and optical fibers for structural support.

Briefly, an optical patch cable (200 μm in diameter, N.A. 0.37) was used to connect the implanted optic fiber (through a ceramic sleeve) to a laser source (BL473T3-50FC, SLOC, Shanghai, China). Laser power was programmatically controlled by a PIC microcontroller through analog voltage input. Output laser power was measured with a laser power meter (LP1, Sanwa Electric Instrument Co., Tokyo, Japan) and compensated for optical power loss in fiber implant and coupling attenuation (determined before surgery). In optogenetic experiments with laser power ramp, the dynamics were further calibrated by an oscilloscope.</p><p>In the DNMS task optogenetic sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1h</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1n</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2b</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2d</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), the optogenetic suppression was arranged in an interleaved one-trial-on, one-trial-off fashion; each session started with a laser-off trial. In the fixed delay, varied optogenetic stimulation tasks, various optogenetic stimulation designs, including laser-off trials, were pseudo-randomly carried out on a trial-by-trial basis.

One cranial window of 0.5 by 1 mm was made in either hemisphere centered at A.P. +1.42 mm and M.L. 2.5 mm, and electrodes were lowered at D.V. 3 mm to target the APC. Tissue gel (1469 SB, 3M) and dental cement were carefully applied to cover the exposed brain tissue and to fix the microdrive. Antibiotics (ampicillin sodium, 20 mg/mL, 160 mg/kg b.w.) was injected for three consecutive days after surgery. Behavior training started 7 to 14 days after that.

Wide band signals (0.5–8000 Hz) from all tetrodes were amplified (×20,000) and digitized at 40 kHz with the Multichannel Acquisition Processor (Plexon Inc, Dallas, Texas) and all data were saved to hard-disks. Detection and sorting of spike events were performed offline as described in a previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, offline spike detection was performed with Offline Sorter (Plexon Inc). Raw signals were filtered in 250~8000 Hz to remove field potentials. Signals larger than five times the standard deviation recorded on any recording site of the tetrode were considered to be spike events. Principle component analysis (PCA) was performed for tetrode-waveforms to extract the first three principle components (PCs) explaining the largest variance. Then, the contour or valley-seek clustering techniques provided by Offline Sorter were performed in 2D or 3D feature space (including principle components) of waveforms. Single units were included only if no more than 0.15% of the spikes occurred within a 2 ms refractory period (false-alarm rate) and the averaged firing rate was higher than 2 Hz. All of the neurons that we sorted exhibited large signal-noise ratios and small false-alarm rates, demonstrating the high quality of single-unit sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). All recording sites were further confirmed by passing current (50µA, 100 ms, 1 Hz x five pulses) through the electrodes, and verified with DAPI staining and immunochemistry 1 day after the lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>All further analyses were performed by custom-written codes in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA) and Java (Oracle).

Briefly, the spike counts for each neuron during well-trained correct task trials were binned into 500 ms windows and grouped by sample odors. Only neurons with more than 30 well-trained trials for each sample odor were included to minimize overfitting. The firing rates for all neurons were normalized to the [0, 1] range. For each repeat, the trials were first randomly partitioned to a training set (no fewer than 30 trials) and a testing set (one trial for each sample odor, unless stated otherwise), with no overlap between the training and testing sets. From the training set, the firing rates of all neurons in 30 bootstrap trials for each sample odor were selected to train the support vector machine (SVM) with the <italic>radial basis function</italic> (RBF) kernel. From the testing set, one trial for each sample odor was used to test the classification accuracy. All trials were then randomly re-partitioned and the training and testing repeated. Averaged decoding accuracy was obtained with 500 repeats. Because the training and testing sets never overlapped and all trials were likely to be used both in training set and testing set due to the large repetition number, the average decoding accuracy equals the cross validation accuracy in a resampled leave-one-trial-out form. A good combination of the two parameters for the RBF kernel, <italic>c</italic> and <italic>γ</italic>, were grid-searched using exponentially growing sequences in the ranges 2 ^ [−5, 5] and 2 ^ [−10, 0], respectively. For the shuffled control, the procedure was repeated 1000 times with the nominal sample odor for each trial randomly redistributed. For the cross temporal decoding analysis, the <italic>c</italic> and <italic>γ</italic> values were kept at the previous obtained value, and the decoding accuracy was calculated using template and test activity vectors from different time windows across the entire length of a trial. For the study of correlation of behavioral performance and population neuronal decoding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>), the decoding accuracy was obtained using averaged firing rates from 1 s before the test onset to the test offset, to reflect the neuronal activity that is important to decision making in the DPA task.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Data and software availability</title><sec id="s4-15-1"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dt5h4m1">https://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dt5h4m1</ext-link>.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kartik Sreenivasan (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a thorough study in which the authors ask if sensory cortices play a key role in working memory. The authors approach the question using behavior, single-unit recordings, and optogenetic interventions. The reviewers and I agreed that the findings were potentially exciting if they could be interpreted clearly. However, there were some critical concerns that the authors must address, including some clarifying experiments:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors must show the effect size of their optogenetic manipulation, as without this one cannot evaluate the results. Reviewer 2 has a detailed account of the requirements for this analysis.</p><p>2) The authors must disentangle the effect of duration of stimulation vs. delay length. The reviewers ask that the authors carry out additional experiments in control and experimental protocols, using the DNMS task, in which they compare the effect of optogenetic stimulation of short 3s vs. long 12s duration, while keeping the delay the same.</p><p>3) The authors should address numerous points raised by the reviewers to better explain, clarify, and provide a rationale for their data. For example, they should address reviewer's concerns on whether the light is affecting other regions of the brain. This and numerous other points of clarification have been raised by the reviewers.</p><p>4) Please note that <italic>eLife</italic> uses Figure Supplements (supplements to specific figures) but not a separate supplemental section. When possible, please add supplemental material to the appropriate figures., as is commonly done in <italic>eLife</italic> papers</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is a thorough study in which the authors ask if sensory cortices play a key role in working memory. The authors utilize a variety of behavioral tasks to test olfactory working memory, intervene with optogenetics in the APC, and do single-unit recordings from the APC.</p><p>The behaviour is convincing and the technical details seem to be carefully handled. For example, the authors use PIDs to show clean removal of odor between stimuli. I appreciate the care taken to try out a range of WM tasks including a difficult one where there is an intervening distractor task during the delay period of a delayed paired association. There is a clear effect of the optogenetic stimulation in each case.</p><p>I have a concern about how well the ChR2 optical stimulus might have been localized. The authors use an optical fiber so most of the light will indeed be directed just below the fiber end, into the APC. Nevertheless, there may be significant scatter. In Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 we see that expression of VGAT-ChR2 is rather broad, and there are several regions which might be affected. With this in mind, I wonder if the authors may wish to revisit their statement in the Discussion that only one out of 5 potential regions were perturbed. I worry that the core conclusion, that the sensory cortex is primarily involved in the working memory, may be weakened if several regions are affected by light scatter. One way to address this might be to obtain recordings from other relevant regions in the olfactory pathway, though I do understand that this is a substantial effort. Another possibility might be <italic>c-Fos</italic> activity labelling.</p><p>The authors also perform single unit recordings and demonstrate sustained activity through the delay period in about 10% of neurons. While this seems reasonably clear, it would be nice to have a more complete analysis here. How many do this on single-trials? Is there more we might understand from a single-trial analysis? What might we infer from a closer comparison of 4-s vs. 8-s delay recordings?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This work addresses a critical limitation of so-called sensory recruitment model – namely that there is no causal evidence that sensory delay activity is involved in WM. This paper is timely, the experiments are thorough and address nearly all potential objections, and the results are clear. Overall, this is an excellent paper. However, there are a few concerns that the authors need to address that could potentially affect the interpretation of the results. Beyond that, the clarity in presentation of the results, particularly when it comes to the organization of the figures, is lacking and needs quite a bit of work.</p><p>1) The authors do not include any measures of effect size, indicate the main effects of the ANOVA, or provide sufficient information for non-significant ANOVAs. These all hinder the ability to evaluate the results. For example, the missing effect sizes don't allow for a proper comparison between the main analyses and the control analyses (e.g., Figure 1 vs. Figure 2). Additionally, it seems possible that the light on vs. off had an effect on control mice as well (albeit a smaller one). If this were true, it would require further discussion.</p><p>2) The authors need to address one possible alternate interpretation of their results. Could it be the case that APC perturbation disrupted the delay activity of downstream neurons (e.g., in PFC) that are critical for the memory? How are these results inconsistent with that view?</p><p>3) The authors' claim rests on the fact that light suppressed the activity of APC neurons in the VGAT-ChR2 mice. However, as shown in Figure 1F and Figure 1—figure supplement 4, there are a variety of responses to the light stimulus. In order to support their claims, the authors need to address this issue directly. For example, a statement clarifying that a wide majority of neurons demonstrated optogenetic suppression, or a simple analysis demonstrating that more neurons were suppressed that would be expected by chance would help advance the claim that the net effect of the manipulation was suppression.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In their manuscript, Active information maintenance in working memory by a sensory cortex, Zhang and colleagues propose to test whether activity in the sensory cortex (in particular the anterior piriform cortex, APC) is required in maintaining working memory (essential theory) by engaging mice in olfactory behaviors, and further using optogenetic manipulations and the monitoring neural correlates of these behaviors at the level of APC. The authors train head-fixed mice in several olfactory tasks: a delayed non-match to sample (DNMS) task, a (multi-sample) delayed paired association (DPA) task, and a dual version of the DPA task, where a distracting go-no-go (GNG) task is added in the delay period. They further perform controls aimed at determining whether optogenetic suppression of APC activity impairs sensory perception of olfactory stimuli and screen candidate GLMs to identify a good fit for the observed behavioral performance. In view of their optogenetic manipulations and APC electrophysiological recordings, the authors conclude that sensory cortex (APC) is critical in the active maintenance of olfactory working memory.</p><p>Understanding the contribution of sensory cortex in supporting working memory is important, and the authors have performed numerous experiments and analyses designed to get at this question from multiple angles. Yet, I have several major concerns with several experimental design caveats and the over-interpretation of the results presented here that in my opinion preclude the publication of this manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic> in the current form.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) The effect of optogenetic silencing of APC (3s) in the DNMS task is very mild, and increases in magnitude with increasing duration of stimulation and longer delay periods between the sample and test stimuli. To my mind, the fact that inhibition of APC activity for a relatively long duration (3s) results only in a minor effect on the DNMS performance is suggesting that APC activity is actually not a major player in mediating working memory in this task in well-trained mice. Furthermore, there are several confounds in the experimental design. To assess in an interpretable fashion the effects of their manipulations, the authors should maintain the same duration of the delay (e.g. 8s), and increase the duration of optogenetic stimulation (3,6,7s, etc.). Does this change the performance of the mice? Second, to disentangle the duration of optogenetic stimulation from the natural decay of working memory (Figure 1D), it would be important to keep the same duration of optogenetic stimulation (e.g. 3s) for different durations of delay periods (6, 8, 12s) and further perform the stimulation at different times in the delay period. Third, how do we know that the first odor is removed efficiently? Do mice really need to keep its identity in memory, or is it sufficient to compare its lingering presence at low concentrations (not-detectable using a PID) to the test stimulus? While this may represent a less likely scenario, the authors should at least comment on the possibility.</p><p>2) It appears that mice have to lick in a dedicated 'response' interval in the DNMS task, and only that interval is taken as an assessment of their performance. Throughout the manuscript, it is unclear what the policy is in the case of early licks during the delay period, or the second stimulus period. In the stimulated trials, do mice lick more often in the delay period during/post stimulation? How about during the presentation of the second stimulus? The authors state that the ability of the mice to lick during the response window is not impaired, but it is important to determine whether they start to lick more outside the response window to better understand the effects of optogenetic suppression of APC. Does the optogenetic stimulation merely result in an increase in licking? (Figure 1, rate of misses decreases and of false alarms increases)? No information is provided on this.</p><p>3) Sensory perception controls (Figure 2): How long is the optogenetic stimulation? It appears to be on the shorter end of the durations used in Figure 1. Is the behavioral performance any different if optogenetic stimulation is matched accordingly to the time intervals used in Figure 1 (6s or 10s as in Figure 1 I-N)?</p><p>4) Delayed paired association (DPA) is indeed better suited for testing working memory in principle, yet the relationship between suppression APC activity and behavioral performance is weak. In Figure 4, optogenetic silencing of APC proceeds for 12s. Yet, the impairment in the performance is small (change in rate of correct choices from an Avg. ~89% to Avg. ~82%), and further appears biased by an outlier (Figure 4B). How does the observed effect change when the outlier is removed? What is the effect of decreasing the duration of optogenetic stimulation from 12s to 3s, 6s or 10s as done in the previous implementation of the DNMS task (Figure 1)? The effect of optogenetic silencing of APC on behavioral performance is even weaker or not apparent in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, D – no change in lick efficiency, nor in sensitivity index (d'). Even in the dual task, with the GNG task embedded, the effect of optogenetic stimulation is very mild. After 9.5s of stimulation, performance in the DPA task changes from ~83% to ~78% (correct rate).</p><p>5) The neuronal correlates in APC are rather weak (Figures 5-7). There is apparent discrepancy between the behavioral performance and the neuro-correlates of activity in APC. For example, activity seems to decay steeply during the 8s delay period in terms of the fraction of neurons that are selective for the odor stimulus; Only 10% of neurons are classified as selective by the end of the 8s delay period. What is the fraction of selective neurons when the delay period is further increased (e.g. 20s)? Behavioral performance is ~80% when using the 8s delay period, and yet only a small fraction of the neurons recorded in the APC are stimulus selective (as a result the performance of the SVM classifier is substantially lower by the end of the 8s delay compared to sample stimulus).</p><p>6) Expression of the opsin does not appear to be limited to the APC, but one can observe fluorescence in several other brain areas from the slice data (Figure 1). This makes the interpretation of the results hard.</p><p>7) The learning curve for the DPA task appears to be very steep (4 days), quite similar to the GNG task. The DPA task is however rather complex, and the results reported here are unusual given experience of other labs in the field in training mice to wait for a long time (&gt;10s) between stimuli, and furthermore embedding a second task. Could the authors include additional details on the training protocol used, and provide additional videos showing mice successfully waiting 20s or 40s in between the sample and test stimuli w/o licking impulsively?</p><p>8) Throughout the manuscript, no mechanisms are proposed on how impairing APC activity for 3s or longer does not change substantially the performance of the mice. Is the model envisioned by the authors that information is stored in some other brain areas during this interval? What is the effect of the optogenetic manipulations on the activity patterns recorded in Figures 6-8?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Active information maintenance in working memory by a sensory cortex&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Given the analyses presented by the authors, there appears to be no significant drop in performance (Figure 2B,D) when the APC is suppressed for 3s (early, mid) or 6s (mid) during the 12s delay version of the task, or for 3s (early, mid), 6s (early, mid, late), 9s (early, mid) for the 20s delay version of the task.</p><p>2) In the fixed optogenetic suppression varied delays task, the effects of optogenetic suppression of APC are also quite variable and small: no significant change in performance for 12s and 20s conditions.</p><p>At this point, it is unclear to me whether suppression of activity in any other parts of the brain may also lead to similar size effects.

In the first set of experiments, the delay duration of the DNMS task was fixed at 12 or 20s but the laser onset and duration were systematically changed (Figure 2A, B-C for 12s, D-E for 20s delay duration). Specifically, optogenetic suppression in the APC neuronal activity was varied in both duration (3, 6, 10, or 12s) and temporal position (early, mid or late in the delay period) in a trial-by-trial fashion. The results demonstrated that optogenetic suppression of longer laser-on duration at later phase of delay period results in larger behavioral defects. In the second set of experiments, the optogenetic suppression was kept at 3 seconds in duration and at the late delay period and the delay duration was varied between 5s and 20s, in a trial-by-trial fashion (Figure 2F).

The authors use an optical fiber so most of the light will indeed be directed just below the fiber end, into the APC. Nevertheless, there may be significant scatter. In Figure 1E and Figure 1— figure supplement 2 we see that expression of VGAT-ChR2 is rather broad, and there are several regions which might be affected. With this in mind, I wonder if the authors may wish to revisit their statement in the Discussion that only one out of 5 potential regions were perturbed. I worry that the core conclusion, that the sensory cortex is primarily involved in the working memory, may be weakened if several regions are affected by light scatter. One way to address this might be to obtain recordings from other relevant regions in the olfactory pathway, though I do understand that this is a substantial effort. Another possibility might be c-Fos activity labelling.</p></disp-quote><p>To confirm the specificity of the optogenetic suppression in APC, we have performed the <italic>c-Fos</italic> activity labelling experiments following optogenetic suppression.

This paper is timely, the experiments are thorough and address nearly all potential objections, and the results are clear. Overall, this is an excellent paper. However, there are a few concerns that the authors need to address that could potentially affect the interpretation of the results. Beyond that, the clarity in presentation of the results, particularly when it comes to the organization of the figures, is lacking and needs quite a bit of work.</p><p>1) The authors do not include any measures of effect size, indicate the main effects of the ANOVA, or provide sufficient information for non-significant ANOVAs. These all hinder the ability to evaluate the results. For example, the missing effect sizes don't allow for a proper comparison between the main analyses and the control analyses (e.g., Figure 1 vs. Figure 2). Additionally, it seems possible that the light on vs. off had an effect on control mice as well (albeit a smaller one). If this were true, it would require further discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We now showed effect size for all optogenetic manipulation and complete statistics data, including main effects of the ANOVA, and information for non-significant ANOVA statistics.

Such effect can be controlled by the interaction statistics between genotype and laser on/off, which was commonly observed. In the newly added experiments (Figure 2), a blue light mask was applied to diminish the visual distraction. Statistics are included in the Figure 1J and discussion about this was included in the text (subsection “APC delay-period activity is critical in olfactory DNMS”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors need to address one possible alternate interpretation of their results. Could it be the case that APC perturbation disrupted the delay activity of downstream neurons (e.g., in PFC) that are critical for the memory? How are these results inconsistent with that view?</p></disp-quote><p>It is likely that the delay activity of other downstream brain regions of sensory regions may contribute to the maintenance of sensory information in a working memory task. The existence of these regions does not conflict with the current results that a sensory region plays important roles in WM maintenance, because this hypothetical downstream brain region critically depends on the APC delay activity to play its role. The exact mechanism underlying the distributed neural circuit underlying WM remains to be determined in the future. We do not believe that mPFC is important for well-trained mice, because our previous work has demonstrated that mPFC delay activity are not critical in the DNMS task once the mice were well-trained (Liu et al., 2014). We have added more discussion to this point (e.g., subsection “Distributed network Interaction”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors' claim rests on the fact that light suppressed the activity of APC neurons in the VGAT-ChR2 mice. However, as shown in Figure 1F and Figure 1—figure supplement 4, there are a variety of responses to the light stimulus. In order to support their claims, the authors need to address this issue directly. For example, a statement clarifying that a wide majority of neurons demonstrated optogenetic suppression, or a simple analysis demonstrating that more neurons were suppressed that would be expected by chance would help advance the claim that the net effect of the manipulation was suppression.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified that a wide majority of neurons (79%) demonstrated optogenetic suppression. This information is also updated in Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) The effect of optogenetic silencing of APC (3s) in the DNMS task is very mild, and increases in magnitude with increasing duration of stimulation and longer delay periods between the sample and test stimuli. To my mind, the fact that inhibition of APC activity for a relatively long duration (3s) results only in a minor effect on the DNMS performance is suggesting that APC activity is actually not a major player in mediating working memory in this task in well-trained mice. Furthermore, there are several confounds in the experimental design. To assess in an interpretable fashion the effects of their manipulations, the authors should maintain the same duration of the delay (e.g. 8s), and increase the duration of optogenetic stimulation (3,6,7s, etc.). Does this change the performance of the mice? Second, to disentangle the duration of optogenetic stimulation from the natural decay of working memory (Figure 1D), it would be important to keep the same duration of optogenetic stimulation (e.g. 3s) for different durations of delay periods (6, 8, 12s) and further perform the stimulation at different times in the delay period. Third, how do we know that the first odor is removed efficiently? Do mice really need to keep its identity in memory, or is it sufficient to compare its lingering presence at low concentrations (not-detectable using a PID) to the test stimulus? While this may represent a less likely scenario, the authors should at least comment on the possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>1) The 3s optogenetic silencing effect of APC is indeed smaller comparing to 6s and 1s optogenetic silencing effects. One possibility is due to the regionally specific optogenetic silencing (small area with reduction in <italic>c-Fos</italic> staining, Figure 1—figure supplement 2C). Because our optogenetic suppression is focal, APC areas not affected by laser might still maintain the information. Moreover, other studies have revealed dependence of optogenetic effect on delay duration. For example, Gorden lab’s study (Bolkan et al., 2017) showed that optogenetic silencing mPFC impaired spatial WM performance in task with 60 s but not 10 s delay duration.</p><p>2) We have performed the additional experiments as requested. In the first set of experiments, the delay duration of the DNMS task was fixed at 12 or 20s but the laser onset and duration were systematically changed (Figure 2A, B-C for 12s, d-e for 20s delay duration). Specifically, optogenetic suppression in the APC neuronal activity was varied in both duration (3, 6, 10, or 12s) and temporal position (early, mid or late in the delay period) in a trial-by-trial fashion.

We did not observe significant interaction between delay-period duration and laser on/off (Figure 2G, Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D, Figure 2—source data 1-2). The text has been updated accordingly.</p><p>3) As the reviewer pointed out, mice are not likely to use the low concentration residual odor to perform the task. We have previously showed the sensory threshold of mice in a working memory task in the experiments setup (Liu et al., 2014), which is higher than the residual concentration during most of the delay period. Furthermore, if the mice depend on residuals to perform the DNMS task, the dual-task performance would be much worse than the experiment data since any lingering residual would be flushed by the many-orders more concentrated olfactory cue for the inner task. We have included more discussion in the text (subsections “The design and performance of a delayed non-match to sample task” and “APC delay activity is critical for active maintenance against a distracting task”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It appears that mice have to lick in a dedicated 'response' interval in the DNMS task, and only that interval is taken as an assessment of their performance.

As show in the figures the optogenetic suppression did not merely result in a lick increase in response period, especially when the timing of optogenetic suppression was varied (Figure 1—figure supplement 6A and B). A small increase in lick rate was observed immediately after the laser offset in the fixed optogenetic suppression, likely due to the association between stimulation-offset and test-onset. The differences are small and transient, which was unlikely to affect the quantification of behavioral response during the response window. (Figure 1—figure supplement 6, C, D and E).

The task designs between two tasks are quite different, for example DPA task require the association between sample and test odors, which is not required for DNMS task.

We have added discussion in the text (subsection “Debate about the necessity of delay-period activity in sensory cortex for WM”).</p><p>We believe that the extra two experiments we already performed in Figure 2A-E already demonstrated the significant interaction between delay duration and laser-on duration.
