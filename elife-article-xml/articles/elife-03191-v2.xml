In this study, we show <italic>Drosophila</italic> ZIP13 (Slc39a13), a presumed zinc importer, fulfills the iron effluxing role. Interfering with dZIP13 expression causes iron-rescuable iron absorption defect, simultaneous iron increase in the cytosol and decrease in the secretory compartments, failure of ferritin iron loading, and abnormal collagen secretion. dZIP13 expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> confers upon the host iron-dependent growth and iron resistance. Importantly, time-coursed transport assays using an iron isotope indicated a potent iron exporting activity of dZIP13. The identification of dZIP13 as an iron transporter suggests that the spondylocheiro dysplastic form of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, in which hZIP13 is defective, is likely due to a failure of iron delivery to the secretory compartments.

Amongst its many important roles, iron is crucial for producing collagen—the protein that provides both strength and elasticity to bones, tendons, ligaments, and skin. Like many other proteins, collagens are produced inside the endoplasmic reticulum—an organelle inside the cell that is enclosed by a membrane that is similar to the plasma membrane that surrounds the cell itself.</p><p>Two enzymes that are critical for producing collagen need to bind with iron in order to work correctly. To do this, iron in the cytoplasm of the cell has to cross the membrane that surrounds the endoplasmic reticulum. Small molecules are commonly transported across membranes by proteins called transporters, which tend to work on specific types of ions or molecules. However, researchers did not know the identity of the membrane transporter responsible for moving iron into the secretory pathway—including the endoplasmic reticulum—to bind with the enzymes that produce collagen.</p><p>Xiao, Wan et al. have now investigated the function of the transporter ZIP13 in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This transporter was thought to transport zinc across membranes and into the cytoplasm. Instead, Xiao, Wan et al. found that ZIP13 transports iron out of the cytoplasm and into the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p>Ehlers–Danlos syndrome is a condition that causes individuals to suffer from frequent joint dislocations, bone deformities, and fragile skin as a result of their body producing collagen incorrectly. One form of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome is caused by ZIP13 transporters working incorrectly. However, this was difficult to understand when it was thought that ZIP13 only transports zinc. The discovery that ZIP13 mostly transports iron rather than zinc can explain the link between this transporter and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome: if ZIP13 doesn't work, the collagen-building enzymes cannot get the iron they need to work properly.</p><p>Disorders caused by iron deficiencies are normally identified by a few tell-tale symptoms, such as anemia, but these are not seen in Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. Xiao, Wan et al. suggest that iron transport problems could therefore be behind a wider range of diseases and disorders than is currently known.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03191.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03191.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Slc39a13</kwd><kwd>iron transporter</kwd><kwd>secretory compartment</kwd><kwd>Ehlers–Danlos syndrome</kwd><kwd>Drosophila</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Basic Research Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013CB910700, 2011CB910900</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Bing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31123004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Bing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Drosophila</italic> ZIP13 (Slc39a13), a presumed zinc importer, is responsible for iron delivery to the secretory pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Iron is critical to the function of a variety of proteins, including hemoglobin and myoglobin, various iron–sulfur proteins, and the electron transport chain. In addition, iron is a necessary component in the secretory pathway. For example, lysyl hydroxylase (LH, also referred to as PLOD) and collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylases (P4Hs) are two post-translational modifying enzymes localized to the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum, which use Fe<sup>2+</sup> as a cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tuderman et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pirskanen et al., 1996</xref>). These two enzymes are critical for the synthesis of collagen, a crucial part of the basement membrane, and are formed by a complicated process involving multiple co- or post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Myllyharju and Kivirikko, 2004</xref>). While the types of collagens and genes found in mammals are very complex, only one type of collagen IV, encoded by two genes <italic>Viking</italic> (<italic>Vkg</italic>) and <italic>Cg25C</italic>, is found in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and it constitutes a major structural component of basement membranes in the developing fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fessler and Fessler, 1989</xref>).</p><p>In adidition to lysyl hydroxylase and prolyl hydroxylase, ferritin is another iron-dependent protein residing in the secretory pathway of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In constrast to mammalian ferritin, which is predominantly found in the cytosol, <italic>Drosophila</italic> ferritin binds iron in the early secretory compartments and is then secreted into the circulation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mandilaras et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tang and Zhou, 2013a</xref>). This process is central for systemic iron supply as well as tissue iron detoxification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tang and Zhou, 2013b</xref>). Therefore, in comparison to mammals, it is expected that <italic>Drosophila</italic> will carry a larger amount of iron through this pathway and abnormalities in this process will lead to serious iron deficiency.</p><p>Despite considerate interest in iron homeostasis, the metabolic process of iron, particularly its intracellular trafficking, remains poorly characterized. One important question that remains unanswered is how cytoplasmic iron is transferred to the secretory pathway for the iron-dependent proteins found therein.</p><p>During the process of using the fruit fly as a model to decipher the functions of zinc transporter dZIP13, we unexpectedly discovered dZIP13 physiologically acts as an iron exporter. dZIP13 belongs to the metal transporter ZIP family (zinc-regulated and iron-regulated transporter proteins or Slc39a); members of this family was reported to generally promote zinc transport from the extracellular space or from intracellular vesicles to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liuzzi et al., 2006</xref>). Our work thus identified the iron transporter required for iron loading in the secretory pathway, which is also the first time a ZIP member has been reported as an iron exporter. This finding implies that failure of iron delivery to the secretory compartments is probably the underlying cause for SCD-EDS (the spondylocheiro dysplastic Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, OMIM #612350), which is due to a mutation in hZIP13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fukada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Giunta et al., 2008</xref>). Because SCD-EDS displays none of the classical iron phenotypes, for example, anemia or iron accumulation toxicity, our results also suggest that iron dyshomeostasis is likely involved in a wider spectrum of biological abnormalities than previously thought.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The putative <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue of human ZIP13 is involved in <italic>Drosophila</italic> dietary iron absorption</title><p>BLASTP searches using the amino acid sequences of mammalian ZIP family members revealed that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome encodes at least eight putative ZIP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lye et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qin et al., 2013</xref>). Among them, the protein encoded by <italic>CG7816</italic> shares the highest overall homology with human ZIP13 (45% identity and 58% similarity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and was named dZIP13 accordingly. In the phylogenetic tree, dZIP13 clusters together with hZIP13 and several other members including catsup (CG10449) and hZIP7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), all belonging to the LIV-1 subfamily of zinc transporters or LZT proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Taylor and Nicholson, 2003</xref>). Several typical features of ZIP family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jeong and Eide, 2013</xref>) are found in dZIP13, including eight transmembrane domains (TM), particularly amphipathic TM4 and TM5, and a predicted extracellular/luminal location of both the amino and carboxyl termini.

Amazingly, the eclosion defect resulting from dZIP13 knockdown could be rescued from ∼10% to ∼75% simply through dietary iron supplementation in the form of ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Addition of 0.1 mM iron-specific chelator bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid disodium (BPS), on the other hand, exacerbated the phenotype as an even lower eclosion rate was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating abnormal iron absorption indeed plays a critical role in causing the eclosion defect in <italic>dZIP13-RNAi</italic> flies. Zinc, a substrate of many ZIP proteins, also to some extent exacerbate the eclosion defect. When zinc was added to the diet, almost no adult flies could eclose (∼0% eclosion rate); however, addition of zinc chelator TPEN could ameliorate the phenotype slightly, although without statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). There have been several reports showing that iron absorption can be competitively inhibited by additional zinc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rossander-Hulten et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Whittaker, 1998</xref>). From that perspective it is possible that zinc addition to the food could exacerbate the iron deficiency phenotype of <italic>dZIP13-RNAi</italic> flies. Simultaneous addition of both zinc and iron could still rescue the eclosion defect very effectively (∼65% eclosion rate, statistically insignificant with iron only). The wild type flies' eclosion rate, in contrast, remained the same either in iron supplemented or deficient, zinc supplemented or deficient food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The dramatic rescue by iron instead of zinc suggests that lack of iron is the primary defect in <italic>dZIP13-RNAi</italic> flies, and the zinc effect is minimal and likely secondary. As a result of this unexpected finding, our original focus of dZIP13's function in zinc homeostasis was subsequently switched to investigating its role in iron homeostasis.</p><p>Consistent with the results obtained in the eclosion experiments, the lifespan of <italic>dZIP13-RNAi</italic> flies was also prolonged by iron addition in the food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>): the flies raised on iron supplemented food have a prolonged median lifespan (∼25 days) compared with files raised on normal food (∼4 days). Addition of zinc to the diet shortened their lifespan (median lifespan of ∼1 day). No significant differences of lifespans were found between normal food and BPS or TPEN food.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>dZIP13 knockdown results in iron deficiency of the whole body except the cytosol of the gut cells</title><p>The activity of aconitase is often used as a molecular indicator for the availability of iron in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Haile et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Suzuki et al., 2005</xref>).

In the gut, however, although the total iron was lower, iron in the cytosol appeared to not be reduced, suggesting that dZIP13 is involved in iron extrusion from the gut to the body. Because ferritin is the major iron storage protein and is located in the secretory pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we speculate that when dZIP13 is down-regulated in the gut, iron may not be able to move from the cytosol to the secretory compartments, resulting in iron elevation in the cytosol, a feedback control of iron uptake and an overall reduction of iron in both the gut and the rest of the body.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>dZIP13 is essential to ferric iron loading in the secretory pathway</title><p>Because dZIP13 affects iron absorption as shown above, and it is known that the dietary iron absorption is mediated by ferritin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tang and Zhou, 2013b</xref>), we next investigated the influence of dZIP13 on ferritin iron assimilation. Ferritin, a heteropolymer composed of H and L subunits, can accommodate thousands of iron atoms in its protein shell in the ferric form. Ferritin is thought to be the major cytosolic iron-storage protein in mammalian organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knovich et al., 2009</xref>), while in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, unlike mammals, ferritin sequences of both the H and L chains contain secretion signals, confining them to the secretory pathway and making them abundant in the hemolymph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nichol et al., 2002</xref>). A major function of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ferritin is absorption of dietary iron through iron loading and transporting via the secretory pathway supplying iron for the systemic use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tang and Zhou, 2013b</xref>). If dZIP13 is responsible for iron loading into the early secretory pathway, we expect it might affect ferritin iron assimilation.</p><p>To explore this possibility, we stained the intestines from dZIP13-modulated fly larvae for ferric iron, which is mainly loaded in ferritin. In the iron cell region (a cluster of cells in the middle midgut region where iron absorption occurs) of <italic>dZIP13-RNAi</italic> larvae, we were unable to detect obvious iron signal, whereas a distinct blue iron-staining signal could be observed in the normal fly larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement1</xref>), suggesting a lack of iron incorporation into ferritin after dZIP13 interference. Conversely, overexpression of dZIP13 led to a stronger staining in the iron cell region, and ectopically in the anterior midgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement1</xref>). This result is reminiscent of the observation that high iron levels, such as 5 mM FAC, can also induce ectopic ferric iron staining in the anterior midgut, suggesting an iron accumulation occurs in the secretory pathway of the gut cells when dZIP13 is overexpressed. Under high levels of dietary iron, iron was only faintly stained in the <italic>dZIP13-RNAi</italic> larvae, whereas staining was much stronger in dZIP13 overexpression larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This indicates that in the gut of <italic>dZIP13-RNAi</italic> larvae much less ferric ion is accumulated in ferritin. A native-PAGE staining for ferric iron further confirmed that the intestinal ferritin was indeed poorly loaded with iron in the <italic>dZIP13-RNAi</italic> larvae while the iron loading in the <italic>dZIP13-OE</italic> larvae was mildly elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement2</xref>).</p><p>To exclude the possibility that the poor iron loading observed in <italic>dZIP13-RNAi</italic> larvae was the result of poor ferritin expression, a protein trap line <italic>Fer1HCH</italic><sup><italic>G188</italic></sup>, which expresses an N-terminal GFP-tagged Fer1HCH, was used to indicate the ferritin expression pattern in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Missirlis et al., 2007</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Missirlis et al., 2007</xref>), in flies reared with standard food, GFP-tagged ferritin was most prominently expressed in the iron cell region. When dZIP13 expression was knocked down, expression of ferritin was ectopically and significantly induced in the anterior and posterior midguts, and was constitutively expressed in the iron cell region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement3</xref>). This expression pattern of ferritin was repeated when flies were administered a diet containing 5 mM ferric ammonium citrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Missirlis et al., 2007</xref>), indicating iron is in excess in certain parts of the gut cells when <italic>dZIP13</italic> is RNA interfered, consistent with the above studies in assessing cytosolic iron status of gut cells. Induction of ferritin expression in <italic>dZIP13-RNAi</italic> larvae was confirmed with a Western blot using a ferritin antibody against ferritin. A dramatic increase of ferritin level was seen in <italic>dZIP13-RNAi</italic> larvae, with a decrease observed in the <italic>dZIP13-OE</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement4</xref>).</p><p>An obvious genetic interaction of dZIP13 and ferritin was detected when dZIP13 was overexpressed in ferritin-RNAi flies.

One experiment to show a protein as an iron exporter is via a radioactive Fe transport assay. Ferroportin, a plasma membrane iron exporter, for example, has been successfully shown to mediate iron export in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, by using Fe isotopes and measuring intracellular and extracellular radioactivity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Donovan et al., 2000</xref>). However, as stated above, dZIP13 is located intracellularly and its expression would only directly alter redistribution of iron inside the cell rather than exporting iron out of the cell, as was seen with ferroportin in the oocyte. In order to show dZIP13 indeed acts as an iron exporter, we decided to measure iron effluxing activity of dZIP13 when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, taking advantage of the fact that the only membrane an <italic>E. coli</italic> cell has is its plasma membrane.

Proteins destined for secretion are at least transiently localized to the ER and could theoretically function during their temporary stay in this organelle. If ZIP13 had acted as a zinc importer as other ZIP members, we would expect the closely related hZIP7 might also exhibit effects similar to those seen with hZIP13 when expressed in the fly. However, despite similarity to hZIP13, expression of hZIP7 produced neither whole body aconitase activity change, nor rescued the defects of <italic>dZIP13-RNAi</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>). In fact, it appeared to have even slightly exacerbated the defects.</p><p>hZIP13 mutations cause SCD-EDS, a disease with defective collagen hydroxylation leading to a decrease of collagen cross-linking and secretion. We asked whether dZIP13 knockdown could also affect collagen formation in flies. Type IV collagen, the main constituent of basement membrane, is encoded by two collagen genes <italic>Viking</italic> (<italic>Vkg</italic>) and <italic>Cg25C,</italic> which are expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat bodies. dPlod is expressed in the collagen-producing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bunt et al., 2011</xref>), and participates in the assembly and secretion of collagen. We used Vkg-GFP, a GFP protein-trap that identifies the localization of the endogenous Viking protein as a marker of the type IV collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Morin et al., 2001</xref>). Ubiquitous knockdown of dZIP13 caused substantial retention of Vkg-GFP in the fat body cells, while iron supplementation rescued the Vkg-GFP retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Because iron is an important cofactor/co-substrate of lysyl hydroxylase, a critical enzyme in collagen synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Murad et al., 1985</xref>), the observation of iron reduction in ER/Golgi when dZIP13 is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) suggests that the normal functions of lysyl hydroxylase and prolyl hydroxylase might be compromised under iron shortage (see ‘Discussion’ for more).</p><p>Taken together, our results indicate dZIP13 is analogous to hZIP13, and is truly the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue of hZIP13. Their functions are fundamentally different from those of the other zinc importers including the closely related ZIP7.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We presented substantial evidence establishing that dZIP13 mediates iron export to the secretory pathway, identifying dZIP13 as the elusive iron transporter in the secretory pathway. Moreover, this is the first time to report that a member of the ZIP transporter family functions as an iron exporter. Previously, certain members of ZIPs, such as ZIP14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liuzzi et al., 2006</xref>) and ZIP8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), have been reported to be capable of transporting iron. However, they are only complex, broad-scope metal-ion importers and their in vivo involvement in iron homeostasis is yet to be established. Our in vivo studies clearly demonstrated that expressional alteration of dZIP13 mainly affects iron instead of zinc metabolism. Modulating dZIP13 expression in the gut cell resulted in opposite iron changes in the cytosol and secretory organelles, and radioisotope iron transport assay further showed that dZIP13 mediates iron exporting, providing compelling evidence in supporting dZIP13 as an iron efflux pump. Future biochemistry/biophysical work is needed to decipher the exact mechanistic detail of the transportation process and evidences thus obtained may further substantiate the conclusion of dZIP13 as an iron exporter.</p><p>The unanticipated finding of dZIP13 as an iron exporter was facilitated by the characteristic manner of dietary iron uptake in <italic>Drosophila</italic> gut, which is mediated by secreted ferritin and requires iron loading in the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tang and Zhou, 2013b</xref>). The subcellular distributions of ferritin are very different between mammals and insects. In mammals, ferritin is predominantly localized in the cytosol for storing cytosolic iron, and absorbed dietary iron is effluxed from enterocytes through ferroportin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vanoaica et al., 2010</xref>). However, in insects such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>, ferritin is mainly secreted, playing a central role in iron absorption by bringing iron out of enterocytes and into the hemolymph through the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tang and Zhou, 2013b</xref>). This feature of iron absorption demands higher levels of iron to be pumped into the secretory pathway for systemic use, and facilitated our characterization of dZIP13 as the iron pumper which fulfills this role.</p><p>In addition to the iron transport function, we also occasionally observed a minor zinc connection for dZIP13. It is possible that dZIP13 still retains some residual zinc-importing activity. However, in most cases, the zinc effect is physiologically marginal or insignificant. We would argue that the zinc dyshomeostasis is not the primary effect of dZIP13 function loss, because iron but not zinc levels were altered in the body of <italic>dZIP13-RNAi</italic> and <italic>dZIP13-OE larvae</italic>. In addition, iron but not zinc supplementation is able to rescue loss of dZIP13. Finally, no genetic interaction was observed between dZIP13 and other ZIPs in the ER/Golgi. These results argue against the idea that zinc dyshomeostasis is the primary defect in the loss of dZIP13 function, and that iron dyshomeostasis is secondary to a zinc defect. Our other characterizations of dZIP13, as reported in this work, are all consistent with this notion.</p><p>Considering the unusual nature of dZIP13 as an iron exporter while other members of the family (SLC39A) so far identified all appear to be importers, it is noteworthy that zinc efflux protein ZnT5 (SLC30A5) can mediate zinc transport in both directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Valentine et al., 2007</xref>). It would be interesting to know what sequences or structures endow dZIP13 with this unique property. At this stage we do not yet have clear answers to this question. Amino acid sequence comparisons of ZIP13 with other ZIP family members reveal some distinct differences. The most notabe difference is in transmembrane domain TM4. The TM4 amino acid sequence for all ZIP13s are DNFTHG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) whereas other closely related ZIPs are HNFTDG, i.e., the highly conserved region in TM4 has a D and H residue swap between ZIP13s and other ZIP members. Our preliminary evidences suggest this variation might be an important factor because when we switched this D and H dZIP13 was no longer functional. Additional experiments are clearly needed to further explore this promising lead.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03191.019</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Two conserved amino acids D and H in the fourth transmembrane domain of other ZIPs are switched in ZIP13.</title><p>Shown here are the fourth transmembrane domain and adjacent sequences of ZIP13 and several other ZIPs. 1–3 are ZIP13 sequences from different organisms. 4–6 are several other representative ZIPs.

Recently mutations in ZIP13, a member of the SLC39A/Zrt-Irt-like protein (ZIP) family, have been identified as the cause for the spondylocheiro dysplastic Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (SCD-EDS), a form of EDS sharing some similar clinical presentations with EDS VI, which is caused by mutations in PLOD1 gene encoding lysyl hydroxylase (LH1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fukada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Giunta et al., 2008</xref>). Because ZIP transporters were generally believed to import zinc into the cytosol from the extracellular milieu or organellar lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kambe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lichten and Cousins, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jeong and Eide, 2013</xref>), the pathogenesis of SCD-EDS was difficult to understand and various hypotheses were proposed to explain how the zinc importer could affect iron homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fukada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Giunta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jeong et al., 2012</xref>). The identification of dZIP13 as the iron exporter for the secretory compartments suggests a more direct interpretation of SCD-EDS: ZIP13 mutations impair iron transport to ER/Golgi, significantly attenuating the activities of iron-requiring enzymes such as lysyl hydroxylase, leading to defective collagen synthesis and accumulation in the secretory pathway.</p><p>Several issues are worthy of clarification here. SCD-EDS was identified to be defective in collagen crosslinking from actions of lysyl and prolyl hydroxylases. However, lysyl and prolyl hydroxylase activities from the cellular extracts of patient cells were reported to be normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Giunta et al., 2008</xref>). This is likely the result from the enzymatic assays, which were performed in the presence of iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Murad et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Giunta et al., 2008</xref>). It has been shown that externally supplied iron is needed to do these assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tuderman et al., 1977</xref>), suggesting iron is probably not tightly bound to these enzymes. However, the addition of iron would neutralize or mask the original iron-deficienct state of these enzymes in vivo (in the ER/Golgi of SCD-EDS patient cells), and therefore produce ‘normal’ in vitro enzymatic activities despite defective in vivo hydroxylation. These seemingly contradictory observations, therefore, are very consistent with our conclusion that ZIP13 is an iron exporter that supplies iron to ER/Golgi.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jeong et al. (2012)</xref> used mammalian cells to measure metal uptake activity of ZIP13. Because ZIP13 is normally an intracellular protein, the authors claimed that when overexpressed, some ZIP13 was mistargeted to the plasma membrane, making the uptake assay possible. In that experiment, zinc uptake was observed, but iron failed to compete with zinc in the importing assay. However, no exporting activity was examined in that experiment. As reported and discussed previously, sometimes we also observed slight changes in zinc levels, though we are not sure whether this was a result of direct dZIP13 transportation or due to secondary effects of iron dyshomeostasis. It is possible that dZIP13 may still retain some residual zinc importing activity. If this is the case, then the results from Jeong et al. would not be contradictory with our own findings.</p><p>While Jeong et al. proposed zinc deficiency in the ER/Golgi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Giunta et al. (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fukada et al. (2008)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bin et al. (2011)</xref> proposed zinc accumulation in the ER/Golgi underlies SCD-EDS. According to this theory, zinc accumulation in ER/Golgi can compete with iron and then affect collagen hydroxylation. Indeed, zinc has been reported as an inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tuderman et al., 1977</xref>). However in our hands, we saw only a marginal increase of zinc in the ER/Golgi when dZIP13 was knocked-down, but a much more dramatic change in the iron level. Because hZIP7, a zinc importer, cannot rescue dZIP13-RNAi, we think when dZIP13 is knocked-down the primary defect is not zinc accumulation. We suggest iron dyshomeostasis instead of a zinc defect is probably the primary cause contributing to SCD-EDS. Although we cannot exclude zinc's effect, it appears that it is not the primary reason, or at most a subsidiary factor.</p><p>Another issue worth pointing out is that none of the classical iron phenotypes are observed in SCD-EDS patients. Iron is involved in heme and Fe-S synthesis, and iron deficiency is typically observed as anemia. In SCD-EDS, it is possible that iron deficiency is localized to the secretory pathway and cytosolic and mitochondrial iron levels remain not much affected. Therefore, a ZIP13 mutation would result in a type of iron dyshomeostasis that would not present itself with the typical types of symptons (e.g., skin abnormality, bone malformation, and growth retardation) observed with classical iron deficiency. We still do not know what other proteins in the secretory pathway require iron. In addition to the common EDS-like features, SCD-EDS patients do present other phenotypes such as generalized skeletal dysplasia involving the spine and striking clinical abnormalities of the hands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Giunta et al., 2008</xref>). Are these additional characteristics also a result of collagen defects or due to abnormalities other than the collagen? This question remains unanswered. Nevertheless, our results add another level of complexity in the regulation of iron homeostasis and some of the consequences that arise from its disruption.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>Constructs used for transgenic flies include pUAST-dZIP13 and pUAST-Golgi-mRFP. pUAST-dZIP13 was generated by PCR amplification of the coding region of CG7816 from <italic>Drosophila</italic> cDNA and cloning into pUAST using the following primers: pUAST-dZIP13 F: 5′-GGAATTCAGCCGAAAATGACCACGAACAG-3′, pUAST-dZIP13 R: 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCCCTAGTGTTCGAATAGCATGGTCATC-3′; pUAST-Golgi-mRFP was generated by PCR amplification of monomeric RFP with rhomboid-1 (Rho1), a Golgi marker protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2006</xref>) and cloning into pUAST.

Zip13 is of particular interest because mutations in humans are associated with a sub type of Ehlers-Danlos, a connective tissue disorder. They present strong and convincing evidence that Zip13 is primarily involved in the transport of iron rather than zinc. This is not without precedent as the ZIP family of transporters has been found to include both iron and zinc transporters in several species. The authors also present evidence that ZIP13 localizes to intracellular vesicles and directs iron efflux from the cytosol to the secretory pathway.</p><p>The data regarding the role of Zip13 in iron rather than zinc transport is entirely convincing and highly significant. The significance is increased because of the relevance to human disease. The data regarding the role of Zip13 as an iron efflux transporter is less convincing. As this would be a very unusual property for a metal transporter – some family members functioning as importers with one functioning as an efflux pump – the strength of the evidence needed to support this conclusion may be beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>Several concerns are:</p><p>1) The use of the in-gel aconitase assay as a measure of cytosolic iron. The labile iron-sulfur cluster of cytosolic aconitase is indeed lost in iron-deficient cells, but conditions other than iron deficiency can also lead to cluster disassembly, ie oxidative stress, nitrosative stress, both of which could be occurring here. Furthermore, the in-gels assay is only semi-quantitative at best. Many of the phenotypes associated with the knockdown or overexpression of Zip13 could also be accounted for by loss or gain of cellular iron uptake.

The labile iron-sulfur cluster of cytosolic aconitase is indeed lost in iron-deficient cells, but conditions other than iron deficiency can also lead to cluster disassembly, ie oxidative stress, nitrosative stress, both of which could be occurring here. Furthermore, the in-gels assay is only semi-quantitative at best. Many of the phenotypes associated with the knockdown or overexpression of Zip13 could also be accounted for by loss or gain of cellular iron uptake. In fact, the reduced level of whole cell iron in the gut cells of knockdowns (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure.3C</italic></xref><italic>) supports a role in iron uptake rather than efflux</italic>.</p><p>Yes, aconitase activity can also be subjected to oxidative stress. To further corroborate our statement that Zip13 knockdown in the gut indeed led to cytosolic iron increase and Zip13 overexpression cytosolic iron decrease, we examined how genes involved in iron homeostasis would behave in these cases (i.e., do they behave as in iron-rich or iron-poor condition?). Ferritin and iron uptaker Malvolio (fly NRAMP homologue) were chosen. Under iron-replete conditions gut ferritin is induced in both the transcript and protein level, while Malvolio is repressed, and vice versa. We then analyzed ZIP13-RNAi and ZIP13-OE flies. ZIP13-RNAi saw a dramatic increase of ferritin and a depression of Malvolio, exactly coinciding with what has happened under iron replete situation (Newly added data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>, and corresponding text added in the Results). So physiologically speaking, when dZIP13 is knocked-down, gut cells “feel” an iron surplus state, and respond by dramatically increased ferritin expression and reduced expression of iron uptaker Malvolio. These are indirect lines of evidence, but constitute fairly strong indirect lines of evidence together with the aconitase assay in suggesting gut cytosolic iron is reduced when dZIP13 is overexpressed and increased when knockdown.</p><p>Contrary to the cytosolic state, that of the secretory compartment is opposite in these cases, i.e., in ZIP13-RNAi and ZIP13-OE flies, iron in the secretory compartments would be reduced and increased respectively. The reason that overall iron reduction is observed in dZIP13-RNAi gut is mostly likely that in fly, ferritin, to which most iron is bound, is in the secretory pathway (unlike mammalians most ferritin is in the cytosol). Indeed, ferric staining highly depends on the presence of ferritin. In other words, the lower total cellular iron in dZIP13-RNAi gut is likely because that gut cells are in a state of iron surplus in the cytosol and a feedback control of iron uptake is thus exerted leading to a reduction of total cellular iron level (cytosolic iron + secretory iron).</p><p>The similar expressional change patterns of Mvl and ferritin through dZIP13 RNAi or iron feeding argue against the suggestion that dZIP13 might be involved in iron uptake because if dZIP13 were an iron uptaker, dZIP13-RNAi gut cells would have responded as if lack of iron. Instead, they responded as if they were experiencing an iron overdose.</p><p><italic>2) The use of E. coli for expression studies. The lipid environment and mechanisms for inserting polytopic proteins into membranes are very different in prokaryotes vs. eukaryotes. Yeast would have been a much better choice for a model cell in this case. Nonetheless, the data support the authors’ conclusions</italic>.</p><p>Iron transport assay has normally to be performed with surface-resident protein, by measuring extracellular and intracellular radioactivities. For an intracellular membrane protein such as dZIP13 this would be hard to do technically, unless with purified organelle. In other words, expression in yeast would most likely result in intracellular residence of dZIP13, in which case direct iron transport assay with whole cells would be hard to do.</p><p>E. coli has no intracellular membrane. So as long as the protein is located to the membrane it will be in the plasma membrane and enable direct measurement of radioactive iron transport. We mentioned this rationale in the original text under the section “Radioisotope transporting experiments demonstrate dZIP13 as an iron exporter”.</p><p>We also purified fly ER/Golgi organelle and measured iron transport. The result showed that indeed dZIP13 mediates iron transport to ER/Golgi.</p><p><italic>3) The lack of an endosomal marker control in the co-localization studies. If Zip13 is really in ER/Golgi, then an endosomal marker would fail to co-localize</italic>.</p><p>We added two endosomal markers, an early endosomal marker FYVE (Bloomington #39695) and a later endosomal marker LAMP (Bloomington #42714). The results showed that dZIP13 does not co-localize well, if at all, with endosomal markers (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) The use of a GFP tagged protein without demonstrating that the tag is not cleaved from the Zip13 in cells. This is needed to confirm that the GFP signal corresponds to that of the rest of the Zip13. The diffuse background staining seen in some images suggests this could be a problem.</italic></p><p>Following this advice, Anti-GFP antibody was used to analyze protein extracts from Da&gt;EGFP (as a control) and Da&gt;dZIP13-EGFP 3rd larvae. The results imply that the EGFP tag is not cleaved from dZIP13 protein in vivo (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>), indicating the original signal seen should be largely from dZIP13-EGFP. The original diffuse background signal is likely due to the fact that the picture was not a cofocal image, and was taken under a Nikon ECLIPES 80i microscope.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Western blot of dZIP13-EGFP larval extract for EGFP to asses EGFP fusion protein stability. Anti-GFP antibody was used. The GFP lane is the extract from Da&gt;GFP flies (4ug). The control lane is normal fly sample (no EGFP expression) (80ug). Little free EGFP was detected in dZIP13-EGFP sample (80ug). An extra band below that of dZIP13-EGFP is likely a background signal because it is also detected in normal fly sample (control lane).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03191-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Because of the lesser quality of this picture, its partial redundancy with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref> (which respectively show a myc fusion and dZIP13 antibody staining), and likely misunderstanding arising from it, we decided to remove this particular picture from the current revision.</p><p><italic>However, in support of the authors’ conclusions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>offer good support of the authors' hypothesis that Zip13 is mediating efflux from an intracellular compartment</italic>.</p><p><italic>2) The data regarding the rescue of fly Zip13 knockdowns with human Zip13 are convincing</italic>.</p><p><italic>3) The use of the Viking-GFP trap is also highly suggestive that the flies have a defect in collagen production</italic>.</p><p><italic>In summary, the data suggesting Zip13 is involved in iron transport are strong and significant.

The main supporting evidence, among other evidence, follows:</p><p>A) direct evidence is presented to show that when dZIP13 expression is knocked-down, the ER/Golgi lacks iron, while strong indirect evidence is provided (additional evidence provided in this revision as described above) to show cytosol is replete with iron in this case, and vice versa.</p><p>B) radioisotope iron transport assays with E. coli and ER/Golgi indicate directly dZIP13 as iron efflux pump.</p><p>These would be considered very strong evidence for showing a protein as an iron effluxer. However, as also pointed out by the editor/reviewers, it is very unusual when other reported cases of the family members (ZIP or SLC39A) are all importers and this one turns out as an exporter. Having said this, it is also noteworthy that zinc efflux protein ZnT5 (SLC30A5) can mediate zinc transport in both directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Valentine et al., 2007</xref>). In the revision, we added these comments in the Discussion.</p><p>At the end of the first paragraph:</p><p>“Our studies clearly demonstrated that expressional alteration of dZIP13 mainly affects iron instead of zinc metabolism. Modulating dZIP13 expression in the gut cell resulted opposite iron change in the cytosol and secretory organelles, and radioisotope iron transport assay further showed that dZIP13 mediates iron exporting, providing compelling evidence in supporting dZIP13 as an iron efflux pump. Future biochemistry/biophysical work is needed to decipher the exact mechanistic detail of the transportation process and evidence thus obtained may further substantiate the conclusion of dZIP13 as an iron effluxing protein.”</p><p>And at the beginning of fourth paragraph:</p><p>“Considering the unusual nature of dZIP13 as an iron exporter while other members of the family (SLC39A) so far identified all appear to be importers, it is noteworthy that zinc efflux protein ZnT5 (SLC30A5) can mediates zinc transport in both directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Valentine et al., 2007</xref>).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
