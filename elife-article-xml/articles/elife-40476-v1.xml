The existing consensus is that NKB induces GnRH release via kisspeptin (<italic>Kiss1</italic>) stimulation in the arcuate nucleus. However, the stimulatory action of NKB is dependent on circulating estrogen (E<sub>2</sub>) levels, without which, NKB inhibits luteinizing hormone (LH) release. Importantly, the evidence supporting the kisspeptin-dependent role of NKB, derives from models of persistent hypogonadal state [e.g. <italic>Kiss1r</italic> knock-out (KO) mice], with reduced E<sub>2</sub> levels. Here, we demonstrate that in the presence of E<sub>2</sub>, NKB signaling induces LH release in a kisspeptin-independent manner through the activation of NK3R (NKB receptor) neurons in the posterodorsal medial amygdala (MePD). Importantly, we show that chemogenetic activation of MePD Kiss1 neurons induces LH release, however, the stimulatory action of NKB in this area is Kiss1 neuron-independent. These results document the existence of two independent neuronal circuitries within the MePD that regulate reproductive function in females.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

Nonetheless, it is well established that kisspeptin and neurokinin B (NKB) signaling systems are indispensable parts of this network. Loss-of-function mutations in the genes encoding for kisspeptin (<italic>Kiss1</italic>) or its receptor (<italic>Kiss1r</italic>) or NKB (encoded by the <italic>Tac2</italic> gene) and its receptor (NK3R, encoded by the <italic>Tacr3</italic> gene) in humans and mice, are linked to hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism and infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Seminara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Topaloglu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Kisspeptins, secreted from Kiss1 neurons in the arcuate (Kiss1<sup>ARC</sup>) and anteroventral periventricular/periventricular (Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup>) nuclei, have been directly linked to the release of gonadotropin releasing hormone [GnRH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fergani and Navarro, 2016</xref>) however, there is another population of Kiss1 neurons in the posterodorsal part of the medial amygdala (Kiss1<sup>MePD</sup>) whose contribution to GnRH/LH stimulation has not yet been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fergani and Navarro, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pineda et al., 2017</xref>). In addition to kisspeptin, Kiss1<sup>ARC</sup> neurons express neurokinin B and dynorphin and these neurons are sometimes referred to as KNDy neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fergani and Navarro, 2016</xref>). Functional studies in mice and other species suggest that the stimulatory effect of NKB/NK3R signaling lies up-stream of Kiss1/Kiss1r, which in turn, directly activates GnRH neurons and, hence, stimulates luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion into the peripheral circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">García-Galiano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grachev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Navarro et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, NKB signaling onto kisspeptin occurs via the auto-synaptic activation of NK3R residing on Kiss1<sup>ARC</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fergani and Navarro, 2016</xref>). The existence of this pathway is supported by the fact that the selective NK3R agonist, senktide, induces Fos expression in Kiss1<sup>ARC</sup> neurons in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Navarro et al., 2011a</xref>) and increases their electrical activity in hypothalamic slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Croft et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Navarro et al., 2011b</xref>). Subsequently, kisspeptin signaling was deemed an indispensable part of the reproductive role of NKB, as the stimulatory effect of senktide on LH secretion was shown to be absent in <italic>Kiss1r</italic> knock out (KO) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">García-Galiano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Navarro et al., 2015</xref>), prepubertal rats treated with a <italic>Kiss1r</italic> antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grachev et al., 2012</xref>) or agonadal juvenile monkeys with a desensitized <italic>Kiss1r</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ramaswamy et al., 2011</xref>). These studies clearly indicated the importance of NKB signaling onto Kiss1<sup>ARC</sup> neurons for GnRH/LH secretion.</p><p>Interestingly, the effect of NK3R activation via intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of senktide on LH release is highly dependent on the sex steroid milieu; senktide was inhibitory in the absence but stimulatory in the presence of sex steroids in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Navarro et al., 2015</xref>) and sheep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billings et al., 2010</xref>). This poses a predicament due to the fact that the aforementioned studies, rendering kisspeptin signaling indispensable for NKB stimulation of LH, have all been carried out in animal models characterized by a persistent hypogonadal state (i.e., in the absence of sex steroids). Furthermore, a subset of GnRH neurons has been shown to contain NK3R in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krajewski et al., 2005</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Navarro et al., 2015</xref>), and a kisspeptin-independent activation of GnRH neurons, by NK3R agonists, in the median eminence (ME) has been demonstrated in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaskins et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, additional NKB regulation of GnRH release at a different level, that is kisspeptin-independent action, in the presence of sex steroids, cannot be excluded.</p><p>The experimental studies described here aimed to assess whether senktide can stimulate LH release, in the presence of E<sub>2</sub>, in adult mice that lack a functional kisspeptin signaling system, and if so, investigate the potential mechanisms involved. We used mice in which Cre recombinase was targeted to the <italic>Kiss1</italic> locus and prevented Kiss1 protein synthesis; consequently, homozygous mice (<italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>cre/cre</sup>) are <italic>Kiss1</italic> KO and display severe hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Padilla et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings reveal a novel kisspeptin-independent pathway of GnRH/LH release, which is activated in the presence of E<sub>2</sub> and involves NKB/NK3R signaling within the MePD. Additionally, we demonstrate, for the first time, that the chemogenetic activation of Kiss1<sup>MePD</sup> neurons activates the gonadotropic axis and therefore, provide evidence for the existence of two independent neuronal circuitries originating from the MePD that regulate LH release in the female mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Central (ICV) administration of senktide stimulates LH release in female Kiss1 KO mice in the presence of sex steroids</title><p>To investigate potential kisspeptin-independent stimulation of LH after central activation of NΚ3R signaling with senktide, we compared hypogonadal <italic>Kiss1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Padilla et al., 2018</xref>) of both sexes to gonadectomized [GNX; orchidectomy (WT<sub>ORX</sub>) or ovariectomy (WT<sub>OVX</sub>)] adult WT male and female mice.

Specifically, we have identified two independent pathways within the MePD that can lead to the stimulation of GnRH/LH release. The first involves Kiss1<sup>MePD</sup> neurons, the activation of which, stimulates LH release into the peripheral circulation. Furthermore, this is achieved by the release of kisspeptin and not by any other signaling molecules produced within the Kiss1<sup>MePD</sup> neuron, since LH was increased only in animals with an intact kisspeptin signaling system. A second pathway, involving NKB/NK3R signaling, was also identified, when senktide (NK3R agonist) administration into the MePD induced LH release in <italic>Kiss1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Padilla et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, kisspeptin is not a required mediator between NK3R activation in the MePD and LH secretion. Interestingly, this pathway is female-specific and estrogen-dependent as responses were absent in males and hypogonadal females<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>From a mechanistic point of view, the most likely kisspeptin-independent pathway for LH stimulation by NKB would involve the direct regulation of GnRH release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krajewski et al., 2005</xref>). Despite there being an anatomical overlap of GnRH and NK3R protein, specifically in the ARC and POA (at the level of the MS), we observed no instances of colocalization between NK3R and GnRH cell bodies irrespective of the presence or absence of sex steroids. Furthermore, GnRH and NK3R cellular associations were minimal with scattered foci of close appositions in the ARC and the POA (at the level of the MS). This reveals certain anatomical differences to what has been previously demonstrated in the rat, where ~ 16% of GnRH cell bodies were found to contain NK3R protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krajewski et al., 2005</xref>). However, our results agree with reports of no NK3R expression in GnRH neurons of the ewe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amstalden et al., 2010</xref>) suggesting the existence of species differences. Overall, our data suggest that the kisspeptin-independent action of NKB cannot be attributed to direct stimulation of NK3R located on GnRH neurons.</p><p>Kiss1<sup>ARC</sup> (KNDy) neurons make close appositions with GnRH cell bodies and terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lehman et al., 2010</xref>) and may therefore stimulate GnRH neurons through intermediates other than kisspeptin. For example, it has been demonstrated with in vitro examination of coronal brain slices, that senktide induces GnRH release from the ME and this effect is, in part, present in <italic>Kiss1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaskins et al., 2013</xref>). We did not observe any NK3R immunoreactive fibers in the internal or external zone of the median eminence, indicating a potential lack of direct NKB (or senktide) regulation of the GnRH terminals in that area. Nonetheless, other signaling molecules such as glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nestor et al., 2016</xref>), galanin or γ-aminobutiric acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Skrapits et al., 2015</xref>) can potentially stimulate LH secretion and must also be considered. However, activation of the Kiss1<sup>ARC</sup> (KNDy) neuron stimulated LH release only in mice with an intact kisspeptin signaling system and was completely absent in <italic>Kiss1</italic> KO mice. This provides evidence that kisspeptin, but no other signaling molecule produced by Kiss1<sup>ARC</sup> (KNDy) neurons can stimulate LH release in vivo. It must be noted that recent evidence has demonstrated that CNO is reverse-metabolized to clozapine in the bloodstream and exerts clozapine-like behavioral effects, thus challenging the assertion that CNO is pharmacologically inert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Manvich et al., 2018</xref>). However, this does not appear to be the case in the current Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup> mouse model as <italic>Kiss1</italic> KO mice were injected with an identical protocol as heterozygous (Kiss1<sup>Cre/+</sup>) and yet showed no alteration in LH. Thus, we can conclude that non-specific clozapine effects are not an issue in this model.</p><p>The distribution of NK3R has been described in the human, rat, and ewe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mileusnic et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krajewski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amstalden et al., 2010</xref>) and here, we confirm a similar distribution in the mouse brain. Interestingly, in certain areas the immunoreactivity of NK3R-containing cell bodies was highly dependent on sex steroid levels. Specifically, estrogen downregulated NK3R expression in the ARC whereas the opposite was true for the MePD, with more NK3R containing cell bodies evident when animals were supplemented with E<sub>2</sub>. High sensitivity of NK3R expression to E<sub>2</sub>, has also been reported for the ARC with in situ hybridization studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Navarro et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, this regulation of NK3R expression is reminiscent of the regulation of <italic>Kiss1</italic> by E<sub>2</sub> in these areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Based on the aforementioned anatomical observations we proceeded with senktide administration into the ARC, POA (at the level of the MS) and MePD of E<sub>2</sub>-treated animals in order to locate the kisspeptin-independent, LH-stimulating population of NK3R-expressing neurons. Senktide administration into the ARC or POA (at the level of the MS) significantly stimulated LH secretion in WT females compared to <italic>Kiss1</italic> KO animals. Therefore, our data suggest that LH release, as a result of NKB/NK3R signaling in the POA or ARC, is predominantly achieved via initial kisspeptin release, involving Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> and/or Kiss1<sup>ARC</sup> neuron activation. Indeed, 10% of Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> and virtually all Kiss1<sup>ARC</sup> neurons contain NK3R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Navarro et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, both populations are interconnected, Kiss1<sup>ARC</sup> cells project to Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons and GnRH cell bodies and terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yip et al., 2015</xref>), which could also account for the increase in LH after administration of senktide into the POA. However, a slight increase in LH occurred in the absence of kisspeptin signaling (<italic>Kiss1</italic> KO mice). In the ARC and MS of the POA, we observed few instances were NK3R containing fibers were in close apposition to GnRH cell bodies and/or processes indicating a minimal, but potentially present, presynaptic action of NKB onto GnRH. It is possible that NKB (or senktide) signaling onto presynaptic NK3R, results in the enhanced secretion of other stimulatory neuropeptides, which in turn stimulate GnRH secretion and could account for the slight increase in LH observed in <italic>Kiss1</italic> KO mice, as documented in the rat striatum, in which tachykinins (including NKB) presynaptically stimulate the release of dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glowinski et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, senktide administration into the MePD of females supplemented with E<sub>2</sub> produced a similar robust increase in LH in animals with or without the presence of the <italic>Kiss1</italic> gene. Conversely, hypogonadal <italic>Kiss1</italic> KO females did not show any alteration in LH release, indicating that this kisspeptin-independent NKB/NK3R signaling mechanism in the MePD becomes activated only when E<sub>2</sub> is present. This notion is further supported by our finding that the number of NK3R cells increases with E<sub>2</sub>, and this upregulation is specific to the MePD. Furthermore, these NK3R expressing cells do not co-localize with NKB, but are surrounded by a plethora of NKB fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) the source of which remains to be determined. Likely candidates include NKB-expressing cells residing within the ARC or the neighboring NKB population in the central amygdala (CeA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) to date, implicated only in the modulation of fear memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andero et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the mechanism further, we determined whether MePD NK3R neuron activation is mediated directly or indirectly by Kiss1<sup>MePD</sup> neurons through the release of signaling molecules other than kisspeptin (since senktide stimulates LH release in <italic>Kiss1</italic> KO mice). Chemogenetic activation of the Kiss1<sup>MePD</sup> neuron provided evidence that the activation of <italic>Kiss1</italic> neurons in the MePD of the female mouse can stimulate LH but only through the release of kisspeptin. This, clearly demonstrates the influence of Kiss1<sup>MePD</sup> signalling on the gonadotropic axis. Furthermore, GnRH/LH stimulation via the Kiss1<sup>MePD</sup> neuron is most likely not part of the kisspeptin-independent NKB/NK3R signaling pathway but of a second LH stimulating mechanism originating from the MePD. To date, functional studies in rodents have shown that an injection of kisspeptin specifically in to the amygdala results in increased LH secretion, while blocking endogenous amygdala kisspeptin signalling with a kisspeptin antagonist decreases both LH secretion and LH pulsatility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Comninos et al., 2016</xref>) indicating that the kisspeptin released may act locally, within the MePD, as part of the LH stimulating pathway. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that NK3R neurons in the MePD also contain Kiss1r and are activated by both NKB and Kiss1.</p><p>The functional relevance of either the MePD kisspeptin-dependent or the kisspeptin-independent neuronal population that can induce LH release is unknown. A reasonable hypothesis is that Kiss1<sup>MePD</sup> and NK3R<sup>MePD</sup> neurons are part of the neuronal network linking pheromonal/social cues and gonadotropin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, estrogen receptors are expressed in the MePD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lymer et al., 2018</xref>) and the brain region is a central hub for processing sensory inputs such as olfactory signals and integrating these into behavioral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rajendren and Moss, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adekunbi et al., 2018</xref>) and neuroendocrine outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pineda et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, it is compelling to hypothesize that the kisspeptin-independent, NK3R-dependent pathway is employed for the generation and/or enhancement of the LH surge and/or female sexual behavior, for example lordosis, given that this mechanism was absent in male mice, and is exclusively activated in the presence of estrogen, similar to what is observed in the female AVPV/PeN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). In accordance, recent evidence demonstrated the enhancement of the LH surge in rats exposed to male-soiled bedding, which was accompanied by an increased Fos expression in Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons as well as various limbic structures, including the MePD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Watanabe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hellier et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have shown that the MePD is a previously unknown component of the gonadotropic axis. Initially, we observed that senktide administration into the lateral ventricle stimulates LH release into the peripheral circulation of female mice lacking kisspeptin (<italic>Kiss1</italic> KO), but only when they are supplemented with E<sub>2</sub>. Upon further investigation, we identified two mechanisms that can lead to GnRH/LH secretion in the female, involving Kiss1<sup>MePD</sup> or NK3R-expressing neurons located in the MePD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the gonadotropic axis is subject to regulation by signalling originating outside the hypothalamus and specifically the MePD, involved in the regulation of social behaviors including sexual behavior, anxiety, and olfaction.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40476.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the neuronal pathways known to stimulate GnRH/LH release in the female mouse.</title><p>The first pathway involves Kiss1 neurons located in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), which also express neurokinin B and dynorphin (thus, often referred to as KNDy neurons).

The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that all the issues have been addressed.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;NKB Signaling in the Medial Amygdala Stimulates Gonadotropin Release in a Kisspeptin-Independent Manner in Female Mice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Sebastien G Bouret (Reviewer #3). Two other reviewers remain anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has highlighted the concerns that require revision and/or responses, and we have included the separate reviews below for your consideration. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Fergani and colleagues describe results investigating the kisspeptin and neurokinin b systems in regulating LH secretion. They report that NKB increases LH secretion in a kisspeptin-independent manner. Moreover, they report a previously unrecognized role of kisspeptin neurons in the medial amygdala in regulating LH secretion in female mice. Collectively, the studies are well described, use multi-disciplanary approaches, and provide novel data. A few issues need to be addressed.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>As outlined below, the major concern is the relative lack of neuroanatomical information. This needs to be addressed to allow the reader to assess the data fully.</p><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>My biggest criticism of the manuscript is the way the data are presented which is somewhat confusing. This is critical for a journal with a wide readership. For example, a major finding appears to be identifying a role of the MeA kisspeptin neurons in regulating LH secretion. This appears to be almost an add on and is not highlighted in the Abstract. It is unclear to this reviewer how this fits with the kisspeptin-independent results with the NKB agonist.</p><p>Similarly, a summary figure of the proposed model would help clarify the new findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>NKB is generally thought to function with kisspeptin in the regulation of gonadotropin secretion. In this manuscript, the authors describe a series of anatomical and pharmacological experiments in mice that further characterize the role of the NKB/NK3R signaling in the regulation of LH secretion. Specifically, the authors examined whether the presence of estradiol or testosterone influence the effect of the NK3R agonist, senktide, on LH secretion in a previously characterized kisspeptin loss of function mouse model (Kiss1KO). In this work, they found that when estradiol is present, senktide increases LH secretion in Kiss1KO mice (i.e. in a kisspeptin independent manner). This effect was only observed in female mice indicating the effect is sex-specific. Additionally, the authors provide evidence suggesting that this kisspeptin-independent effect of senktide on LH secretion occurs in the medial amygdala. Overall, the findings from this work contribute to what is known about NKB signaling and LH regulation. The NKB system has always remained less well-characterized than the kisspeptin system, and up to this point it was generally believed that NKB only influenced GnRH and LH secretion by acting through kisspeptin. The data reported in this paper suggest that NKB can act independently of kisspeptin in the medial amygdala, which provides a strong rationale for new lines of research. While the results in the manuscript are generally worth reporting, there are both major and minor concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>Of particular concern is the inadequate documentation of experimental findings. The images provided in nearly all figures are poorly formatted and of low quality. This undermines confidence in the quantitative measures and the specificity of experimental interventions. All of the images ostensibly demonstrating cellular associations are not convincing. Equally troubling are images meant to illustrate successful DREADD expression and signaling in the medial amygdala (which part?), which do not provide strong support for the authors statements in the manuscript (Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Furthermore, key reagents should be clearly described and their validation detailed. For example, the effectiveness of the viral transductions used to express DREADDs should be examined beyond mere confirmation of expression of the mCherry reporter, perhaps by confirming neuronal activation using an independent signal (e.g. Fos). The figure legends are remarkably uninformative and need extensive revision. A glaring example is that neither the text in the Results section, nor the legend for Figure 2, clearly describes what the GFP labeling represents.</p><p>Minor issues:</p><p>1) If there is not a reference limit, the authors should cite the original manuscripts in the Introduction instead of Fergani and Navarro 2016.</p><p>2) In the Results section beginning in the fourth paragraph, the authors should briefly explain why they decided to investigate the distribution of NK3R.

While a great deal of research in the reproductive field has focused on Kisspeptin/NKB neurons in the hypothalamus, little is known about the extra-hypothalamic action of those neurons and their distinct contribution in reproductive function. This paper uses the full modern genetic armamentarium to elegantly identify novel neuronal pathways by which NKB controls gonadotropin secretion.</p><p>There is only one minor issue that should be addressed: the authors use CNO to chemoactivate kisspeptin neurons. While CNO is undoubtely a powerful activator of muscarinic DREADDs, its metabolic conversion of CNO to clozapine is a potential concern since clozapine can have its own biological/physiological effects. The authors should at least discuss this potential concern.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40476.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As outlined below, the major concern is the relative lack of neuroanatomical information.

This is critical for a journal with a wide readership. For example, a major finding appears to be identifying a role of the MeA kisspeptin neurons in regulating LH secretion.
