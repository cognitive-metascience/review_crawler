locations facilitates the activity of spatially restricted processes. We have analyzed subcellular transcriptomes of FMRP-null mouse neuronal cells to identify transcripts that depend on FMRP for efficient transport to neurites. We found that these transcripts contain an enrichment of G-quadruplex sequences in their 3′ UTRs, suggesting that FMRP recognizes them to promote RNA localization. We observed similar results in neurons derived from Fragile X Syndrome patients. We identified the RGG domain of FMRP as important for binding G-quadruplexes and the transport of G-quadruplex-containing transcripts. Finally, we found that the translation and localization targets of FMRP were distinct and that an FMRP mutant that is unable to bind ribosomes still promoted localization of G-quadruplex-containing messages. This suggests that these two regulatory modes of FMRP may be functionally separated. These results provide a framework for the elucidation of similar mechanisms governed by other RNA-binding proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Essentially all eukaryotic cells contain subcellular regions that are associated with specific functions. The identity and activity of these regions are in large part defined by the proteins contained within them. Cells require an efficient sorting process to get proteins required for function to their correct location. For many genes, this fundamental problem is solved by transporting the RNA molecule encoding the protein, rather than the protein itself, to the desired location. The transcript is then translated on-site to immediately produce a correctly localized protein.</p><p>RNA localization has been studied extensively in diverse systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ephrussi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Long, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moor et al., 2017</xref>). Thousands of transcripts are asymmetrically distributed within cells and therefore subject to localization regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cajigas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gumy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lécuyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Taliaferro et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Taylor et al., 2009</xref>). However, precise molecular mechanisms that govern how transcripts are transported have been worked out in detail for only a small subset of heavily studied localized RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertrand et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ephrussi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jambhekar and Derisi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kislauskis et al., 1994</xref>). In these RNAs, sequences that mark transcripts for transport, sometimes termed ‘zipcodes’, are often found in 3′ UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jambhekar and Derisi, 2007</xref>). Zipcode sequences are then bound by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that mediate RNA transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">St Johnston et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>). The zipcode/RBP pairs that are known were often identified through careful but laborious reporter experiments that involve systematic deletions or mutations that inactivate putative regulatory elements.</p><p>A large disparity persists, though, between the number of RNAs that are targets of localization regulation and the number of known localization regulatory elements within those RNAs. High-throughput experiments that probe the localization of thousands of transcripts at once may be able to help bridge this gap. By providing many examples of transcripts whose localization is regulated by a given RBP, commonalities among those transcripts can shed light on general rules that define sequence features that regulate RNA localization as well as the RBP that binds them.</p><p>FMRP is an RBP that is highly expressed in the brain and has long been known to be the protein behind Fragile X syndrome (FXS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Santoro et al., 2012</xref>). Loss of expression of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene in humans is associated with intellectual disabilities and occurs in approximately 1 in 5000 males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coffee et al., 2009</xref>). FMRP-null mice display similar phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kazdoba et al., 2014</xref>). FMRP has been shown to regulate RNA metabolism at the level of translational repression and RNA localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dictenberg et al., 2008</xref>). The relative contribution of these activities to observed phenotypes is generally unclear. Although genome-wide studies probing the translation repression activity of FMRP have been performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>), much less is known about the RNAs that depend on FMRP for efficient localization to neuronal projections. FMRP has been implicated in the transport of a handful of RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dictenberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Muddashetty et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zalfa et al., 2007</xref>), but there is no general understanding of the identity of transcripts whose localization is regulated by FMRP.</p><p>How FMRP recognizes and binds its functional targets is also not well understood. Several studies have reported transcript and RNA motif targets for FMRP in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ascano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darnell et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darnell et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vasilyev et al., 2015</xref>), yet considerable disagreement among these studies remains about the identity of RNA sequences that interact with FMRP with high-affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>). RNA G-quadruplex sequences have been repeatedly identified as binding targets of FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blice-Baum and Mihailescu, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darnell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schaeffer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), and studies that have looked at commonalities between published datasets have found enrichments for WGGA sequences consistent with G-quadruplex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suhl et al., 2014</xref>). However, other studies have found that FMRP binds completely different short RNA motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ray et al., 2013</xref>) while still others seem to show that FMRP displays almost no sequence specificity at all and instead binds all along the coding sequence of its target transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>). Whether or not these potentially different modes of binding are related to the different functions of FMRP is again unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of transcripts that depend upon FMRP for efficient neuronal transport</title><p>We and others have previously used subcellular fractionation followed by high-throughput sequencing to quantify transcripts in the soma and neurites of neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Taliaferro et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zappulo et al., 2017</xref>). In these experiments, neuronal cells are plated on porous membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Using CRISPR/Cas9, we created an FMRP-null CAD mouse neuronal cell line. CAD cells are derived from a mouse brain tumor and can be induced by serum starvation to display features of neuronal differentiation, including cell cycle downregulation, expression of neuronal markers, and the appearance of neuronal morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Qi et al., 1997</xref>). The CAD FMRP knockout line was found to have a single basepair deletion in all alleles of <italic>Fmr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) that caused a frameshift and a premature termination codon two codons downstream of the gRNA cut site. The premature termination codon was upstream of all identified RNA-binding domains in FMRP. The knockout cells displayed no detectable FMRP expression by immunoblotting, even when probed with a polyclonal FMRP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>We then fractionated wildtype and FMRP knockout CAD cells into soma and neurite fractions in triplicate. To monitor the efficiency of the fractionation, we assayed the expression of beta-actin, which should be present in all fractions, and histone H3, which, being nuclear, should be restricted to the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). RNA was isolated from each fractionation and profiled by high-throughput sequencing.</p><p>The expression of <italic>Fmr1</italic> RNA was downregulated in FMRP knockout samples, as would be expected since the Cas9-induced lesion likely made the RNA a target of nonsense-mediated decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Principal component analysis of gene expression values showed that replicates clustered together and samples were separated along the first two principal components by compartment and genotype, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). To quantify RNA localization, we defined a metric termed localization ratio (LR) as the log2 of a gene’s abundance in the neurite fraction divided by its abundance in the soma fraction. Positive LR values are therefore associated with neurite localization, and higher LR values are associated with stronger neurite localization.</p><p>Previous literature has demonstrated that transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins and components of the electron transport chain are strongly enriched in neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gumy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moccia et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Taliaferro et al., 2016a</xref>). We therefore sought to assay the efficiency of our fractionation and RNA isolation by looking at the LR values of these genes. Reassuringly, we found that, in all samples, mRNAs encoding these proteins were strongly neurite-enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>To further monitor the quality of our fractionations and RNA samples, we compared data produced by these fractionations to data produced by similar neuronal subcellular transcriptomic experiments that had been previously published. In total, we calculated LR values for all expressed genes from 65 samples spanning two species, four laboratories, and nine neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farris et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Minis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Taliaferro et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zappulo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hudish et al., 2020</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). We found that our LR values correlated well with LR values from other studies (R ~ 0.6 to 0.8) and that all 65 samples were significantly more similar to each other than would be expected by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>), giving us confidence that our subcellular sequencing data was comparable with previously published datasets. Furthermore, we found that transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>) and components of the electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>) were neurite-enriched in a large majority of samples, confirming their status as markers of neurite RNA.</p><p>To identify genes whose transcripts depend on FMRP for efficient transport to neurites, we compared the LR values of genes between the wildtype and knockout samples using the R package Xtail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>). Xtail is designed to analyze ribosome profiling data to identify genes whose translational efficiency changes across conditions. However, since both translational efficiency and LR are ratios of gene expression values, we reasoned that Xtail would be a good tool to identify genes whose LR value changes across samples. Using Xtail and a false discovery rate cutoff of 0.01, we identified 86 genes whose transcripts displayed impaired neurite localization, and thus decreased LR values, in the FMR1 knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">Figure 1—figure supplement 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). We defined these genes as FMRP localization targets.</p><p>Gene ontology analysis of these targets revealed that they were enriched for genes that regulate vesicle transport in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplement 11</xref>). In particular, mRNAs encoding several kinesins were less localized in the FMRP knockout. Interestingly, mRNAs encoding kinesins have been recently identified as both bound and transported by FMRP in glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pilaz et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Because LR is a ratio of neurite to soma gene expression values, in principle, a decrease in LR could be due to either a decrease in neurite expression or an increase in soma expression. To investigate this further, we compared the expression of the mislocalized genes in the soma and neurite compartments separately. We found that while the expression of FMRP localization targets did not change in the soma between the wildtype and FMRP knockout samples, their expression in the neurites of FMRP knockout cells was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Because the soma contains the vast majority of cellular RNA, this indicates that the overall expression and processing of the localization targets is not impaired yet their ability to be trafficked to neurites is reduced. These findings suggest that these genes are in fact misregulated at the level of RNA localization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>FMRP localization targets have significant enrichments of G-quadruplex sequences in their 3′ UTRs</title><p>After identifying functional RNA localization targets of FMRP, we then looked for commonalities among them that can give insight into how FMRP recognizes and binds them.

For each CLIP-seq dataset, we found that our FMRP localization targets were enriched for FMRP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>) and that FMRP-bound RNAs were significantly more likely to be mislocalized in FMRP knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">6</xref>). From these analyses, we conclude that FMRP is likely directly regulating the localization of these functional RNA localization targets.</p><p>We then reasoned that sequences that were enriched in FMRP localization targets relative to nontargets could represent preferred binding sites for FMRP. Because the majority of RNA sequence elements that regulate localization identified to date reside in 3′ UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jambhekar and Derisi, 2007</xref>), we compared the abundance of all 6mers in the 3′ UTRs of FMRP localization targets and nontargets. We observed a strong enrichment for the RNA sequence ‘GGA’ in the 3′ UTR of FMRP localization targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). GGA had previously been identified from an FMRP CLIP-seq dataset as a preferred FMRP binding motif, giving us further confidence that our identified localization targets were directly bound and regulated by FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ascano et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Tandem repeats of GGA sequences are known to have the ability to fold into G-quadruplex sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suhl et al., 2014</xref>). G-quadruplexes are four-stranded nucleic acid structures in which guanosine residues interact with each other across the strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rhodes and Lipps, 2015</xref>). Given that G-quadruplex structures have been shown to be specifically bound by FMRP in vitro, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Didiot et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vasilyev et al., 2015</xref>), we then asked if G-quadruplex sequences were enriched in FMRP localization target sequences. To do so, we employed two computational methods to predict G-quadruplex sequences from RNA sequences. Using a regular expression we searched for four repeated WGGA sequences separated by 0–7 nucleotide linkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huppert and Balasubramanian, 2007</xref>) where W represents either adenosine or uracil. We also used the RNA secondary structure prediction software RNAfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lorenz et al., 2011</xref>). Both methods agreed that the 3′ UTRs of FMRP localization targets contained significantly more G-quadruplex sequences than nontargets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>).</p><p>We then complemented these computational predictions of G-quadruplex sequences with previously published experimentally defined G-quadruplex sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guo and Bartel, 2016</xref>). These were identified by quantifying reverse transcriptase stop sites in the presence of either potassium or lithium. Because potassium stabilizes G-quadruplexes and lithium destabilizes them, stop sites that display differential abundance between the two conditions are likely due to G-quadruplexes. These experimentally defined G-quadruplexes displayed many expected properties, including a large enrichment for guanosine nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>), highly stable predicted secondary structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>), and a strong enrichment for predicted G-quadruplexes using both the regular expression and RNAfold methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplements 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s10">10</xref>). The agreement between the computational and experimental approaches to G-quadruplex identification gave us confidence in the ability of both techniques. As with the computational predictions, we observed a significant enrichment of experimentally defined G-quadruplexes in the 3′ UTRs of FMRP localization targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>We then asked what other transcript features were associated with FMRP localization targets. We observed that FMRP localization targets had much longer open reading frames and 3′ UTRs than expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), consistent with previous reports that 3′ UTR extensions and alternative 3′ UTRs can regulate RNA localization in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Taliaferro et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tushev et al., 2018</xref>). We observed no relationship between the overall abundance of a transcript and whether or not it was an FMRP localization target. The enrichment of G-quadruplexes in FMRP localization targets was restricted to their 3′ UTRs as we did not observe a significant relationship between CDS or 5′ UTR G-quadruplex density and localization regulation by FMRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>G-quadruplexes are not positionally conserved but tend to be present in orthologous genes</title><p>The enrichment of G-quadruplex sequences in FMRP localization targets and the enrichment of those targets in FMRP CLIP-seq datasets suggested that the G-quadruplex sequences may be functional.

Surprisingly, we found that guanosines in quadruplexes were less conserved than those not in quadruplexes, and those in FMRP localization targets were less conserved than those in nontargets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

Strikingly, the human orthologs of the mouse FMRP localization targets were significantly less neurite-localized in FXS neurons than in unaffected neurons, indicating that the functional localization targets of FMRP were broadly conserved across species (mouse and human) and experimental systems (neuronal cell line and iPS-derived neurons) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Overall, we observed a modest (R = 0.21) but highly significant (p=1e-37) correlation between the mislocalization of genes in the CAD knockout system and the mislocalization of their human orthologs in the FXS iPS system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>).</p><p>We then defined genes whose localization differed between the FXS and unaffected samples.

It could be that the ΔRGG truncation was unable to bind the transcript in cells, or, alternatively, it could be that the ΔRGG truncation was unable to be transported to neurites. To distinguish between these possibilities, we tested the abilities of the ΔRGG truncation and the full length protein to bind the reporter transcripts in cells using CLIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yoon and Gorospe, 2016</xref>) and assayed their ability to be transported to neurites using immunofluorescence.</p><p>To assay RNA binding ability, cells coexpressed one of the Firefly luciferase reporters, either containing or lacking a G-quadruplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), and Renilla luciferase from a bidirectional promoter.

By comparing the amounts of Firefly and Renilla luciferase transcripts in the input and immunoprecipitated samples using qPCR, relative levels of FMRP/Firefly RNA interaction in cells were determined.

When we repeated the experiment using the Firefly reporter lacking the G-quadruplex, both full length FMRP and the ΔRGG truncation showed reduced, but importantly, equal, ability to bind the transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These results are consistent with the in vitro results of the RBNS assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>To address the ability of the ΔRGG truncation to be transported to neurites, we assayed the subcellular location of full length FMRP and the ΔRGG truncation using immunofluorescence.

This suggests that, transcriptome-wide, the RGG domain of FMRP is important for the neurite-localization of RNA molecules that contain G-quadruplex sequences.

To address this question, we identified FMRP translational regulatory targets by performing ribosomal profiling on wildtype and FMRP null CAD cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>). We observed that our ribosome protected fragments displayed strong enrichments for coding regions as well as a strong three nucleotide periodicity, indicating that the ribosome profiling data was of high quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">4</xref>).</p><p>We used the software package Xtail to identify transcripts that displayed significantly different ribosome occupancies in wildtype and FMRP null CAD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary File 1f</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>). Previous studies had reported that FMRP predominantly negatively regulates translation by inducing ribosome stalls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>). Since stalls may result in ribosome pileups and increased ribosome densities, we reasoned that FMRP translation targets should have a lower ribosome occupancy in FMRP null cells, even though their rate of translation and protein output is increased in the absence of FMRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This is an important consideration, especially when investigating a protein that is believed to induce ribosome stalling. Cycloheximide-based ribosome profiling data informs on the locations of all ribosomes, not just translating ribosomes, and this is why we prefer the term ‘ribosome occupancy’ to ‘translational efficiency’ when referring to this data. We found genes that displayed reduced ribosome occupancy in FMRP null cells compared to wildtype cells were significantly more likely to have been identified as FMRP CLIP targets than expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ascano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maurin et al., 2018</xref>), consistent with FMRP either generally acting to inhibit translation by inducing ribosome stalling or with FMRP generally acting as a translational activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Greenblatt and Spradling, 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The translational regulation targets of FMRP are distinct from its RNA localization targets and have no relationship to G-quadruplex sequence density.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of how the removal of FMRP, which is known to cause ribosome stalls, may affect overall ribosome density on a transcript.

However, when we looked at the transcripts that were statistically significantly affected in the two conditions, we found no significant overlap between the translational regulatory targets and the RNA localization targets of FMRP, suggesting that the protein exerts these activities on largely distinct pools of transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). While the localization targets of FMRP were enriched for genes that regulate transport in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>), the translational regulatory targets were enriched for genes that regulate RNA metabolism and for those that regulate synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">Figure 7—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>We also found no relationship between the 3′ UTR G-quadruplex content of a transcript and whether or not it was translationally regulated by FMRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Identifying transcript features associated with translational regulation by FMRP proved difficult as the transcript features most strongly associated with FMRP translation targets were the GC content and length of the transcript’s CDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s7">Figure 7—figure supplements 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s8">8</xref>). Translational regulatory targets of FMRP were strongly enriched for having GC-poor, long CDS sequences. These effects are difficult to disentangle, however, as transcript GC content and length are correlated with each other in multiple species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marín et al., 2003</xref>) as well as with a variety of other metrics, including conservation, expression, and RNA secondary structure.</p><p>Given that the target pools of the translation and RNA localization activities of FMRP appear to be distinct, we wondered whether these two activities could be functionally separated. To address this, we assayed the ability of a point mutant of FMRP, I304N, to promote localization of G-quadruplex-containing transcripts. The I304N mutation is in one of the KH domains of FMRP and renders the protein unable to interact with polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feng et al., 1997</xref>) and unable to repress translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laggerbauer et al., 2001</xref>). As with the ΔRGG truncation, we created CAD cells that express the I304N mutant by rescuing FMRP-null cells through site-specific integration of an I304N cDNA using Cre-lox recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khandelia et al., 2011</xref>). We fractionated these cells into soma and neurite fractions, and then sequenced RNA collected from both fractions. Quality control metrics for the fractionation indicated that it was of high quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplements 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">9</xref>). We then compared RNA localization, transcriptome-wide, between FMRP-null cells rescued with GFP and cells rescued with I304N.</p><p>We found that transcripts that were more efficiently localized in the I304N sample contained significantly more G-quadruplexes than expected, indicating that the I304N mutant retains the ability to promote the localization of G-quadruplex-containing transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1g</xref>). In support of this result, we found that wildtype FMRP and the I304N mutant were transported to neurites with approximately equal efficiencies, as had been previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s9">Figure 7—figure supplement 9</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schrier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>When we compared localization data from cells expressing full length, wildtype FMRP to those expressing the I304N mutant, we found that the mutant was deficient in promoting the localization of G-quadruplex-containing messages compared to the wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s10">Figure 7—figure supplement 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1h</xref>). However, the I304N mutant is approximately four fold more lowly expressed than the wildtype in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s11">Figure 7—figure supplement 11</xref>). This decreased expression of the I304N mutant is consistent with previous reports of reduced I304N expression in I304N mouse mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zang et al., 2009</xref>). Given that in our system the wildtype and I304N mutant proteins are integrated and expressed from the same locus using the same promoter, we propose that this decrease in I304N protein expression is due to decreased protein stability.</p><p>From these results, we conclude that an FMRP mutant that is unable to regulate translation is still able to regulate the localization of G-quadruplex-containing transcripts. We propose a model in which the recognition of a G-quadruplex sequence within the 3′ UTR of a transcript by the RGG domain of FMRP is associated with localization of the transcript. Conversely, the recognition of some as-yet unidentified transcript feature by one or both of the KH domains of FMRP may be associated with translational regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). This transcript feature, if it exists, has been difficult to identify as both bioinformatic sequence analysis of the translational regulation targets of FMRP and the RNA sequences specifically bound by the KH domains of FMRP in the RBNS experiment yielded no strongly enriched motifs.</p><p>This model is supported by three observations. First, although some studies have found that the RGG domain of FMRP is required for efficient interaction of the protein with polyribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blackwell et al., 2010</xref>), other studies have found that the RGG domain of FMRP is at least partially dispensable for this interaction while the KH domains are absolutely required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Darnell et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mazroui et al., 2003</xref>). Second, the I304N mutation, which is in one of the KH domains, abolishes polyribosome association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feng et al., 1997</xref>) and translation repression activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laggerbauer et al., 2001</xref>), but not localization activity. Third, G-quadruplex sequences are unable to compete with polysomes for binding to FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darnell et al., 2005a</xref>). Taken together, these findings support the idea that the dual functionalities of FMRP are driven by distinct binding capabilities of its different RNA binding domains.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Hundreds to thousands of transcripts are asymmetrically distributed within cells, yet the mechanisms that regulate trafficking are known for only a handful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cajigas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gumy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lécuyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Taylor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). In this study we have used genome engineering, subcellular fractionation, and high-throughput sequencing to identify transcripts that depend on FMRP for transport in neuronal cells. These FMRP localization targets displayed a large enrichment for G-quadruplex sequences, particular in their 3′ UTRs, suggesting that FMRP specifically recognizes these sequences to target them for transport. G-quadruplex sequences were not enriched in the translational regulatory targets of FMRP as identified by ribosome profiling. In fact, no recognizable sequence motif was strongly enriched in the translational regulatory targets beyond a negative correlation with GC content. These apparent dual modes of target recognition and the lack of clear specificity in the translational regulatory targets may explain some of the previously reported conflicting results in regards to the preferred RNA binding sites of FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our results raise the question as to how an RNA that is targeted to neurites through the action of FMRP is not subject to translational regulation by FMRP. Although we did not test these hypotheses here, we propose these potential mechanisms. We found that binding events that lead to RNA transport frequently occur in the 3′ UTR, while other studies have found that binding events associated with translation regulation occur in the open reading frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>). Perhaps where FMRP contacts the RNA plays a role in the regulatory effects it can exert. Alternatively, the two activities of the protein could be differentially regulated spatially or in response to stimulus.</p><p>FMRP has long been known to bind to G-quadruplex sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darnell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suhl et al., 2014</xref>), and G-quadruplex sequences have been shown to be sufficient for transport to neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Subramanian et al., 2011</xref>). In this work, we formally and directly combine those facts to functionally relate the ability of FMRP to bind G-quadruplexes with its ability to transport RNA molecules. It is important to note that we cannot formally prove that the G-quadruplex sequences enriched in FMRP localization targets are actually folded in cells. Recent reports have demonstrated that the majority of RNA sequences that have the ability to fold into G-quadruplex structures in vitro may be generally unfolded in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guo and Bartel, 2016</xref>). Still, previous reports and our data demonstrate that the G-quadruplexes must be folded in order to be efficiently bound by FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Subramanian et al., 2011</xref>), and G-quadruplex sequences have been reported to be under purifying selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>No clear links have yet been found between the mislocalization of a specific transcript or transcripts in FXS neurons and FXS phenotypes. The relative contribution of the RNA localization and translational regulation activities of FMRP to FXS phenotypes similarly remain unclear. However, the fact that the I304N mutant, which is unable to inhibit translation but still able to regulate RNA localization, is associated with FXS phenotypes clearly points to the translational regulatory activity of FMRP being important. Further work is needed to more fully understand mechanistic links between RNA localization and neurological diseases including FXS.</p><p>For the vast majority of localized transcripts, in neurons and elsewhere, the RBP/RNA interactions that mediate transport are completely unknown. Classically, experiments designed to address these questions have focused on one transcript at a time and take the approach of systematic deletions and/or mutations to identify minimal sequence elements that regulate localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferrandon et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jambor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim-Ha et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kislauskis et al., 1994</xref>). While these experiments have been successful and provided key insights for the field, they are quite labor-intensive, and it is difficult to derive general rules that govern RNA localization from isolated, single-transcript examples. RBP-perturbation experiments followed by transcriptomic profiling have been highly successful in elucidating mechanisms that underlie other RNA metabolic processes, including pre-mRNA processing, translation, and decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iwasaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mukherjee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). By extending these techniques to the study of RNA localization, we envision this study as providing a framework for the investigation of other RBPs and their effects on RNA trafficking. Given that RNA mislocalization has been associated with a range of neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), these studies can lay groundwork that links molecular defects to observed phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Fmr1</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">ENSMUSG00000000838</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">Fmr1 guide RNA</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Used to create mouse FMR1-null cells, cloned into pX330 <break/><named-content content-type="sequence">AAATTATCAGCTGGTAATTT</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CAD</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">08100805-1VL, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0199">CVCL_0199</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CAD/loxP</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khandelia et al., 2011</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Contains single integration of loxP cassette</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Fmr1 cDNA</td><td valign="top">Dharmacon</td><td valign="top">BC079671.1</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse anti FMR1, monoclonal</td><td valign="top">Proteintech</td><td valign="top">66548</td><td valign="top">1:5000 dilution for immunoblotting</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse anti HA, monoclonal</td><td valign="top">Genscript</td><td valign="top">GenScript Cat# A01244, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1289306">AB_1289306</ext-link></td><td valign="top">1:2000 for immunofluorescence</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">smFISH probes against Firefly luciferase</td><td valign="top">BioSearch</td><td valign="top">VSMF-1006–5</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Zymo Quick-RNA Microprep kit</td><td valign="top">Zymo Research</td><td valign="top">R1050</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Cell culture inserts for fractionatoin</td><td valign="top">Corning</td><td valign="top">353102</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construction of an FMRP-null CAD line</title><p>CAD cell lines were authenticated using STR profiling and were found to be mycoplasma negative.

To fractionate CAD cells into soma and neurite fractions, CAD cells were plated on porous, transwell membranes that had a pore size of 1.0 micron (Corning 353102). One million CAD cells were plated on each membrane. These membranes fit in one well of a six well plate, and six membranes were combined to comprise one single preparation. After allowing the cells to attach, the cells were induced to differentiate into a more neuronal state through the withdrawal of serum. Cells were then differentiated on the membranes for 48 hr.</p><p>To fractionate the cells, the membranes were washed one time with PBS. One mL of PBS was added to the top (soma) side of the membrane. The top side of the membrane was then scraped repeatedly and thoroughly with a cell scraper and the soma were removed into an ice-cold 15 mL falcon tube. After scraping, the membranes were removed from their plastic housing with a razor blade and soaked in 500 µL RNA lysis buffer (Zymo R1050) at room temperature for 15 min to make a neurite lysate. During this time, the 6 mL of soma suspension in PBS was spun down and resuspended in 600 µL PBS. 100 µL of this soma sample was then carried forward for RNA isolation using the Zymo QuickRNA MicroPrep kit (Zymo R1050). In parallel, RNA was also isolated from the 500 µL neurite lysate using the same kit. Typically, the neurite RNA yield from the six combined membranes was 500–1000 ng.

Additionally, we confirmed loss-of-function of <italic>FMR1</italic> in our FXS patient iPSC lines by taqman assays for <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA and western blotting for FMRP. iPSCs were maintained on Matrigel coated dishes and fed every day with complete mTesR1 medium (Stem Cell Technologies). iPSCs were passaged every 5–7 days using ReLeSR (Stem Cell Technologies).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>FXS iPS line differentiation into motor neurons</title><p>Motor neurons were generated using an improved, suspension culture-based protocol based on previously published Dual-Smad inhibition approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Du et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reinhardt et al., 2013</xref>). iPSCs were grown as clusters in suspension, and differentiated in a set-wise fashion as outlined in Supp. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>. Briefly, clusters were exposed to Smad and ROCK inhibition and WNT activation during the first 6 days, followed by activation of the retinoic and sonic hedgehog pathways. At day 10 the clusters were dissociated, and single cells were plated on membranes coated with Matrigel (Corning) in maturation media until d18-21 when MNs were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fractionation of iPS neurons into soma and neurite fractions</title><p>Generally, iPS neurons were fractionated in a very similar method as the CAD cells. However, since the iPS neurons usually contained less material, instead of combining six wells together into one prep as was done for the CAD cells, between 6 and 12 wells were combined together. After mechanical fractionation by scraping into soma and neurite fractions and RNA isolation using the Zymo Quick RNA Microprep Kit, between 100 and 500 ng of neurite RNA was obtained.</p><p>Fractionation efficiency was monitored by protein dot blot using the beta-actin and histone H3 antibodies described above. PolyA-selected, stranded RNAseq libraries were constructed using the Kapa mRNA Hyperprep kit, 100 ng of total RNA, and 15 PCR cycles of library amplification. Each condition (FXS and unaffected; soma and neurite) was fractionated, prepared, and sequenced with four replicates for a total of 16 samples. Samples were sequenced using paired-end, 150 nt sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeq. Approximately 30 million read pairs were obtained per sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Analysis of iPS neuron subcellular transcriptome data</title><p>Raw sequencing data from the iPS soma and neurite samples were analyzed using salmon and tximport as described above. After analysis of changes in RNA localization between FXS and unaffected samples using Xtail, very few genes met a reasonable FDR threshold for being significantly different between conditions. This may be a reflection of the increased variance in expression values in these samples relative to the CAD samples, perhaps due to slight variations between preps in the differentiation from iPS cells into motor neurons. For the analysis of G-quadruplex densities in mislocalized genes, mislocalized genes were identified as those who had a log2 fold change in LR across conditions (FXS vs unaffected) of at least 0.25.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>RNA Bind-n-Seq protein purification and sequence analysis</title><p>Rosetta<italic>E. coli</italic>cells were transformed with pGEX6 bacterial expression constructs (GE Healthcare) harboring GST-SBP (streptavidin binding peptide)-RGG or the two KH domains from mouse FMRP. The RGG domain was defined as residues 478–614 and the KH domains were defined as residues 222–315 from mouse FMRP1. Cultures were grown in LB broth until the optical density reached ~0.8. Cultures were brought to 16°C and induced with IPTG overnight. Cells were then harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 500units/per 1L culture Benzonase Nuclease, 20 mg/L Lysozyme, Pierce Protease Inhibitor tablets). Cell pellets were then sonicated, incubated for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged at 12500 rpm for 40 min. Supernatants were passed through a 0.45 micron filter and GST-tagged proteins were purified using GST-trap FF columns (GE). Samples were further subjected to size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE)). Pure fractions were pooled together and concentrated by centrifugation (Amicon Ultra-0.5mL Centrifugal Filter Units). Purity was assessed by PAGE and Coomassie stain.</p><p>The RNA Bind-n-Seq assay was performed similar to previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dominguez et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, RNA with a random region of 40nt was prepared by in vitro transcription. The RNA pool resolved by PAGE and purified. Concentrated RNA was heated at 85C for 5 min in the presence of 150 mM KCl or LiCl and allowed to cool for at least 3 min to allow for folding. Binding reactions were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dominguez et al., 2018</xref>). All wash and binding buffers contained either 150 mM KCl or LiCl. Protein-RNA complexes were eluted, RNA isolated and prepared for sequencing as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dominguez et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Sequence enrichments in RNA Bind-n-Seq data were obtained in three ways. First, kmer frequencies (k = 3–6) were computed in protein-bound libraries and compared to kmers in the input library. For each kmer, the ratio of its frequency in the protein-bound library to the input library results in an enrichment or ‘R’ value for every kmer, as was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dominguez et al., 2018</xref>). To identify G quadruplex sequences, we determined the fraction of protein-bound reads with matches to a variety of G quadruplex motifs (e.g. GGGN1-7GGGN1-7 GGGN1-7GGG) and compared that to the number of input reads with the same motif. Lastly, we used RNAfold version 2.4.11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lorenz et al., 2011</xref>) to predict G quadruplexes (RNAfold -g option) in the 40 nucleotide randomized regions of input and bound RNAs. As with the pattern match approach, the ratio of protein-bound to input reads predicted to fold into G quadruplexes was computed. In each case reads were subsampled for estimates. Error bars shown in figures represent standard deviation from mean across subsamples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Fluorescence polarization assay</title><p>RNAs labeled at the 3′ end with 6-FAM were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies.

Cation usage (K+ or Li+) was kept constant throughout the assay. The RGG domain of FMRP was purified and then serially diluted with binding buffer to concentrations between 1 µM to 2 nM. The RGG domain was then incubated with 10 nM of rG4 in potassium, rG4 in lithium or CTRL RNA. After incubation for 5 min at 25°C, plates were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min. Fluorescence polarization was monitored with a PHERAstar plate reader (BMG Labtech) at 26–27°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Construction of an FMRP-null CAD line with single LoxP cassette</title><p>CAD LoxP cell lines were received from the lab of Eugene Makeyev (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khandelia et al., 2011</xref>). This line contains a single loxP cassette in the genome of the cells to facilitate recombination of exogenous constructs. A knockout insertion cassette was introduced to exon 6 of the endogenous <italic>Fmr1</italic> gene via CRISPR-Cas9 technology to generate CAD LoxP FMRP KO cells. This cassette includes stop codons in all frames as well as a strong polyadenylation signal. 300 nt of homology on either side of the gRNA cut site was included to facilitate homology directed repair. A G418 resistance gene was included to select for integration. pX330 was used to express Cas9 and the guide RNA sequence <named-content content-type="sequence">AAATTATCAGCTGGTAATTT</named-content>. Following selection with G418, cells were sorted to single cells using a flow cytometer and allowed to expand for two weeks. Clones were screened for insertion of the cassette by PCR as well as FMRP mRNA and protein depletion determined by qPCR, RNA-seq and Western Blot Analysis with a monoclonal FMRP antibody (Proteintech 66548). Lesions at the locus of cutting were identified by PCR using genomic DNA to amplify the locus followed by Topo cloning of the PCR fragment and Sanger sequencing of individual bacterial colonies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Expression of Fmr1 rescue constructs in CAD cells</title><p>CAD LoxP FMRP KO cell lines were plated in 12-well plates at 1.0 to 1.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in an DMEM:F12 supplemented with 10% Equafetal 12 to 18 hr before transfection.

This was captured by a camera such that pixel sizes in the xy were 98.4 nm wide and z pixels a 398 nm wide. Cell outlines were drawn using cell autofluorescence in the FITC channel where somas and neurites were treated as separate cells. Images were first filtered with a 3D 2x gaussian method using the default parameters. Pre-detection was conducted, and spots were fit using FISH-quant default settings and a pixel-intensity threshold set to overestimate detected spots. All thresholding parameters were set tightly around each mean population to exclude gross outliers. Averaged detected spots were inspected for spherical character to ensure quality of detection.

box and G-quadruplex sequences&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Gene W Yeo as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Stephanie Ceman (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript evaluates the role of FMRP on mRNA localization to neurites using genomic approaches to reveal sequence elements and related protein domains that are suggested to be required for binding and/or neurite-targeting. The results mostly confirm current models of RGG-domain function in interacting with G-rich sequences for FMRP, and also confirm known FMRP's role in localizing neuritic mRNAs. Nevertheless, if the authors' argument for separation of function for RNA binding and its requirement for neurite-targeting, versus translation control by FMRP can be strengthened, that would be a novel finding and a requirement for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Far stronger evidence that the neurite purification led to expected, enriched mRNAs in the neurites is required. e.g., using neurofilament markers to provide confidence that indeed neurites are being enriched in the purification. Comparing the neurite-enriched mRNAs in the induced neurons to published lists (Zappulo et al., 2017) will strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>2) Ascano et al. identified FLAG tagged FMRP targets in human non-neuronal, proliferative cells (HEK293?), and Darnell et al., 2011, had an additional step to isolate mouse brain polyribosomal mRNAs. This would imply that Ascano's FMRP targets are unlikely to be localized mRNAs and Darnell's targets are enriched for ribosome-bound mRNAs. Are these datasets really comparable? What is the number of intersecting targets? And are the intersected targets really what should be compared to find FMRP-dependent localized mRNAs? If I understand Figure 2A correctly, 15% of 86 genes (localization reduced) is 12 (seems like a relatively low number to rely on for the downstream non-parametric statistical tests). What would the overlap be if the individual CLIP datasets were used to compute overlaps, and there are other datasets for FMRP CLIPs available now – what are the overlaps there and how robust are the statistical outcomes downstream?</p><p>3) The reviewers appreciate the use of FXS neurons and do agree that relying on this dataset is preferable than the CAD neurons. Thus, it is important to ensure that the antibodies for FMRP is not cross-reactive to properly interpret the data. If the authors want to utilize the CAD system, it is necessary to evaluate for clarity if the same mRNAs are found localized in both human and mouse systems. Please provide the list of mRNAs identified to the readers.</p><p>4) Further clarity and evidence that the absence of the Nol3 reporter RNA in neurites in the delta RGG FMRP case is due to loss of RNA binding or loss or neurite-targeting. Is the RGG domain required for binding the 3'UTR/the RNA in the soma and is unable to localize to the neurites, or that it binds but cannot target. Do they also observe an effect on endogenous Nol3 localization? Can CLIP be performed to clarify binding to the Nol3 reporter/endogenous RNA in the presence/absence of the different domains? Truly decoupling localization and translation with luciferase or other assays would be strong.</p><p>5) Can the affinity of the RGG and KH domains for the pools of selected RNA in the RBNS assay be measured? Are there constant regions that flank the variable 40 nts? Could that contain a sequence that binds the KH domains?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52621.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Far stronger evidence that the neurite purification led to expected, enriched mRNAs in the neurites is required. e.g., using neurofilament markers to provide confidence that indeed neurites are being enriched in the purification.

If there is leakage of the soma compartment into neurite samples, we would expect to see Histone H3 signal in the neurite samples. We have tried, both in the experiments for this publication and previous ones (Taliaferro et al., 2016), to detect neurofilament markers by Western blotting in our neurite samples but have not had success, likely due to the small amount of material collected from neurites.</p><p>As an alternative, we therefore chose to compare transcriptome-wide RNA localization values (projection / soma) in the data presented in this manuscript to those obtained in similar, previously published experiments (Figure 1—figure supplement 6). Overall, we compared projection / soma expression ratios from 65 samples spanning 2 species, 4 laboratories, and 9 cell types. We found that our fractionation data correlated quite well (R ~ 0.6 to 0.8) with almost all of these samples, and that our samples were generally indistinguishable from almost all other previously published ones. Keep in mind that we are correlating ratios of expression values, not just the expression values themselves.</p><p>To further analyze this, we found that the similarity of these samples to each was far greater than would be expected by chance (p = 2e-65, Figure 1—figure supplement 7), demonstrating that our data is quite consistent with previously published datasets.</p><p>We and many others have found that RNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and electron transport chain proteins are routinely enriched in projections. This was true of all of the samples presented in this manuscript, and the large majority of the 65 samples we analyzed (Figure 1—figure supplements 8 and 9), again demonstrating that our fractionations are consistent with previously published ones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Ascano et al. identified FLAG tagged FMRP targets in human non-neuronal, proliferative cells (HEK293?), and Darnell et al., 2011, had an additional step to isolate mouse brain polyribosomal mRNAs.

What would the overlap be if the individual CLIP datasets were used to compute overlaps, and there are other datasets for FMRP CLIPs available now – what are the overlaps there and how robust are the statistical outcomes downstream?</p></disp-quote><p>These are important subtleties in these datasets that we are glad the reviewers pointed out. Using data from another publication that performed FMRP CLIP and compiled data from the Ascano and Darnell papers (Maurin et al., 2018) there were 7800 identified targets in the Ascano data and 768 identified targets in the Darnell data. There is an overlap of 597 targets between them, which is a significant overlap (p &lt; 2e-16, binomial test).</p><p>We redid the analysis of overlaps in FMRP binding targets and our identified FMRP localization targets. We used the targets identified in each CLIP-seq dataset (Ascano, Darnell, and Maurin) individually to assess overlap with our list of functional targets. In each case, we observed a significant overlap (binomial test) between the CLIP targets and our localization targets. These plots are included as Figure 2—figure supplements 1, 3, and 5.</p><p>Additionally, we reoriented the analysis to ask about the localization sensitivity to FMRP loss for each of the identified sets of FMRP CLIP targets. If our analysis revealed direct targets of FMRP, we would expect that FMRP CLIP targets would be preferentially less localized in response to FMRP loss compared to FMRP CLIP nontargets. This is exactly what we found for each CLIP dataset. CLIP targets were significantly less localized following FMRP loss than expected. These results are presented in Figure 2—figure supplements 2, 4, and 6.</p><p>The results of these analyses, both the gene set overlap and localization change of CLIP targets in response to FMRP loss are also included in Figure 2A and B. The set of FMRP CLIP targets for these panels are defined as those shared in common between the Ascano, Darnell, and Maurin datasets.</p><p>In short, the results are robust, no matter the CLIP dataset used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reviewers appreciate the use of FXS neurons and do agree that relying on this dataset is preferable than the CAD neurons.

If this is in regard to the Western blot demonstrating that FMRP expression is decreased in FXS samples (Figure 3A), this result is corroborated by the accompanying RNAseq data. In that data, <italic>FMR1</italic> transcript levels are decreased 10-20 fold in the FXS samples relative to unaffected controls (Figure 3B). Transcript levels of the paralogs FXR1 and FXR2 are unaffected. Given that the Western blot shows a clear decrease in protein expression, we believe that the most parsimonious interpretation of this data is that the antibody recognizes FMRP. Further, the FMRP antibody we used shows a clear and complete loss of signal in the CAD knockout line (Figure 1B and Figure 7—figure supplement 9), which would not be the case if there was cross-reactivity.</p><p>There is a strong correlation in localization data obtained from CAD cells and localization data obtained from the iPS neurons (R ~ 0.7). This is reflected in Figure 1—figure supplement 6 and has been now mentioned explicitly in the text. Localization data for all genes in the CAD system and the iPS system are presented in Supplementary file 1A and B, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Further clarity and evidence that the absence of the Nol3 reporter RNA in neurites in the delta RGG FMRP case is due to loss of RNA binding or loss or neurite-targeting. Is the RGG domain required for binding the 3'UTR/the RNA in the soma and is unable to localize to the neurites, or that it binds but cannot target. Do they also observe an effect on endogenous Nol3 localization? Can CLIP be performed to clarify binding to the Nol3 reporter/endogenous RNA in the presence/absence of the different domains? Truly decoupling localization and translation with luciferase or other assays would be strong.</p></disp-quote><p>These are important points. To address them, we performed two experiments.</p><p>In the first, we assayed the ability of full length FMRP and the RGG truncation to bind the Nol3 reporter in cells, either with or without the G-quadruplex. This was done using a CLIP-qPCR experiment. The Nol3 UTR is attached to the open reading frame of Firefly luciferase. The cells also coexpress <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase from the same promoter that drives Firefly. By measuring the ratio of Firefly/<italic>Renilla</italic> transcripts using qPCR in Input and crosslink/IP samples, we can therefore measure the relative affinity that different FMRP constructs have for different UTRs.</p><p>We found that, in cells, relative to full length FMRP, the RGG truncation mutant was significantly reduced in its ability to interact with G-quadruplex-containing transcripts. Conversely, the ability of the RGG truncation to interact with transcripts that do not have a G-quadruplex was similar to that of the full length protein. These results are presented in Figure 5E and are consistent with our in vitro binding data presented in Figure 4.</p><p>To address the ability of the RGG truncation to be trafficked to neurites, we quantified the amount of FMRP protein in the soma and neurite using immunofluorescence. We found that full length FMRP and the RGG truncations displayed similar proportions of FMRP protein in the neurite, suggesting that trafficking of the RGG truncation is not significantly impaired. These results are presented in Figure 5F.</p><p>Based on these results, we conclude that it is likely the reduced ability of the RGG truncation to interact with G-quadruplexes that is responsible for the majority of the observed localization defects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Can the affinity of the RGG and KH domains for the pools of selected RNA in the RBNS assay be measured? Are there constant regions that flank the variable 40 nts? Could that contain a sequence that binds the KH domains?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this, we performed fluorescence polarization assays to determine affinities. We found that the interaction between the RGG domain and a G-quadruplex RNA had an affinity of approximately 30 nM. This is in line with previous estimates of this affinity (60 nM, Zhang et al., 2014). We observed that lithium acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor in this assay, lowering the amount of RNA that was bound, but not changing the affinity. These data are presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><p>We attempted to detect binding of the KH domains to RNA, either to the constant regions that flank the variable 40 nt or to the G-quadruplex RNA. We were never able to detect binding of the KH domains to either RNA sequence.</p></body></sub-article></article>
