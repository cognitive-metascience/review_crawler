axons. Na+ channel clustering is thought to depend on two axonal cell adhesion molecules that mediate interactions between the axon and myelinating glia at the nodal gap (i.e., NF186) and the paranodal junction (i.e., Caspr). Here we show that while Na<sup>+</sup> channels cluster at nodes in the absence of NF186, they fail to do so in double conditional knockout mice lacking both NF186 and the paranodal cell adhesion molecule Caspr, demonstrating that a paranodal junction-dependent mechanism can cluster Na<sup>+</sup> channels at nodes. Furthermore, we show that paranode-dependent clustering of nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channels requires axonal βII spectrin which is concentrated at paranodes. Our results reveal that the paranodal junction-dependent mechanism of Na<sup>+</sup>channel clustering is mediated by the spectrin-based paranodal axonal cytoskeleton.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21392.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21392.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>axon</kwd><kwd>myelin</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brophy</surname><given-names>Peter J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brophy</surname><given-names>Peter J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS044916</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rasband</surname><given-names>Matthew N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005984</institution-id><institution>Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G.

Node assembly depends on the interactions between axons and myelinating glia that are mediated by distinct cell adhesion complexes present at both the nodal gap and the paranodal junction flanking each node of Ranvier. A key mediator of these interactions is the cell adhesion molecule neurofascin (Nfasc). The <italic>Nfasc</italic> gene is alternatively spliced to generate a neuronal 186 kDa variant (NF186) found at nodes of Ranvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davis et al., 1996</xref>), and a glial 155 kDa variant (NF155) that is a core component of the paranodal junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tait et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pillai et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>Nfasc</italic> is essential for node of Ranvier assembly as genetic deletion of both NF155 and NF186 in mice results in the absence of nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sherman et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>At peripheral (PNS) and central (CNS) nodes, NF186 is clustered and stabilized at the axolemma by glial adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eshed et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feinberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Susuki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colombelli et al., 2015</xref>). Clustered NF186 functions as an attachment site for the nodal scaffolding proteins ankyrinG (AnkG) and βIV spectrin, which in turn recruit Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis and Bennett, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sherman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gasser et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ho et al., 2014</xref>). After node assembly, NF186 helps to stabilize and maintain the nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Desmazieres et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with these observations, transgenic expression of neuronal NF186 on an <italic>Nfasc</italic>-null background is sufficient to rescue nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zonta et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, the glial NF155-dependent paranodal axoglial junctions have also been proposed to function as a parallel mechanism to cluster Na<sup>+</sup> channels by acting as lateral diffusion barriers to restrict the location of nodal proteins in the axolemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rasband et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pedraza et al., 2001</xref>). In support of this idea, transgenic expression of NF155 in myelinating oligodendrocytes on a <italic>Nfasc</italic>-null background is sufficient to induce Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zonta et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, in vitro myelination of <italic>Nfasc</italic>-null axons by wild-type Schwann cells (which results in the formation of a normal paranodal junction) induces the clustering of Na<sup>+</sup> channels at nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feinberg et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, mice lacking both paranodal junctions and NF186-binding CNS nodal ECM proteins have a profound reduction in the clustering of Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Susuki et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, disruption of paranodal junctions alone causes only mild perturbations to Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dupree et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhat et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pillai et al., 2009</xref>). Together, these observations support a model where two glia-dependent mechanisms direct Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering at nodes of Ranvier: (1) clustering of axonal NF186 by glia-derived proteins and (2) restriction of nodal protein complexes within the nodal gap by the paranodal junctions.</p><p>Nevertheless, this model, and in particular the function of the paranodal junction in the clustering of Na<sup>+</sup> channels, remains controversial since conditional deletion of NF186 in neurons was reported to block the clustering of Na<sup>+</sup> channels at nodes of Ranvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thaxton et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, if paranodal junctions can act as diffusion barriers to cluster Na<sup>+</sup> channels, what molecular mechanisms are involved?</p><p>To further determine if paranodal junctions are sufficient to cluster nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channels in vivo, we genetically deleted (in three separate laboratories) nodal NF186 using two different conditional <italic>Nfasc</italic> alleles, and three independent Cre-driver lines. We confirmed the role of the paranodal junction as a second, glia-dependent mechanism for Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering by generating double-conditional knockout mice lacking both axonal Caspr and NF186. Finally, using double-conditional knockout mice deficient in both axonal NF186 and βII spectrin, we extend our understanding of node formation by showing that the axonal βII spectrin-based paranodal cytoskeleton underlies the paranodal mechanism of nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NF155-dependent paranodal junctions can cluster Na<sup>+</sup> channels in the PNS</title><p>To determine whether the paranodal junctions are sufficient to cluster Na<sup>+</sup> channels in the absence of axoglial contact at the nodes, we generated two distinct <italic>Nfasc</italic> conditional alleles to specificially remove NF186 in neurons: mice with floxed <italic>Nfasc</italic> exons 6 and 7, and mice with a floxed <italic>Nfasc</italic> exon 4, hereafter referred to as <italic>Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Nfasc(4)<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zonta et al., 2011</xref>).

We found clusters of Na<sup>+</sup> channels at all nodes of Ranvier at both P9 and P12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–d</xref>). We also examined the clustering of other nodal proteins including AnkG, βIV spectrin, and gliomedin (Gldn; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Whereas Na<sup>+</sup> channels, AnkG, and βIV spectrin were unaffected by the loss of NF186, Gldn was no longer restricted to nodes of Ranvier, consistent with gliomedin's function as a ligand for NF186 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eshed et al., 2005</xref>). Similar to <italic>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, analysis of peripheral nerves from <italic>Thy1-Cre;Nfasc(4)<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice revealed clustered Na<sup>+</sup> channels, AnkG, and βIV spectrin, but loss of the nodal NF186 ligands NrCAM and Gldn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b and d</xref>).</p><p>A major function of NF186 during early development is to interact with gliomedin to form heminodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel clusters which are precursors to mature nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feinberg et al., 2010</xref>). Heminodes are most easily seen in dorsal root ganglion/Schwann cell mixed cultures that have been induced to myelinate. Whereas 84% (n = 128 heminodes) of heminodes from wild-type (WT) cultures had heminodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), only 6% (n = 113 heminodes) of heminodes from <italic>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice had heminodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel clusters. Instead, <italic>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice had Na<sup>+</sup> channels in the forming nodal gap between adjacent Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). The distribution of Na<sup>+</sup> channels in the latter supports a role for paranodal junctions in restricting nodal proteins between two forming myelin sheaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feinberg et al., 2010</xref>). Intriguingly, close examination of <italic>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> dorsal roots and <italic>Thy1-Cre;Nfasc(4)<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> peripheral nerves showed that the intensity of nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel staining was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Quantification of the nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel fluorescence intensity in <italic>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice at P9 and P12 showed a significant reduction compared to control <italic>Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Consistent with this reduced nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel density, compound action potential recordings from P10 dorsal roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref>) revealed a reduction in conduction velocity in <italic>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g</xref>). The loss of Na<sup>+</sup> channels from nodes may account for the juvenile lethality observed in <italic>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (i.e., at 7–10 days these mice began to develop a progressive tremor that worsened until most mice died at around 3 weeks of age). Hence, while these observations confirm that paranodal junctions are sufficient for the initial Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering at PNS nodes, they also support previous observations that NF186 plays important roles in maintaining the nodal protein complex which is necessary for proper action potential conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Desmazieres et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The paranodal junctions can cluster Na<sup>+</sup> channels in the CNS</title><p>To determine if paranodal junctions can cluster Na<sup>+</sup> channels in the asbence of axonal NF186 in the CNS, we crossed <italic>Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice with <italic>Six3-Cre</italic> mice which are reported to undergo recombination in retinal ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Furuta et al., 2000</xref>). Immunostaining of <italic>Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mouse optic nerves with a chicken panNF antibody that recognizes both NF186 and NF155 splice variants showed staining at both nodes and paranodes (note the yellow color at nodes due to overlap with Na<sup>+</sup> channels in the <italic>Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> control optic nerves, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). However, we found that some oligodendrocytes in the <italic>Six3-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mouse also recombine, resulting in a mosaic nerve with some regions lacking both NF155 and NF186 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>, outlined region). Like <italic>Pgk-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, regions lacking both NF155 and NF186 had dramatically reduced Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering; when Na<sup>+</sup> channels were clustered in regions lacking paranodal NF155, they always colocalized with NF186 in axons corresponding to retinal ganglion cells that presumably did not undergo recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Therefore, we restricted our analysis to regions of the <italic>Six3-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mouse optic nerve where oligodendrocytes still expressed NF155. Immunostaining showed a pronounced gap in Nfasc immunoreactivity at nodes; occasionally we found some nodes that still had nodal NF186, likely due to a lack of recombination in those neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>, arrows). Consistent with our observations in the PNS, we found robust Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering in the gap between all panNF-labeled paranodal junctions at P17 and P30 in the <italic>Six3-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mouse optic nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b,d</xref>). Intriguingly, at P60 some nodes had intact panNF-labeled paranodal junctions but without any associated Na<sup>+</sup> channel immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, arrowhead and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). However, in contrast to the PNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), we did not observe a general reduction in Na<sup>+</sup> channel fluorescence intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). As expected, nodes lacking NF186 in the <italic>Six3-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice had AnkG and βIV spectrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>).

Paranodes also have a specialized αII/βII spectrin-based axonal cytoskeleton whose assembly requires the NF155-dependent paranodal junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ogawa et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the paranodal cytoskeleton may function as repeating intra-axonal boundaries that restrict AnkG and Na<sup>+</sup> channels to nodes.

Thus, <italic>Avil-Cre;Sptbn1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice have normal Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering and densities of Na<sup>+</sup> channels, indicating that NF186 is sufficient to cluster nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channels.

With the same rationale, Na<sup>+</sup> channels still cluster at nodes in the absence of the paranodal junction barrier (by genetically deleting cell adhesion molecules that mediate axoglial contact at this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhat et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pillai et al., 2009</xref>), or βII spectrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>]) due to the function of NF186 at the forming nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Glial NF155 binds to a heterodimeric cell adhesion molecule complex consisting of axonal Caspr and contactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charles et al., 2002</xref>). In myelinating glia, NF155 also interacts with ankyrinB (AnkB) and AnkG to facilitate the assembly of the paranodal junction, which in turn controls the rapid development of Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2014</xref>). Axonal Caspr has a cytoplasmic protein 4.1 binding domain, and protein 4.1B is enriched at paranodes and juxtaparanodes. Protein 4.1B binds to αII/βII spectrin and mice deficient in either 4.1B or βII spectrin have impaired axonal membrane domain organization with mislocalization of juxtaparanodal Kv1 K<sup>+</sup> channels due to loss of the paranodal boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horresh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Einheber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that in myelinated axons, glial NF155 directs the assembly of the αII/βII spectrin-based paranodal cytoskeleton through Caspr and protein 4.1B. One prediction from this model is that mice lacking both NF186 and protein 4.1B should phenocopy the <italic>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sptbn1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice we analyzed.</p><p>How does the βII spectrin-based paranodal cytoskeleton function as a barrier to restrict AnkG/βIV spectrin to nodes of Ranvier? We speculate that similar to the AIS and distal axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galiano et al., 2012</xref>), different spectrin and ankyrin cytoskeletons occupy mutually exclusive domains due to steric effects. Thus, domains containing βIV spectrin are mutually exclusive to those containing βII spectrin. Recent experiments using super-resolution microscopy reveal that the βII spectrin-based cytoskeleton in unmyelinated axons is organized into repeating rings of spectrin tetramers and actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). However, the high density of αII/βII spectrin found at paranodes may not be organized in the same way, and this high density may function to restrict ankG/βIV spectrin-containing cytoskeletons to the forming nodes as the myelin sheath elongates. While the conclusion that the paranodal junction contributes to the clustering of nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channels is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rasband et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zonta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feinberg et al., 2010</xref>), it is different from the one reached by Thaxton et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thaxton et al., 2011</xref>). To specifically target NF186 these authors used a Cre-recombinase under control of the Neurofilament light chain (<italic>Nefl-Cre</italic>). Unfortunately, this Cre-driver line has poor penetrance and poor temporal precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thaxton et al., 2011</xref>). Since we also observed reduced densities of nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering (in the PNS) and even complete loss of channels in some NF186-deficient axons (both PNS and CNS) with increasing age, we speculate the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thaxton et al. (2011)</xref> reflect the role of NF186 for maintenance of Na<sup>+</sup> channel clusters rather than their initial assembly. This conclusion is consistent with their observation that in P11 sciatic nerves, 30% of nodes lacking NF186 still had Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering. It was with these concerns in mind that we used two different <italic>Nfasc</italic> alleles and three different highly penetrant and temporally precise Cre-driver lines. Why are Na<sup>+</sup> channel intensities at PNS nodes reduced but normal at CNS nodes in NF186-deficient axons? We speculate that differences in primary and secondary clustering mechanisms can account for the reduced Na<sup>+</sup> channel density in the PNS. For example, we previously proposed the main clustering mechanism in the PNS is through ECM/NF186 rather than the paranode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feinberg et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, since Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering in the CNS is temporally correlated with assembly of the paranodal junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rasband et al., 1999</xref>), but not the assembly of the CNS nodal ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Susuki et al., 2013</xref>), our results are consistent with the idea that the main driver of CNS nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering is the paranodal cytoskeleton-based mechanism. Since the main paranode-based mechanism is intact in <italic>Six3-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, their Na<sup>+</sup> channels may be more stable.</p><p>Our discovery that paranodal cytoskeletons play an important role in node of Ranvier formation may also have important implications for disease and injury. Spectrins are potent substrates for calpain-mediated proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Siman et al., 1984</xref>). Thus, injury or disease could affect the integrity of this clustering mechanism. This could be particularly detrimental for peripheral and central autoimmune diseases that have as their molecular targets nodal antigens including NF186 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mathey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uncini et al., 2013</xref>) resulting in a 'double-hit': disruption of nodal neurofascin and paranodal junction cytoskeletons. Consistent with this idea, calpain inhibitors preserve nodes of Ranvier in animal models of Guillain-Barre syndrome where nodal antigens are thought to be targeted in the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McGonigal et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we confirmed that two glia-dependent mechanisms control the clustering of Na<sup>+</sup> channels at the nodes of Ranvier. These mechanisms depend on specific cell adhesion molecules that mediate the contact between myelinating glia and their underlying axons at the forming nodes and the paranodal junction. Furthermore, we extended these conclusions by showing that the paranodal junction-dependent mechanism of Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering requires the βII spectrin-based cytoskeleton that is assembled at this site.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Animals were housed at the Center for Laboratory Animal Care at Baylor College of Medicine, the Weizmann Institute of Science, and the University of Edinburgh.

After fixation, nerves were transferred to ice-cold 20% sucrose (w/v) in 0.1 M PB until equilibrated. The tissue was then frozen in Tissue-Tek OCT mounting medium. Teased sciatic nerves were prepared and immunolabeled as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Poliak et al., 2001</xref>). Briefly, sciatic nerves were fixed as described above, de-sheathed and teased using fine forceps on SuperFrost Plus slides (Menzel-Gläser, Thermo Scientific), air dried over-night, and then kept frozen at −20°C till use. For the isolation of dorsal and ventral roots, spines were dissected and submerged in 2% fresh PFA for 2 hr at 4°C. They were then transferred to 0.5M EDTA, pH 8.0, overnight on ice at 4°C. The next day, spinal cords were excised from the spinal bones with their bound ventral and dorsal roots, and immersed in ice cold PBS overnight on ice at 4°C. The next day, we carefully removed the roots and teased the nerve bundles with fine forceps or thin needles on SuperFrost Plus slides, air dried over-night, and then kept frozen at −20°C till use. In some cases, optic nerves and dorsal roots were sectioned and mounted on slides. All tissues for immunostaining were blocked and permeabilized in 0.1 M PB, 10% normal goat serum, and 0.3% or 0.5% TX-100 for one hour. Primary antibodies were then diluted either in the same blocking buffer or in blocking buffer containing 0.1% TX-100 and added to sections overnight. Labeled sections were then washed 3X in the blocking buffer or PBS for 5 min each. Secondary antibodies were then diluted in blocking buffer and added to the tissue sections for one hour. Sections were then washed three times in PBS for 5 min each. The fluorescently immunolabeled sections were then covered with coverslips using anti-fade mounting medium (KPL, MD) and imaged using a Zeiss Axioimager Z1 with apotome attachment for structured illumination, a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope or Leica TCL-SL confocal microscope and 63X objective, numerical aperture 1.4. Images were acquired and processed using the Zen software (Carl Zeiss) or Leica proprietary software. Signal intensity analysis was performed on images obtained from the Zeiss confocal microscope, and performed using Volocity (Perkin-Elmer) or using Zeiss Zen software. For the measurement of node fluorescence intensity, sections were carefully handled side-by-side with the same stainings, exposure times, etc. Nodal intensities were obtained using two separate methods: 1) by dividing the fluorescence intensity by the area of the node, and 2) normalizing the nodal fluorescence intensity to that of the flanking paranodal Caspr. Both methods were used in the PNS and gave similar results. The data presented in the PNS (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>) was obtained in the Peles laboratory using the first method, while the data in the CNS was obtained in the Rasband laboratory using the second method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>CAP recordings in dorsal roots and optic nerves were performed as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rasband et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Susuki et al., 2007</xref>).

For better contrast resolution, tissues were impregnated with uranyl-acetate (2% in H2O for 1 hr) before being washed twice in H2O. After a series of dehydrating steps in rising EtOH-concentrations (50%, 70%, 96% each twice for 5 min, 100% three times 10 min), tissues were embedded in propylene oxide (3 × 10 min) and incubated overnight in 30% Epon ‘Hard’ (EMS) diluted in propylene oxide. Next, Epon was introduced gradually into the samples (50% and 70% 24 hr each, 100% 48 hr).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study re-evaluates the role of nodal versus paranodal interactions in clustering sodium channels (NaChs) at nodes of Ranvier in the PNS and CNS. Using in vivo genetic manipulations to selectively delete NF186 from different populations of PNS and CNS neurons, the authors find NaV channel clusters remain at nodes in the absence of NF186. This finding is, on the surface, different from that reported by Thaxton et al. in 2011, in which loss of NF186 was reported to result in a loss of NaCh clusters. The authors suggest that this discrepancy is due to the poor efficiency of the Cre line used in the 2011 report, and further, that NF186 plays an important role in maintaining NaCh clusters rather than in initially forming clusters. Consistent with this interpretation, the 2011 report observed some NaCh clusters in P11 sciatic nerves, and both groups find a decrease in NaCh clusters with age.</p><p>This study is important, as it provides a compelling explanation for previous findings, reconciles data from different manipulations, and describes a role for glial-axonal paranodal interactions through NF155 and βII spectrin in the initial localization of NaV channels to nodes. The in vivo analyses and use of multiple cre lines enhance the findings and impact. There was a consensus that the manuscript is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, provided the following concerns are addressed.</p><p>Concerns with the text:</p><p>1) In some positions, the paper is written in a way as if almost nothing was known before. For example, Abstract: &quot;but the specific mechanisms remain unclear.&quot; It would be important to carefully re-write the paper to make clear where the model established for example in Susuki et al. has been reinforced and where it has been extended. Novel aspects established in their current study should be highlighted, for example, the role of paranodal spectrin and the role of neurofascin186 in maintaining sodium channel clustering.</p><p>2) The paper would benefit from a graphical model depicting the key insights of the paper and a model that summarizes our current understanding of node assembly.</p><p>3) It isn't clear from the experiments whether the pathway proposed is merely an example of redundancy or whether this interaction is important for some aspect of initial node formation. It seems that βII spectrin deletion alone does not alter nodal clustering, suggesting that under normal conditions, NF186 is sufficient. It would be helpful if the authors were to discuss this issue and provide some quantification of NaCh density in the βII knockout (see below).</p><p>4) Some of the PNS experiments deleting NF186 appear to repeat work that is already published. Thus, Feinberg et al., 2010, cocultured DRG neurons from NF-/- mice with wt Schwann cells and found Na<sup>+</sup> channels clustered at nodes, but not heminodes. This is also reported here in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, although with a different mutant. Was a different result expected? The Salzer lab used RNAi to knock down NF186 in similar cultures, and found no Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering at regions that they interpreted as nodes, but had wide gaps (JCB 177:857, 2007).</p><p>Concerns about immunocytochemical quantification:</p><p>1) Results section. NaCh immunofluorescence intensity was measured in the conditional deletion and compared with a control. This is a very difficult measurement, requiring careful controls. All we are told is that they used the Volocity software. For example, comparing the dorsal root images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the nodal label looks weaker in the deletion, but so does the Caspr label. How were the measurements normalized to be able to compare different sections? Were the sections mounted on the same slide so that they would be treated identically?</p><p>2) In the Abstract and the Discussion the authors do not address the fact that NaCh clustering, while present in the absence of NF186, is markedly decreased and the mice have a profound deficit in action potential conduction. Thus, the results provide a more nuanced picture than is presented. It would be helpful if this issue were addressed. As the density of NaCh is affected, the authors should provide a consistent assessment of NaCh content in the different mouse lines (Although immunolabeling is not truly quantitative, it would provide a means to compare relative abundance, provided processing and image acquisition are standardized). For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, NaCh immunostaining intensity is quantified, providing an explanation for the reduction in AP conduction velocity, but similar data are not provided for the other mouse lines and no density measures are provided for CNS axons.</p><p>3) The authors conclude that paranodal interactions are &quot;sufficient for the initial NaCh clustering at PNS nodes.&quot; However, they do not provide evidence that the density of NaChs achieved at nodes in NF186 deficient axons is similar to that which occurs in wild type. This statement should be revised or additional data provided to support this conclusion.</p><p>4) As pointed out by the authors, some nodes in <italic>Six3-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>mice at P60 lacked NaCh clusters but had paranodal NF immunoreactivity. The authors need to assess whether these axons had intact βII spectrin. If so, it would contradict the primary conclusion of the study and should be discussed. Is it possible that different neurons may exhibit a different dependence on NF186/NF155 interactions for NaCh clustering and/or maintenance?</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, it would be helpful if the authors provided quantification of the number of positive nodes with βII spectrin, βIV spectrin, AnkG, etc. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) to demonstrate the robustness of these observations. 2. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-D</xref> and subsection “The spectrin-based paranodal cytoskeleton underlies the paranodal clustering mechanism”. The thinner myelin seen in NF186/βII spectrin null mice is interesting. The authors do not speculate on a possible mechanism for this. Further, while they state that paranodal junctions are intact, no transverse bands are visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, while the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) has hints of them. The presence of Caspr may not guarantee &quot;intact paranodal junctions&quot;. The authors may wish to refer to Mierzwa et al., J. Comp. Neurol. 518:2841, 2010.</p><p>Concerns about the electrophysiological analysis</p><p>1) The electrophysiology raises a number of questions. Firstly, the methods simply refer to previous papers. There should be a few sentences describing: the basic technique (wires? suction electrodes?); stimulus parameters; the bath solution recipe and if it was oxygenated; and the temperature. Secondly, it would be helpful to have a conduction velocity for all peaks. Is the second peak in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref> attributable to unmyelinated axons? Why is there such a large range of velocities in the control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>? Some of these may be so slow as to be from unmyelinated fibers. The <italic>Avil-Cre</italic> NF(f/f) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref> does not just show a decreased velocity of the fast peak. There is a very pronounced second peak. What is its velocity? Does it represent small myelinated axons or unmyelinated axons? Has there been a shift in the relative numbers of these fibers from the NF(f/f) control?</p><p>2) Could the decreased conduction velocity in the CNS in the <italic>Six3-Cre</italic> NF(f/f) optic nerves be due to the loss of ECM proteins that was seen? The authors have shown previously that loss of Tenascin-R lowers velocity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21392.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Concerns with the text:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) In some positions, the paper is written in a way as if almost nothing was known before.

We carefully examined every major section (see summary below):</p><p>Abstract: deleted statement that the &quot;[…] specific mechanisms remain unclear.&quot;</p><p>Introduction: we state what previous evidence supported a paranodal junction-dependent mechanism, and we highlight where the controversy remains surrounding the necessity of NF186. Finally, we conclude the introduction by stating that we confirmed the role of the paranodal junction and extend our understanding of node formation by revealing the requirement for the βII spectrin-dependent paranodal cytoskeleton.</p><p>Results: In the first section that describes the deletion of NF186 and the sufficiency of NF155-dependent paranodal junctions to cluster Na<sup>+</sup> channels in the PNS we conclude: “Hence, while these observations confirm that paranodal junctions are sufficient for the initial Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering at PNS nodes, they also support previous observations that NF186 plays important roles in maintaining the nodal protein complex which is necessary for proper action potential conduction (Amor et al., 2014; Desmazieres et al., 2014).” Throughout the remainder of the results we indicated where the results either confirm previous work or extend our understanding of the mechanisms.</p><p>Discussion: We revised the discussion to indicate where we confirm or extend our understanding of node formation. The discussion focuses on three things: 1) the model for how Na<sup>+</sup> channels are clustered and what the genetic mouse models reveal from the work reported here, 2) that NF186 is dispensable and we provide a potential explanation for why the work of Thaxton et al. differs from our study, and 3) the majority of the discussion focuses on the paranodal cytoskeleton and its role in Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering which is the major conceptual advance reported here.</p><p><italic>2) The paper would benefit from a graphical model depicting the key insights of the paper and a model that summarizes our current understanding of node assembly.</italic> </p><p>We now include a model (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.) that summarizes the major conclusions from the paper in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>3) It isn't clear from the experiments whether the pathway proposed is merely an example of redundancy or whether this interaction is important for some aspect of initial node formation.</italic> </p><p>We agree that we have not provided any evidence that the paranodal mechanism plays an important role in some aspect of initial node formation. In the PNS the primary mechanism of NaCh clustering is through Gldn/NF186 with the paranodal junctions being the secondary mechanism. In the CNS, the primary mechanism is the paranodal junction, while the ECM/NF186 interaction is the secondary mechanism. These conclusions were reported by us previously in Susuki et al., Neuron 2013.</p><p><italic>It seems that βII spectrin deletion alone does not alter nodal clustering, suggesting that under normal conditions, NF186 is sufficient.

We performed new measurements of nodal densities and found that 94.1% and 94.6% of nodes in control and <italic>Avil-Cre;Spnb2<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>mice, respectively, had Na<sup>+</sup> channels (p=0.28 by Student’s t-test n=3 independent animals for each genotype and a total of 796 and 464 nodes were examined in control and cKO mice, respectively). When we examined the Na<sup>+</sup> channel density at individual nodes in the <italic>Avil-Cre;Spnb2<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>mice we found fluorescence intensities of 1.035 and 0.935 in control and <italic>Avil-Cre;Spnb2<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>mice, respectively (p=0.44 by Student’s t-test, n= 4 mice of each genotype with a total of 100 and 92 nodes measured in control and cKO mice, respectively). We have added these details in the Results section.</p><p><italic>4) Some of the PNS experiments deleting NF186 appear to repeat work that is already published. Thus, Feinberg et al., 2010, cocultured DRG neurons from NF-/- mice with wt Schwann cells and found Na<sup>+</sup> channels clustered at nodes, but not heminodes.

(2010) and that reported by Dzhashiashvili et al. (2007). A different result was not expected. The purpose of the figure was to show that using the new conditional NF186 knockout mice we can confirm previous studies using mixed cultures. Again these data are in support of a model where NF186 is dispensable for nodal clustering, but required for heminodal clustering of channels. Given previous reports to the contrary (Thaxton et al., 2011) we consider these experiments to be important for the main messages.</p><p><italic>Concerns about immunocytochemical quantification:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Results section.

How were the measurements normalized to be able to compare different sections? Were the sections mounted on the same slide so that they would be treated identically?</italic> </p><p>For the measurement of fluorescence intensity, sections were carefully handled side-by-side with the same stainings, exposure times, etc. Nodal intensities were obtained by dividing the fluorescence intensity by the area of the node (for the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Nevertheless, to be absolutely certain of our results we performed two independent measurements of NaCh density in the <italic>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>mice – one in the Peles lab and one in the Rasband lab. The measurements shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> are from the Peles lab. The Rasband lab measured nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel intensity at P10, but normalized the intensity to that for the flanking paranodal Caspr. We obtained a ratio of 0.94 in <italic>Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>mice mice and 0.74 in <italic>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>mice (p=0.02, Student’s t-tets, n= 4 mice of each genotype). Thus, using a different method of measuring nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel intensity both groups obtained consistent results. We chose to present the data from the Peles lab in the manuscript because we had two time points.</p><p><italic>2) In the Abstract and the Discussion the authors do not address the fact that NaCh clustering, while present in the absence of NF186, is markedly decreased and the mice have a profound deficit in action potential conduction. Thus, the results provide a more nuanced picture than is presented. It would be helpful if this issue were addressed. As the density of NaCh is affected, the authors should provide a consistent assessment of NaCh content in the different mouse lines (Although immunolabeling is not truly quantitative, it would provide a means to compare relative abundance, provided processing and image acquisition are standardized). For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, NaCh immunostaining intensity is quantified, providing an explanation for the reduction in AP conduction velocity, but similar data are not provided for the other mouse lines and no density measures are provided for CNS axons.</italic> </p><p>To be as clear as possible about the major conclusions of our study we focused our Abstract on the three major results: 1) NF186 is dispensable for Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering, 2) paranodes are sufficient to cluster Na<sup>+</sup> channels, and 3) the molecular basis for the paranodal mechanism is βII spectrin. We do not believe the Abstract is an appropriate place for a detailed description of results. However, we have not suppressed or hidden the observation of reduced Na<sup>+</sup> channel density. We agree the reduction in Na<sup>+</sup> channel density is significant and we report this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. We now provide fluorescence intensity measurements for the βII spectrin conditional knockout mouse line in the revised manuscript, but we do not have fluorescence intensity measurements for the <italic>Thy-1Cre;Nfasc(4)<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice. We also performed fluorescence intensity measurements of Na<sup>+</sup> channel intensity in the <italic>Six3Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>CNS.</p><p>Surprisingly, in contrast to the PNS where there was a very obvious reduction in NaCh density at individual nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we measured no equivalent change in the <italic>Six3Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>CNS optic nerve (n= 3 animals of each genotype). These data are included here for the reviewers <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>. We speculate that this discrepancy between the CNS and PNS reflects differences in primary and secondary clustering mechanisms in the PNS vs. the CNS. Specifically, in the PNS the primary mechanism of NaCh clustering is through Gldn/NF186 with the paranodal junctions being the secondary mechanism. In the CNS, the primary mechanism is the paranodal junction, while the ECM/NF186 interaction is the secondary mechanism (Susuki et al., Neuron 2013). (These conclusions are also consistent with the observation that in mice lacking paranodal junctions the nodal clusters in the CNS become proportionally much, much longer than those in the PNS (Rios et al., J Neurosci 2003)). We chose not to include these data since they do not change the conclusions and would require a complicated discussion of the differences in the hierarchy of clustering mechanisms between the PNS and CNS that may detract from the main message. Should the reviewers feel these data are critical to the overall message of the paper we will be happy to include them as they provide strong support for the sufficiency of the paranodal mechanism – especially in the CNS. Finally, in recognition of the reviewer’s point that our results are more nuanced (i.e. that clustering is not completely normal since nodes have reduced densities of Na<sup>+</sup> channels), we revised the Discussion and overall conclusion to state, “Accordingly, the loss of NF186 can be partially compensated for by the paranodal junction-based cytoskeletal barrier since Na<sup>+</sup> channels may still be clustered, but they cannot be maintained in the absence of NF186 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).”<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21392.011</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Nodal NaCh intensity in the <italic>Six3Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>CNS optic nerve.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21392.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21392.011</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21392-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>3) The authors conclude that paranodal interactions are &quot;sufficient for the initial NaCh clustering at PNS nodes.&quot; However, they do not provide evidence that the density of NaChs achieved at nodes in NF186 deficient axons is similar to that which occurs in wild type. This statement should be revised or additional data provided to support this conclusion.</italic> </p><p>The results presented in this paper, using 3 different conditional knockout mouse models, show that paranodal junctions are sufficient for the initial clustering of Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We don’t claim that the density of channels is identical to that of control animals. We specifically only stated that paranodes are sufficient to induce Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering at PNS nodes. In fact, we provided data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>, suggesting that in contrast to the PNS, CNS nodes may have normal densities of Na<sup>+</sup> channels even at P17, which is the time of peak node formation in the optic nerve (see Rasband et al., J Neurosci 1999). For the reasons already stated (see above), we chose not to include these results. We conclude that indeed paranodes are sufficient for the initial Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering at PNS nodes. Please note the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows reduced Na<sup>+</sup> channel densities in NF186-deficient mice, emphasizing that the paranodal clustering mechanisms may not be sufficient to maintain the normal density of channels.</p><p><italic>4) As pointed out by the authors, some nodes in Six3-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice at P60 lacked NaCh clusters but had paranodal NF immunoreactivity. The authors need to assess whether these axons had intact βII spectrin. If so, it would contradict the primary conclusion of the study and should be discussed. Is it possible that different neurons may exhibit a different dependence on NF186/NF155 interactions for NaCh clustering and/or maintenance?</italic> </p><p>The reviewer suggests that if we were able to identify a P60 node that lacked Na<sup>+</sup> channels but still had intact βII spectrin it would argue against a model where the paranodal cytoskeleton is sufficient for channel clustering. In fact, we expect that all P60 nodes in the <italic>Six3-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>mice have intact paranodal βII spectrin. Since earlier timepoints always show clustered Na<sup>+</sup> Channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), we conclude that loss of NF186 results in failure to <underline>maintain</underline> the clusters of Na<sup>+</sup> channels, not to assemble them. If we detected paranodal βII spectrin at P60 flanking nodes lacking Na<sup>+</sup> channels in these mice it would <underline>not</underline> argue against our model. Unfortunately direct demonstration of βII spectrin at CNS paranodes in the <italic>Six3-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>miceis technically exceedingly difficult (nigh impossible for the number of instances that would be needed to be observed for statistical confidence) for two reasons: 1) the frequency of a node lacking Na<sup>+</sup> channels is very rare (only ~15% of nodes at P60), and 2) βII spectrin is highly expressed in both axons and myelinating oligodendrocytes making it very difficult to observe paranodal βII spectrin in the CNS. In addition, the density of myelinated axons in the optic nerve makes the detection of paranodal βII spectrin very difficult. It is only in regions where optic nerve axons have ‘frayed’ and individual axons can be seen where it is possible to see the paranodal βII spectrin. It is much easier to see the paranodal βII spectrin in PNS axons because they can be much more easily separated.</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, it would be helpful if the authors provided quantification of the number of positive nodes with βII spectrin, βIV spectrin, AnkG, etc. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) to demonstrate the robustness of these observations.</italic> </p><p>We are unsure of the reviewers’ intent with this question. Is the suggestion that Na<sup>+</sup> channels may be clustered in the absence of βIV spectrin or AnkG? We previously showed that the ankG-binding motif of Na<sup>+</sup> channels is both necessary and sufficient for the proper clustering of nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channels (Gasser et al., J Neurosci 2012) and we showed that Na<sup>+</sup> channels are <underline>never</underline> clustered without a nodal ankyrin (Ho et al., Nat Neurosci 2014). Based on these prior observations we did not quantify βIV spectrin or ankG staining in the mice we analyzed – instead our focus was on Na<sup>+</sup> channels since clustering of Na<sup>+</sup> channels requires intact ankyrin and β spectrin clustering. Nevertheless, our qualitative analysis indicated that the staining for ankG and βIV spectrin in <italic>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Spnb2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice is similar to that for Na<sup>+</sup> channels. Since the animals analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> (<italic>Thy-1Cre;Nfasc(4)<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice) have intact βII spectrin gene expression and intact paranodal junctions (as indicated by Caspr staining) we did not analyze βII spectrin staining in these mice.

The presence of Caspr may not guarantee &quot;intact paranodal junctions&quot;. The authors may wish to refer to Mierzwa et al., J. Comp. Neurol. 518:2841, 2010.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the thinner myelin observed in the <italic>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Spnb2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> is quite interesting and also consistent with a delay in myelination observed in the full NFasc knockout mouse (Zonta et al., JCB 2008). However, we chose not to discuss the hypomyelination because the focus of the paper is on Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering at nodes and the function of the paranodal cytoskeleton in that process. Although interesting, we believe it is tangential to the main message of the paper and we have no data to support any particular mechanism. If the editor would like us to discuss the issue we are happy to do it, but it will be speculation. The more important question is about the EM and the lack of transverse bands. We agree that transverse bands are not visible in the example of the paranode shown. Unfortunately, because of the recombination that occasionally occurs in oligodendrocytes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), we cannot be certain that a given paranode has NF155. Although most investigators believe the molecular basis of the transverse band is the Caspr/contactin/NF155 protein complex, this has never been proven by immunoelectron microscopy. Nevertheless, since there are no known examples where transverse bands are present but Caspr and NF155 are not also clustered, we used Caspr and paranodal NF immunostaining to indicate intact paranodal junctions in the nodes we analyzed. Thus, although we are limited in our analysis of paranodes by EM, the immunostaining strongly supports the conclusion that junctions are intact.</p><p><italic>Concerns about the electrophysiological analysis</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The electrophysiology raises a number of questions. Firstly, the methods simply refer to previous papers. There should be a few sentences describing: the basic technique (wires?, suction electrodes?); stimulus parameters; the bath solution recipe and if it was oxygenated; and the temperature.</italic> </p><p>We have added these details to the Materials and methods section.</p><p><italic>Secondly, it would be helpful to have a conduction velocity for all peaks. Is the second peak in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref> attributable to unmyelinated axons?</italic> </p><p>The second peak in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref> is unlikely to reflect an increase in unmyelinated axons since their conduction velocities and amplitudes are more than an order of magnitude lower than signals recorded from myelinated sensory axons, and we see no reduction in myelination in the <italic>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> or <italic>Six3-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>mice. Instead the delay in the first peak and increase in the second peak corresponds to slowing of axons due to reduced Na<sup>+</sup> channel densities. Respectfully, we do not believe reporting a conduction velocity for all peaks is particularly informative since the entire trace shown represents the summation of action potentials from many hundreds if not thousands of axons in the sensory roots. The velocity for the second peak is easy to provide, it is just that we do not think it will provide any additional information beyond what is already given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>. Perhaps we have overlooked the reason why the reviewer suggested this. If the reviewer feels strongly about this we would be happy to consider their reasons.</p><p><italic>Why is there such a large range of velocities in the control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>? Some of these may be so slow as to be from unmyelinated fibers. The Avil-Cre NF(f/f) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref> does not just show a decreased velocity of the fast peak. There is a very pronounced second peak. What is its velocity? Does it represent small myelinated axons or unmyelinated axons? Has there been a shift in the relative numbers of these fibers from the NF(f/f) control?</italic> </p><p>The reason for the large range of velocities in the control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref> is that we pooled all CAP data recorded from dorsal roots. These roots have different proportions of sensory neuron subtypes with different diameters which results in a wide distribution of conduction velocities even in the control roots. Please see the answer above with regard to the unmyelinated axons and the second peak.</p><p><italic>2) Could the decreased conduction velocity in the CNS in the Six3-Cre NF(f/f) optic nerves be due to the loss of ECM proteins that was seen? The authors have shown previously that loss of Tenascin-R lowers velocity.</italic></p><p>The reviewer is correct that we (and others) have previously reported changes in CNS nerve conduction velocity in mice lacking nodal ECM proteins such as Tenascin and Bral1 (loss of Bral1 also disrupts Brevican and Versican retention at CNS nodes). Thus, it is quite possible that the loss of these ECM proteins also contributes to reduced conduction velocities. We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have added the following sentence to the Results section: “The reduced conduction velocity does not reflect impaired myelination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F and 1G</xref>), but instead likely reflects the combined effects of decreased nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel density, loss of nodal extracellular matrix molecules (Weber et al., 1999; Bekku et al., 2010), and loss of some paranodal junctions due to NF155-deficient oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
