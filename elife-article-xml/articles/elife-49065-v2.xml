During development many different types of neurons are specified to build the macrocircuitry of the central nervous system before the microcircuitry is established. Understanding the genetic and cellular underpinnings of brain development has remained one of the major challenges in developmental biology. Many aspects of neural development are conserved in animals but compared to vertebrates, insects have a strongly reduced number of neural cells and the genes involved are usually present in single copy. This has made insects very useful models to study the genetic control of neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hartenstein and Stollewerk, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Technau et al., 2006</xref>). The insect central nervous system is composed of serially homologous segmental ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Snodgrass, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weber, 1966</xref>). However, the anterior-most part of the brain, the protocerebrum, is of different origin. It stems from an anterior non-segmental tissue dating back to the last common bilaterian ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arendt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rempel, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Scholtz and Edgecombe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Snodgrass, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Strausfeld, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weber, 1966</xref>). Accordingly, a number of neural patterning genes are expressed in the anterior brain anlagen but not in the trunk of animals from vertebrates to insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acampora et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arendt and Nübler-Jung, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arendt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gehring, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hirth et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hirth et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lowe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Posnien et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Quiring et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sinigaglia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Steinmetz et al., 2010</xref>). Conversely, a number of transcription factors that confer spatial identity to trunk neuroblasts (NBs) are expressed in a quite modified way or not at all in the protocerebral neuroectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Urbach and Technau, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Urbach and Technau, 2003b</xref>). A number of profound structural differences distinguish the protocerebrum from segmental ganglia. The former contains unique structures like the optic lobes, the mushroom bodies and is marked by a set of midline-spanning neuropils, the central complex (CX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">El Jundi and Heinze, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pfeiffer and Homberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Snodgrass, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Strausfeld, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weber, 1966</xref>). Further, a process called fascicle switching occurs in the commissure of the brain but not the ventral nerve cord. In that process, some neurites leave their commissural fascicle (de-fasciculation) and join another commissural fascicle (re-fasciculation). Fascicle switching leads to the typical X-shaped chiasmata (decussations) of the central body and is essential for CX development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boyan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boyan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Recently, a molecular subdivision within the protocerebrum was found where an anterior <italic>optix</italic>/<italic>six3</italic> positive region distinguishes an ancestral neuroendocrine center of animals from a more posterior <italic>otd/otx</italic> positive region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kittelmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Steinmetz et al., 2010</xref>). The components and some of their interactions of the anterior gene regulatory network (aGRN) including <italic>six3</italic> and <italic>foxQ2</italic> are conserved within animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hunnekuhl and Akam, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kitzmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lowe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marlow et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Range and Wei, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sinigaglia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wei et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yaguchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yaguchi et al., 2010</xref>). Apart from marking neuroendocrine cells throughout animal clades, this neural region gives rise to the apical organ of marine animals including ciliated cells like the apical tuft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dunn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marlow et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Santagata et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sinigaglia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wei et al., 2009</xref>). It was proposed that the anterior brain of bilaterians evolved by the fusion of an ancestral apical brain with an ancestral blastoporal brain located at the opposite pole of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tosches and Arendt, 2013</xref>). In this model, the ancestral apical brain contained cells for neuroendocrine control and non-visual photoreception and was patterned by the expression of <italic>six3</italic> and <italic>rx</italic>. Based on recent data, <italic>foxQ2</italic> adds to this list of apical markers. The blastoporal nervous system, in contrast, was located at the opposite pole of the animal, performed a sensory contractile function and was marked by the expression of <italic>nk2.1, Pax6</italic> and other genes. Starting from this ancestral condition, the anterior part of the blastoporal system fused with the apical brain to form an evolutionary ‘chimera’ forming the anterior brain of extant bilaterians. For instance anterior and tuberal hypothalamus and the retina of vertebrates were proposed to be of chimeric origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tosches and Arendt, 2013</xref>). However, it has remained unclear to which non-neuroendocrine structures the apical region might contribute in arthropods, which do not have an apical organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hunnekuhl and Akam, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marlow et al., 2014</xref>). Further, the identity of the neural parts representing the hypothetical chimeric anterior brain has remained enigmatic in insects.</p><p>We have been using the red flour beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> as complementary model system for brain development for a number of reasons. First, it represents a more ancestral situation of anterior neuroectoderm development. In <italic>Tribolium</italic> and most other insects including the basal hemimetabolan insects, the brain neuroectoderm derives from a subterminal ventral blastodermal region rather than from the anterior dorsal blastoderm as found in <italic>Drosophila.</italic> This difference in blastodermal geometry results in divergent genetic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ansari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kittelmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nunes da Fonseca et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Posnien et al., 2010</xref>). Second, any profound functional comparison of brain development and function between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other taxa requires a quite advanced toolkit. With respect to transgenesis, misexpression, genome editing, efficient genome wide RNAi screening and other tools for analysis of gene function, <italic>Tribolium</italic> is a genetic model insect second only to <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berghammer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bucher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dönitz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gilles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schinko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmitt-Engel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tomoyasu and Denell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Trauner et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In this work we examined the role of the forkhead transcription factor <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> in brain development because this gene is exclusively expressed in the region patterned by the aGRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kitzmann et al., 2017</xref>). Further, it is a highly conserved anterior patterning gene. Orthologs of <italic>foxQ2</italic> are involved in anterior-most specification of neural cells in many clades of bilaterians and in cnidarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Darras et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fritzenwanker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hunnekuhl and Akam, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leclère et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marlow et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Range and Wei, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Range and Wei, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sinigaglia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wei et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yaguchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yaguchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yu et al., 2003</xref>). A notable exception are amphibians and mammals, where the gene was lost from the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mazet et al., 2003</xref>). In arthropods, anterior expression of <italic>foxQ2</italic> orthologs was described in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<italic>fd102C,</italic> CG11152) and <italic>Strigamia maritima</italic>, a myriapod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hunnekuhl and Akam, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee and Frasch, 2004</xref>) correlating with the location of neuroendocrine cells. Recently, we have shown an upstream role of <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> in anterior head epidermis patterning in <italic>Tribolium</italic> where it acts together with <italic>six3</italic>/<italic>optix</italic> upstream in the aGRN to build the labrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kitzmann et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, an effect on embryonic CX development was noted as well. The two CX neuropils protocerebral bridge (PB) and central body (CB) form partially during embryogenesis in <italic>Tribolium</italic> and some other holometabolan taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koniszewski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Panov, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wegerhoff and Breidbach, 1992</xref>) while in <italic>Drosophila</italic> the first functional CX neuropil appears during pupation. In the ancestral situation represented for instance by the hemimetabolan insect <italic>Schistocerca gregaria</italic>, the entire brain forms during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boyan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koniszewski et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>Tribolium</italic> larvae, the CB neuropil forms a simple bar crossing the midline. Its position prefigures the one of the adult CB but it still lacks columnar structure and subdivision into upper and lower divisions (fan-shaped and ellipsoid body, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koniszewski et al., 2016</xref>). A modification of the shape of the larval CB was observes after RNAi knock-down of <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> but apart from that, functional data on the neural function of <italic>foxQ2</italic> had been missing in any protostome.</p><p>We found that <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> was continuously expressed in anterior median cell clusters from neural progenitors to postmitotic neurons of the late embryonic, larval and adult brains. Based on co-expression with other protocerebral patterning genes we characterized four different types of <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> positive neural progenitor cells. Further, we generated genetic neural imaging lines and found that <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> positive neurons project through the primary brain commissure and later into the upper unit of the central body (fan-shaped body). <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> RNAi-knock-down embryos failed to develop brain midline structures: The primary brain commissure did form but failed to split into the large number of protocerebral commissures. Consequently, the CB formation was abolished. These results identify <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> as one of the key factors of embryonic brain development contributing to the different development of the protocerebrum versus segmental ganglia. Unexpectedly, our results show that cells patterned by the aGRN contribute to the CX, a unique protocerebral brain structure. Apparently, the insect CX evolved by integrating cells from the ancestral anterior-most neuroectoderm, which gives rise to the apical organ including the apical tuft in marine animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> marks neural progenitor cells with four different molecular identities</title><p>In the embryo, <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> is expressed in the anterior neuroectoderm from earliest stages onwards indicating a role in the specification of neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kitzmann et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, we sought to determine which neural progenitor cells (NPCs) expressed <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic>. To that end we generated an antibody specific for the Tc-FoxQ2 protein (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and used an intronic probe of <italic>Tc-asense</italic> (<italic>Tc-ase</italic>) as marker for NPCs, which could be either NBs, intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) of type II NBs or ganglion mother cells (GMCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boone and Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>).

Thirdly, about 12 weakly stained cells were closely attached to the developing commissure at the midline (n = 5; star in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A’</xref>). These cells were Tc-FoxQ2 protein negative at NS13 but could have retained EGFP signal from median cells marked at a previous stage (e.g. dorsal to the stomodeum at NS6; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B’</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>In vivo imaging reveals complex morphogenetic movements of the developing brain</title><p>In order to confirm our view on the morphogenetic behavior of the marked cell clusters we used light-sheet based fluorescence microscopy for in vivo imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Strobl et al., 2015</xref>).

Shortly later, the stomodeum became elongated and bent away towards the ventral side such that the initially adjacent expression domains came to lie on opposite sides of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>).

By subsequent joining of additional neurites from the DM1-4 and other lineages one compact commissure develops. This primary brain commissure later splits and expands into the mature brain commissure, which consists of many midline crossing fascicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Therianos et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Williams and Boyan, 2008</xref>). Subsequently, formation of the CB by de- and re-fasciculation of axon tracts from a subset of these commissures occurs in grasshopper and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boyan et al., 2017</xref>). Given the contribution of <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells to the primary commissure and other midline spanning structures, we asked whether it was required for splitting of the primary brain commissure. In order to test this, we knocked down <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> function by RNAi and stained the knock-down embryos with acetylated tubulin (acTub). We found that the primary brain commissure formed but was slightly irregular at NS13 (compare white arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). This was in line with our finding that <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> positive neurons do not pioneer the commissure but project into it shortly after its formation. Some anterior aberrations stemmed from the previously described loss of the labrum (white arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kitzmann et al., 2017</xref>). In wildtype NS15 embryos, the brain primordium had increased in size by additional fascicles, the primary commissure had split and first chiasmata had formed (white arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Strikingly, this process was not observed in <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> RNAi animals with strong phenotype. Here, the primary commissure remained compact without signs of splitting (white arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). As a consequence, the brain neuropil remained extremely narrow (compare the space between the cell bodies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C’ and D’</xref>, open arrowheads). Lateral to the central body, the basic architecture of fascicles emanating from the commissure was mostly intact (e.g. the formation of three main branches emanating from the central brain (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>)) although it appeared to be built by fewer neurons. Indeed, the number of neurons marked in two imaging lines was reduced (see below). As a consequence, the lateral neuropil area was reduced as well (open arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D’, E’</xref>). In weak phenotypes, commissure splitting had occurred to some degree but the arrangement of fascicles was clearly abnormal (white arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). In summary, <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> function is essential for splitting of the brain commissure and for the expansion of the protocerebral neuropil, which together constitute the central brain anlagen.

Type II neuroblasts were discovered and described recently in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boone and Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Izergina et al., 2009</xref>) and subsequently, lineages with similar properties were described in the grasshopper <italic>Schistocerca gregaria</italic>, which represents the basal hemimetabolan clade of insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boyan et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we assume that both types of neuroblasts exist in <italic>Tribolium</italic> as well although this remains to be shown. Type I NBs divide asymmetrically to form ganglion mother cells, which divide once more to form two postmitotic neural cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Technau et al., 2006</xref>). All neuroblasts of the ventral nerve cord and most neuroblasts of the brain belong to the type I. Type II neuroblasts, in contrast, give rise to intermediate neural progenitors (INPs), which themselves divide in a stem cell-like fashion to form ganglion mother cells (GMCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boone and Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boyan et al., 2010</xref>). This division mode leads to an increased number of cells stemming from one neuroblast. Interestingly, most of the columnar neurons of the central complex derive from type II neural lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boyan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pereanu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Walsh and Doe, 2017</xref>). Unfortunately, molecular markers for reliably distinguishing type I from type II neuroblasts remain to be established in insects outside <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Nevertheless, we suggest that <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> marks both types of neuroblasts. The <italic>anterior-lateral-foxQ2-lineage</italic> might be a type I lineage. First, it is located in a lateral region in the neuroectoderm while type II neuroblasts were found in the anterior median brain in other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Boyan and Williams, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Walsh and Doe, 2017</xref>). Second, within this cluster we see only one <italic>Tc-ase</italic> marked cell with neuroblast typical morphology throughout several stages of development and the cluster eventually comprises a moderate number of neurons (15-20), which is in the range typical of type I NBs. Finally, this group of cells is surrounded by one glial sheet, which is indicative for neural lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Younossi-Hartenstein et al., 1996</xref>). Using both the location and <italic>Tc-ase</italic> staining pattern as criteria, we assume that this type I lineage might derive from the <italic>P-fox-l</italic> neuroblast (number 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I’</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>anterior-median-foxQ2-cluster</italic>, by contrast, is likely built by one or more type II neuroblasts. First, the number of <italic>Tc-ase</italic> positive cells in that region decreased over time (<italic>P-fox-am</italic> and <italic>P-fox-amp</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This would be rather unusual for neuroblasts but would be expected for INPs and GMCs of a type II lineage, which express <italic>asense</italic> as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Álvarez and Díaz-Benjumea, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Walsh and Doe, 2017</xref>). Further, the number of <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> positive neurons within the single glia niche was much larger (&gt;200 cells), which would be in line with type II mode of division. Moreover, the projection patterns into the CX are reminiscent of the one found in embryonic type II neuroblast lineages in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Álvarez and Díaz-Benjumea, 2018</xref>). However, we were not able to unequivocally show a contribution of <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> positive cells to the WXYZ tracts, which were described for DM1-4 type II lineages in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Schistocerca</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boyan and Reichert, 2011</xref>). Hence, this hypothesis needs to be further tested once reliable markers for type II neuroblasts are developed. It would be intriguing to find one regulatory gene contributing to the specification of different types of neuroblasts, which both contribute to the central complex.</p><p>The ventrally located group of Tc-foxQ2 positive NPCs probably contributed to a cell cluster close to the stomodeum, which projected into the circumesophageal commissure but not to the central brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Due to our focus on central brain development, we did not study this group in detail.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>How does <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> function in CX development?</title><p><italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> positive cells are contributing to the CX and <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> is essential for its development. The contribution could affect several stages of CX development. First, the effect could be a consequence of the failure of commissural splitting. In normal development, the primary brain commissure splits into several fascicles, which is the prerequisite for subsequent central body formation. Some neurites undergo fascicle switching, that is they leave their commissure (de-fasciculation) and bridge to another commissure, which they join (re-fasciculation). As consequence, these neurites form X-shaped crossings prefiguring the columns of the central body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Boyan and Williams, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boyan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boyan et al., 2017</xref>). In the absence of commissural splitting, this process and central body formation cannot take place. A putative second contribution of <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> could be to specify the points of fascicle switching. In the late embryonic brain, <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> marks commissures that are located in the region where this process will occur. In this model, Tc-foxQ2 positive neurites could either be the ones that de-fasciculate or they could be required to provide the signal for other neurites to do so. Indeed, we find <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> positive fascicles closely associated with the larval central body. Due to the arrest of development after the first phenotype, the subsequent processes cannot be observed and remain to be tested. Scrutinizing the development of individual <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> positive cells would be helpful. Actually, we have designed our enhancer trap line to expresses Cre along with EGFP. Therefore, once a transgenic <italic>Tribolium</italic> line with a functional brainbow construct is developed, single neurons within the <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> positive clusters can be traced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Livet et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Making the protocerebrum different from segmental ganglia</title><p>Our results show that <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> is one of the regulatory genes required for the development of structures that distinguish the protocerebrum from segmental ganglia. Specifically, it is involved in the unique development of the brain commissures and the midline spanning neuropils of the central complex. We found several protocerebrum-specific functions. First, <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> is expressed in neural progenitors of the protocerebrum but not in the more posterior ganglia. Hence, <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> has indeed the potential of contributing to developmental programs that are specific to this brain part. Therefore, this gene adds to the list of co-expressed genes assumed to specify NB identity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Urbach and Technau, 2003a</xref>). A second protocerebrum-specific role is the contribution of <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> positive neurons to the CX, which is a strictly protocerebral neuropil. Third, <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> positive neurons mark subsets of axons within the early brain commissure ending up in different commissural fascicles after the split of the primary commissure.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Evolutionary relationship of apical organ and the central complex</title><p><italic>foxQ2</italic> together with <italic>six3</italic> and other genes are part of the anterior gene regulatory network (aGRN) in animals and they contribute to the development of anterior-most neural structures. Specifically, they are involved in patterning the apical organ/apical tuft including serotonergic and neurosecretory cells in marine larvae, cnidarians, annelids and sea urchins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leclère et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marlow et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yaguchi et al., 2008</xref>). However, apical organs are usually lost during metamorphosis and clear morphological homologs were not found in neither insects nor vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nielsen, 2005</xref>). However, correlation of the aGRN with neuroendocrine cells was found in animals of all phyla including arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hunnekuhl and Akam, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oliver et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Posnien et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Steinmetz et al., 2010</xref>). It has been proposed, that this aGRN derives from an ancestral apical brain (with neuroendocrine and non-visual light detection functions), which fused with a more posterior blastoporal brain (with sensory-contractile function) to form the ‘chimeric’ anterior brain of bilaterians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tosches and Arendt, 2013</xref>). Unfortunately, the lack of a clear apical organ homolog in insects has hampered the comparison of the respective brain parts based on morphology. Hence, molecular similarity has to be interrogated instead for such analyses. Indeed, it was found before that <italic>six3</italic> and <italic>rx</italic> are required for the formation of central brain structures with respect to the expected neuroendocrine cells but also for other protocerebral structures like mushroom bodies and central complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Velasco et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eggert et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kraft et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kunz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Posnien et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Steinmetz et al., 2010</xref>). The role of <italic>Tc-six3</italic> and <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> in <italic>Tribolium</italic> brain development had been noted but a detailed analysis of the respective brain phenotypes had not been performed and importantly, the projection patterns of these cells had not been studied in any insect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kitzmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Posnien et al., 2011b</xref>).</p><p>In this work we used <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> as a very specific marker for a subset of cells deriving from the aGRN region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kitzmann et al., 2017</xref>). Based on its limited and highly conserved expression throughout bilaterian and its functional interconnection with <italic>six3</italic>, <italic>foxQ2</italic> is likely to represent a specific marker for the hypothetical apical brain. As expected, the cell bodies of <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> positive cells are located in the pars intercerebralis, which is one of the neuroendocrine parts of the brain, being marked by <italic>six3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Steinmetz et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, this is another piece of evidence supporting the ancestral neuroendocrine function of the apical region. Unexpectedly, our data revealed for the first time a contribution of these cells to the brain commissure and to the CX. These represent important non-neuroendocrine structures required for motor control, which would be indicative for an origin from the suggested blastoporal brain with its sensory-contractile origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tosches and Arendt, 2013</xref>). This was unexpected given that cells derived from the apical brain were thought to be mainly involved in neuroendocrine control and non-visual photoperception.</p><p>There are two evolutionary scenarios for the involvement of an apical neural cell to motor control. The chimeric brain hypothesis states that apical and the anterior part of the blastoporal brain fused to form the anterior brain of bilaterians. In the light of this hypothesis, these cells could represent the predicted chimeric cells combining features from both the neuroendocrine apical brain and the motor control function of the blastoporal brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tosches and Arendt, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, this result could indicate that <italic>foxQ2</italic> positive cells evolved novel functions after the apical organ became reduced in the lineage leading to arthropods. In this model, the reduction of the apical organ made the <italic>foxQ2</italic> positive cells free to evolve and they integrated into the evolving CX. Actually, a canonical CX is found only in crustaceans while homology of brain midline structures of other arthropods with the CX remain equivocal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hanström, 1928</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holmgren, 1916</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Loesel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Loesel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Strausfeld, 2012</xref>). A contribution of the apical organ to brain development has been suggested in the annelid <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic>, where the apical organ may provide an initial scaffold for the developing anterior brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marlow et al., 2014</xref>). In the millipede <italic>Strigamia maritima, foxQ2</italic> positive cells located at the brain midline build an early axonal scaffold forming a midline brain structure from which longitudinal tracts project bilaterally into the trunk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hunnekuhl and Akam, 2014</xref>). Based on these findings, we suggest a model, where in a bilaterian arthropod ancestor the apical organ provided a scaffold for subsequent neural development of the anterior brain. In basal arthropods like myriapods, the initially simple midline structure with contribution from the apical organ expanded to form a prominent midline structure, which was still of low complexity. The respective neurons provided a more prominent scaffold for subsequent neural development. In crustaceans, this simple architecture was further developed to build a more elaborate CX, which in stomatopods and insects reached its most complex realization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Thoen et al., 2017</xref>). A comparison of the molecular signatures of <italic>foxQ2</italic> positive cells in animals might be helpful to trace back their evolutionary trajectories.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Outlook</title><p><italic>foxQ2</italic> is one of several genes with an almost exclusive anterior expression in animals. We show its crucial contribution to protocerebrum-specific development. Based on this, it seems imperative that other highly conserved and protocerebrum-specific genes be considered when investigating brain development (e.g. <italic>rx</italic>, <italic>six3, chx, fez1,</italic> etc.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kitzmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Posnien et al., 2011b</xref>). An approach focusing on genes known from the ventral nerve cord might fall short of important insights. Given the rather exclusive contribution of foxQ2 positive neurons, it will be important to determine their individual projection patterns in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Tribolium</italic> in order to map them with identified neurons from existing resources and to determine the degree of conservation. Importantly, our concept of genetic neural lineages turned out to work quite well and opens the way for comparative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koniszewski et al., 2016</xref>). As a basis it will be necessary to systematically compare cell types and markers between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other insects in order to ascertain that orthologous genes mark homologous cell types. Finally, the evolution of <italic>foxQ2</italic> positive neurons provide an interesting study case for neural evolution: From a role in patterning a rather simple structure, the apical organ, they expanded their role in arthropods contributing to one of the most intricate insect brain structures. On the other hand, <italic>foxQ2</italic> was lost in amphibians and mammalians, which is astonishing regarding the usually high degree of conservation of anterior regulators.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene(<italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>foxQ2</italic></td><td valign="top">iBeetle-Base <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ibeetle-base.uni-goettingen.de/">http://ibeetle-base.uni-goettingen.de/</ext-link></td><td valign="top">TC004761</td><td valign="top"><italic>Drosophila</italic> Ortholog: <italic>fd102</italic>, CG11152</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>San Bernardino</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>SB</italic></td><td valign="top">NCBI:txid7070</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>vermillion<sup>white</sup></italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>vw</italic></td><td valign="top">NCBI:txid7070 <break/>for transgenesis, mutant eye color (white) is rescued to black by 3XP3-vw</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>foxQ2-5’-line</italic></td><td valign="top">this publication</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">marks Tc-foxQ2 positive cells with <break/>EGFP;

The detailed annealing and ligation are following the protocol described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gilles et al., 2015</xref>). [3xP3:Tc’v-SV40-Cre-2A-EGFP:bhsp68-eb] was designed as a repair template for NHEJ-mediate knock-in by CRISPR/Cas9. For linearizing the plasmid, <italic>Dm-ebony</italic> target site (gRNA-eb) was cloned into this construct (Addgene plasmid # 124068). Each fragment of the construct was amplified by PCR from plasmids available in the laboratory’s plasmid library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>-table 3) by using primers with overhangs that are complements of two adjacent fragments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>-table 10). The 2A-peptide and the target sequences for cleavage were completely added by primers. Overlap extension PCR was performed to assemble all fragments together. In addition, an <italic>ApaI</italic> and a <italic>XbaI</italic> restriction sites were added in end primers for the following ligation. The entire construct was finally cloned into pJET1.2 vector. The helpler plasmid p(bhsp68-Cas9) expressing Cas9 was a gift from Michalis Averof (Addgene plasmid # 65959).</p><p>Embryonic injection was performed in <italic>Tc-vermillion<sup>white</sup></italic> (<italic>Tc-vw</italic>) according to standard procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berghammer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schinko et al., 2012</xref>). Two gRNAs (gRNA1 and gRNA2) targeting the upstream region of <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> together with the repair plasmid, Cas9 expression plasmid and gRNA-eb were injected. The final concentration of Cas9 plasmid and the repair plasmid is 500 ng/μl each, and gRNA is 125 ng/μl each. The injected animals were separated into male and female during pupal stage. Each animal was crossed to three <italic>Tc-vw</italic> wild type beetles of the opposite sex. The G1 offspring were screened for black eyes. The transgenic beetle was outcrossed with <italic>Tc-vw</italic> wild type and kept as a new stock.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>rx-5’-up line</title><p>The regulatory region including the endogenous promoter sequence of the gene <italic>Tc-rx</italic> was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using primer pairs with restriction sites <italic>BamHI</italic> and <italic>NheI</italic> (for primer sequences see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>-table 10) and cloned into the Dual Promoter pCRII vector by using the TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). The final construct was designed with the following sections from 5´ to 3´: (1) regulatory regions, (2) endogenous promoter, (3) reporter gene. The reporter gene DsRedExpress was amplified from the other construct by using according primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>-table 10). The construct was designed and created in the vector pslfa1180fa.

After one hour of collection at 25°C, embryos were incubated for 20 hr at 32°C. Sample preparation took approximately one hour at room temperature (23 ± 1°C), so that embryos were at the beginning of germband retraction. Embryos were recorded either (i) only along the dorsal axis or (ii) along the dorsal and lateral axis with an interval of 60 min. All shown embryos survived the imaging procedure, developed to healthy and fertile adults, and when mated either (i) with a homozygous <italic>foxQ2-5’</italic> sibling or (ii) with a (mO-mC/mO-mC) homozygous AGOC #6 sibling, produced progeny that was also fertile.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Angelika Stollewerk (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you will see from the reviews below, the reviewers do not ask for any additional experiments as they are happy with the thoroughness of the approach that you took. However, all three reviewers want you to revise the manuscript to make it more accessible, but also to present more background to allow a wider audience to access a manuscript that might appear otherwise esoteric, in part due to the non-conventional system (<italic>Tribolium</italic> is not yet a full blown model organism).</p><p>Therefore, we think that you will need to do a more thorough job in presenting your data, and in particular the comparative context (as precisely outlined in the three reviews). One of the reviewers also believes that you must provide a much better introduction of the central complex and of the whole apical nervous system idea. But new experiments are not required.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript analyses the expression and role of <italic>Tribolium foxQ2</italic>, a conserved developmental gene, which has been associated with the formation of anterior-most neural structures across the animal kingdom. The authors show that in <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> RNAi embryos the protocerebral commissure does not become subdivided and as a consequence the central complex does not form.</p><p>Overall the manuscript is well written. The figures are excellent and support the narrative. The Discussion is concise and puts the main findings into context. However, the authors seem to directly translate knowledge of developmental processes based on studies in other insects (e.g. grasshopper, <italic>Drosophila</italic>) to <italic>Tribolium</italic> (e.g. type I and II neuroblasts, fasciculation patterns; details below) without clarifying that confirmation of similar processes in <italic>Tribolium</italic> are lacking.</p><p>Furthermore, the authors discuss what makes the protocerebrum different with regard to the segmental ganglia and state: &quot;The third and most striking role of <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> in making the protocerebrum different from the segmental ganglia is the requirement for commissure splitting.&quot; This statement is not true. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the two segmental commissures of the ventral nerve cord are initially established as one commissure, which is then split into an anterior and posterior commissure by the migration of the midline glia cells. The commissures are subsequently further divided into tracts along the dorso-ventral axis (again by the midline glia).</p><p>Finally, the analysis of the brain imaging lines would be more meaningful, if the authors correlated the expression with developing brain centers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (General assessment and major comments (Required)):</italic></p><p>This paper provides novel information about the formation of the central complex in <italic>Tribolium</italic>, and the role of the transcription factor <italic>FoxQ2</italic> in this process. The paper makes a significant contribution in pushing forward the detailed neuroanatomical analysis of brain development in <italic>Tribolium</italic>, providing novel tools very useful for the community, and new insights into how the arthropod brain is specified and differentiates. The text is generally well written and illustrated. Comments:</p><p>1) Results, subsection “Marking of the genetic <italic>Tc-FoxQ2</italic> neural lineage by a CRISPR/Cas9 induced enhancer trap”</p><p>How do the medial and lateral domain described here for antibody and EGFP match the three groups of neural progenitors introduced in subsection “<italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> marks neural progenitor cells with four different molecular identities”? Potential differences in EGFP expression should be mentioned in more detail, referring to the three previously described groups.</p><p>2) Subsection “Three <italic>Tc-FoxQ2</italic> positive cell clusters contribute to brain midline structures including the central body”</p><p>From the description it becomes clear that the <italic>foxQ2</italic> Gal4 line remains expressed longer than the gene itself (referring to subsection “<italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> marks neural progenitor cells with four different molecular identities”). The authors should describe this more explicitly. Do the number of lineages that are speculated to form part of the antero-median cluster match the number of progenitors seen earlier (by antibody) in the anteromedial cluster?</p><p>3) Subsection “Three <italic>Tc-FoxQ2</italic> positive cell clusters contribute to brain midline structures including the central body”</p><p>At the beginning of the section (NS13) the authors propose that the anteromedian clusters contains multiple lineages (second paragraph); at the end, based on glial marker, it sounds like that the cluster corresponds to a single lineage (fifth paragraph). Please clarify.</p><p>4) Subsection “Arrest of central brain formation in <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> RNAi embryos”</p><p>The terms/concept concerning the &quot;primary commissure&quot; and &quot;splitting of the commissure&quot; need to be clarified. What exactly is defined here as the &quot;primary commissure&quot;? Up until which stage do the authors call the crossing fibers &quot;primary commissure&quot;? Is it a single bundle, or more than one?</p><p>Concerning the &quot;splitting&quot;: It is not clear how the pattern of labeling, with Tubulin antibody or the <italic>foxQ2</italic>-Gal4, relates to the reality of commissure formation. None of the markers will label all fibers (otherwise, the entire neuropil would be homogenously labeled). There are some fibers/fiber tracts that, at a given time point, will label, whereas others will not (or more weakly). Thus, if one initially sees one single labeled commissural tract, and later two such tracts, separated by a non-labeled &quot;cleft&quot;: this could mean (1) that a single commissural bundle has grown in number of its fibers (because neuron of the same class/lineage successively join the bundle), and then a central subset of its fibers (the first born ones?) have lost expression of the marker; or (2) that there was one bundle which does not change, and a second bundle (from a separate class/lineage) has grown alongside, separated by the first by a non-neural cleft (glial sheath?). These distinctions are important when characterizing the RNAi phenotype.</p><p>It should also be addressed why the &quot;strong&quot; phenotype resulted in such a massive loss of fiber tracts/neuropil. Was the number of cell bodies (e.g., volume of cortex) equally reduced? Would that fit with the fairly restricted expression of <italic>foxQ2</italic> in a few lineages?</p><p>5) Subsections “Analyses in novel brain imaging lines reveals a role for <italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> for different lineages” and “<italic>Tc-foxQ2</italic> function is required for survival of neural cells”</p><p>As indicated above, the authors should address the effect of <italic>foxQ2</italic> RNAi on neural lineages in generally more explicitly. If it is true that lineages outside the <italic>foxQ2</italic>-expressing domain are affected, this would imply some inductive effect of the anterior-median domain onto the adjacent domains. Is there good evidence for that (neuron number; apoptosis..)?</p><p>What is the effect of <italic>foxQ2</italic> on the structure of the CB in the adult? How does the phenotype, described only for the late embryo, evolve over time (or do treated animals die?)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript addresses the contribution of <italic>foxQ2</italic><sup>+</sup> neuroblasts and descending neurons to central complex and brain commissure formation in the beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, using genetic labelling and imaging techniques at embryonic and larval stages. First, to identify <italic>foxQ2</italic><sup>+</sup> neural progenitors, the authors co-stain for the progenitor marker asense via whole-mount in situ hybridization (wmish) and for <italic>foxQ</italic> via antibody (ab) staining. This reveals four groups of cells present from embryonic into larval stages: anterior-median, anterior-median-posterior, lateral, and ventral progenitor cells. For each group of neural progenitor cells, the authors then determine the transcription factor code at embryonic stages: for example, the conserved regional marker <italic>six3</italic> is co-expressed in all but the ventral group, another conserved mediolateral patterning gene <italic>nk2.1</italic>/scarecrow in the ventral, the brain sensory marker <italic>rx</italic> in the lateral group and additional genes <italic>chx, pax6, fez</italic> in different combinations of all groups. Next, the authors GFP-label the <italic>foxQ2</italic><sup>+</sup> neurons with an expression construct using the <italic>foxQ2</italic> promoter. This allows identifying the contributions of <italic>foxQ2</italic><sup>+</sup> neurons to the central complex, and to its various substructures at the level of the anterior commissure including the central body. <italic>foxQ2</italic> RNAi knockdown consequentially disturbs commissure structure and abolishes the central body. Furthermore, in vivo imaging reveals morphogenetic movements that shape the larval brain. Finally, the authors present two new imaging lines that they cross with the <italic>foxQ2</italic> line to further elucidate larval brain development and anatomy.</p><p>The major value of this study lies in the comprehensive assessment of the role of <italic>foxQ2</italic> to development and anatomy of the insect central complex. The central complex is known to receive and process sensory information from the sensory organs, integrate it with activation state and learning experiences, and provide a first level of motor control output to initiate behavior. A new tailored enhancer trap line allows tracing the <italic>foxQ2</italic> positive neurons through embryonic and larval development and reveals contributions of these neurons to central complex, commissural neuropil and central body substructures such as the central body. This alone is a good step forwards in our understanding of insect brain development and anatomy, addressing a so far neglected area that has recently attracted increased attention by insect neuroanatomists.</p><p>From an evolutionary point of view, these data are relevant because the role of <italic>foxQ2</italic> in the formation of apical brain structures appears to be highly conserved in animals but has so far remained enigmatic. (<italic>FoxQ2</italic> is lost in mammals and larval brain development is highly derived in <italic>Drosophila</italic>). Also, the interplay with other conserved apical markers such as <italic>six3, rx, nk2.1, fez</italic> etc. has been barely addressed. <italic>Tribolium</italic> offers a unique opportunity to fill this gap, as it is much more accessible than the fly and shows more ancestral conditions. However, the study falls short of providing new insight into conserved roles of <italic>FoxQ2</italic> in two important points.</p><p>- First, much of the imaging is hard to interpret and understanding for a reader not familiar with <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryonic and larval brain anatomy in detail. Explanatory schemes are provided for Figures 1 and 2 but not sufficiently explained and completely missing from the rest of the figures. To an extent that in most cases it remains difficult to appreciate what the authors are referring to. It would be highly desirable to accompany the majority of rows of panels with explanatory drawings that illustrate what the authors want the reader to see. This can be fixed but required substantial effort.</p><p>- Second, the neuroanatomical comparative context is not sufficiently clear and only briefly discussed in the last paragraph of the Discussion. How does the central complex exactly relate to the evolution of the apical nervous system? What is the central, or fan-shaped body, and what is its relevance for our understanding of insect brain and apical nervous system evolution? Most important, the authors connect this structure to neuroendocrine centres in other bilaterians. What is this comparison based on, in light of known central complex' motor output? The authors 'sell' their work with the statement that &quot;unexpectedly, our data suggests that the central complex evolved by integrating neural cells from an ancestral anterior neuroendocrine center&quot;. This is indeed an intriguing hypothesis, but what cells are they referring to and how does their data support this new hypothesis? As it stands, their hypothesis appears too vague to be convincing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49065.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Overall the manuscript is well written.

Due to our focus on central brain development, we did not study this group in detail.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Three Tc-FoxQ2 positive cell clusters contribute to brain midline structures including the central body”</p><p>From the description it becomes clear that the foxQ2 Gal4 line remains expressed longer than the gene itself (referring to subsection “Tc-foxQ2 marks neural progenitor cells with four different molecular identities”). The authors should describe this more explicitly. Do the number of lineages that are speculated to form part of the antero-median cluster match the number of progenitors seen earlier (by antibody) in the anteromedial cluster?</p></disp-quote><p>Our text was a bit equivocal here. According to our hypothesis, the entire anterior-median group of NPCs belongs to one type II lineage. This explains the pattern of decreasing <italic>ase</italic> positive cells (would be unusual for NBs but expected for INPs). We think that the minor divergence between EGFP signal and <italic>FoxQ2</italic> signal does not influence this reasoning. We now briefly mention this hypothesis in the Results and refer to the Discussion for arguments:</p><p>“Based on the number of observed NPCs within the cluster and the number of projections that emerge from it we assume that it represents a type II lineage (see Discussion).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Three Tc-FoxQ2 positive cell clusters contribute to brain midline structures including the central body”</p><p>At the beginning of the section (NS13) the authors propose that the anteromedian clusters contains multiple lineages (second paragraph); at the end, based on glial marker, it sounds like that the cluster corresponds to a single lineage (fifth paragraph). Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, this was inconsistent. We changed according to our hypothesis that we are dealing with one type II lineage (see above).</p><p>“Based on the number of observed NPCs within the cluster and the number of projections that emerge from it we assume that it represents a type II lineage (see Discussion for detailed reasoning).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “Arrest of central brain formation in Tc-foxQ2 RNAi embryos”</p><p>The terms/concept concerning the &quot;primary commissure&quot; and &quot;splitting of the commissure&quot; need to be clarified. What exactly is defined here as the &quot;primary commissure&quot;? Up until which stage do the authors call the crossing fibers &quot;primary commissure&quot;? Is it a single bundle, or more than one?</p></disp-quote><p>We described better the early development as described in the literature</p><p>“Development of the protocerebral brain commissures starts with the midline crossing of the primary commissure pioneer neurons. By subsequent joining of additional neurites from the Dm1-4 and other lineages one compact commissure develops. This primary brain commissure later splits and expands into a broad field containing several midline crossing fascicles (Therianos et al., 1995; Williams and Boyan, 2008).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concerning the &quot;splitting&quot;: It is not clear how the pattern of labeling, with Tubulin antibody or the foxQ2-Gal4, relates to the reality of commissure formation. None of the markers will label all fibers (otherwise, the entire neuropil would be homogenously labeled). There are some fibers/fiber tracts that, at a given time point, will label, whereas others will not (or more weakly). Thus, if one initially sees one single labeled commissural tract, and later two such tracts, separated by a non-labeled &quot;cleft&quot;: this could mean (1) that a single commissural bundle has grown in number of its fibers (because neuron of the same class/lineage successively join the bundle), and then a central subset of its fibers (the first born ones?) have lost expression of the marker; or (2) that there was one bundle which does not change, and a second bundle (from a separate class/lineage) has grown alongside, separated by the first by a non-neural cleft (glial sheath?). These distinctions are important when characterizing the RNAi phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We have to admit that such basic descriptions are still lacking in <italic>Tribolium</italic>. However, we assume that acTubulin marks most fibres at that stage. Further, this process has been extensively studied in the grasshopper such that we can assume with quite some confidence that the major process is the splitting of an initially compact primary commissure. See description above, which is taken mainly from several Boyan papers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It should also be addressed why the &quot;strong&quot; phenotype resulted in such a massive loss of fiber tracts/neuropil. Was the number of cell bodies (e.g., volume of cortex) equally reduced? Would that fit with the fairly restricted expression of foxQ2 in a few lineages?</p></disp-quote><p>Correct, the cell number was decreased, at least those marked by two of our imaging lines (analyzed in the following section). Some reduced cell clusters were of anterior median origin close to the <italic>foxQ2</italic> cells but other affected cell clusters were outside of that domain. We refrained from speculating about the possible mechanisms due to lack of additional evidence.</p><p>We added a reference to respective results of the subsequent section:</p><p>“Indeed, the number of neurons marked in two imaging lines was reduced (see below)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsections “Analyses in novel brain imaging lines reveals a role for Tc-foxQ2 for different lineages” and “Tc-foxQ2 function is required for survival of neural cells”</p><p>As indicated above, the authors should address the effect of foxQ2 RNAi on neural lineages in generally more explicitly. If it is true that lineages outside the foxQ2-expressing domain are affected, this would imply some inductive effect of the anterior-median domain onto the adjacent domains. Is there good evidence for that (neuron number; apoptosis..)?</p><p>What is the effect of foxQ2 on the structure of the CB in the adult? How does the phenotype, described only for the late embryo, evolve over time (or do treated animals die?)</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in that these are interesting points that we have not been able to address in this paper. We also agree that such an inductive effect would have to be inferred. However, for sake of focus we remained with embryonic development in this study and did not try to find the potentially complex interplay between <italic>foxQ2</italic> knock-down and effects to cells outside the expression domain. These are questions that should be addressed in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] The study falls short of providing new insight into conserved roles of FoxQ2 in two important points.</p><p>- First, much of the imaging is hard to interpret and understanding for a reader not familiar with Tribolium embryonic and larval brain anatomy in detail. Explanatory schemes are provided for Figures 1 and 2 but not sufficiently explained and completely missing from the rest of the figures. To an extent that in most cases it remains difficult to appreciate what the authors are referring to. It would be highly desirable to accompany the majority of rows of panels with explanatory drawings that illustrate what the authors want the reader to see. This can be fixed but required substantial effort.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this important remark. We hope that we do now provide sufficient explanatory schemes. Specifically, we added more explanation to the schemes in Figure 1 and added a reference for corresponding and directly comparable schemes from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos.</p><p>Further, we added schemes to relate the fluorescent signal to the embryonic head in Figure 3 (The other figures show embryos of the same stages). Finally, we added schemes to visualize the embryonic movements shown in Figure 6 and amended the respective legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Second, the neuroanatomical comparative context is not sufficiently clear and only briefly discussed in the last paragraph of the Discussion. How does the central complex exactly relate to the evolution of the apical nervous system? What is the central, or fan-shaped body, and what is its relevance for our understanding of insect brain and apical nervous system evolution?</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the Discussion in the light of the chimeric origin of the brain and speculate about the relationship of apical brain and CX. However, I fear that the data that we contribute with this work do not give crucial additional insights into these very interesting and general questions with respect to CNS evolution. Therefore, we refrained from more speculative inferences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Most important, the authors connect this structure to neuroendocrine centres in other bilaterians. What is this comparison based on, in light of known central complex' motor output? The authors 'sell' their work with the statement that &quot;unexpectedly, our data suggests that the central complex evolved by integrating neural cells from an ancestral anterior neuroendocrine center&quot;. This is indeed an intriguing hypothesis, but what cells are they referring to and how does their data support this new hypothesis? As it stands, their hypothesis appears too vague to be convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to put our idea more clearly in the Discussion. Mainly we discuss two alternative options: chimeric brain hypothesis and de novo evolution of novel functions for these cells in CX formation (see above).</p></body></sub-article></article>
