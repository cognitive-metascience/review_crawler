humans. However, in contrast to Pol II transcription, which has been extensively studied, the knowledge of how Pol III is regulated is very limited. We report here that in budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Pol III is negatively regulated by the <underline>S</underline>mall <underline>U</underline>biquitin-like <underline>MO</underline>difier (SUMO), an essential post-translational modification pathway. Besides sumoylation, Pol III is also targeted by ubiquitylation and the Cdc48/p97 segregase; these three processes likely act in a sequential manner and eventually lead to proteasomal degradation of Pol III subunits, thereby repressing Pol III transcription. This study not only uncovered a regulatory mechanism for Pol III, but also suggests that the SUMO and ubiquitin modification pathways and the Cdc48/p97 segregase can be potential therapeutic targets for Pol III-related human diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SUMO</kwd><kwd>Ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>post-translational modification</kwd><kwd>quality control</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>8P41GM103533-17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aslanian</surname><given-names>Aaron</given-names></name><name><surname>Yates</surname><given-names>John R</given-names><suffix>III</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA080100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name><name><surname>Aslanian</surname><given-names>Aaron</given-names></name><name><surname>Hunter</surname><given-names>Tony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000097</institution-id><institution>National Center for Research Resources</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5P41RR011823-17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aslanian</surname><given-names>Aaron</given-names></name><name><surname>Yates</surname><given-names>John R</given-names><suffix>III</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA082683</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name><name><surname>Aslanian</surname><given-names>Aaron</given-names></name><name><surname>Hunter</surname><given-names>Tony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA014195</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name><name><surname>Aslanian</surname><given-names>Aaron</given-names></name><name><surname>Hunter</surname><given-names>Tony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The SUMO-Ub-Cdc48 pathway is a novel regulatory mechanism of Pol III and a potential therapeutic target for Pol III-related human diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotes have three conserved DNA-directed RNA polymerases (RNA Pols) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roeder and Rutter, 1969</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weinmann and Roeder, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zylber and Penman, 1971</xref>), where Pol I transcribes most of the rRNAs, Pol II transcribes mRNA, and Pol III transcribes tRNA, 5S rRNA, as well as some non-coding RNAs, such as the U6 snRNA involved in mRNA splicing. The Pol III machinery includes the polymerase itself (composed of 17 subunits), as well as basal transcription factors TFIIIA, the TFIIIB complex, and the TFIIIC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geiduschek and Kassavetis, 2001</xref>). In budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, TFIIIB is composed of Brf1, Bdp1, and TBP. TFIIIC is composed of Tfc1, Tfc3, Tfc4, Tfc6, Tfc7, and Tfc8. For 5S rRNA transcription, all three basal transcription factors are required, whereas tRNA transcription only requires TFIIIB and TFIIIC. As important as it is for normal cell physiology, Pol III plays critical roles in pathological processes, such as virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chiu et al., 2009</xref>), tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">White, 2004</xref>), and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Filer et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, Pol III mutations were recently found to cause neurodegenerative diseases in humans. Mutations that cause hypomyelinating leukodystrophy with 4H syndrome occur predominantly in the largest two subunits of Pol III, POLR3A and POLR3B (Rpc160 and Rpc128 in yeast, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saitsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shimojima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Synofzik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Terao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tétreault et al., 2011</xref>), with a few in POLR1C (Rpc40 in yeast) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thiffault et al., 2015</xref>), a subunit shared by Pol I and Pol III. Four mutations in BRF1 were found to cause a cerebellar-facial-dental syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borck et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>How Pol III transcription is regulated is still poorly understood. Current knowledge of Pol III regulation is largely limited to phosphorylation of the Pol III machinery components, such as Maf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moir et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oficjalska-Pham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roberts et al., 2006</xref>) and the Rpc53 subunit of Pol III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Maf1 is a robust Pol III repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boguta, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moir and Willis, 2013</xref>). Upon stress, Maf1 is dephosphorylated and translocated into the nucleus, where it binds Pol III and blocks its interaction with TFIIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Desai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moir et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roberts et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vannini et al., 2010</xref>). Phosphorylation of Rpc53 by the Mck1 and Kns1 kinases also represses Pol III under stress conditions, although the mechanism is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). SUMO is another potential regulator for Pol III that could act as a transcriptional repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neyret-Kahn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rohira et al., 2013</xref>), or activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chymkowitch et al., 2017</xref>), but how sumoylation regulates Pol III is largely unclear. Therefore, deeper insights regarding the regulatory mechanisms of Pol III transcription are needed to design therapeutic tools that can be used to modulate Pol III activity accordingly in human diseases.</p><p>Post-translational modification by SUMO is a conserved pathway and is essential for viability in most organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kerscher et al., 2006</xref>). Similar to ubiquitin modification, SUMO is conjugated to a lysine residue within the target protein through a cascade of reactions catalyzed by a SUMO-specific E1 activating enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnson et al., 1997</xref>), an E2 conjugating enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johnson and Blobel, 1997</xref>), and E3 ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson and Gupta, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Strunnikov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Takahashi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhao et al., 2004</xref>). SUMO proteases are responsible for both the maturation of the SUMO polypeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Hochstrasser, 1999</xref>) and the removal of SUMO from modified proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li and Hochstrasser, 2000</xref>). Sumoylation can trigger ubiquitylation through the activity of <underline>S</underline>UMO-<underline>T</underline>argeted <underline>Ub</underline>iquitin E3 <underline>L</underline>igases (STUbLs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mullen and Brill, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prudden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xie et al., 2007</xref>). Besides ubiquitylation, SUMO can also recruit the Cdc48 (p97)-Ufd1-Npl4 segregase complex, through the SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) in Cdc48 and Ufd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bergink et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nie et al., 2012</xref>). The key to fully understand the functions of sumoylation is its substrates. Ever since its discovery two decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mahajan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matunis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okura et al., 1996</xref>), biochemical approaches have been greatly improved to identify thousands of sumoylated proteins, as well as their conjugation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hendriks et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lamoliatte et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tammsalu et al., 2014</xref>), underscoring the importance of this modification in the cell. However, how sumoylation affects the functions of its protein substrates is still a challenging question that remains largely unanswered, because mutating the conjugation sites usually does not cause any obvious phenotype. To address this issue, a phenotype-based genetic method is needed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A reverse suppressor screen identified Pol III as a major functional target of SUMO</title><p>We designed a reverse suppressor screen in budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, with the goal of identifying proteins or pathways, for which loss of sumoylation results in a phenotype. Specifically, the screen looks for lethal or sick mutations that can be rescued by a dominant Q56K mutation in SUMO (<italic>SMT3-Q56K</italic>). <italic>SMT3-Q56K</italic> is one of the SUMO pathway mutations identified previously in the <italic>mot1-301</italic> suppressor screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and it suppresses <italic>mot1-301</italic> dominantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). <italic>SMT3-Q56K</italic> cells are viable, suggesting the mutated protein is partially functional (data not shown). To perform the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, Materials and methods), yeast cells were first transformed with a plasmid carrying <italic>URA3</italic> and <italic>SMT3-Q56K</italic>, followed by random mutagenesis, and allowed to grow into single colonies. Using the <italic>ade2/ade3</italic> color assay, yeast cells will turn red in the presence of the plasmid. If a clone carries a lethal/sick mutation that can be rescued by <italic>SMT3-Q56K</italic>, the cells can no longer lose the plasmid in order to grow. All cells from this clone will thus maintain the plasmid, forming a colony that is uniformly red. Such colonies will be sensitive to 5-fluoroorotic acid (5FOA), which counter-selects the <italic>URA3</italic> gene on the plasmid. Mutated genes can subsequently be cloned by transforming with a genomic DNA library and screening for 5FOA-resistant colonies. Mutations are then identified by PCR sequencing of the gene locus.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35447.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A reverse suppressor screen using the dominant <italic>SMT3-Q56K</italic> mutant.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A <italic>mot1-301</italic> strain was transformed with <italic>CEN LEU2</italic> vectors carrying indicated genes, then selected for transformants on SC-Leu plates.

First, the screen identified mutations in expected genes, including <italic>MOT1</italic> and <italic>SMT3</italic>. The screen also revealed mutations in <italic>AOS1</italic> (SUMO E1) and <italic>ULP2</italic> (SUMO protease), which was not surprising, as they encode enzymes in the SUMO pathway. Strikingly, the remaining 13 mutations were all in genes encoding components of the Pol III transcription machinery, including the largest two subunits of Pol III (Rpc160 and Rpc128), a TFIIIB subunit (Brf1), and two TFIIIC subunits (Tfc1 and Tfc6). To confirm the screen results, the identified mutations were introduced into wild-type cells, and subsequently crossed with a strain lacking a major SUMO E3 ligase, Siz1 (<italic>siz1Δ</italic>). For example, introduction of the M809I mutation in Rpc160 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and the A704T mutation in Rpc128 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) caused severe growth defects, while <italic>siz1Δ</italic> fully rescued <italic>rpc160-M809I</italic> and partially rescued <italic>rpc128-A704T</italic>, as expected. However, the deletion of the closely related SUMO E3 ligase, <italic>SIZ2</italic>, did not rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Correlating with the growth phenotype, the amount of total tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) as well as individual tRNA species, including mature and pre-mature intron-containing tRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), were dramatically decreased in <italic>rpc160</italic> mutant cells, but were restored to normal levels by <italic>siz1Δ</italic>.

However, none of these mutants have been reported before, so their actual enzymatic defects are unclear. We therefore tested whether previously described Pol III mutations, including <italic>rpc31-236</italic> which is an initiation-defective mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thuillier et al., 1995</xref>), as well as two elongation mutants, <italic>rpc160-112</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dieci et al., 1995</xref>) and <italic>rpc160-270</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thuillier et al., 1996</xref>), could be rescued by reduced sumoylation, and found that all three mutants were rescued by <italic>siz1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Besides these loss-of-function mutations, when expression of wild type <italic>RPC160</italic> was reduced by growth of a strain in which the only <italic>RPC160</italic> gene was under the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter in glucose, the resultant slow growth phenotype was partially rescued by <italic>siz1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We also tested whether human Pol III mutations that cause neuronal diseases, which were introduced into yeast Rpc160, Rpc128, and Brf1 at corresponding positions based on sequence homology, could be rescued when sumoylation was compromised. Among the 17 Rpc160 mutations tested for growth under normal conditions and at elevated temperature (37°C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), two single (Q608K and E1329K) and two double mutations (D384N, N789I and Q608K, G1308S) caused growth defects, which could all be rescued by <italic>siz1Δ</italic>, except for E1329K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

It is surprising that our screen only identified Pol III but not either of the other two polymerases, given the fact that the three polymerases are very similar to each other, with many related subunits and even shared subunits. We therefore first tested if it was due to a specific function of SUMO or simply because the screen was not saturated, by introducing similar mutations into the three RNA polymerases, such as an aspartic acid mutation to the glycine residue in the highly conserved ‘trigger loop’ domain in the largest subunits of the polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fernández-Tornero et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoffmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Identifying both of them suggests that they are either tightly associated with a sumoylated protein or are sumoylated themselves. Indeed, Rpc53 was extensively sumoylated in vivo, and this was largely dependent on Siz1 but not Siz2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), correlating with the fact that <italic>siz2Δ</italic> did not rescue the <italic>rpc160</italic> mutant growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Rpc53 was sumoylated more extensively in <italic>rpc160</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that it may serve as a better SUMO substrate when Pol III is defective. The major sumoylation sites were mapped to K51, K115, and K236, by showing that mutating all three of them to arginines (<italic>K51, 115, 236R</italic>, or <italic>rpc53-3KR</italic>) abolished the majority of sumoylation, and no modification was detected when the N-terminal 274 amino acids of Rpc53 were deleted (Δ2–275) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Importantly, <italic>rpc53-3KR</italic> rescued the <italic>rpc128-A704T</italic> growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), whereas SUMO fusion to the N-terminus of Rpc53 (<italic>Su-rpc53-3KR</italic>), which mimics constitutive sumoylation, abolished the rescue effect of Rpc53-3KR. The SUMO-Rpc53-3KR fusion protein was expressed and functional, as it fully complemented the growth defect of <italic>rpc53</italic> null (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). The rescue by <italic>rpc53-3KR</italic> was partial, suggesting additional modification sites in Rpc53 or other relevant SUMO substrates exist. Nevertheless, these results confirmed a direct relationship between SUMO and Pol III, and suggest that Rpc53 sumoylation can repress a defective Pol III machinery. Interestingly, the human homolog of Rpc53, RPC4, was found to be extensively sumoylated in mammalian cells by multiple proteomic studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that this regulatory mechanism might be conserved from yeast to human.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Pol III is repressed by ubiquitylation and the Cdc48 segregase</title><p>Sumoylation itself is not sufficient to inhibit Pol III and the effect of SUMO seems to be indirect, based on the facts that constitutive sumoylation of Rpc53 did not lead to any growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), and that <italic>rpc160-M809I</italic> could also be rescued by a SUMO protease mutant, <italic>ulp2-101</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which did not abolish Rpc53 sumoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that Rpc53 sumoylation triggers a downstream event, such as STUbL-mediated ubiquitylation, which in turn represses Pol III. Indeed, the full repression of Pol III also requires ubiquitylation, as deletion of either one of the STUbL subunits (Slx5 and Slx8), or the Ubc4 ubiquitin E2 enzyme could all rescue the growth defect caused by <italic>rpc160</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). Furthermore, we could detect a physical interaction between Slx5 and Rpc53 in a yeast two-hybrid assay, which required Rpc53 sumoylation, as the 3KR mutation or the N-terminal deletion of Rpc53 abolished this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

It is thus possible that sumoylation and ubiquitylation of Pol III subunits both occur on the chromatin. Indeed, we could detect an enrichment of Siz1 at tRNA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Interestingly, more Siz1 protein was associated with tRNA genes in the mutant <italic>rpc160-M809I</italic> cells than in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, grey bars versus red bars), suggesting that the recruitment/association of Siz1 with tRNA genes might be triggered/stabilized by defective Pol III complexes. To further test this idea, we induced expression of mutant <italic>rpc160-M809I</italic> from a plasmid in wild-type <italic>RPC160</italic> cells, and asked what would happen when the ratio of defective versus normal Pol III machinery increases in the cell.

These results are consistent with our hypothesis that the association of Siz1 with tRNA genes might be a response to disrupted Pol III transcription.</p><p>Besides Siz1, we were also able to detect an enrichment of Slx5 and Cdc48-3 at tRNA genes, especially in the mutant <italic>rpc160-M809I</italic> cells, similar to Siz1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, D</xref>). Chromatin association of wild-type Cdc48 could not be detected (data not shown), possibly because it continuously disassembles the ubiquitylated Pol III complexes, releasing them as well as itself, from the chromatin. Surprisingly, Slx5 did not require its SIMs to associate with tRNA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), indicating the role of SUMO is not to recruit the STUbL to Pol III. Interestingly, however, the DNA-binding domain (SAP domain) of Siz1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reindle et al., 2006</xref>) was required for its tRNA gene association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Furthermore, the SAP domain was also required for Siz1 to sumoylate Rpc53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) and to inhibit the growth of the <italic>rpc160</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Besides Siz1, the STUbL subunit Slx8 also contains a DNA-binding activity, which was mapped to the N-terminal 163 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2006</xref>).

However, very few of the known sumoylation sites have been shown to have a functional consequence, because mutation of single sumoylation sites or even combinations in a protein usually results in no obvious phenotype. A possible explanation is provided by the ‘SUMO spray’ model, which proposes that a locally concentrated SUMO E3 ligase sumoylates multiple proteins nearby, allowing SUMO to serve as a glue for protein complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Psakhye and Jentsch, 2012</xref>). In such cases, sumoylation on multiple proteins would need to be abolished simultaneously to reveal a phenotype, making genetic analysis of SUMO function more difficult. To address this challenge, we devised, a phenotype-based genetic screen that selects for point mutations in yeast whose growth is rescued only when sumoylation is compromised, allowing identification of proteins where sumoylation has a functional consequence that can then be studied.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>SUMO-ubiquitin-Cdc48 is a new regulatory pathway for Pol III</title><p>We used a yeast genetic approach to uncover a functional relationship between Pol III and SUMO, demonstrating that genetics is a powerful tool to study sumoylation, complementary to the biochemical approach. Performing the same type of screen under different conditions is likely to yield more functional SUMO targets in the cell, and the same principle can be potentially extended to study other posttranslational forms. Our findings support a model where SUMO, ubiquitin, and Cdc48 act in a linear pathway to repress Pol III transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In this model, a defective/stalled chromatin-associated Pol III complex on a tRNA gene is first recognized by the chromatin-associated Siz1 E3 SUMO ligase and sumoylated on the Rpc53 subunit. Rpc53 sumoylation would then trigger ubiquitylation of the Rpc160 Pol III catalytic subunit, and possibly other proteins by the chromatin-associated Slx5-Slx8 SUMO-targeted E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Subsequently, ubiquitylated Pol III complexes are recognized and disassembled by the Cdc48 AAA-ATPase segregase, leading to proteasomal degradation of the Rpc160 subunit, thus clearing obstructed tRNA genes to allow transcription to resume. However, as we were not able to directly detect Rpc160 ubiquitylation, most likely due to technical issues, alternative models of more complex interactions between SUMOylation, ubiquitylation, and segregation machineries in control of defective RNA pol III cannot be excluded. Nevertheless, we showed that this pathway is independent of the Mck1 and Kns1 kinases and Maf1, thus representing a new regulatory mechanism for Pol III. Interestingly, SUMO was recently shown to promote Pol III assembly and activity by modifying another subunit, Rpc82 (Chymkowitch et al., 2017), suggesting that SUMO modification has complex regulatory effects on Pol III. By modifying different components of the Pol III machinery, SUMO may regulate Pol III at multiple transcription steps or in response to various signaling events.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35447.026</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of Pol III regulation by SUMO, ubiquitin, and Cdc48.</title><p>A stable interaction between chromatin and the SAP domain of Siz1 stimulates its activity to modify Rpc53 with SUMO (<bold>S</bold>).

Since mutations in the Pol III initiation factors Brf1, Tfc1, and Tfc6 can also be rescued by disrupting sumoylation, it is likely that a defect in transcription initiation is being recognized. This is supported by the result that <italic>siz1Δ</italic> rescued an initiation-defective mutant, <italic>rpc31-236</italic>. In Rpc160, the mutations T379I (close to the catalytic site), A880T (in bridge helix), and G1098T (in trigger loop) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoffmann et al., 2015</xref>) are likely to impair elongation, suggesting elongation defects might also be a feature recognized by the SUMO-ubiquitin-Cdc48 pathway. Consistently, two previously characterized elongation mutants, <italic>rpc160-112</italic> and <italic>rpc160-270</italic>, were both rescued by <italic>siz1Δ</italic>.</p><p>The next question is, how are initation- and elongation-defective Pol III proteins targeted by the pathway? Our data imply that it is the whole Pol III complex rather than individual subunits that are targeted for repression. For instance, sumoylated Rpc53 was co-purified with Rpc160, suggesting it exists in the complex. In addition, when a mutation occurs in one subunit (e.g. Rpc128), SUMO and ubiquitin are conjugated to different subunits (Rpc53 and Rpc160, respectively), instead of Rpc128 itself, and the mutant Rpc128 proteins did not become unstable (data not shown). It is possible that SUMO and ubiquitin recognize overall conformational changes in the Pol III protein complex caused by a defective subunit, but we favor another possibility that involves chromatin DNA. It is conceivable that initiation or elongation defects will trap Pol III on the chromatin, forming a relatively stable protein/DNA complex. It would be a more efficient way to distinguish defective Pol III from normal Pol III molecules by utilizing the stable interaction between the E3 ligases and chromatin DNA, rather than by recognizing conformational changes. In fact, Siz1, Slx5, and Cdc48 are all associated with tRNA genes, and both Siz1 and Slx8 contain DNA-binding domains that are required for them to repress Pol III.</p><p>The requirement of the DNA-binding activities in Siz1 and Slx8 is somewhat surprising, since no functional consequences have been reported when they are disrupted. Specifically, the SAP-truncated version of Siz1 can still sumoylate PCNA and maintain the DNA-damage sensitivity of the <italic>rad18</italic> mutant, which can be reversed by complete deletion of <italic>SIZ1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parker et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, deleting the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of Slx8 does not affect its ability to associate with chromatin (Yang et al., 2006), or to complement the <italic>slx8Δ</italic> synthetic lethal phenotype with <italic>sgs1Δ</italic>. Therefore, the requirement for DNA-binding activity may indicate a role of SUMO and ubiquitin in a process other than the DNA damage response or genome stability maintenance.</p><p>Unlike the SAP domain in Siz1, the SIMs in Slx5 and the DNA-binding domain in Slx8 are not required for their chromatin association at tRNA genes, suggesting that their main function is not to recruit STUbL to Pol III. Instead, they may provide important docking sites to position the enzyme in the right orientation relative to the substrate in order for it to ubiquitylate a specific target subunit in Pol III. It is thus possible that the STUbL can travel with sumoylated Pol III without ubiquitylating the polymerase until Pol III is somehow trapped on the chromatin, which will allow STUbL to stably bind to DNA and activate its ligase activity. Therefore, Rpc53 sumoylation itself will not be sufficient to trigger ubiquitylation to inhibit Pol III. This is supported by the finding that SUMO-fused Rpc53 did not affect cellular growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), even though the N-terminal SUMO fusion could functionally replace sumoylation on the natural modification sites (K51, K115, and K236) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These results also suggest that sumoylation may not activate Cdc48 directly, but rather indirectly through ubiquitylation. Consistently, the SUMO-interacting activities of Cdc48 and its cofactor Ufd1 were not required for Pol III repression. Our data suggest that Cdc48 may be able to disassemble defective Pol III complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) and remove them from the chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), although how Cdc48 is activated and what cofactors are required for Cdc48 in this case remain to be answered.</p><p>Taken together, we propose that SUMO, ubiquitin, and Cdc48 act in a sequential manner, and that together with the additional requirement of DNA-binding activities, they confer substrate specificity to restrict ubiquitylation, as well as subsequent complex disassembly and proteasomal degradation, only toward transcriptionally defective Pol III, while leaving normal Pol III unaffected. To further test our hypothesis, in vitro sumoylation, ubiquitylation, and Pol III transcription assays with purified proteins are required.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The SUMO-ubiquitin-Cdc48 pathway is a potential target for Pol III-related human diseases</title><p>Given the fact that Pol III, sumoylation, ubiquitylation, and Cdc48 are all conserved from yeast to humans, this new Pol III regulatory mechanism is likely to be conserved as well. In fact, proteomic studies of sumoylation in mammalian cells have identified sumoylated proteins in Pol III, including four Pol III-specific subunits and two subunits shared by Pol I and/or Pol II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hendriks et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lamoliatte et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tammsalu et al., 2014</xref>). By comparison, only three subunits for each of Pol I and Pol II were found to be sumoylated, suggesting Pol III is the major SUMO target among the three polymerases. This correlates with the specific genetic relationship between SUMO and Pol III observed in yeast, namely that <italic>siz1Δ</italic> only rescued mutations in Pol III but not those in Pol I or Pol II. Interestingly, RPC4, the human homologue of yeast Rpc53, seems to be the most prevalent sumoylated protein among all human RNA polymerase subunits, with a total number of 10 sumoylation sites combining all three datasets.</p><p>Mutations in Pol III cause neurodegenerative disorders in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saitsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shimojima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Synofzik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Terao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tétreault et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thiffault et al., 2015</xref>). We showed, interestingly, that the phenotypes caused by a subset of these Pol III disease mutations, when introduced into yeast cells, were rescued when sumoylation was disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). In addition, the fibroblasts derived from a patient carrying Pol III mutations exhibited reduced levels of tRNA (data not shown), as is the case in yeast. It is thus intriguing to speculate that sumoylation, ubiquitylation, and Cdc48 segregase can all be potential therapeutic targets for the neurodegenerative disease caused by Pol III mutations. The next step is to determine if this regulatory mechanism is conserved in humans, by testing it in cultured mammalian cells and mouse model systems. We have shown that the yeast growth assay is a convenient tool to determine which neurodegenerative disease mutations are likely to cause a phenotype and therefore, which should be chosen to create cell lines and mouse models. It is possible to differentiate iPSC lines into myelinating oligodendrocytes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kerman et al., 2015</xref>), and the oligodendrocytes from Pol III patients are expected to display a myelination defect. Alternatively, a cell line can be made to carry a lethal mutation in one copy of a Pol III subunit gene while leaving the wild-type copy under control of an inducible promoter. Such a cell line can be adapted for high-throughput chemical screens for inhibitors against sumoylation, ubiquitylation, or Cdc48, which can not only be used as research tools, but also be developed into potential therapies for Pol III-related disorders or other human diseases involving SUMO, ubiquitin, or Cdc48, such as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kessler et al., 2012</xref>). A genetically modified mouse model will eventually be needed to recapitulate the disease and test the effect of the inhibitors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-HA</td><td>Santa Cruz</td><td>SC-7392</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-HA beads</td><td>Sigma</td><td>A2095</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Flag</td><td>Sigma</td><td>F3165</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Flag beads</td><td>Sigma</td><td>A2220</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Myc</td><td>This study</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-G6PDH</td><td>Sigma</td><td>A9521</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Smt3 (SUMO)</td><td>Santa Cruz</td><td>SC-28649</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>GFP-Trap beads</td><td>chromotek</td><td>gta-20</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Alexa Fluor 680 <break/><break/>Goat anti-Mouse IgG</td><td>Fisher Scientific</td><td>A21058</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Alexa Fluor 680 <break/><break/>Goat anti-Rabbit IgG</td><td>Fisher Scientific</td><td>A21109</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>DyLight 800 <break/><break/>Goat anti-Rabbit IgG</td><td>Fisher Scientific</td><td>SA535571</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>DyLight 800 <break/><break/>Goat anti-Mouse IgG</td><td>Fisher Scientific</td><td>SA535521</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, <break/>recombinant protein</td><td>2x HA peptide</td><td>This study</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, <break/>recombinant protein</td><td>2x Flag peptide</td><td>This study</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial <break/>assay or kit</td><td>cOmplete, Mini, <break/>EDTA-free Protease <break/>Inhibitor Cocktail</td><td>Sigma</td><td>11836170001</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial <break/>assay or kit</td><td>Power SYBR Green <break/>PCR Master Mix</td><td>Fisher Scientific</td><td>4367659</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial <break/>assay or kit</td><td>SuperScript III <break/>First-Strand Synthesis <break/>System</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>18080–051</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM)</td><td>Sigma</td><td>E3876</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>5-Fluoroorotic <break/>Acid (5-FOA)</td><td>Toronto Research <break/>Chemicals</td><td>F595000</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>MG132</td><td>Fisher Scientific</td><td>50-833-9</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>Cycloheximide</td><td>Sigma</td><td>C7698</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, <break/>algorithm</td><td>Excel</td><td>Microsoft</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, plasmids, media, and genetic methods</title><p>The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, respectively.

All media used, including rich YPD medium (yeast extract-peptone-dextrose), sucrose medium (yeast extract-peptone-Suc), synthetic complete (SC) drop-out medium (for example, SC-U), SC-galactose medium and sporulation medium, were made as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rose et al., 1990</xref>). SC-L + 5 FOA plates were made as standard SC drop-out medium, but using 2 g of SC-UL drop-out mix, plus 50 mg of uracil, and 1 g of 5FOA per 1 liter of total volume. For a more stringent yeast two-hybrid interaction signal, 24 μmol of 3-aminotriazole (3AT) was spread onto a 10 cm SC-LWH plate. Standard genetic methods for mating, sporulation, transformation, and tetrad analysis were used throughout this study. In the tetrad analysis experiments, the mutant haploid <italic>rpc160</italic> or <italic>rpc128</italic> strains contain a <italic>URA3</italic> vector carrying wild type copy of gene, in order to maintain the strains. The <italic>URA3</italic> plasmids were lost from the diploid cells on 5FOA media after mating and before sporulation.

Wild type yeast cells are white, while <italic>ade2</italic> mutant is red. <italic>ade3</italic> mutation suppresses <italic>ade2</italic>, so that <italic>ade2 ade3</italic> double mutant is white. Both <italic>ade2</italic> and <italic>ade3</italic> are recessive, so in the presence of pZW321, ZOY261 colonies are red. The starting strain (ZOY261 + pZW321 + pAK12-1), if grown on YPD, does not need pZW321 for viability, so the cells will lose the plasmid during cell proliferation, eventually forming colonies with red and white sectors. The screen looks for mutations that cause sickness or lethality, but can be suppressed/rescued by <italic>SMT3-Q56K</italic> on pZW321. These mutants will appear as uniformly red colonies, because they always need to keep pZW321 for viability. They will also be sensitive to 5FOA, because 5FOA counter-selects against <italic>URA3</italic> on pZW321.</p><p>To perform the screen, cells were mutagenized with 3% ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), washed, and then spread onto YPD plates at 30°C to allow formation of single colonies. Uniformly red colonies were first picked and re-streaked on fresh YPD plates. The clones remaining uniformly red after restreak were subsequently screened for those that are 5FOA-sensitive. The red 5FOA-sensitive colonies could also come from mutations that are synthetic lethal with the <italic>ura3</italic> or <italic>ade3</italic> alleles, as pZW321 also carries wild-type <italic>URA3</italic> and <italic>ADE3</italic>. To reduce the chance of isolating these undesired mutations, two modifications were made. First, an additional copy of wild-type <italic>FUR1</italic> gene was integrated at the <italic>CAN1</italic> gene locus of the starting strain, because <italic>ura3</italic> synthetic lethal mutations are most frequently found in <italic>FUR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koren et al., 2003</xref>).

Unlike wild-type <italic>ADE3</italic>, the <italic>ade3-pink</italic> allele is partially functional, but confers a pink (instead of red) colony color phenotype in <italic>ade2 ade3</italic> background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koren et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, in the presence of pAK12-1, the <italic>ade3</italic> synthetic lethal mutants will not appear as uniformly red colonies, but sectored with red and pink instead. To finally confirm that a strain contains a <italic>SMT3-Q56K</italic>-rescuable mutation, the strain was transformed with the pZW311 plasmid (<italic>CEN LEU2 SMT3-Q56K</italic>), which should render the cells resistant to 5FOA after transformation.</p><p>To identify the mutated gene, a wild-type genomic DNA library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jones et al., 2008</xref>) was transformed into the candidate strains, and screened for 5FOA-resistant transformants.

The genomic mutations were finally confirmed by PCR and sequencing. To summarize, ~80,000 colonies were initially screened, and 740 uniformly red ones were picked and restreaked. One hundred and five clones remained red after restreak, among which 77 were 5FOA-sensitive.

Dried pellets were dissolved in 8 M urea, reduced with 5 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP), and alkylated with 50 mM chloroacetamide. Proteins were then trypsin digested overnight at 37°C. The digested peptides were labeled with TMT10plex Isobaric Label Reagent Set (Thermo catalog number 90309 (lot SK259407) and fractionated by basic reverse phase HPLC (Thermo 84868). The TMT labeled samples were analyzed on a Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo). Samples were injected directly onto a 25 cm, 100 μm ID column packed with BEH 1.7 μm C18 resin (Waters). Samples were separated at a flow rate of 200 nL/min on a nLC 1200 (Thermo). Buffer A and B were 0.1% formic acid in water and 90% acetonitrile, respectively. A gradient of 1–20% B over 280 min, an increase to 40% B over 50 min, an increase to 100% B over another 20 min and held at 90% B for a final 10 min of washing was used for 360 min total run time. Columns were re-equilibrated with 20 μL of buffer A prior to the injection of sample. Peptides were eluted directly from the tip of the column and nanosprayed directly into the mass spectrometer by application of 2.8 kV voltage at the back of the column. The Lumos was operated in a data-dependent mode. Full MS1 scans were collected in the Orbitrap at 120 k resolution. The cycle time was set to 3 s, and within this 3 s the most abundant ions per scan were selected for CID MS/MS in the ion trap. MS3 analysis with multinotch isolation (SPS3) was utilized for detection of TMT reporter ions at 15 k resolution. Monoisotopic precursor selection was enabled and dynamic exclusion was used with exclusion duration of 10 s.</p><p>Protein and peptide identifications were done with Integrated Proteomics Pipeline – IP2 (Integrated Proteomics Applications). Tandem mass spectra were extracted from raw files using RawConverter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 2015</xref>) and searched with ProLuCID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2015b</xref>) against <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Uniprot database (UP000002311 released June 7, 2015). The search space included all fully-tryptic candidates. Carbamidomethylation on cysteine and TMT labels on N terminus and lysine were considered as static modifications. Data were searched with 50 ppm precursor ion tolerance and 600 ppm fragment ion tolerance. Identified proteins were filtered using DTASelect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tabb et al., 2002</xref>) and utilizing a target-decoy database search strategy to control the protein false discovery rate to 1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peng et al., 2003</xref>). Quantification was done using Census (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 2014</xref>). Values were normalized to Rpc160.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and real-time PCR analysis</title><p>ChIPs were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keogh et al., 2003</xref>). Yeast cells were grown over night at 30°C to log phase. Formaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 1% for 20 min at room temperature, and the reaction was quenched by the addition of glycine to 0.3 M. Cells were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline, and lysed with glass beads in FA lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 50 mM <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide (NEM), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors (Roche, catalog # 11836170001). Chromatin was sheared by sonication until the average fragment size was between 200 and 500 bp. 100 μl and 700 μl of crude chromatin samples were used as input and to perform immunoprecipitation, respectively.</p><p>Immunoprecipitation was performed over night at 4°C with anti-HA or anti-Flag agarose. The bound materials were eluted with 2x HA or 2x Flag peptide, followed by RNase A and protease K treatment to de-crosslink. Bound DNA was then purified with the Qiagen PCR purification kit, and analyzed by real-time PCR, as described above. Data are mean ± standard deviation calculated from six data points (two biological replicates and three technical replicates), using the percent of input method. An untagged strain was used as negative control. Statistical analysis of differences between two groups was performed using a two-tailed, equal variance t-test (Excel).The sequences of the primers were listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Gregory Prelich for the SUMO pathway mutant plasmids and strains and the wild type genomic DNA library, Martin Kupiec for the <italic>ade3-pink</italic> plasmid, Michel Werner for the <italic>rpc160</italic> and <italic>rpc31</italic> mutant plasmids, Vicki Lundblad for sharing yeast vectors and equipment, and Jill Meisenhelder for the 2x Flag peptide.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Deborah Johnson (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Regulation of RNA polymerase III is important for eukaryotic cell division and survival, as illustrated by mutations in the RNA polymerase III machinery that have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Little is known about molecular mechanisms that ensure accurate transcription by RNA polymerase III. In this study, Wang and coworkers used a genetic approach to identify sumoylation as an important regulatory mechanism that inhibits RNA polymerase III dependent transcription. Their data suggests that SUMO modification of the RNA Pol III subunit Rpc53 triggers ubiquitylation of another subunit, Rpc160, which in turn leads to Cdc46-dependent disassembly of RNA polymerase III complexes. Inhibition of SUMO-modification of Rpc53 accordingly increases RNA polymerase III activity, thus allowing for genetic rescue of RNA Pol III mutants, such as those observed in human diseases. This mode of regulation was discovered by analyzing rescue of defective RNA Pol III, and thus, might be particularly important to clear stalled RNA Pol III complexes from chromosomes; indeed, this pathway operates on chromatin as shown by the authors. Overall, this is a nice study that uses a powerful combination of genetics and mass spectrometry to identify components of the SUMO-ubiquitin-Cdc48 axis that regulates RNA Pol III. The experiments have been performed well and the results are typically very clean. The findings of this study have implications on how transcription of tRNA genes is regulated in eukaryotic cells, and it might point to new approaches to treat diseases caused by mutations in the RNA Pol III machinery. However, after a discussion among the reviewers, the following three issues need to be addressed before proceeding with this manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to provide more insight into Rpc160 sumoylation and ubiquitylation. One reviewer indicated that Rpc160 might indeed by SUMO-modified, and little data is available to probe its ubiquitylation downstream of SUMO-modification. It would be particularly important to show that Rpc160 ubiquitylation is affected in strains that express the <italic>rpc53-3KR</italic> mutant.</p><p>2) In addition, the authors needs to show more directly how Rpc53 sumoylation and/or Rpc160 ubiquitylation recruit Cdc48, and how this leads to disassembly of stalled RNA Pol III complexes. Binding studies might be helpful, but the reviewers agreed that immunoprecipitations from cells expressing mutant Cdc48 could be very informative (i.e. does this have an effect of RNA Pol III composition?).</p><p>3) Finally, it would be important to strengthen the suggested role of this pathway in a stress response to stalled or inactive RNA Pol III, as discussed by the authors. Are there any growth phenotypes of <italic>rpc53-3KR</italic> cells? Alternatively, are Siz1, Slx5 or Cdc48 recruited to tRNA genes as a response to expression of defective RNA Pol III mutants? Such data would strengthen the physiological relevance of this study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35447.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to provide more insight into Rpc160 sumoylation and ubiquitylation.

In addition, the results in Figure 3A show that the major sumoylated proteins are smaller than 160 kDa, and so we have not obtained any evidence to support a role of Rpc160 sumoylation in this case.</p><p>We tried to directly detect Ub conjugated to Rpc160 both by IP and by immunoblotting, but could not obtain a convincing signal for Rpc160 ubiquitylation. We have tried isolating His-tagged ubiquitin under denaturing conditions in the presence of proteasome inhibitor MG132 in <italic>pdr5Δ</italic> yeast cells that are more permeable to the drug, but still could not see ubiquitylation of Rpc160. The prior study that identified Rpc160 ubiquitylation sites was performed in the similar way, but used an anti-diGly-Lys antibody to enrich tryptic peptides derived from ubiquitylated Lys residues followed by MS analysis. In spite of our negative results, given the fact that the ubiquitylation sites on Rpc160 were previously identified by mass spectrometry, and that mutating three of the sites can stabilize the mutant Rpc160-M809I and at least partially rescue its growth defect, we are confident that Rpc160 ubiquitylation must exist in vivo. Although we did not demonstrate it directly, we believe sumoylation and ubiquitylation function in a linear pathway, because 1) Slx5/Slx8 is a well-established STUbL E3 ligase, 2) Slx5 interacts with Rpc53 in a SUMO-dependent manner, 3) the SIMs in Slx5 are required for Pol III inhibition, and 4) deletion of SIZ1 or UBC4 both fully rescue the <italic>rpc160-M809I</italic> growth defect, suggesting they are not redundant with each other in Pol III regulation. As mutating the three ubiquitylation sites in Rpc160 only partially rescued <italic>rpc160-M809I</italic>, it is likely that additional ubiquitylation sites in Rpc160 and in other relevant proteins exist, which remain to be identified in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In addition, the authors needs to show more directly how Rpc53 sumoylation and/or Rpc160 ubiquitylation recruit Cdc48, and how this leads to disassembly of stalled RNA Pol III complexes.

In summary, our new data suggest that the mutant Rpc160-M809I proteins are largely released from Pol III holoenzyme, as well as from tRNA genes, in a Cdc48-dependent manner, since the associations of Rpc160-M809I with other Pol III subunits and with chromatin can both be restored in <italic>cdc48-3</italic> mutant cells. Therefore, consistent with its segregase activity, Cdc48 may be able to disassemble the Pol III protein complex, as well as to disassociate Pol III complexes from the chromatin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Finally, it would be important to strengthen the suggested role of this pathway in a stress response to stalled or inactive RNA Pol III, as discussed by the authors. Are there any growth phenotypes of rpc53-3KR cells? Alternatively, are Siz1, Slx5 or Cdc48 recruited to tRNA genes as a response to expression of defective RNA Pol III mutants? Such data would strengthen the physiological relevance of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not been able to observe any growth phenotype for <italic>rpc53-3KR</italic> cells, and we think a synthetic lethal screen of <italic>rpc53-3KR</italic> can be very informative, but it is beyond the scope of this study. We did examine the recruitment of Siz1 to tRNA genes as a response to expression of defective Pol III mutants, and the results are incorporated as a new Figure 7B. In this experiment, we placed <italic>rpc160-M809I</italic> under control of the GAL1 promoter, which can be induced by growing cells in galactose media. We found that more Siz1 protein was recruited to tRNA genes upon induction of the mutant <italic>rpc160-M809I</italic>, compared with when additional wild type <italic>RPC160</italic> expression was induced. These results are consistent with the findings in our initial submission, that more Siz1, Slx5, and Cdc48 proteins are associated with tRNA genes, when the mutant <italic>rpc160-M809I</italic> allele is the only source of translated <italic>rpc160</italic> protein. The data suggest that the recruitment of Siz1 to tRNA genes might be a result of defective/stalled Pol III transcription, which is consistent with our protein quality control hypothesis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
