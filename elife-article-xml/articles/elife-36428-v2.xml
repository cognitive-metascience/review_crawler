function and can become dysregulated in white matter (WM) disease. In humans, loss-of-function mutations of <italic>KCNJ10,</italic> which encodes the inward-rectifying potassium channel KIR4.1, causes seizures and progressive neurological decline. We investigated Kir4.1 functions in oligodendrocytes (OLs) during development, adulthood and after WM injury. We observed that Kir4.1 channels localized to perinodal areas and the inner myelin tongue, suggesting roles in juxta-axonal K<sup>+</sup> removal. Conditional knockout (cKO) of OL-<italic>Kcnj10</italic> resulted in late onset mitochondrial damage and axonal degeneration. This was accompanied by neuronal loss and neuro-axonal dysfunction in adult OL-<italic>Kcnj10</italic> cKO mice as shown by delayed visual evoked potentials, inner retinal thinning and progressive motor deficits. Axon pathologies in OL-<italic>Kcnj10</italic> cKO were exacerbated after WM injury in the spinal cord. Our findings point towards a critical role of OL-Kir4.1 for long-term maintenance of axonal function and integrity during adulthood and after WM injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Kir4.1 (KCNJ10)</kwd><kwd>oligodendrocytes</kwd><kwd>neurobiology</kwd><kwd>visual System</kwd><kwd>white matter</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000890</institution-id><institution>National Multiple Sclerosis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FG-1607-25111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schirmer</surname><given-names>Lucas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCHI 1330/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schirmer</surname><given-names>Lucas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P2SKP3_164938/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pröbstel</surname><given-names>Anne-Katrin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007378</institution-id><institution>Associazione Italiana Sclerosi Multipla</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013/B/4</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cordano</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000381</institution-id><institution>Multiple Sclerosis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franklin</surname><given-names>Robin JM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior investigator award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rowitch</surname><given-names>David H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005984</institution-id><institution>Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G.

For example, oligodendrocytes (OLs) maintain metabolic and trophic support of axons by providing lactate in response to sensing of axonal firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fünfschilling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saab et al., 2016</xref>).

We observed that Kir4.1 is localized to both OL cell bodies and myelin, where it is found within the inner tongue of myelin and in AS processes near the node of Ranvier, which appear poised to remove axonal K<sup>+</sup>. By dissecting out early from late developmental functions, we found that OL-Kir4.1 conditional knockout (cKO) was dispensable for early myelin production but resulted in pronounced late onset axonal degeneration with damage to mitochondria in long fiber tracts of the optic nerve (ON) and spinal WM as well as after focal WM demyelination. Hence, our data suggest that K<sup>+</sup> clearance via OL-Kir4.1 channels is critical for sustained axonal function and integrity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>OL-Kir4.1 is gradually upregulated during early postnatal development and shows a peri-axonal expression pattern</title><p>As Kir4.1 channels are assembled as homo- and heterotetramers with Kir5.1, we investigated the expression of both proteins throughout development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hibino et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishii et al., 2003</xref>).

Here, we studied the role of OL-Kir4.1 channels for WM integrity and maintenance in the ON and spinal WM tracts during postnatal development, adulthood and WM injury. Both fiber tracts are composed of long axons that rely on a strong glial support establishing proper action potential propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nave, 2010</xref>). Long fiber tracts are particularly vulnerable to WM pathologies as observed in MS and EAST/SeSAME syndrome, and the anterior visual system comprising the retina and the ON is a common lesion site in MS. Also, the system is easily accessible to precise imaging and measurements such as OCT and VEP to monitor neuro-axonal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ontaneda et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we found that Kir4.1 channels were localized to perinodal OLs and within myelin in juxta-axonal spaces along the ON, suggesting roles of Kir4.1 channels for proper axonal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hibino et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bay and Butt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishii et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kalsi et al., 2004</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first report of a mature OL-associated K<sup>+</sup> channel with polar expression oriented towards axons, i.e. localization at the inner myelin tongue. Because the lactate transporter MCT1 also shows a similar juxta-axonal expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), it is possible that other ion channels and solute carrier transporters are arrayed in a similar way to maintain axon energy, activity and integrity. Thus, we propose that Kir4.1 comprises a ‘myelin nanochannel’. While this positioning is consistent with a role in siphoning K<sup>+</sup> within myelin segments, further studies are needed to confirm this function.</p><p>Our loss-of-function studies identified two temporally-regulated roles for OL-Kir4.1. Using both early-acting <italic>Olig2-cre</italic> or <italic>CNP-cre,</italic> which initiates expression at a later stage, we defined early and later functions of Kir4.1 and ruled out caveats associated with heterozygous effects of <italic>cre</italic> knockin to the <italic>Olig2</italic> and <italic>Cnp</italic> loci . Regarding early developmental requirements of OL-Kir4.1 function, the cKO resulted in somewhat precocious maturation and myelination. This suggests either a direct role in regulating differentiation or indirect effects of altered ion currents on voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in <italic>Kcnj10</italic>-deficient OPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cheli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheli et al., 2016</xref>). Based on observations during development and regeneration, we conclude that Kir4.1 regulates, but is not required for normal myelination. Other studies have indicated early roles for OL-Kir4.1 channels in support of acute axonal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larson et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Secondly, we studied late (adult) functions of glial Kir4.1 and identified a specific OL-related role of Kir4.1 channels for support of long axons of the ON and the spinal WM. Indeed, our data demonstrated that OL-mediated Kir4.1 function was essential in WM maintenance, a function not found in AS-specific <italic>Kcnj10</italic> cKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kelley et al., 2018</xref>). While in principle, loss of OL-Kir4.1 currents can be compensated for by OPC- or AS-encoded Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels, or homotetrameric Kir5.1 channels with PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hibino et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tanemoto et al., 2002</xref>), it is evident that such compensation eventually fails during adulthood in OL-specific <italic>Kcnj10</italic> cKO mice, possibly due to increasing demand for perinodal K<sup>+</sup> buffering during sustained electric activity, such as with physical exertion (rotarod performance) or after (excitotoxic) demyelinating WM injury. Indeed, we found that Kir4.1 (<italic>Kcnj10</italic>) expression increases in OLs during maturation and aging, and consistent with progressive requirements in adults, it has been reported that Kir4.1-mediated K<sup>+</sup> buffering becomes more important during ON high-frequency stimulation and that OL-<italic>Kcnj10</italic> loss-of-function increases neuronal excitability in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bay and Butt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larson et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, mice without AS-encoded <italic>Kcnj10</italic> lack spinal WM tract abnormalities typical of OL-encoded <italic>Kir4.1</italic> cKO mice. Thus, our data parses out the specific roles of OL-Kir4.1 and reveals a new supportive role of OLs for long-term axonal maintenance.</p><p>Overall, our findings suggest a model in which developmental upregulation of OL-Kir4.1 is linked to increasing needs for axonal K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis during adulthood. Siphoning of K<sup>+</sup> is most likely established through an orchestrated action of juxta-axonal and perinodal glial Kir4.1 channels. The ad-axonal expression pattern of mature OL-Kir4.1 channels emphasizes that those channels might have an essential role in K<sup>+</sup> clearance from axons, a function that becomes more critical later in life. However, we cannot rule out other distinct functions of Kir4.1 that are more linked to cell body-associated localization of Kir4.1 and OL-intrinsic functions like differentiation during early postnatal development (see above). Indeed, motor dysfunction and spastic paraplegia are progressive age-related neurological symptoms in individuals with EAST/SeSAME syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cross et al., 2013</xref>), which would resemble features that come with permanent knockout of mature OL-Kir4.1 channels resulting in mitochondrial damage and progressive neurodegeneration. Increased numbers and swelling of mitochondria as well as enlarged axon diameters were early indicators of impending axonal degeneration in OL-<italic>Kcnj10</italic> cKO mice, especially when challenged with focal WM demyelination. Of note, morphological changes of intra-axonal mitochondria have been associated with lysolecithin-induced demyelinating lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zambonin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kiryu-Seo et al., 2010</xref>) and axonal degeneration in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nikić et al., 2011</xref>). In the latter, it might characterize a phenomenon that is reversible and precede ultimate axonal degeneration. Notably, higher seizure frequencies with increasing age might contribute to chronic cognitive and motivational dysfunction in cKO animals; however, it is unlikely that this has a major effect on degenerative changes in long white matter tracts.</p><p>In summary, we identified that OL-Kir4.1 channels are localized to myelin inner tongue and juxta-nodal regions suggesting functions in removal of K<sup>+</sup> commensurate with axonal activity. Moreover, we describe a novel role for OL-encoded <italic>Kcnj10</italic> in long-term maintenance of axons in WM tracts of the CNS. Permanent loss of OL-Kir4.1 channels resulted in progressive damage to axons and ultimately loss of neurons with increasing age. Our findings raise the question of whether similar mechanisms might exist in Schwann cells that serve the myelinating function in the peripheral nervous system. Additionally, our finding might have relevance for understanding mechanisms of axonal degeneration in chronic MS lesions, where KIR4.1 channels are dysregulated and lost during lesion progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schirmer et al., 2014</xref>). If so, dissecting mechanisms of dysregulated K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in chronic neuro-inflammatory conditions could help develop neuroprotective strategies designed to correct local peri-axonal K<sup>+</sup> imbalances.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All mouse strains were maintained at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) specific pathogen-free animal facility under protocol number AN110094.

Briefly, pupils were dilated with 1% tropicamide (Akorn), and mice were anesthesized using isoflurane (Isothesia, Henry Schein Animal Health). Guided by the infrared fundus image, vertical and horizontal OCT scans confirmed that the retina lays perpendicular to the laser. Then, 25 B-scans in high-resolution mode were taken and rasterized from 30 averaged A-Scans using the Spectralis Diagnostic Imaging system with the TruTrack eye-tracker to avoid motion artifacts (Heidelberg Engineering). Automated segmentation was done using the modular imaging software (Heidelberg Eye Explorer). Retinal segments were manually corrected corresponding to the inner limiting membrane (ILM) and inner plexiform layer (IPL), representing the limits of the inner retinal layers (IRL). IRL thicknesses were calculated using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grid with diameters of 1, 2, and 3 mm centered on the optic disc, and exported into a spreadsheet file. Both eyes for each mouse were examined, using generalized estimating equations with an exchangeable correlation matrix and adjustments for intra-subject inter-eye correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cruz-Herranz et al., 2016</xref>).

Mice were adapted to darkness for 5 min before placed in the recording system. The measuring electrode was a needle electrode placed medially in the area corresponding to the visual cortex, the reference electrode was placed under the nasal skin, while the grounding electrode was positioned at the tail root. VEP recordings started 13 min after i.p. injection and consisted of three runs (3 cd·s/m2, 1 Hz, 4 ms, 6500K, 100 sweeps). Mice VEP results in a negative wave, corresponding to P100 in humans, after approximately 75 ms, called N1.

After post-fixation in glutaraldehyde, ON and spinal cord tissue blocks were further fixed in osmium tetroxide at 4°C overnight, dehydrated through ascending ethanol washes, and embedded in TAAB resin (TAAB Laboratories). 1 μm-thick sections were cut, stained with toluidine blue, and examined by light microscopy to assess WM integrity and identify lesions. Non-lesion ON, spinal cord and remyelinating lesion blocks were examined by transmission EM (Hitachi, H600), and g-ratio calculations of axons in the area of interest were calculated by dividing the diameter of an axon by the diameter of axon and associated myelin sheath. Between 100–200 axons per group of 4 animals were analyzed. Briefly, images of transverse ON and spinal cord sections were taken at either 6000x or 10,000x magnification. Digitized and calibrated images were analyzed, and linear regression was used to indicate the differences between <italic>cKO</italic> and control groups in myelin thickness across the range of axon diameters. Numbers and densities of intra-axonal mitochondria per axon area were quantified, and circularities of individual mitochondria were calculated using Fiji ImageJ software (NIH).

Your article has been reviewed by Gary Westbrook as Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. In the discussion of the manuscript, all three reviewers had concerns about over-interpretation, particularly with the EAE component, as well as the claims concerning therapeutic implications. The consensus from the discussion of the reviewers was that the work on disease modeling work should be dropped and the manuscript focused on the interesting analysis of the cKOs by presenting the study with more clarity, removing the speculative cartoons and rescue experiments and analyzing the results with appropriate statistical approaches (see specific comments below). Of note, the impact of an oligodendrocyte-specific knockout of Kir4.1 on the integrity of myelin is likely to be small is a concern that is further supported by the recent study of Bergles et al., 2018 observing no differences in myelination in the corpus callosum in oligodendrocyte-specific Kir4.1cKO.</p><p>We expect that the changes to your manuscript would require substantial restructuring, and thus we are not able to consider the manuscript in its current form. However, if you decide to address these general issues as above, and the relevant specific comments in the original reviews below, we would be glad to consider a revised and resubmitted manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is an important and very timely study building further on previous studies of some of the same authors (Schirmer et al., 2014, Srivastava et al., 2012) in which Kir4.1 autoantibodies were identified in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Here, the authors provide an extensive in vivo, ultrastructural and immunofluorescence study of Kir4.1 in the optic nerve (ON), both in progressive MS and in a mouse model of demyelination using conditional Kir4.1 knockouts. They reveal Kir4.1 expression both in the oligodendrocyte cell body and in the myelin sheath based on high-pressure freeze immuno-EM, which is new and exciting. They conclude that long-term impairments of OL Kir4.1 mediate axonal damage and myelin degradation. This part of the work is carefully performed and illustrated by (sometimes excessive) quantification but the second part has major problems.</p><p>1) The claim that Kir4.1 represents a therapeutic target (as the title mentions) is not supported by the experiments shown from subsection “Retigabine-induced activation of Kv7.2 channels protects against neurodegeneration in aging <italic>Kir4.1</italic> cKO animals” and onwards. Retigabine (Ezogabine in the US) is not targeting the Kir4.1 channel and neither is it demonstrated to have a convergent action at the glial and neuronal K<sup>+</sup> gradients as the authors postulate in their cartoons (Figure 2A and Figure 5A). On the contrary, ezogabine is likely to cause a greater extracellular K<sup>+</sup> accumulation outside of the demyelinated axons and within or around intact internodes and nodes of Ranvier. There is no opening of an additional gate for K<sup>+</sup> to mitigate the lack of Kir4.1 activity in the cKO mice. There are more errors. For example, there is no evidence that ezogabine shunts the nodal action potential waveform (e.g. Schwartz et al., 2006). A more likely explanation for the partial neuroprotective action of ezogabine is the concomitant reduction in hyperexcitability. Similar protective effects on axon integrity have been observed with the sodium channel blocker phenytoin (Black et al., 2006). Such methodologies are, however, not providing evidence that Kir4.1 is an effective therapeutic target.</p><p>2) If the authors wish to demonstrate that Kir4.1 is a specific &quot;therapeutic target&quot; they will need to develop and test the rescue potential of Kir4.1 openers. In the absence of these, my current recommendation is to remove the entire ezogabine part from the manuscript and focus on the in vivo and in vitro findings in the conditional Kir4.1 knockout model. This is a huge amount of high quality data. On the other hand, if the aim is to show the neuroprotective action of ezogabine in MS and propose a repurposing of the drug, there is the need to show immunofluorescence of Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 expression in the ON in demyelinating neuropathies or MS models</p><p>3) It remains unclear to me which subcellular sites contribute to the neuropathology in cKO of Kir4.1. That OL cell bodies with Kir4.1 channels are localized to perinodal domains (Figure 2F-G) is not clear from the data but the assumptions widely propagate throughout the manuscript, mainly in cartoon form. But how is the distribution along the myelin sheath different from random and what are the data to support such claim? What are the distinct contributions of cell body Kir4.1 and myelin sheath Kir4.1 to the neuropathology?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Overall this an excellent study by Schirmer and colleagues that contains an impressive amount of convincing experiments and state of the art analyses to comprehensively characterize the role of oligodendroglial Kir4.1 during development, adulthood and in demyelinating diseases.</p><p>My only major concerns are with the EAE experiment shown in Figure 6 and they relate to the following two aspects:</p><p>1) The clinical course shown in Figure 1B shows a very mild disease course with an average maximal score of 1 in Sal treated mice (corresponding to a limp tail). As the authors also state that for the Sal-RTG group treatment was only started when an EAE score of 2 was reached – this seems nearly incompatible with the data shown here (max group score of 0.5, assuming that the scale is correct). I would suggest to separately analyse the effect on disease incidence (very unlikely to be influenced by a neuroprotective interventions) and the effect on the disease course of those mice that actually develop clinical signs. To show a protective effect of the Sal-RTG vs. Sal-Sal treatment it would e.g. be important to plot those presumably matched mice treated with either Sal-RTG or Sal-Sal aligned to the start of treatment (so the time when these mice have first reached a score of 2).</p><p>2) The argument for a primary neuroprotective effect is that neurons and/or axons are preserved, while no effect on the immune response is observed. This argument is difficult to make based on the data presented here – at least the Sal-RTG group does not appear to show histological protection of axons or RGCs. Such protection is observed in the RTG only group however only one immune parameters is analysed here (microglia number is not significantly changed in 5 mice examined – given that the effect size of RTG on microglia number is similar to the effect size on axons and neurons this could also be the result of a the substantially higher variability in this outcome parameter).</p><p>In summary to me the claim that RTG is neuroprotective in EAE is the one claim in the manuscript that is currently not sufficiently supported by the data presented here. As this is an important claim for the entire manuscript I would suggest to increase the number of animals in particular in the Sal-RTG vs Sal-Sal group (so treatment only started at an EAE score of 2 with randomization to either RTG or Sal) and analyse both the clinical score as well as the axonal pathology and parameters of adaptive and innate immune cell infiltration in the lesions in a larger number of mice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Schirmer et al., explore the role of Kir4.1, a disease-linked inward rectifying potassium channel in oligodendrocytes (OLs), both in the maintenance of axonal integrity and as a potential therapeutic target for multiple sclerosis. The authors find that conditional deletion of Kir4.1 in OLs or OL precursor cells leads to relatively modest defects in OL differentiation and myelination during development. However, as mice age, OL-specific Kir4.1 loss leads to reduced optic nerve function, fewer RGC neurons, some mitochondrial structural abnormalities, motor defects, and early death, supporting an OL-intrinsic function in maintaining axonal integrity. Finally, the authors provide evidence that administration of retigabine (RTG, to open axonal Kv7.2 channels and presumably help buffer extracellular potassium) ameliorates some of the negative effects of Kir4.1 loss in knockout mice or in the EAE mouse model of multiple sclerosis.</p><p>Overall the paper is technically rigorous and gives definitive proof that OL-intrinsic Kir4.1 expression is important for function and survival of axons in adult mice, rather than for myelination per se. The weaker part of the story is the disease modeling aspect which is more preliminary and would be improved by additional analysis. Specific points:</p><p>1) Throughout the paper, the authors should have performed their statistical analyses using the average measurement for each animal used in the study, rather than on every individual measurement taken. For example, in Figure 2K, statistical analyses on g-ratio seem to have been performed comparing hundreds of axons measured, artificially increasing statistical significance. Same is true for mitochondrial and axonal morphology measurements. Since effect sizes are often very small, it is likely that there is no real statistical or biologically relevant difference between many of these conditions that the authors consider significant.</p><p>2) In Figure 1 the authors show that Kir4.1 is reduced in demyelinating lesions. Since Kir4.1 is expressed by mature OLs, does this just reflect loss of mature OLs rather than a specific downregulation of Kir4.1? The plot of MOG (mature OLG marker) versus Kir4.1 in Figure 1E is consistent with this idea.</p><p>3) Figure 4: Lysolecithin experiments. The authors conclude that &quot;Kir4.1 is required for white matter integrity after injury&quot; but the data do not robustly support this conclusion. Kir4.1 knockouts have mildly *better* remyelination, consistent with the accelerated differentiation/myelination seen developmentally. There is no data presented on axon degeneration for these experiments, only plots of axon and mitochondrial morphology, all of which suffer from very small effect sizes and inappropriate statistics to suggest these effects are significant (see above point about statistical analysis). The authors state that there is evidence for Wallerian degeneration in Figure 4G but this is just a single TEM micrograph with no quantitative support of this conclusion. I think the paper would be stronger without this set of experiments.</p><p>4) In Figure 5 (text in subsection “Retigabine-induced activation of Kv7.2 channels protects against neurodegeneration in aging Kir4.1 cKO animals”), the authors conclude that &quot;RTG-induced activation of Kv7.2 channels protects against neurodegeneration in aging Kir4.1 cKO animals.&quot; Therefore, the essential statistical comparison to make is between the groups of mice that were knocked out for Kir 4.1 that either received saline or RTG. The authors do not make this key comparison in their statistical analysis that would support their conclusion, but instead offer statistics for less relevant comparisons (e.g. showing that CKOs treated with saline are statistically different than WT mice treated with RTG is not relevant to the authors' conclusion.)</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Oligodendrocyte-encoded Kir4.1 function is required for axon integrity and long-term maintenance&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Here, the authors provide an extensive in vivo, ultrastructural and immunofluorescence study of Kir4.1 in the optic nerve (ON), both in progressive MS and in a mouse model of demyelination using conditional Kir4.1 knockouts. They reveal Kir4.1 expression both in the oligodendrocyte cell body and in the myelin sheath based on high-pressure freeze immuno-EM, which is new and exciting. They conclude that long-term impairments of OL Kir4.1 mediate axonal damage and myelin degradation. This part of the work is carefully performed and illustrated by (sometimes excessive) quantification but the second part has major problems.</p><p>1) The claim that Kir4.1 represents a therapeutic target (as the title mentions) is not supported by the experiments shown from subsection “Retigabine-induced activation of Kv7.2 channels protects against neurodegeneration in aging Kir4.1 cKO animals” and onwards. Retigabine (Ezogabine in the US) is not targeting the Kir4.1 channel and neither is it demonstrated to have a convergent action at the glial and neuronal K<sup>+</sup> gradients as the authors postulate in their cartoons (Figure 2A and Figure 5A). On the contrary, ezogabine is likely to cause a greater extracellular K<sup>+</sup> accumulation outside of the demyelinated axons and within or around intact internodes and nodes of Ranvier. There is no opening of an additional gate for K<sup>+</sup> to mitigate the lack of Kir4.1 activity in the cKO mice. There are more errors. For example, there is no evidence that ezogabine shunts the nodal action potential waveform (e.g. Schwartz et al., 2006). A more likely explanation for the partial neuroprotective action of ezogabine is the concomitant reduction in hyperexcitability. Similar protective effects on axon integrity have been observed with the sodium channel blocker phenytoin (Black et al., 2006). Such methodologies are, however, not providing evidence that Kir4.1 is an effective therapeutic target.</p></disp-quote><p>We take the reviewer’s point and based on this suggestion and similar advice from the editor and other reviewers we have removed this data, which will be augmented for an independent study. The suggestions above for additional endpoints and potential mechanisms are helpful and will be pursued in this future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) If the authors wish to demonstrate that Kir4.1 is a specific &quot;therapeutic target&quot; they will need to develop and test the rescue potential of Kir4.1 openers. In the absence of these, my current recommendation is to remove the entire ezogabine part from the manuscript and focus on the in vivo and in vitro findings in the conditional Kir4.1 knockout model. This is a huge amount of high quality data. On the other hand, if the aim is to show the neuroprotective action of ezogabine in MS and propose a repurposing of the drug, there is the need to show immunofluorescence of Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 expression in the ON in demyelinating neuropathies or MS models</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we removed the data on retigabine (ezogabine) as a pharmacological model to improve function in Kir4.1 cKO animals and focused on characterizing the Kir4.1 knockout model during development/aging and white matter injury.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It remains unclear to me which subcellular sites contribute to the neuropathology in cKO of Kir4.1.

Also, we included statistics on counts for intra-axonal mitochondria per axon versus mitochondrial densities in situations where axons are pathologically enlarged such as chronic lysolecithin lesions (cf. Figure 5) and cited additional references (Kiryu-Seo et al., 2010 and Zambonin et al., 2011) to emphasize increase in intraaxonal mitochondria densities and stationary mitochondrial size in remyelination and lysolecithin-mediated white matter injury (Discussion section) (Kiryu-Seo et al., 2010; Zambonin et al., 2011).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1 the authors show that Kir4.1 is reduced in demyelinating lesions.

We think this is not the case in acute lesions where KIr4.1 becomes downregulated. Also, our loss-of-function studies show that Kir4.1 function is not needed to re-myelinate focal white matter lesions. So, in the acute lesions our conclusion is that Kir4.1 downregulation precedes loss of OLs. However, we do agree with the reviewer about the links in chronic demyelinated lesions that leads to a loss of OLs. Note that because OPCs express little Kir4.1 it is formally possible that OPC differentiation is blocked resulting in Kir4.1 lack of expression. As we removed translational aspects on MS and EAE in the current revised manuscript, we decided not to comment on this issue in the paper but will follow-up on the issue in a follow-up study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 4: Lysolecithin experiments.
