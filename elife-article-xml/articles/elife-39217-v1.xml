To improve our understanding of the molecular alterations that underlie deadly malignancies, we analyzed the genomic profiles of 17,879 tumors from patients with known outcomes. We find that mutations in almost all cancer driver genes contain remarkably little information on patient prognosis. However, CNAs in these same driver genes harbor significant prognostic power. Focal CNAs are associated with worse outcomes than broad alterations, and CNAs in many driver genes remain prognostic when controlling for stage, grade, <italic>TP53</italic> status, and total aneuploidy. By performing a meta-analysis across independent patient cohorts, we identify robust prognostic biomarkers in specific cancer types, and we demonstrate that a subset of these alterations also confer specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. In total, our analysis establishes a comprehensive resource for cancer biomarker identification and underscores the importance of gene copy number profiling in assessing clinical risk.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39217.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancers are not created equal: even when the disease affects the same organ, it can run different courses between individuals. For example, amongst people with early-stage bowel cancer who undergo surgery, 60% will go on to live cancer-free but the remaining patients will see the illness come back within a few years. These differences in outcome are still poorly understood, but they may find their roots in the genetic changes present in tumor cells.</p><p>Comparing the genomes of healthy and cancerous cells can help to understand which genetic modifications makes a cell go ‘rogue’ and start to multiply uncontrollably. Often, this happens because of a mutation, a change in the letters that compose our genetic code. However, looking at genetic differences between cancerous cells from different patients, or different tumors, can shed light on how certain genetic changes make the disease deadlier or more likely to reoccur.</p><p>Smith and Sheltzer looked into the genomes of 17,879 tumors from patients whose clinical information was also available. The analysis revealed that specific genetic alterations were more common in either deadly or treatable cancers. Most of these changes were not mutations that affected a few DNA letters; instead, they were copy number alterations, whereby large portions of the genetic code are being repeated or deleted. These results suggest that while mutations certainly drive the development of the disease, other changes such as copy number alterations can tell us which cancers will be deadlier. Through this approach, Smith and Sheltzer were also able to identify copy number alterations that were associated with patients responding well to certain drugs.</p><p>These findings now need to be confirmed on a different set of data. If they hold, new technologies may be developed so that the approach can be used cheaply and easily in the clinic. Ultimately, being able to examine copy number alterations in tumors may help physicians to tailor treatment for a particular cancer, or even a specific tumor.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>biomarkers</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>prognosis</kwd><kwd>aneuploidy</kwd><kwd>copy number alterations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP5OD021385</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sheltzer</surname><given-names>Jason M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001513</institution-id><institution>Breast Cancer Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Young Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sheltzer</surname><given-names>Jason M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013356</institution-id><institution>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSHL-Northwell Translational Cancer Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sheltzer</surname><given-names>Jason M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Gene copy number provides more prognostic information than gene mutation status in cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancers that arise from the same tissue can exhibit vast differences in clinical behavior. For instance, among individuals diagnosed with early-stage colorectal cancer, about 60% of patients will be cured by surgery alone, while the remaining 40% will experience a recurrence that is frequently fatal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mäkelä et al., 1995</xref>). Various pathological and molecular biomarkers are typically analyzed in order to assess patient risk and aid clinical decision-making. In general, these biomarkers are divided into two classes: <italic>predictive</italic> and <italic>prognostic</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nalejska et al., 2014</xref>). Predictive biomarkers identify patients who are likely to respond to specific therapies, like the <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations that sensitize lung tumors to EGFR inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paez et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, prognostic biomarkers provide information on cancer aggressiveness and the likelihood of patient death. Tumor de-differentiation and lymph-node infiltration serve as prototypical prognostic biomarkers due to their strong association with poor outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Connolly et al., 2003</xref>). Yet, these pathology-based biomarkers can suffer from low levels of inter-observer concordance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allsbrook et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coons et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Elmore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gilks et al., 2013</xref>), and even perfect pathological assessment yields incomplete information on a patient’s most likely clinical course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bijker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nofech-Mozes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Young, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zaniboni et al., 2004</xref>). New methods to identify aggressive tumors could lead to improvements in the stratification of patient risk, better clinical management, and a decrease in dangerous and unnecessary over-treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Esserman et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Advances in high-throughput technologies have yielded unprecedented insight into the diverse array of genomic changes found within every cancer cell. Projects like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) have characterized methylation, mutation, copy number, and gene expression patterns across cancer types. As a result of these studies, many of the genomic differences between normal and transformed cells have been identified and characterized. However, we lack a similar understanding of the genomic differences between indolent tumors and aggressive malignancies. As the cost of DNA sequencing continues to drop, it has become increasingly feasible for hospitals to implement routine targeted and/or genome-wide analyses of patient tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gagan and Van Allen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sholl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zehir et al., 2017</xref>). But, while several DNA-based, therapy-specific predictive biomarkers have been discovered, the prognostic information contained within tumor genomes is much less clear.</p><p>Previous genome-wide efforts to discover novel prognostic biomarkers have largely focused on the gene expression changes associated with patient mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anaya, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anaya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gentles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Uhlen et al., 2017</xref>). These studies have identified a set of transcripts that encode proteins involved in cell cycle progression that correlate with recurrence and death in several cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cuzick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dancik and Theodorescu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gentles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mosley and Keri, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Venet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wistuba et al., 2013</xref>). Comparatively less is known about how changes at the DNA level affect patient survival. Outcome-associated analyses of genetic mutations have predominantly been conducted on a limited number of known oncogenes from single cancer types and have come to divergent conclusions. Reports in the literature commonly suggest that mutations in driver oncogenes are associated with poor outcomes, including, for instance, <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations in lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Guan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marabese et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sun et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oshiro et al., 2015</xref>), and <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations in colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Richman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tol et al., 2009</xref>). Other studies of the same genes in the same cancer types have failed to observe any significant associations with outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bozhanov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gonzalez-Angulo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hutchins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Scoccianti et al., 2012</xref>). In general, mutation-based biomarker studies may be confounded by small samples sizes, post-hoc hypothesis testing, imprecise clinical endpoints, and the so-called ‘file drawer’ problem, in which negative findings are less likely to be published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aronson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ensor, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goossens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rosenthal, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Scargle, 1999</xref>). The prognostic information captured by sequencing driver oncogenes remains unknown, and a pan-cancer, exome-wide analysis of outcome-associated mutations has not been conducted.</p><p>Previous investigations into the prognostic importance of DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) have indicated that highly-aneuploid tumors tend to have worse outcomes than diploid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Friedlander et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kallioniemi et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kokal et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Merkel and McGuire, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zimmerman et al., 1987</xref>). However, these analyses have largely focused either on arm-length changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davoli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roy et al., 2016</xref>) or on alterations that affect single oncogenes or tumor suppressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deming et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Srividya et al., 2011</xref>). The functional importance of copy number changes in most genes at the single-gene level is unknown, and a pan-cancer, gene-by-gene analysis of prognostic copy number alterations has not been conducted. In order to gain a global understanding of the genomic features in a primary tumor that influence cancer prognosis, we collected and analyzed molecular profiles from a ‘discovery’ set of 9442 patients and a ‘validation’ set of 8618 patients with solid tumors. Our comprehensive, gene-centric analysis sheds light on the genomic changes that drive aggressive disease and will provide a useful resource for the development of strategies to improve clinical risk assessment. Additionally, we provide a web portal to facilitate community access to this rich biomarker dataset at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://survival.cshl.edu">http://survival.cshl.edu</ext-link>.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>A cross-platform, pan-cancer analysis of cancer survival data</title><p>To determine the differences between benign and fatal tumors, we first analyzed multiple classes of genomic data from 9442 patients with 16 types of cancer from the TCGA (outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; abbreviations are defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). For every tumor type and every dataset, we generated Cox univariate proportional hazards models linking the presence or expression of a particular feature with clinical outcome (described in Supplemental Text 1). We report the Z score for each model, which encodes both the directionality and significance of a particular association. If the presence of a mutation or copy number amplification is significantly associated with patient death, then a Z score &gt;1.96 corresponds to a P value &lt; 0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). In contrast, a Z score less than −1.96 indicates that the presence of a mutation is associated with survival or that a gene deletion is significantly associated with patient death.</p><p>We extracted mutation, copy number, gene expression, and clinical information from 16 TCGA cohorts (summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and discussed in additional detail in Supplemental Text 2). To assess the validity of our data analysis pipeline, as well as the accuracy of the reported patient annotations, we first examined the overall survival curves for the 16 tumor types that we profiled. As expected, we observed significant differences in clinical outcome according to a cancer’s tissue-of-origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Prostate cancer had the least aggressive clinical course, with a median survival time that was not reached in this dataset (&gt;4600 days), while pancreatic cancer conferred the worst prognosis (median survival time: 444 days). Overall, the 5 year survival frequencies of patients in the TCGA were highly similar to the national averages reported by NCI-SEER (R = 0.83, p &lt; 0.0001), suggesting that the patients included in this analysis are broadly representative of the general population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Next, we inferred patient sex on the basis of chromosome-specific gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gentles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van den Berge and Sijen, 2017</xref>).

We extracted non-silent mutations in each tumor, and then we identified all genes that were mutated in ≥2% of patients in each of the 16 cohorts (discussed in Supplemental Text 1). We next performed Cox proportional hazards analysis to compare the survival times for patients harboring mutant or wild-type copies of each gene. This analysis uncovered very few mutations that were significantly associated with patient outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2A-B</xref>).

To test this, we identified the 30 most-frequently mutated amino acid positions in the TCGA cohorts, and then asked whether patients harboring these alterations had different outcomes than those who did not. IDH1<sup>c132</sup> mutations were significantly associated with a favorable prognosis in glioma, but other recurrently-mutated codons (KRAS<sup>c12</sup>, PIK3CA<sup>c1047</sup>, TP53<sup>c273</sup>, etc.) were largely uninformative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A–D</xref>). Then, we identified ‘hotspot’ residues that were mutated in at least five different patients across all cohorts. Considering only these ‘hotspot’ mutations in each gene also failed to uncover robust survival associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4E</xref>). Finally, we identified cancer type-specific recurrent mutations, but these alterations (FGFR3<sup>c249</sup> in BLCA, CTNNB1<sup>c37</sup> in UCEC, etc.) were similarly uninformative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4F</xref>).</p><p>Next, we sought to test whether the use of targeted therapies had blunted the deleterious effects of certain driver mutations (e.g., in <italic>BRAF</italic> or <italic>EGFR</italic>). However, due to the time-frame of sample collection, very few patients were treated with BRAF or EGFR inhibitors, and removing those patients who had received these therapies failed to significantly affect Z scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Hyper-mutation within a subset of cancers could increase mutational ‘noise’ and decrease our ability to identify prognostic signatures, but excluding patients with hyper-mutated tumors had minimal effect on the prognostic significance of driver gene mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2C</xref>). We then asked whether the presence of mutations in multiple cancer driver genes might cooperate to confer a worse clinical outcome. We found that, in general, patients harboring mutations in two cancer driver genes that were not prognostic alone had the same risk of death as patients with wild-type copies of one or both genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C</xref>). Lastly, we considered the possibility that the clonality of a mutation might affect its prognostic significance. We calculated the variant allele frequency (VAF) for each cancer mutation and tested whether mutations present at clonal levels in single tumors were more likely to be associated with outcome. We found that restricting our analysis to mutations with high VAFs failed to identify more prognostic genes, indicating that patient stratification is unlikely to be improved by assessing only clonal mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>These analyses suggested that, in general, cancer driver gene mutations lacked significant patient stratification power. This led us to investigate whether mutations in genes other than recurrently-mutated oncogenes and tumor suppressors could affect prognosis. We therefore expanded our analysis to include all genes mutated in ≥2% of patients with a particular tumor type. To account for greatly expanding the number of genes tested, we applied a Benjamini-Hochberg correction with a 5% false-discovery rate to the individual Z scores that we obtained. We uncovered several genes that were linked with prognosis in glioma, but found very few genes significantly associated with death or survival in the other 15 cancer types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2A</xref>). For instance, in breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, 128 and 3996 genes were mutated in ≥2% of patients, respectively, but none of these mutations were significantly correlated with patient outcome at a 5% FDR. In total, these results indicate that most mutations in cancer genomes lack significant prognostic power.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Subtype-independent and subtype-dependent prognostic mutations in gliomas</title><p>In our above analysis, we noted that the five genes with the strongest survival associations were all observed in the GBMLGG (pan-glioma) cohort.

However, when we analyzed low-grade gliomas and glioblastomas separately, several of these alterations remained prognostic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2D</xref>). For instance, while <italic>IDH1</italic> mutations were more common in low-grade gliomas, they were occasionally observed in high-grade tumors as well, and they were independently associated with prolonged survival in both cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7C</xref>).

We determined the copy number of each gene at its transcriptional start site and regressed this value against patient outcome in each tumor cohort. We then examined the clinical impact of CNAs affecting the same 30 cancer driver genes that we previously investigated. Surprisingly, we found that the copy number of these oncogenes and tumor suppressors was frequently linked with patient outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3A-B</xref>).

Overall, among the 30 most frequently-mutated cancer driver genes, we detected 108 significant associations between gene copy number and outcome, compared to 23 associations between mutation and outcome. For 28 out of 30 driver genes, DNA copy number was prognostic in more cancer types than mutational status was.

Thus, the greater prognostic significance of tumor CNAs could reflect the fact that individual CNA measurements inherently harbor more information. To test this possibility, we trichotomized CNA values into ‘deletions’ (&lt;−0.3), ‘amplifications’ (&gt;0.3), and ‘copy-neutral’ (≥−0.3 and≤0.3). We then calculated Cox regressions at the same 30 loci using the discretized copy number values. This analysis resulted in 94 significant survival associations, more than four times as many significant features as when mutations were analyzed, and comparable to the number of significant features that resulted using continuous CNA values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This analysis suggests that the greater prognostic significance of CNAs is not simply a consequence of the continuous nature of copy number data.</p><p>We next investigated whether these oncogene and tumor suppressor CNAs were likely to drive patient mortality, or whether they were passenger genes that changed in copy number along with other, unknown drivers. To assess this question, we combined Z scores from different cancer types using Stouffer’s method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stouffer, 1949</xref>), and then plotted the pan-cancer meta-Z scores along every chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This analysis revealed multiple sharp peaks and valleys in the data that overlapped with known driver mutations. The most significant survival-associated copy number changes genome-wide were found on chromosome 9p in a valley that precisely included the tumor suppressor <italic>CDKN2A</italic>. Z score peaks were found at loci that include oncogenes <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, <italic>EGFR</italic>, <italic>MYC</italic>, <italic>CCNE1</italic>, and others. This overlap suggests that, in many instances, the copy number of these oncogenes and tumor suppressors directly influence the risk of cancer patient death.</p></sec><sec id="s1-5"><title>The prognostic significance of CNAs is independent of tumor sample purity and immune infiltration</title><p>Whole-chromosome aneuploidy has previously been linked to a decreased infiltration of immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davoli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore considered the possibility that CNAs are prognostic via an indirect mechanism; namely that they are found in tumors that lack robust immune infiltration, and this deficient immune response was itself driving patient mortality. However, multiple lines of evidence argue against this interpretation. First, we assessed the association between patient survival and three different measures of tumor sample purity: pathologist-assessed tumor cell fraction, sample purity as judged by ABSOLUTE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>), and leukocyte infiltration, as judged by methylation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>). We found that sample purity was inconsistently-associated with patient outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). For instance, higher tumor purity determined by either pathological analysis or ABSOLUTE was associated with worse outcome in only one of 16 cohorts, each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). The lack of a strong correlation between infiltrating cell populations and clinical prognosis suggests that analyte purity is insufficient to explain the relationship between CNAs and patient survival. Secondly, we generated multivariate Cox models that included gene copy number and these three measurements of tumor purity, and we found that driver gene CNAs remain broadly prognostic in these bivariate models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3C-E</xref>). For instance, we discovered that amplification of Cyclin E1 is associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer, and this remained true even when our analysis was restricted to high-purity tumor samples and samples that lacked significant leukocyte presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Thus, while the interrelationship between aneuploidy and immunological tolerance likely plays an important role in tumor development, this analysis suggests that it is not the primary driver of CNA-associated patient mortality.</p></sec><sec id="s1-6"><title>Copy number analysis improves on patient stratification conferred by common clinical parameters</title><p>Pathological assessment of tumor stage and grade are important sources of prognostic information, though blinded assessments reveal significant inter-observer discordance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allsbrook et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coons et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Elmore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gilks et al., 2013</xref>).

We found that Z scores generated from either univariate models or multivariate models that included stage or grade were highly correlated (R = 0.91 and R = 0.96 respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Overall, 71% of prognostic CNAs in individual cancer types remained prognostic in these multivariate models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Thus, including gene-level copy-number assessment can significantly improve the stratification of patient risk beyond standard clinical parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>). Certain mutations were similarly able to yield prognostic information in a stage- and grade-independent manner. However, due to the lower overall significance of most mutations that we identified, the improvements in patient stratification were generally more modest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4E</xref>).</p><p>Gene-level copy number values also remained prognostic when separating TCGA cohorts by cancer subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4F-G</xref>). For instance, CNA Z scores values were highly correlated between the bulk GBMLGG cohort and the individual GBM and LGG subtypes (R = 0.68 and R = 0.86, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>).

At other loci, low patient numbers from certain subtypes may obscure the detection of specific biomarkers. For instance, within the KIPAN cohort, 67% of tumors are clear cell carcinomas, 23% of tumors are papillary cell carcinomas, and 10% of tumors are chromophobe carcinomas. <italic>CDKN2A</italic> deletion is a strong indicator of poor prognosis in the pan-kidney cohort, in clear cell carcinomas, and in papillary cell carcinomas, but did not reach statistical significance when kidney chromophobe carcinomas were analyzed independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4F–G</xref>). In total, these results underscore the ability of driver gene CNAs to improve patient stratification when controlling for tumor identity, though larger cohort numbers may be needed to identify the strongest biomarkers in rare cancer subtypes.</p></sec><sec id="s1-7"><title>Driver gene CNAs contain prognostic information not captured by <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status or total aneuploidy</title><p>Highly-aneuploid tumors tend to harbor mutations in <italic>TP53</italic>, and both <italic>TP53</italic> mutations and arm-length aneuploidy have previously been associated with poor clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davoli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Petitjean et al., 2007</xref>).

Next, we sought to uncover whether these copy number alterations were deadly because they increased or decreased the expression of mutant gene products. That is, we could observe that the amplification of a driver gene is prognostic only in tumors in which that driver gene is also mutated. Interestingly, this is not the case: at 95% of our test loci, gene copy number remained prognostic in multivariate models that also included gene mutation status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

In total, these results indicate that even at recurrently-mutated loci, changes in the expression of the wild-type gene can have a profound effect on cancer cell behavior. Together with our observation that focal changes tend to confer a worse prognosis than broad changes, these results support the recently-proposed ‘cancer gene island’ model of tumor genome evolution (discussed in more detail below; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Solimini et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s1-10"><title>Independent patient cohorts verify the prognostic significance of driver gene CNAs</title><p>To determine the generality of our findings, we collected independent patient cohorts harboring mutation or copy number data linked to survival outcome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We then performed univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis on these ‘validation’ cohorts and compared the results to the Z scores obtained from our ‘discovery’ set of TCGA data. First, we identified prognostic mutations within a set of 16 patient cohorts from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), comprising 3054 patients analyzed by whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing. Overall, the mutation frequencies and the Z scores of recurrent mutations were highly similar between the ICGC and TCGA cohorts (R = 0.67, p &lt; 0.0001, and R = 0.56, p &lt; 0.0001, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>).

Other mutations, including in known cancer driver genes, were rarely associated with outcome in individual cancer types and harbored minimal pan-cancer significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).

We next analyzed 2431 additional patients with CNA data curated by cBioportal, and found numerous amplifications and deletions associated with patient mortality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6C</xref>). In breast cancer, we found prognostic amplifications that were centered around oncogenes, including <italic>ERBB2</italic>, <italic>MYC</italic>, and <italic>MDM2</italic>, while prognostic deletions encompassed tumor suppressors <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, <italic>PTEN</italic>, and <italic>TP53 (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

Finally, in patient cohorts subjected to both mutation and copy number analysis, we verified that CNAs in driver genes commonly harbored greater prognostic significance than mutations in those same genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). For instance, in breast cancer, among 25 frequently-mutated genes, mutations in only two genes (<italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>GATA3</italic>) displayed prognostic significance, while CNAs in 12 of those same genes were associated with patient outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>).

Our combined patient dataset therefore included two to six independent cohorts from each of 13 common cancer types, comprising 16,580 total patients. These cohorts were collected at different locations, in different patient populations, using different study designs, and the samples were analyzed using different genomic technologies. We reasoned that alterations that were consistently associated with outcome despite these significant differences would represent highly-penetrant biomarkers of patient prognosis. To identify such alterations, we screened for biomarkers that were associated with outcome (|Z| &gt; 1.96) in ≥2 independent cohorts, and that were highly significant (|meta-Z| &gt; 3.3) across all available cohorts.

We therefore sought to discover whether genetic alterations that drove aggressive disease could also sensitize patient tumors to specific therapeutic regimens. By analyzing a cohort of 1000 patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), we identified several instances in which high-confidence biomarkers were associated with vulnerability to particular anti-cancer agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gao et al., 2015a</xref>). For instance, we identified Chr9 deletions that encompassed CDKN2A as a robust biomarker for poor prognosis in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). We found that PDXs harboring CDKN2A deletions were profoundly sensitive to combination therapy with a CDK4/6 inhibitor and an mTOR inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>), consistent with the fact that a protein encoded by <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, p16, functions as a natural inhibitor of CDK4/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Serrano et al., 1993</xref>), p. 4).

However, increasing evidence suggests that large subsets of patients receive sub-optimal care, and are over-treated or under-treated relative to their level of risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhatt and Klotz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Esserman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Swaminathan and Swaminathan, 2015</xref>). To date, many of the genetic alterations that differentiate fatal and benign tumors have remained obscure. Our analysis of prognostic biomarkers from 17,879 patients sheds light on these genetic differences, identifies a subset of patients who may benefit the most from aggressive intervention, and suggests therapeutic strategies for tumors harboring certain alterations associated with poor prognosis. A web portal to facilitate access to these results is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://survival.cshl.edu/">http://survival.cshl.edu/</ext-link>.</p><p>As cancers arise due to the accumulation of mutations in growth-promoting oncogenes and growth-inhibitory tumor suppressors, the presence and diversity of these mutations may be expected to dictate a tumor’s clinical course. However, our data suggest that in many cases, they do not. Substantial disagreements exist in the literature on the value of mutation-based prognostic biomarkers, as the same driver oncogenes have been independently reported to be either adverse or non-significant prognostic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Guan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marabese et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Scoccianti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). In this manuscript, we performed an unbiased genome-wide analysis of public datasets with pre-established sample sizes. This approach may therefore bypass certain problems, including post-hoc hypothesis testing, patient-selection bias, and the ‘file-drawer problem’, that can confound targeted biomarker studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aronson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ensor, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goossens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rosenthal, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Scargle, 1999</xref>). We consider it possible that, with larger sample sizes or more-specific tumor subtypes, additional prognostic mutations could be identified. Importantly, in most patient cohorts that we collected, tumors were analyzed on multiple genomic platforms, and CNAs were commonly prognostic in the same cohorts in which gene mutations were not. These results underscore our ability to successfully detect biomarkers in cohorts of these sizes, and suggest that, in a head-to-head comparison, copy number alterations provide more useful prognostic information than single-gene mutations.</p><p>While we identified very few mutations associated with patient outcome, several lines of evidence underscore the potential benefits of continued clinical sequencing efforts. First, our analysis revealed a subset of mutations with tissue-specific prognostic power, including <italic>TP53</italic> mutations in breast cancer, <italic>RB1</italic> mutations in bladder cancer, and <italic>FBXW7</italic> mutations in colorectal cancer. Secondly, most patients in the TCGA cohorts were treated with standard cytotoxic drugs. As targeted and immuno-therapies are increasingly adopted in the clinic, oncogenic mutations that were non-prognostic in the datasets analyzed here may be able to predict sensitivity to specific therapeutic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gagan and Van Allen, 2015</xref>). Thirdly, tumors themselves are composed of sub-clonal populations that harbor distinct sets of mutations, and recent evidence suggests that cancer heterogeneity can influence clinical course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, interrogating the mutational spectrum at the sub-clonal level may identify prognostic mutations not distinguished in bulk analyses.</p><p>Though large-scale changes in tumor ploidy have previously been recognized as an indicator of poor outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Friedlander et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kallioniemi et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kokal et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Merkel and McGuire, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zimmerman et al., 1987</xref>), the contributions of copy number alterations in most single genes have remained unexplored. Despite the limited stratification value of mutations in cancer driver genes, we found that copy number alterations of many of these same genes are broadly prognostic. Focal CNAs tended to confer a worse prognosis than broad CNAs, consistent with a model in which large-scale gene dosage imbalances trigger proteotoxic stress and impose a fitness penalty on cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Santaguida and Amon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sheltzer and Amon, 2011</xref>). Moreover, while prognostic CNAs commonly caused proportional changes in target gene expression, most CNAs remained prognostic whether or not they affected the expression of a mutated gene. These results support a ‘cancer gene island’ or ‘cumulative aneuploidy’ model of tumorigenesis, in which cancers accumulate a series of limited copy number changes affecting haplo-sensitive and triplo-sensitive regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davoli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Solimini et al., 2012</xref>). Identifying the functional consequences of these prognostic CNAs on tumor physiology is a key future goal.</p><p>Patients whose tumors harbor genetic alterations that drive mortality are in urgent need of improved treatment options. We discovered many instances in which high-confidence biomarkers of aggressive disease also sensitized tumors to specific anti-cancer therapies. By taking advantage of these vulnerabilities, a precision-medicine approach could be applied to both stratify patient risk and identify drug combinations most likely to provide a clinical benefit. Several predicted sensitivities from our work have clinical or mechanistic support, including the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors to treat <italic>CDKN2A</italic>-deleted tumors, the use of PARP inhibitors to treat <italic>STAG2</italic>-mutant tumors, and the use of SYK inhibitors to treat <italic>RB1</italic>-mutant tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bailey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gao et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Treatment with targeted agents significantly alters the cellular epigenetic and genetic landscape, often culminating in the development of resistance to the applied therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Holohan et al., 2013</xref>). We speculate that secondary alterations that tumors evolve to tolerate these drugs could also alter or blunt the aggressive phenotype caused by the original driver alteration. In this way, targeting a biomarker that confers poor prognosis could both directly lead to improved patient outcomes by triggering a robust clinical response, and indirectly help patients by forcing tumor evolution away from dependence on a driver of aggressive disease.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Data sources</title><p>Patient cohorts analyzed in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

For the TCGA genomic copy number analysis, we used the HG19 segmented SCNAs, corrected for germline SCNAs. Overall survival time was used as a clinical endpoint for all cancer types except PRAD. Overall survival was chosen because it reflects an objective and unambiguous event, it is the gold-standard for oncology clinical trials, and it is widely-available across different studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Driscoll and Rixe, 2009</xref>). However, as fewer than 2% of the patients in the PRAD cohort died during the follow-up period, ‘days to biochemical recurrence’ was used as a surrogate endpoint. For all cancers, survival or follow-up time from diagnosis were corrected for the days to sample procurement. Primary tumors (indicated with a ‘01’ in the patient barcode) were used for every cancer type except SKCM; for this cancer, few primary samples were available, so metastatic samples (indicated with a ‘06’ in the barcode) were included for patients in which no primary tumor was available. For additional discussion of the TCGA samples, see Supplemental Text 2. Pathology-assessed tumor cell fraction was obtained from the TCGA clinical files under ‘Percent_tumor_cells’.

Cox proportional hazard analysis used the R survival package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html</ext-link>) to compute Z scores and p values. Justification and further explanation for the use of Cox proportional hazards modeling can be found in Supplemental Text 1. The rpy2 project was used to control R from python, allowing seamless integration of Z score calculations with data processing and pan-cancer analysis. Pandas DataFrames were used as the primary structure for storing and manipulating data. Additionally, native numpy methods and arrays were for used occasionally for efficiently storing strictly numerical data, for example, as input to Cox proportional hazards models. The statsmodels package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.statsmodels.org">www.statsmodels.org</ext-link>) was used for false discovery correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Microsoft Excel was occasionally used for final data processing and examination, so a single apostrophe was added before gene names in intermediate data processing steps to protect genes from auto-formatting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zeeberg et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Code was structured to allow ease of internal reuse and reproducibility of results. Cox univariate proportional hazards, Cox multivariate proportional hazards, Kaplan-Meier, and Stouffers analysis methods were factored into an analysis library, taking as input the data required to perform the computation as numpy arrays or pandas DataFrames.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>TCGA analysis</title><p>In addition to the code for statistical analyses, code for processing TCGA clinical files was factored into a common library. This approach allowed the same TCGA clinical file processing code to be executed across a variety of platform analyses, ensuring identical behavior for each platform. The TCGA clinical processing code selected the relevant clinical endpoints and sample procurement data. The processing translated the available clinical data into the required format for Cox proportional hazard models: an endpoint/survival time value and a censor value for each patient. Code to select tumor samples based on cancer type was also included in this library.</p><p>Raw input data for the mutation analysis needed additional preprocessing before Cox proportional hazard models could be constructed. This preprocessing included removing per-patient headers throughout the data and some data transposition. For all analyses using TCGA mutation data, mutations annotated as silent were excluded. Genes were only included in downstream analyses if they were mutated in 2% or more of the patients in a cancer type cohort.</p><p>Raw input data for copy number analysis also required substantial preprocessing. Copy number input data consists of per-patient, per-chromosome location maps of copy numbers (hg19 downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tyner et al., 2017</xref>). These maps were converted to a single copy number value for each gene. We created an interval tree (using the intervaltree python package, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/intervaltree">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/intervaltree</ext-link>) of the location maps for each chromosome and used the appropriate HGNC to convert chromosome locations to genes for each patient. We used the gene’s transcriptional start site position to look up in the interval tree the copy number value for a gene. This analysis produced an intermediate file of a similar form to the other TGCA platforms, which allowed for straightforward Cox analysis. Note that Cox proportional hazards models are a threshold-independent method of performing survival analysis, and so no minimum or maximum threshold for a copy number alteration was specified.</p><p>A tumor was defined as having a focal amplification or deletion if its copy number was greater than 0.3 or less than −0.3, and the chromosomal interval with a copy number greater than 80% of the copy number at the gene of interest was less than or equal to 3 Mb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krijgsman et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To calculate the number of structural alterations per tumor, the number of distinct copy number values per chromosome in the DNA segmentation file was summed for each patient.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Pan-cancer TCGA analysis</title><p>For each platform and analysis type, we performed a pan-cancer analysis. This analysis created a single Z score for each gene by combining the per gene Z scores from each cancer type using Stouffer’s method. To perform Stouffer’s method, we took the sum of the Z scores for a single gene and divided that sum by the square root of the number of cancer types with Z scores for the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stouffer, 1949</xref>). This meta-Z score was then compared against meta-Z scores obtained similarly from other platform analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Additional TCGA mutation analyses</title><p>We performed several additional analyses on mutation data, including double mutation combination Z scores, hotspot codon Z scores, and Z scores corrected for VAFs. For double mutation Z scores, we took the top 30 most common cancer driver genes and performed pairwise combinations. We then calculated Cox proportional hazards for each pair of genes, where a patient was considered to have a pairwise mutation if and only if both genes were non-silently mutated for that patient. Z scores were only calculated for a pair if (1) neither gene in the pair was statistically significant alone in the univariate analysis and (2) if both genes were mutated together in at least 10 patients.</p><p>Per-codon Z scores were calculated for a selected set of hotspot codons. Most cancer types were available in HG37, so HG37 mutation positions were used to locate codons. Mutations for OV and COADREAD were only available in HG36, so gene positions were converted to HG37 before codon processing. Per codon Z scores were calculated by first identifying patients with mutations in the relevant gene, then selecting from that set of patients those whose mutations were in the codon of interest. If 2% of patients or more had mutations in the selected codon, a Z score was calculated.</p><p>VAFs were calculated for 10 of the TCGA cancer types. We analyzed VAF data in two ways. First, we calculated Z scores, only counting a gene as mutated if its VAF was greater than or equal to 0.4. Secondly, we identified the median VAF score per gene, and calculated Z scores only counting a gene as mutated if its VAF was equal to or greater than the median VAF for that gene.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>CBioPortal analysis</title><p>CBioPortal was structured similarly to the TCGA analyses, though data processing was not factored into an independent library since each of these datasets was only used in one analysis. Copy number data from one CBioPortal cancer type, blca_mskcc, required initial preprocessing in the manner described above for TCGA copy numbers. Mutations were included if they were annotated as one of these types: In_Frame_Ins, Nonstop_Mutation, Translation_Start_Site, In_Frame_Del, Splice_Region, Frame_Shift_Ins, Frame_Shift_Del, Splice_Site, Nonsense_Mutation, or Missense_Mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>ICGC analysis</title><p>ICGC analysis was structured similarly to CBioPortal analysis. Mutations were only included in downstream analyses if they were annotated as one of these types: disruptive inframe deletion, disruptive inframe insertion, frameshift variant, inframe deletion, missense variant, splice acceptor variant, splice donor variant, stop gained, or stop lost. Z scores were calculated if a gene was mutated in 2% or more of the patients in a particular cohort.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Identification of high-confidence biomarkers associated with drug sensitivities</title><p>Across independent datasets, cohorts of patients from related cancer types were identified. Mutations or CNAs significantly associated with patient prognosis (Z &gt; 1.96 or Z &lt; −1.96) in two or more independent cohorts from each cancer type were determined. Then, the subset of these alterations that remained highly-significant (Z &gt; 3.3 or Z &lt; −3.3) across all cohorts from the same cancer type were classified as high-confidence biomarkers. In some instances, amplifications that spanned continuous chromosomal regions were found to correlate with patient prognosis. These segments were identified manually. For the determinations of therapeutic sensitivity described below, the gene with the minimum meta-Z score (for deletions) or maximum meta-Z score (for amplifications) within a segment was chosen to represent the segment as a whole.</p><p>Therapeutic sensitivity data for PDXs was acquired from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gao et al., 2015a</xref>). To identify mutations that correlated with therapy sensitivity, for each drug or drug combination, a comparison was performed if five or more PDXs had a mutation in a gene of interest, and if five or more PDXs were wild-type for a gene of interest. For genes and therapies fitting these criteria, we next identified instances in which the therapy resulted in a clinical response in the mutant population, defined as an average ‘Best Average Response’&lt;15% tumor growth among PDXs with a mutation in the gene of interest. Finally, for genes and therapies fitting these criteria, we performed a t-test for the ‘Best Average Response’ between PDXs with mutant and wild-type copies of a gene of interest. We reported therapies in which these criteria were met and tumors with mutation were more sensitive to the therapy than tumors with wild-type copies of the gene of interest (p &lt; 0.01).</p><p>To identify CNAs that correlated with therapy sensitivity in the PDX cohort, amplifications and deletions (CNA &gt;|.3|) were called, and then considered separately. As above, CNAs were included if five or more PDXs exhibited an alteration, and if five or more PDXs did not exhibit that alteration. For genes and therapies fitting these criteria, we next identified instances in which the therapy resulted in a clinical response in the altered population, defined as an average ‘Best Average Response’&lt;15% tumor growth among PDXs with an amplification or deletion in the gene of interest. Finally, for genes and therapies fitting these criteria, we performed a t-test for the ‘Best Average Response’ between PDXs with mutant and wild-type copies of a gene of interest.

For this data, two different comparisons were used. First, the calculations described below were performed for cell lines from the specific cancer type that the high-confidence biomarker was identified in. If this analysis yielded no significant vulnerabilities, then the calculations were repeated across all cancer types (pan-cancer).</p><p>High-confidence mutations were assessed if five or more cell lines in the set of interest had a non-synonymous mutation in that gene, and if five or more cell lines had wild-type copies of that gene. CNAs were assessed if five or more cell lines had an alteration (deletion or amplification) of that gene, and if five or more cell lines lacked that alteration. For each comparison, T-tests were performed between the log(IC50) value of every tested compound. For single-cancer type analyses, a threshold of p &lt; 0.01 was used to identify significance, while for pan-cancer analyses, a threshold of p &lt; 0.0001 was used to identify significance.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Code</title><p>Code is available on GitHub at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/joan-smith/genomic-features-survival">https://github.com/joan-smith/genomic-features-survival</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Smith, 2018</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/genomic-features-survival">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/genomic-features-survival</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Kaplan-Meier analysis</title><p>Kaplan-Meier plots were generated using Graphpad Prism.

These include Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox proportional hazards regression, accelerated failure time modeling, and many others. In this paper, we chose to apply Cox proportional hazards regression to analyze cancer survival data. The Cox model is represented by the following function:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Where t is the survival time, h(t, X) is the hazard function, h<sub>0</sub>(t) is the baseline hazard, X<sub>i</sub> is a potential prognostic variable, and β<sub>i</sub> indicates the strength of the association between a prognostic variable and survival. In this model, patients have a baseline, time-dependent risk of death [h<sub>0</sub>(t)], modified by time-independent prognostic features that either increase (β<sub>i</sub>&gt;0) or decrease (β<sub>i</sub>&lt;0) risk of death. In this paper, we report Z scores, which are calculated by dividing the regression coefficient (β<sub>i</sub>) by its standard error.</p><p>Cox proportional hazards modeling was chosen for several reasons. First, unlike Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox models do not require the selection of a threshold or cut-off, so continuous data like gene expression values do not need to be dichotomized. (Note that in this manuscript, Kaplan-Meier plots are provided for visualization purposes, but the reported Z scores are always from Cox models). Secondly, Cox models can accept both continuous and discrete input data, allowing this approach to be used to analyze both binary (e.g., mutant vs. non-mutant) and continuous (e.g., gene copy number) genomic features. Thirdly, Cox models are amenable to both univariate (i = 1) and multivariate (i &gt; 1) analyses. Fourthly, Cox regression allows us to calculate Z scores and a p value for each association, as Z scores represent the number of standard deviations from the mean of a normal distribution. Fifthly, Z scores encode the directionality of an association: poor prognostic factors will exhibit β<sub>i</sub> values greater than 0, while favorable prognostic factors will exhibit β<sub>i</sub> values less than 0. This allows ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ survival features to be directly compared. Sixthly, Z scores are useful for meta-analyses, as they can be combined using Stouffer’s Method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stouffer, 1949</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Seventhly, Cox proportional hazards modeling is commonly used in both previous genome-wide survival analyses and in numerous clinical biomarkers studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dhanasekaran et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fukuoka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gentles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2005</xref>), facilitating comparison with other biomarker discovery efforts.</p><p>To verify the underlying normality of the Z scores, we generated qq plots for gene copy number values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The resulting distributions for CNAs were generally linear, as expected, with occasional shoulders at low and high Z scores. We similarly calculated Z scores for all genes harboring coding-sequence mutations; however, we discovered that this resulted in plateaus around the origin in multiple cancer types. These aberrations were caused by the occurrence of rare, random mutations in multiple genes that lacked any prognostic power. To eliminate these plateaus, we experimented with different thresholds for mutational analysis. Considering only mutations that occurred in a certain percentage of cancer patients diminished the appearance of the plateaus, but high thresholds also eliminated from consideration mutations in a number of known cancer drivers. We selected a 2% threshold to balance between maintaining the normality of the Z score distribution while also retaining infrequent but significant mutations in driver genes.</p><p>Note that in many survival analysis papers, a ‘feature selection’ step is included to identify a minimal number of features that can accurately identify at-risk patients. We performed an unbiased, whole-genome analysis without feature selection, to generate a Z score for every gene and for every feature type in the genome.

Though clinical information was collected for nearly all patients, these cohorts were not specifically chosen in order to conduct survival studies. We posit that our survival analysis is appropriate for several reasons. First, we verified that the overall survival times of patients within the TCGA is highly consistent with national epidemiological data collected by the NCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–E</xref>). Secondly, we found that many well-established biomarkers hold prognostic significance in TCGA cohorts, including <italic>IDH1</italic> mutations in glioma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>), <italic>TP53</italic> mutations in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), tumor stage and grade in multiple cancer types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), and more. Thirdly, we validated the survival patterns that we describe in the TCGA in several independent patient cohorts, indicating that these are not TCGA-specific phenomena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Fourthly, in an independent analysis of the quality of clinical annotations in the TCGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), none of the cohort/endpoint combinations chosen for this study were classified as ‘not recommended for use.’ Fifthly, our efforts build upon a robust body of work that has also performed survival analyses on TCGA cohorts, and, in some cases, similarly validated findings from the TCGA in independent patient populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davoli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gentles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guinney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Uhlen et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, we note that the TCGA has several benefits over standard investigator-initiated survival studies. Patient samples were collected and analyzed in an unbiased manner, precluding the possibility of the ‘file-drawer problem’ (failing to publish negative results) or post-hoc sample size adjustment (ending patient enrollment when a significant result is found). Significantly more molecular data is available from TCGA tumors than in any other comparably-sized dataset, which allows for multivariate and correlational analyses of different facets of tumor genomes. All data from the TCGA and all code from this manuscript are publicly-available, allowing easy replication and extension upon this analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank members of the Sheltzer Lab for helpful comments on this work.

Your article has been reviewed by Dr. Jeffrey Settleman as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another, and I have drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers feel that your paper should be accepted for publication after our concerns are addressed, either by performing additional analyses or by qualifying your findings in the writing.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Sheltzer and coworkers &quot;Genetic determinants of cancer patient outcome&quot; provides an extensive evaluation of the prognostic information associated with frequent mutations and copy number alterations across multiple tumors from the TCGA and other validation sets. While overall the findings are intriguing, the reviewers have suggestions to correct gaps in this evaluation. If the authors can address the issues noted below however this could be a very interesting article.</p><p>We have the following suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p><p>1) The observation that copy number (CN) of driver genes and not mutations of the same genes associate with outcome is interesting and intriguing. However, the authors should clearly point out that their current analysis addresses whether CN of driver genes or mutations of various genes have inherent prognostic value in patients treated with standard chemotherapy regimens.</p><p>The authors need to state explicitly that their analysis does not address whether newer therapies targeted to inhibit specific activated oncoproteins (e.g. mutant EGFR in lung cancer) will ultimately have an important impact. This analysis must await adequate follow-up of patients treated with targeted drugs. The same caveat applies to oncogenes included in CN such as MDM2. Specific inhibitors may be especially active in these patients, but this will have to be addressed in future studies.</p><p>2) The authors should make some attempt to consider the impact of disease-specific mutations. For example, mutations occurring in &gt;2% of patients are highlighted. However, EGFR mutations are more common in lung cancer than they are in other solid tumor types. I also note that specific variants known to influence function are not accounted for – noting EGFR as an example, there is no acknowledgment of exon 19 del or L858R mutations (as opposed to variants of unknown clinical significance). If these types of analyses are beyond the scope of what can be done in two months, the authors should clearly state that their paper is meant to highlight the role of CN in prognosis and acknowledge that disease- and mutation-specific analyses will be needed to assess the importance of mutations that activate specific oncoproteins in specific types of cancer.</p><p>3) Different statistical power for CN and mutations: perhaps the overall frequencies of mutations are too low and underpowered as compared to CN event frequencies (probably not the case for TP53 but for most other genes), thus explaining the lower number of statistically significant associations. In addition, a more meaningful comparison could be the hazards ratio from the Cox model, which would be independent of the number of samples with CN/mutations. Reporting z-scores (analogously to p-values) for the Cox regression is necessary to reject the null hypothesis but it would be informative to also provide hazards ratio and confidence interval for the Cox hazards regression (These data can be easily obtained from the R survival package Cox implementation even for continuous variables such as CN).</p><p>4) Gain/loss of function mutations and CN: From the data presented (Figure 3D) it is unclear whether gene focal CN and mutations overlap or tend to be mutually exclusive. A more exhaustive exploration of gain/loss of function through the directionality of prognostic associations would be desirable: It is interesting that TP53 shows significant and inverse association with survival in the METABRIC set (Figure 4J); that might be an expected behavior for tumor suppressor genes with loss of function mutations; As opposed to gain of function oncogene hot spots (BRAF600, RAS12, etc.), which should show positive, z-score for both CN and mutation. Is this directionality affecting the results presented in Figure 3D were EGFR shows loss of significance for the combined CN+ mutation bar? An oncoprint/table showing frequencies mutations overlaying CN would also be helpful to understand gain/loss of function events. Along these same lines, how do the authors know for sure which genes are the drivers within individual CN regions. Couldn't the affect on prognosis of some CN regions be based on the simultaneous loss or gain of function of two or more linked genes within a given region?</p><p>5) The approach to quantify aneuploidy (Taylor et al., 2018) didn't report any association with outcome in their original manuscript, despite previous literature reports (Kallioniemi et al., 1987; Kokal et al., 1986; Friedlander et al., 1984; Merkel and McGuire, 1990; Zimmerman et al., 1987) and only weak associations were found in this manuscript (Figure S10B). This measure of aneuploidy quantifies whole chromosome and whole arm numerical changes but doesn't account for focal events or other elements (i.e. structural variants) associated with chromosomal instability. As a consequence, the question of whether CN of driver genes carry prognostic information independently of overall chromosomal instability burden remains unanswered. The authors should be able to quantify the number of focal events per sample as an alternative measure of chromosomal instability and evaluate whether the prognostic capabilities of driver genes CN remain significant. Another measure of chromosomal instability could be the number of CN breakpoints (per Mbase) that can be obtained from segmentation data from TCGA samples.</p><p>6) Patient risk stratification is a highly complex, specialized and histology-type specific area of research. It would not be within the scope of this manuscript to review each tumor type strategy, however it would be useful if the authors could identify one or two real case scenarios in which their findings could potentially be integrated into clinical diagnostic practice (i.e., how MDM4 gain of copy number could be used to complement the Gleason score in predicting risk in prostate cancer).</p><p>The authors are also using outcomes data without providing definitions of how they were collected, though they do provide very detailed rationale for the choice of methods (Cox modeling in particular).</p><p>7) Copy number analysis is interesting but would benefit from a more in-depth look by disease type and perhaps by known oncogenic drivers within those cancer types. Pooling these data here may be missing critical signals within subsets. The need for further analysis by cancer type and histology should at least be acknowledged in the Discussion section if it cannot be completed within the timescale. Prognostic information based on gene or copy number depends to some extent on treatment. The authors should address the treatment that patients in this analysis received to the extent that they are able. Were any of the patients treated with modern day TKIs and immunotherapy?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Genetic determinants of cancer patient outcome&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

In the Discussion section, we have added the following: “Secondly, most patients in the TCGA cohorts were treated with standard cytotoxic drugs. As targeted and immuno-therapies are increasingly adopted in the clinic, oncogenic mutations that were non-prognostic in the datasets analyzed here may be able to predict sensitivity to specific therapeutic agents.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should make some attempt to consider the impact of disease-specific mutations.

For instance, across all 16 cancer types, 70% of mutations in KRAS are in a single codon (c12), while another 10% of mutations are in codon 13 – both clearly KRAS-activating. Thus, by considering all KRAS mutations together, we do not believe that we are diluting a signal in the data by conflating KRAS-activating mutations with mutations that fail to affect protein function. Nonetheless, we have made several attempts to identify codon-specific and tissue-specific mutations with prognostic power:</p><p>1) We identified the 25 most-frequently mutated codons in the TCGA cohorts (KRAS<sup>c12</sup>, BRAF<sup>c600</sup>, etc.) and performed Cox modeling to test whether they were prognostic. Out of 480 possible mutation/cancer type combinations, only 6 achieved statistical significance (Figure 1—figure supplement 4D). Moreover, the most significant single-codon mutation (IDH1<sup>c132</sup> in glioblastoma) recapitulated what was observed when all IDH1 mutations were considered together (Figure 1—figure supplement 7A).</p><p>2) We identified all “hotspot” mutations in cancer: specific codons that were mutated in five or more patients. We pooled patients who harbored a “hotspot” mutation in a specific gene, while eliminating from consideration mutations that failed to reach this threshold. Thus, for KRAS, we pooled patients with mutations in codon 12, 13, 61, etc., but eliminated the single patients with mutations in codon 8 and codon 22. However, when we performed Cox modeling considering only patients who had mutations in a “hotspot” codon, we failed to detect any significant prognostic markers outside of GBMLGG (Figure 1—figure supplement 4E).</p><p>3) We identified the most common “hotspot” mutations in each specific cancer type: codons that were mutated in at least 4% of patients within an individual cohort. This identified recurrent mutations that were observed across cancer types (like PIK3CA<sup>C545</sup>) and mutations that were unique to specific cancer types (like FGFR3<sup>c249</sup> mutations in BLCA and GNAS<sup>c844</sup> mutations in PAAD). Univariate Cox modeling again revealed very few prognostic alterations among these specific mutations (3 out of 66, when GBMLGG is excluded; Figure 1—figure supplement 4F). The EGFR<sup>L858</sup> alteration that the reviewers inquired about fell below our cut-off, but analyzing it separately we found that this alteration was also non-prognostic in this cohort.</p><p>Thus, while we agree that larger cohorts may yield additional prognostic mutations, using several different analytical approaches, we have been unable to identify robust codon-specific or disease-specific prognostic mutations, outside of glioma/glioblastoma.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Different statistical power for CN and mutations: perhaps the overall frequencies of mutations are too low and underpowered as compared to CN event frequencies (probably not the case for TP53 but for most other genes), thus explaining the lower number of statistically significant associations. In addition, a more meaningful comparison could be the hazards ratio from the Cox model, which would be independent of the number of samples with CN/mutations. Reporting z-scores (analogously to p-values) for the Cox regression is necessary to reject the null hypothesis but it would be informative to also provide hazards ratio and confidence interval for the Cox hazards regression (These data can be easily obtained from the R survival package Cox implementation even for continuous variables such as CN).</p></disp-quote><p>It is conceivable that different statistical power between copy number and mutations could contribute to these results. For instance, as mutations are discrete (“mutant” vs. “wild-type), while CNA values are continuous, every copy number measurement contains inherently more information than a mutation in our Cox models. To test whether this difference in statistical power contributed to our conclusions, we discretized the copy number measurements, dividing them into “deletions” (&lt;-0.3), “copy-neutral” (≥-0.3 and ≥0.3), and “amplifications” (&gt;0.3). Though this procedure significantly reduced the information contained in every CNA, it did not greatly affect our overall conclusion. Among the 30 most frequently mutated genes in the 16 TCGA cohorts, we detected 23 prognostic mutations (Figure 1C) compared to 108 prognostic CNAs (Figure 2B). After we discretized the copy number data, 94 CNAs were still significant. This result is now included in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A.</p><p>As per the reviewers’ request, we have now included hazard ratio calculations in several areas in this manuscript (Figure 1—figure supplement 3, Figure 5—figure supplement 1, Supplementary file 2B, Supplementary file 3B). However, relying on hazard ratios is tricky due to the difficulty in directly comparing them or extracting useful information from them. For instance, in multivariate models from the TCGA breast cancer cohort, age is significantly associated with poor outcome (Z = 2.97, P &lt;.003), but the hazard ratio for this risk factor is only 1.03 (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). Additionally, we calculated hazard ratios for our main 30 gene x 16 cohort analysis – but for 22 of these calculations, the hazard ratio was 0, with a 95% CI from 0 to infinity, as no patients with the indicated mutation died during data collection. Thus, in this paper, we have relied on Z scores in order to test the null hypothesis that a given variable is uninformative in cancer prognosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Gain/loss of function mutations and CN: From the data presented (Figure 3D) it is unclear whether gene focal CN and mutations overlap or tend to be mutually exclusive. A more exhaustive exploration of gain/loss of function through the directionality of prognostic associations would be desirable: It is interesting that TP53 shows significant and inverse association with survival in the METABRIC set (Figure 4J); that might be an expected behavior for tumor suppressor genes with loss of function mutations; As opposed to gain of function oncogene hot spots (BRAF600, RAS12, etc.), which should show positive, z-score for both CN and mutation.

An oncoprint/table showing frequencies mutations overlaying CN would also be helpful to understand gain/loss of function events. Along these same lines, how do the authors know for sure which genes are the drivers within individual CN regions. Couldn't the affect on prognosis of some CN regions be based on the simultaneous loss or gain of function of two or more linked genes within a given region?</p></disp-quote><p>The relationship between the directionality of a Z score and the function of a particular gene is complicated. For cancer mutations, it does not appear that there is a strong link between the two. For instance, IDH1 mutations are clearly oncogenic, but they are associated with a highly significant negative Z score (as it has been recognized that IDH1-mutant gliomas are less aggressive than gliomas driven by other alterations; Yan et al., 2010). We’ve also found that tumor suppressor mutations can be associated with both positive Z scores (e.g., RB1 in BLCA) and negative Z scores (e.g., <italic>FBXW7</italic> in COADREAD; Figure 2B).</p><p>For CNAs, we definitely note the presence of tumor suppressors in Z-score valleys (<italic>CDKN2A</italic> on 9p, <italic>PTEN</italic> on 10q) and oncogenes in Z-score peaks (<italic>PIK3CA</italic> on 3q, MYC on 8q; Figure 2C). But we fully agree with the reviewers that multiple genes within an amplified or deleted region are likely to affect the functional consequences of any given CNA. We are hesitant to draw strong conclusions about specific drivers from fundamentally correlative observations, other than the few well-characterized examples that we have highlighted. In our lab, we are working to develop CRISPR-based tools to manipulate the copy number of DNA segments, which we hope to use to dissect these recurrently-altered regions.</p><p>Concerning the overlap between mutations and CNAs: in some instances, there’s significant overlap, in other instances there’s not. For instance, in PRAD, 71% of tumors that have a PTEN mutation also have a PTEN deletion, likely reflecting a segmental LOH event. In contrast, among COADREAD tumors with ARID1A mutations, only 8% have a deletion in ARID1A, suggesting that mutations and deletions are commonly mutually-exclusive methods of eliminating this gene. We haven’t been able to detect an overarching explanation as to when there is or is not overlap. Nonetheless, these instances of overlap do not affect the overall conclusion that 95% of prognostic CNAs remain associated with outcome in multivariate models that include gene mutation status, indicating that even changes in wild-type loci can affect cancer aggressiveness (Figure 3D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The approach to quantify aneuploidy (Taylor et al., 2018) didn't report any association with outcome in their original manuscript, despite previous literature reports (Kallioniemi et al., 1987; Kokal et al., 1986; Friedlander et al., 1984; Merkel and McGuirer, 1990; Zimmerman et al., 1987) and only weak associations were found in this manuscript (Figure S10B). This measure of aneuploidy quantifies whole chromosome and whole arm numerical changes but doesn't account for focal events or other elements (i.e. structural variants) associated with chromosomal instability. As a consequence, the question of whether CN of driver genes carry prognostic information independently of overall chromosomal instability burden remains unanswered. The authors should be able to quantify the number of focal events per sample as an alternative measure of chromosomal instability and evaluate whether the prognostic capabilities of driver genes CN remain significant. Another measure of chromosomal instability could be the number of CN breakpoints (per Mbase) that can be obtained from segmentation data from TCGA samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now quantified the number of CN breakpoints from the TCGA segmentation data as a proxy for structural instability in each tumor. P53-mutant tumors harbor more breakpoints, as expected (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B), and the total breakpoint burden is a prognostic factor in 8/16 cohorts (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). Nonetheless, 75% of driver gene alterations remain significantly-associated with outcome in multivariate models that include tumor breakpoint burden, providing further evidence that the prognostic power of these alterations is not an indirect consequence of their correlation with chromosomal instability (Figure 3—figure supplement 2E-F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Patient risk stratification is a highly complex, specialized and histology-type specific area of research. It would not be within the scope of this manuscript to review each tumor type strategy, however it would be useful if the authors could identify one or two real case scenarios in which their findings could potentially be integrated into clinical diagnostic practice (i.e., how MDM4 gain of copy number could be used to complement the Gleason score in predicting risk in prostate cancer).</p><p>The authors are also using outcomes data without providing definitions of how they were collected, though they do provide very detailed rationale for the choice of methods (Cox modeling in particular).</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the high-confidence biomarkers we identified in the combined meta-analyses have the potential to be integrated into clinical practice. As suggested by the reviewers, we built multivariate models combining the top-scoring copy number alterations with standard prognostic criteria (receptor status in breast cancer, Clark score in melanoma, Gleason score in prostate cancer, etc.). The CNAs remained associated with survival time in these combined models, highlighting their potential clinical relevance (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Additionally, we have provided more information concerning our choice of clinical endpoints. In the Materials and methods section, we write: “Overall survival time was used as a clinical endpoint for all cancer types except PRAD. Overall survival was chosen because it reflects an objective and unambiguous event, it is the gold-standard for oncology clinical trials, and it is widely-available across different studies<sup>84</sup>. However, as fewer than 2% of the patients in the PRAD cohort died during the follow-up period, ‘days to biochemical recurrence’ was used as a surrogate endpoint.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Copy number analysis is interesting but would benefit from a more in-depth look by disease type and perhaps by known oncogenic drivers within those cancer types. Pooling these data here may be missing critical signals within subsets.

Prognostic information based on gene or copy number depends to some extent on treatment. The authors should address the treatment that patients in this analysis received to the extent that they are able. Were any of the patients treated with modern day TKIs and immunotherapy?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that further analysis within specific tumor histologies is warranted. In the Discussion section, we write, “We consider it possible that, with larger sample sizes or more-specific tumor subtypes, additional prognostic mutations could be identified.”</p><p>However, we think that it’s noteworthy that in the exact same cohorts in which driver gene mutations are generally non-prognostic, CNAs in those same genes are highly prognostic. And, as we continue to collect larger cohorts from discrete cancer subtypes, we continue to see CNAs out-perform mutations. For instance, consider the &gt;2000-patient METABRIC breast cancer cohort that we used as a validation dataset, in which 2/25 common mutations are prognostic while 12/25 CNAs are prognostic (Figure 4J).</p><p>We do not yet know the degree to which the stratification power of CNAs will depend on treatment. Certain pathological findings – like positive surgical margins, lymph-node dissemination, and tumor pleomorphism – are broadly prognostic across a range of cancers, independent of subsequent treatment. It is possible that some CNAs could be similarly prognostic, regardless of the specific therapeutic regimen.</p><p>A small fraction of patients were treated with targeted therapies or immunotherapies. For instance, about 3% of melanoma patients are recorded as having received a BRAF inhibitor, while about 5% received a CTLA-4 antibody. In general, eliminating these patients from consideration does not substantially affect our results (Figure 1—figure supplement 5A and data not shown).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Can you please revise the Title to reflect more specifically the key conclusion regarding gene copy number information.
