During autophagy, cytoplasmic material is delivered into the lysosomal system by organelles called autophagosomes. Autophagosomes form in a de novo manner and, in the course of their formation, isolate cargo material from the rest of the cytoplasm. Cargo specificity is conferred by autophagic cargo receptors that selectively link the cargo to the autophagosomal membrane decorated with ATG8 family proteins such as LC3B. Here we show that the human cargo receptor p62/SQSTM-1 employs oligomerization to stabilize its interaction with LC3B and linear ubiquitin when they are clustered on surfaces. Thus, oligomerization enables p62 to simultaneously select for the isolation membrane and the ubiquitinated cargo. We further show in a fully reconstituted system that the interaction of p62 with ubiquitin and LC3B is sufficient to bend the membrane around the cargo.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08941.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08941.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08941.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells use a process called autophagy to destroy damaged proteins and other harmful materials. During autophagy, the harmful materials become enclosed in a compartment called an autophagosome, which seals it off from the rest of the cell. The autophagosome – which is made of a double-layered membrane – then fuses with another compartment called a lysosome, which contains enzymes capable of breaking down the harmful material. Autophagy helps to keep cells healthy and defects in this process can contribute to cancer, neurodegeneration and other serious diseases in humans.</p><p>It is important that cells are able to correctly select harmful materials for autophagy. A protein called p62 is able to specifically bind to damaged proteins that have been covered with a molecule called ubiquitin. It also interacts with proteins of the ATG8 family that are found on the surface of the developing autophagosome. In this way, p62 operates as an adaptor that brings damaged proteins into contact with autophagosomes in preparation for autophagy. However, since a single p62 molecule can only interact with one ubiquitin molecule and one ATG8 protein, it is not clear how it is able to specifically select only the proteins that carry many ubiquitin tags.</p><p>Individual p62 units can interact with each other to form a group called an oligomer. Wurzer, Zaffagnini et al. use a combination of biochemical and cell biological techniques to study these oligomers in human cells. The experiments show that the oligomers are able to bind to many ubiquitin tags on a single structure. This enables a p62 oligomer to form a stronger connection to the damaged protein than a single p62 unit can. At the same time, the oligomer can interact with many ATG8 proteins, which tend to be found in clusters only on the surface of the autophagosome.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that when an autophagosome starts to form, its membrane expands and curves around the cargo. Wurzer, Zaffagnini et al. observed that the binding of p62 oligomers to ATG8 proteins and damaged structures with ubiquitin tags, drive the bending of the membrane around these structures. Wurzer, Zaffagnini et al.’s findings reveal how the formation of oligomers allows p62 to specifically select and target damaged proteins that are covered with many ubiquitin tags for destruction, while sparing other materials. Other proteins that are closely related to p62 also help to select cell materials for autophagy, so a future challenge is to find out whether these proteins work in a similar way.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08941.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08941.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>selective autophagy</kwd><kwd>cargo receptor</kwd><kwd>in vitro reconstitution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-StG 260304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martens</surname><given-names>Sascha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P 25546-B20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martens</surname><given-names>Sascha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EMBO YIP Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martens</surname><given-names>Sascha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003065</institution-id><institution>Universität Wien</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Uni:docs fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zaffagnini</surname><given-names>Gabriele</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001822</institution-id><institution>Austrian Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DOC fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abert</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Oligomerization of p62/SQSTM1 generates high avidity binding regions that enable it to spatially select for concentrated ubiquitin and ATG8-family proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular homeostasis and quality control require degradation of potentially harmful cytoplasmic material. The lysosomal system mediates degradation of large and bulky substances that cannot be degraded by other means, for example, the proteasome. A major pathway for the degradation of cytoplasmic material is macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">De Duve and Wattiaux, 1966</xref>). During autophagy, double membrane-bound organelles called autophagosomes are formed that, upon fusion with the lysosomal system, deliver cytoplasmic cargo material for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kraft and Martens, 2012</xref>). Autophagosomes form in a de novo manner. Initially, small-membrane structures called isolation membranes or phagophores are observed, which gradually enclose cargo material as they grow. Upon closure of the isolation membranes, autophagosomes are formed within which the cargo is isolated from the rest of the cytoplasm. Subsequently, the autophagosomes fuse with the endolysosomal system where the inner membrane and the cargo are eventually degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kraft and Martens, 2012</xref>).</p><p>It has become clear that autophagy can be highly selective with regard to the cargo that is enclosed and degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rogov et al., 2014</xref>). Among the many cargos are aggregated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bjørkøy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kirkin et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Komatsu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pankiv et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Szeto et al., 2006</xref>), damaged mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Geisler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kanki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Narendra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Novak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Okamoto et al., 2009</xref>), intracellular pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gutierrez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakagawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thurston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yoshikawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zheng et al., 2009</xref>), surplus peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Farré et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hutchins et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iwata et al., 2006</xref>), and ferritin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dowdle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kishi-Itakura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mancias et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, dysfunctional autophagy results in several pathological conditions such as neurodegeneration, cancer, and uncontrolled infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levine and Kroemer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mizushima and Komatsu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levine et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The selectivity of autophagic processes is conferred by autophagic cargo receptors that bind the cargo and link it to the isolation membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johansen and Lamark, 2011</xref>). The isolation membrane is specifically recognized by the cargo receptors due to its modification with proteins of the ATG8 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kabeya et al., 2000</xref>). Yeast Atg8 and its homologues are ubiquitin-like proteins that become conjugated to the headgroup of the membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ichimura et al., 2000</xref>). This unusual modification renders the soluble ATG8 proteins membrane-bound and serves as an identifier for the isolation membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ichimura et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The first autophagic cargo receptor identified was the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Atg19 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leber et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scott et al., 2001</xref>). Atg19 acts during the transport of the oligomeric prApe1 peptidase and other cargos into the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hutchins and Klionsky, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scott et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yuga et al., 2011</xref>). Within the vacuole, prApe1 becomes activated and fulfills its enzymatic function. Under basal, nutrient-rich conditions, the prApe1 oligomers are constitutively transported into the vacuole by the cytoplasm-to-vacuole transport (Cvt) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klionsky et al., 1992</xref>), in which small double membrane-bound vesicles, called Cvt vesicles, tightly enclose the prApe1 cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baba et al., 1997</xref>). The formation of these Cvt vesicles depends on the core autophagic machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harding et al., 1995</xref>) and it is mechanistically analogous to the formation of selective autophagosomes in complex eukaryotes, including mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lynch-Day and Klionsky, 2010</xref>). The Atg19 receptor binds directly and strongly to the prApe1 cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morales Quinones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sawa-Makarska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scott et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shintani et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, it contains multiple Atg8 binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Noda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sawa-Makarska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shintani et al., 2002</xref>). These two properties enable Atg19 to bend the membrane tightly around the cargo and thereby to exclude non-cargo material from the Cvt vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baba et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sawa-Makarska et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Mammals have multiple cargo receptors that mediate the autophagic degradation of cytoplasmic material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johansen and Lamark, 2011</xref>). While some mammalian cargo receptors such as NCOA4 directly recognize their cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dowdle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mancias et al., 2014</xref>), many mammalian cargo receptors including p62/SQSTM-1, NBR1, Optineurin, NDP52, and Tollip recognize the cargo material due to its modification with ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bjørkøy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kirkin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kirkin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rogov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thurston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wild et al., 2011</xref>). p62 is a multidomain protein and contains, among other domains, an N-terminal PB1 domain, a LIR motif mediating the interaction with ATG8 family proteins and a C-terminal UBA domain that binds ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johansen and Lamark, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vadlamudi et al., 1996</xref>). The affinity of the UBA domain for ubiquitin is very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Long et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Long et al., 2010</xref>) but can be increased by phosphorylation on serine 403 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsumoto et al., 2011</xref>). The N-terminal PB1 domain mediates interaction with several other proteins as well as homo-oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lamark et al., 2003</xref>).

We asked whether this feature is conserved and turned our attention to p62, which is a major cargo receptor in mammals, including humans. Only a single LIR motif has been identified in p62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ichimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pankiv et al., 2007</xref>), but there was the possibility that low-affinity-binding sites for ATG8 family proteins such as LC3B and GABARAP were not detected in classical pull-down assays since they fail to detect interactions with high off-rates. We, therefore, used a more sensitive assay to find potential p62–LC3B interaction sites that are independent of the known LIR motif. To this end, we attached GFP-labeled LC3B or GABARAP to the membrane of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Recombinant mCherry-p62 was added to the GFP-LC3B and GFP-GABARAP-coated GUVs and the recruitment of mCherry-p62 was followed by spinning disk microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). mCherry-p62 was robustly recruited to GFP-LC3B and GFP-GABARAP but not to GFP-coated GUVs.

Indeed, the PB1 domain was shown to enhance LC3B binding in pull-down experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bjørkøy et al., 2005</xref>). To directly test whether the strength of the p62–LC3B interaction correlates with the ability of p62 to oligomerize, we recombinantly expressed and purified several oligomerization mutants of p62. The attachment of mCherry to the N-terminus of p62 considerably increased the yield of soluble protein. In order to determine the oligomerization state of our mCherry-p62 variants, we conducted size exclusion chromatography (SEC) runs coupled to static light scattering (SLS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We will refer to this mutant as the NBR1-p62 chimera. Interestingly, introduction of the oligomerization-interfering K7A/D69A double mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lamark et al., 2003</xref>) into the PB1 domain of p62 resulted in an intermediate behavior between the two extremes with a small fraction of the protein eluting in the <italic>V</italic><sub>0</sub> and another peak representing the trimeric species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To confirm this result, we tested purified wild-type mCherry-p62, p62 delta PB1, and the K7A/D69A mutant in a p62 sedimentation assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ciuffa et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with the SLS results, the wild-type protein nearly completely sedimented into the pellet, while the delta PB1 mutant remained in the supernatant. Interestingly, the K7A/D69A mutant partitioned into both fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>).</p><p>To analyze whether the ability of p62 to oligomerize correlates with the strength of its interaction with LC3B, we performed GFP-TRAP experiments using cell lysates of HeLa cells co-transfected with siRNA-resistant versions of the mCherry-p62 variants and GFP-LC3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The endogenous p62 was silenced by siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Indeed, there was a strong correlation between the ability of p62 to oligomerize and its presence in the bead fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). While the wild-type protein showed the most robust interaction with LC3B, the interaction of the K7A/D69A double mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lamark et al., 2003</xref>) was reduced but still readily detectable. The interaction of delta PB1 p62 and the NBR1-p62 chimera became detectable only after long exposure of the blots.</p><p>Next, we tested the different purified recombinant mCherry-p62 variants in pull-down assays using GST-LC3B as bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Similarly to what we observed in the GFP-TRAP experiments, the ability of the different p62 variants to co-pellet with GST-LC3B correlated strongly with their oligomeric state, suggesting that oligomerization of p62 directly affects its binding to LC3B.</p><p>Pull-down assays favor interactions with off-rates low enough to resist washing. Therefore, one possible interpretation of these results is that the oligomeric wild-type p62 has a lower off-rate from LC3B clustered on a surface than the non-oligomerizing mutants. However, it is also possible that in p62 oligomers some monomers are simply piggybacked without actively contributing to the interaction with LC3B. Finally, a third possibility would be that the PB1 domain allosterically enhances binding to LC3B.</p><p>To discriminate between these possibilities, we first measured the steady-state binding of wild-type and delta PB1 mCherry-p62 to GST-LC3B-coated beads. To this end, we recruited wild-type and delta PB1 mCherry-p62 at different concentrations to glutathione beads coated with GST-LC3B and imaged them by spinning disk microscopy at equilibrium. The mCherry-p62 LIR mutant was used as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>).</p><p>The fluorescence signal on the beads correlated well with the protein concentration for both wild-type and delta PB1 mCherry-p62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). However, the titration curve of the wild-type protein showed a steeper slope compared to the delta PB1 protein and approached a plateau above a concentration of 5 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We could, therefore, estimate a half-maximal binding constant of 1.5 µM for wild-type mCherry-p62. It was impossible to estimate the half maximal binding constant for the delta PB1 mutant since at higher protein concentrations the fluorescence of the unbound protein rendered an accurate quantification of the bead-associated signal impossible.</p><p>The different shapes of the titration curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) suggested that the presence of the PB1 domain does not merely confer piggybacking of p62 molecules, but actively increases the overall affinity of p62 toward LC3B. This could either be due to an oligomerization-dependent increase in avidity or an allosteric effect on the intrinsic affinity of the LIR motif for LC3B.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Oligomerization of p62 renders binding to LC3B-coated surfaces irreversible</title><p>To discriminate between these possibilities, we first performed fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP) experiments to determine the exchange rate of mCherry-p62 on GST-LC3B coated beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). In fact, if the PB1 domain increases the avidity of p62 towards surface-localized LC3B via oligomerization, this would result in a lower off-rate of the wild-type protein compared to the non-oligomerizing delta PB1 p62. This would in turn translate into a slower fluorescence recovery for the wild-type protein.

To this end, GST-LC3B-coated beads were incubated with wild-type mCherry-p62 or the delta PB1 mutant, diluted into empty buffer and imaged over time. While delta PB1 p62 started to dissociate immediately after dilution, the wild-type protein remained stably bound to the beads for up to 1.5 hr after dilution. We, therefore, concluded that oligomerization decreases the off-rate of p62 from surface-localized LC3B.</p><p>We also followed the kinetics of association of wild-type and delta PB1 mCherry-p62 to GST-LC3B-coupled beads. Both proteins showed an initially fast association with the beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, insert). However, while no further increase in bead-associated signal was observed for the delta PB1 protein, the wild-type mCherry-p62 further accumulated on the beads over the time course of 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Next, we asked whether oligomerization would also positively affect binding of p62 to free LC3B. We, therefore, immobilized p62 on RFP-TRAP beads and added free GFP-LC3B. The recruitment of wild-type and delta PB1 p62 to RFP-TRAP beads was equally efficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, black bars). To our surprise, mCherry-p62 delta PB1 was twice as efficient as the wild-type protein in recruiting free GFP-LC3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, gray bars, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We then went on to measure the decay of the GFP-LC3B signal from the beads upon dilution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Here, GFP-LC3B readily dissociated from beads coated with both the oligomeric and non-oligomeric p62 variants, with no significant difference.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that oligomerization of p62 specifically promotes interaction with surface-localized, clustered LC3B by drastically reducing the off-rate of p62 from LC3B-coated surfaces. In contrast, oligomerization does not affect the intrinsic affinity of LIR motif for LC3B since binding to free LC3B is not enhanced.</p><p>This hypothesis predicts that the stability of oligomeric p62 on LC3B-coated surfaces should directly correlate with the density of LC3B on the surface. We tested this hypothesis by recruiting wild-type mCherry-p62 to beads coated with decreasing densities of GST-LC3B and measured the fluorescence recovery rates after bleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, decreasing the density of LC3B on the beads resulted in faster recovery rates for wild-type p62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In contrast, the recovery rate of p62 delta PB1 was not affected when the density of LC3B on the beads was reduced even by a factor of 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We then plotted the recovery rates extrapolated from the FRAP curves against the respective LC3B density on the beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). The data points fitted robustly to an exponential curve, which showed a half-maximum around 14% of LC3B density. This value is in line with the result we obtained when we measured the steady-state binding of p62 to beads coated with different densities of GST-LC3B (<italic>c</italic><sub>1/2</sub> = 9.5% for the wild-type protein, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>The data above strongly support a model of oligomerization-dependent LIR motif clustering and hence high-avidity interactions with surfaces on which LC3B is clustered. If this is indeed the case, then the same behavior should be displayed by a non-oligomerizing version of p62 containing multiple LIR motifs.</p><p>We, therefore, generated a mCherry-p62 delta PB1 protein containing 4 LIR motifs (4xLIR) and tested its exchange rate on LC3B-coated beads by FRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>). Strikingly, p62 delta PB1 4xLIR showed a recovery rate approximately four times slower than delta PB1 p62 containing only one LIR motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Oligomerization of p62 promotes the interaction with ubiquitin and confers chain specificity</title><p>Given the effect of p62 oligomerization on LC3B binding, we asked whether a similar mechanism applied to the interaction with ubiquitin. Indeed, it was previously reported that the deletion of the PB1 domain resulted in reduced interaction with ubiquitin in a pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kirkin et al., 2009</xref>). We first tested the interaction of mCherry-p62 with GFP-ubiquitin in GFP-TRAP experiments using cell lysates from transfected HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) in which the endogenous p62 was downregulated by siRNA treatment. The ability of the p62 variants to co-precipitate with GFP-ubiquitin correlated strongly with their ability to oligomerize. While the wild-type protein and the LIR mutant interacted most robustly with ubiquitin, this interaction was markedly reduced for the K7A/D69A mutant. The non-oligomerizing delta PB1 mutant and the NBR1-p62 chimera showed barely detectable interactions with ubiquitin.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08941.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Oligomerization of p62 promotes ubiquitin binding. </title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GFP-TRAP experiment using HeLa cell lysates co-expressing GFP (control) or GFP-ubiquitin and the indicated mCherry-p62 variants.

To this end, we covalently coupled GFP-ubiquitin to 2 µm beads and added wild-type mCherry-p62 at a final concentration of 50 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). Spinning disk microscopy was then used to determine the association of p62 with the beads. The non-oligomeric delta PB1 mutant and the NBR1-p62 chimera as well as the ΔUBA mutant showed strongly reduced recruitment to the GFP-ubiquitin-coated beads when compared to the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Consistent with the GFP-TRAP experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), the K7A/D69A mutant showed only slightly reduced binding to the GFP-ubiquitin-coated beads.</p><p>In vivo individual ubiquitin molecules are frequently covalently attached to one another forming longer chains. Depending on the residue used for the linkage formation, different chain types can be formed, each of them with a different functional role in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Husnjak and Dikic, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>). p62 was shown to bind preferentially K63- over K48-linked chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Long et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsumoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seibenhener et al., 2004</xref>). We, therefore, asked whether oligomerization of p62 influences the binding specificity for different ubiquitin chains.</p><p>To this end, we cross-linked linear (M1)-, K48-, or K63-linked tetra-ubiquitin chains to 2 µm beads and measured the binding of wild-type and delta PB1 mCherry-p62 at equilibrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, black bars). Consistent with previous reports, wild-type mCherry-p62 bound stronger to K63-linked chains than to the K48-linked chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Long et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsumoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seibenhener et al., 2004</xref>). The strongest binding was detected for linear ubiquitin. When we compared the binding intensities of p62 delta PB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, gray bars) with the wild-type protein, we made two observations: first, binding to linear ubiquitin was strongly reduced, and second, there was no longer a significant difference in binding to the three chain types. We concluded that oligomerization of p62 determines specificity toward linear and perhaps weakly toward K63-linked ubiquitin chains, while non-oligomerizing p62 delta PB1 binds indifferently to all three chain types. Interestingly, oligomerization does not promote binding to K48-linked ubiquitin chains.</p><p>It was reported that addition of K63-linked ubiquitin chains partially disrupted p62 oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ciuffa et al., 2015</xref>). Employing the p62 pelleting assay ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ciuffa et al., 2015</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>), we tested the effect of linear, K48- and K63-linked tetra-ubiquitin chains on the oligomerization of p62. All three chain types had a measurable effect on the oligomerization of p62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This effect was specific as GST did not disrupt p62 oligomers. Consistent with previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ciuffa et al., 2015</xref>), we did also not detect any effect of LC3B on the oligomerization of p62 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>]. Addition of K48-linked ubiquitin chains had the strongest disruptive effect on p62 oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Together with the fact that these chains were not preferentially bound by oligomeric p62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) this suggests that p62 oligomers may be locally disrupted upon binding to the beads cross-linked with K48-linked ubiquitin chains.</p><p>Since the strongest oligomerization-dependent binding of p62 to ubiquitin was detected for linear chains, we analyzed this interaction further. When beads coupled to mono-ubiquitin, linear di-ubiquitin, and tetra-ubiquitin were tested for p62 binding, it became apparent that both wild-type and delta PB1 p62 bound stronger to longer ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Thus, even though linear ubiquitin chains disrupt p62 oligomers to some extent in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), they are still bound stronger than mono-ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). We then went on to study whether lower off-rates contribute to the stronger binding of the wild-type protein to linear tetra-ubiquitin compared to mono-ubiquitin. Indeed, FRAP analysis of wild-type mCherry-p62 bound to mono-ubiquitin and linear tetra-ubiquitin showed that the recovery rate was higher for mono-ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Lowering the density of mono-ubiquitin on the beads also resulted in increased FRAP recovery rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>), similarly to what we observed for LC3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These results suggested that oligomerization of p62 results in clustering of the ubiquitin-binding UBA domain and thus avid binding to surface-localized, clustered ubiquitin, analogous to the interaction with surface-localized LC3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). To directly test whether oligomerization of p62 confers more avid interaction with ubiquitin on surfaces, we measured the decay of mCherry-p62 wild-type or delta PB1 from ubiquitin-coated beads upon dilution in buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K,L</xref>). Both proteins showed some degree of dissociation from the surface of the beads but the oligomeric wild-type p62 remained more stably bound.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>p62 drives membrane bending around cargo particles</title><p>In vivo p62 interacts with ubiquitin when it is concentrated on the cargo and with LC3B when it is localized on the isolation membrane. We, therefore, asked what the consequences of the simultaneous interaction of p62 with ubiquitin and LC3B would be in the context of membrane-localized LC3B and ubiquitin localized to a surface. First, we asked whether p62 actually possesses the ability to simultaneously interact with LC3B and ubiquitin. To this end, we conducted experiments using GST-di-ubiquitin-coated beads to indirectly recruit GFP-LC3B via p62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). First, the recruitment of mCherry-p62 variants to GST-di-ubiquitin-coated beads recapitulated our results with GFP-mono-ubiquitin (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, black bars, with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We next assessed the ability of the p62 variants to recruit GFP-LC3B to the beads. No significant difference between wild-type p62 and the K7A/D69A mutant was observed, while p62 delta PB1 and the NBR1-p62 chimera recruited significantly less LC3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, gray bars). However, when the GFP-LC3B signal is normalized to the corresponding mCherry-p62 signal, the non-oligomerizing mutants appear to be about twice as efficient as p62 wild-type in recruiting GFP-LC3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This mirrors the results we obtained when we directly tethered mCherry-p62 to RFP-TRAP beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>In summary, oligomerization of p62 generates high-avidity interactions that increase the residence time of the oligomeric particle on LC3B and ubiquitin-coated structures.

To visualize the vesicles, the membrane was labeled by incorporation of Oregon-green phosphatidylethanolamine. GST-linear tetra-ubiquitin was bound to 2 µm glutathione beads. The beads were then incubated with mCherry-p62 variants and added to GUVs. Strikingly, wild-type mCherry-p62 mediated strong bending of the GUV membrane around the beads. Frequently, the beads were completely submerged into the GUVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Membrane bending was dependent on the specific interaction with LC3B as the LIR mutant showed strongly reduced membrane bending activity. The non-oligomerizing delta PB1 mutant showed reduced membrane-bending efficiency, likely due to the fact that less p62 delta PB1 was localized to the ubiquitin-coated beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether membrane bending by p62 also specifically required its interaction with ubiquitin, we directly cross-linked mCherry p62 delta PB1 to beads. Cross-linked p62 delta PB1 efficiently mediated membrane bending in a LIR-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), showing that the presence of ubiquitin is not essentially required for membrane bending. Next, we tested the ability of p62 to bend the membrane around beads cross-linked to linear, K48- and K63-linked tetra-ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We observed membrane bending events for all the three chain types. However, membrane bending was significantly reduced for K48-linked ubiquitin, consistent with the lower affinity of p62 for this chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we conclude that the interaction of p62 with ubiquitin and LC3B is sufficient to drive bending of a LC3-coated membrane around an ubiquitin-positive cargo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Oligomerization of p62 promotes its relocalization to cargo and LC3B recruitment</title><p>Given our in vitro results, we wanted to know whether oligomerization mutants of p62 would localize to LC3B-positive structures in vivo. We, therefore, examined the co-localization of mCherry-p62 with endogenous LC3B in HeLa cells in which the endogenous p62 was silenced by siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Consistent with earlier results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bjørkøy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ichimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pankiv et al., 2007</xref>) the wild-type and LIR mutant proteins localized in multiple <italic>puncta</italic>, but only wild-type p62 extensively co-localized with LC3B.

Interestingly, the K7A/D69A protein was largely cytosolic but still displayed some degree of <italic>puncta</italic> formation and co-localization with LC3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>Next, we went on to test whether the ability of p62 to oligomerize would affect its accumulation around cargo particles and its ability to recruit LC3B also in cells. To this end, we adapted a previously described assay that is based on the coating of small latex beads with transfection reagent ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2010</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Upon internalization of the beads by the cell, the transfection reagent damages the endosomal membrane, which then becomes a target for selective autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thurston et al., 2012</xref>). In order to render the beads themselves a direct target for selective autophagy, we coated them with recombinant TagBFP-ubiquitin before coating with transfection reagent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). TagBFP-ubiquitin-coated beads were then added to HeLa cells that had the endogenous p62 protein downregulated by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and that were co-transfected with mCherry-p62 and GFP-LC3B. Extracellular beads were stained using an anti-ubiquitin antibody allowing us to count only the intracellular beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). mCherry-p62 wild–type was robustly recruited to the TagBFP-ubiquitin-coated beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). The ability of the p62 mutants to associate with the beads strongly correlated with their ability to oligomerize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). While the non-oligomeric delta PB1 mutant and the NBR1-p62 chimera showed almost no recruitment above the experimental background (mCherry), the K7A/D69A mutant was still recruited to a considerable degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). To follow the recruitment of LC3B to the beads, we quantified the number of beads that were positive for both mCherry-p62 and GFP-LC3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,F</xref>). The recruitment of GFP-LC3B to the beads was also strongly dependent on the ability of p62 to oligomerize. Wild-type p62 showed robust recruitment of LC3B to the beads while p62 delta PB1 and the NBR1-p62 chimera showed very low LC3B recruitment. The p62 K7A/D69A mutant displayed an intermediate behavior between the two extremes with regard to LC3B recruitment. Moreover, we noticed that the effect of the oligomerization on the LC3B recruitment to the beads was largely dependent on the reduced recruitment of the p62 oligomerization mutant. This became obvious when we quantified the total recruitment of LC3B to all intracellular beads, regardless of whether they were positive or negative for p62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). This quantification showed that there is at least one redundant factor that is able to recruit LC3B to the ubiquitin-coated beads. This redundant factor accounts for 68% of the LC3B recruitment activity (compare wild-type p62 to mCherry). Obvious candidates for this factor are other cargo receptors such as NBR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kirkin et al., 2009</xref>), optineurin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wild et al., 2011</xref>), or Tollip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2014</xref>).

Thus, oligomerization enables p62 to simultaneously select for concentrated ubiquitin and LC3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). There are interesting parallels but also deviations compared to the yeast Atg19 cargo receptor. Atg19 binds its prApe1 cargo with very high affinity and selects for membrane-bound Atg8 via a high-avidity interaction mediated by multiple low-affinity Atg8 interaction sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sawa-Makarska et al., 2014</xref>). These properties are advantageous because the prApe1 cargo is a dedicated selective autophagic cargo that needs to be delivered into the vacuole in order to fulfill its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klionsky et al., 1992</xref>). Thus, the high-affinity interaction of Atg19 with the prApe1 cargo ensures its rapid transport into the vacuole. The multiple Atg8 binding sites in Atg19 subsequently mediate the selective interaction with membrane localized, locally concentrated Atg8, enabling Atg19 to bend the membrane tightly around the cargo and to exclude non-cargo material from its delivery into the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baba et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sawa-Makarska et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, the cargo of p62 is not normally destined to be transported into the lysosomal system but fulfills a function in the cell’s cytoplasm. Only when this material becomes dysfunctional or superfluous it becomes marked with ubiquitin and thereby a target for selective autophagy. Aggregated proteins, for example, are a cargo for p62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bjørkøy et al., 2005</xref>). However, when cytosolic proteins unfold and aggregate, they initially become a target for the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). When the UPS is overwhelmed, unfolded, ubiquitinated proteins form aggregates on which ubiquitin is locally concentrated. Only these structures should become a target for p62 and subsequently be degraded by selective autophagy. The low affinity but high avidity interaction of the p62 oligomer with ubiquitin will select for these structures as ubiquitin is locally concentrated on them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Interestingly, we found that K48-linked ubiquitin chains are less efficiently bound by oligomeric p62 compared to linear and K63-linked chains, possibly because K48-linked ubiquitin chains disrupt the p62 oligomers more effectively. These results hint to the possibility that K48-linked chains are not the preferred target for p62 in vivo, possibly in order to prevent proteins targeted for the proteasome to become premature targets of p62. Thus aggregated proteins may need further modification by K63-linked or linear ubiquitin chains in order to render them efficient targets for p62.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08941.022</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A model for selective autophagy in yeast and mammalian cells. </title><p>Multiple binding sites in the yeast cargo receptor Atg19 promote selective and exclusive engulfment of cargo material by Atg8-covered membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sawa-Makarska et al., 2014</xref>).

Instead, oligomerization drastically increases the residence time of p62 on LC3B and ubiquitin-coated surfaces. In the case of wild-type p62 and concentrated LC3B, the interaction even becomes irreversible and might represent the end point of a pathway in which the whole structure is eventually degraded in the lysosome.</p><p>Moreover, we report that non-oligomerizing p62 mutants are more efficient than wild-type p62 in recruiting soluble LC3B. Consistent with a recently published structure of p62, which showed a helical arrangement of the oligomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ciuffa et al., 2015</xref>), we hypothesize that p62 oligomers adopt a three-dimensional structure that does not allow all LIR motifs to be engaged in LC3B interactions at the same time. Furthermore, we speculate that in vivo oligomerization is required to tightly appose the growing LC3B-positive membranes to the cargo particle, largely due to the fact that oligomerization mediates the concentration of p62 at the cargo.</p><p>Additional regulation by cargo-localized kinases such as TBK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsumoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2015</xref>) may generate positive feedback loops resulting in more efficient delivery of ubiquitinated cargo into the lysosome. Furthermore, cooperation of p62 with other cargo receptors such as NBR1 fine-tunes the process and contributes to the clustering of aggregated proteins into larger structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kirkin et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we found that oligomerization mutants of p62 showed a dominant negative effect on LC3B recruitment around <italic>Salmonella</italic>. It is possible that the presence of p62 oligomerization mutants prevents other cargo receptors or the autophagic machinery in general to trigger the formation of an LC3B-positive isolation membrane.</p><p>Self-association of autophagic cargo receptors in order to generate high-avidity interaction surfaces to select ubiquitinated cargo and ATG8-family protein decorated membranes may be a reoccurring theme. The cargo receptor optineurin forms higher-order oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gao et al., 2014</xref>), while the NBR1 cargo receptor dimerizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kirkin et al., 2009</xref>).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor and Reviewing editor) and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work describes a biochemical approach to investigate the relationship between p62 oligomerization and cargo binding. Contrary to Atg19, a substrate adaptor with multiple LIR motifs, p62 contains only a single LIR-motif and a single UBA-domain. This study suggests that oligomerization provides p62 with multiple LIR-motifs and UBA domains within a single structure, probably related to the large helical structures previously described by cryo-EM. Oligomerization decreases the off-rate of cargo from the adaptor, thus stabilizing the interaction of adaptor and cargo sufficiently for membrane formation around the cargo. In addition, the simultaneous binding of p62 to ubiquitin and LC3 allows for bending of the autophagosomal membrane around cargo, at least in the context of GUVs. There is also some correlation between in vitro data and recognition of ubiquitylated Salmonella by p62.</p><p>Overall, there are several interesting observations in this manuscript, that paired with careful biochemical characterization make it an interesting study for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) My major concern with this study is the ubiquitin aspect: cargo for p62 is usually heavily ubiquitylated, with either long chains or more complex ubiquitin structures being observed most frequently. However, this study is mostly done in the context of mono- or di-ubiquitin, and linkage-specificity of ubiquitin conjugates is not taken into account. It is important to address both length and linkage of the ubiquitin conjugates as previous work had suggested that long ubiquitin chains (octamers connected through K63) can disrupt the oligomeric structure of p62. Thus, some of these assays need to be repeated with defined K63- or K48-linked chains of at least four ubiquitin molecules tested for their interaction with p62 and their ability to induce membrane bending in conjunction with p62.</p><p>2) The assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D-F</xref> is nice. Are all components required for bending the membrane or that an interaction between the beads and the membrane could be sufficient to drive the curvature? The authors may need to demonstrate a physiological circumstance which requires ubiquitin, oligomerized p62 and LC3 to bend the membrane. Could the p62-coated beads bend the LC3-coated membrane? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, the data shown do not support the statistical significance of the claim that &quot;The oligomerization deficient mutants of p62 showed reduced ability to mediate membrane bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).&quot; The authors show that PB1-mediated oligomerization is important for avid binding to Ub, but their results do not support the idea it is a direct driving force for membrane bending.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F-G</xref> do not appear to show significant effects. In 6G in particular, the effects are very small. This is probably due to adaptor redundancy. The authors speculate about other adaptors that might be involved. On balance the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F-G</xref> neither support nor oppose the authors' hypothesis.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>. While the histogram shows what looks like an impressive reduction for the PB1 mutants, I'm confused about how colocalization was scored. By eye it looks like plenty of GFP is colocalized with all of the mutants in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>.</p><p>5) The advance of the study is to illustrate the enhanced association of p62 with the LC3 and ubiquitin by oligomerization. However, the process is insufficiently characterized. The reviewer suggest calculating a binding curve between the lipid anchored LC3 and different concentrations of different p62 variants. Further, the binding kinetics in addition to the dissociation kinetics indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> may also be helpful. If oligomerization is just simply increasing the affinity to LC3 and ubiquitin binding, could an engineered p62 with multiple LIFs fulfill similar purpose?</p><p>6) Oligomerization decreases the diffusion rate of p62 in the cytosol which may be a negative contributor to its dynamics and efficiency to recognize cargo. Therefore, it is possible that the extent of p62 oligomerization is low but enhanced by cargo binding or association with LC3. Could the author examine the effect of ubiquitin and LC3 on the extent of p62 oligomerization?</p><p>7) The author may consider revising the conclusion in the subsection &quot;Oligomerization of p62 renders binding to LC3B-coated surfaces irreversible&quot;. The authors indicated the &quot;concentrated p62&quot;. Here it is difficult to conclude from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F-H</xref> that these soluble LC3 is not concentrated, as once they associate with the oligomerized p62 concentrated on the beads, they may become concentrated too. The reviewer suggests modifying &quot;concentrated&quot; to &quot;membrane associated&quot;. Otherwise, it is necessary to quantify the fluorescence intensity of the LC3 on the lipid surface as well as those associated the p62-coated beads to make a comparison. In addition, the authors may consider titrating the amount of LC3 on the membrane and quantifying the dissociation rate of oligomerized p62 from the membranes coated with different concentrations of LC3 proteins.</p></body></sub-article> <sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08941.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) My major concern with this study is the ubiquitin aspect: cargo for p62 is usually heavily ubiquitylated, with either long chains or more complex ubiquitin structures being observed most frequently.

We have now tested the interaction of wild type p62 and the non-oligomeric delta PB1 mutant with beads cross-linked to linear tetra-ubiquitin, K48-linked tetra-ubiquitin and K63-linked tetra-ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Interestingly, while the delta-PB1 mutant bound equally to all three chain types, the oligomeric wild type protein showed increased binding to linear ubiquitin and to some extent to K63-linked ubiquitin chains but not to K48-linked ubiquitin. When we tested the oligomer disruption activity of the three chain types we found that K48-linked ubiquitin chains had the strongest effect on oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus it appears that K48-linked ubiquitin chains may not be the preferred target for oligomeric p62. We further tested the effect of ubiquitin chain length on p62 binding using mono-ubiquitin and linear di- and tetra-ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Both, wild type and p62 delta PB1 bound stronger to longer chain types but the positive effect of the increasing chain length was more pronounced for the oligomeric wild type protein. This was despite the fact that at high concentrations linear ubiquitin chains have a considerable disruptive effect on p62 oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). We then went on to test the dissociation of p62 from mono-ubiquitin and linear tetra-ubiquitin using FRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>) and found that p62 is much more tightly bound (i.e. has a lower off rate) to tetra-ubiquitin chains than to mono-ubiquitin. Increasing the density of mono-ubiquitin on the beads also resulted in reduced off-rates of p62 from the beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Thus a major factor for the avid binding of oligomeric p62 to ubiquitinated structures is the density of ubiquitin rather than the existence of chains, although chains could still have an additive positive effect. We also tested the ability of wild type p62 to bend the membrane of GUVs around beads coated with linear tetra-ubiquitin, K48-linked tetra-ubiquitin and K63-linked tetra-ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We found that p62 mediated membrane bending for all three chain types. Consistent with weaker interaction of p62 with K48-linked chains bending was less efficient for this chain type.</p><p><italic>2) The assay in</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D-F</xref><italic>is nice. Are all components required for bending the membrane or that an interaction between the beads and the membrane could be sufficient to drive the curvature?

In order to prevent massive crosslinking of beads by oligomeric p62 we have used delta PB1 and the corresponding LIR mutant for this experiment. We found that cross-linked p62 delta PB1 efficiently mediated membrane bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) showing that the presence of ubiquitin per se is not essential for the membrane bending activity of p62. In addition, this experiment shows that oligomerization is also not essential for membrane bending (although it could of course have an additive positive effect). Thus oligomerization may primarily mediate the accumulation of p62 at the ubiquitinated cargo, which in turn clusters the LIR motifs allowing the bending of the LC3B-coated membrane. We thank the reviewers for suggesting this insightful experiment.</p><p>Regarding the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> of the previous version of the manuscript (now replaced with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) in which we showed a comparison of the membrane-bending activities of the p62 variants it is clear that it had some conceptual difficulties. Thus wild type p62 binds very strongly to the membrane via its interaction with LC3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) and the beads via its interaction with ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This means that the protein will cover both surfaces and due to the practically irreversible nature of these interactions the interaction of the beads with the membrane are mediated by p62-p62 interactions. In contrast, the oligomerization deficient mutants are less tightly bound to the membrane and the beads and thus are likely to exchange and therefore to be able to mediate simultaneous interaction with LC3B and ubiquitin. We came to the conclusion that we are not comparing the same phenomenon for the different p62 variants. Therefore we have changed the experimental setup by pre-incubating linear tetra-ubiquitin coupled beads with p62 followed by their addition to GUVs coated with LC3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This experiment shows that p62 is able to bend the membrane around the beads and that this activity is significantly reduced for the delta PB1 mutant.</p><p><italic>3)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F-G</xref><italic>do not appear to show significant effects.

However, although the effects are indeed very small they are significant.

While the degree of LC3B localization to the bacteria was significantly reduced for oligomerization mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) the level of co-localization of the p62 and LC3B at the bacteria is mainly influenced by the reduced localization of the p62 oligomerization mutants to the bacteria. We understand that this quantification can be misleading and have moved it to the Figure Supplement ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2.</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) The advance of the study is to illustrate the enhanced association of p62 with the LC3 and ubiquitin by oligomerization. However, the process is insufficiently characterized. The reviewer suggest calculating a binding curve between the lipid anchored LC3 and different concentrations of different p62 variants. Further, the binding kinetics in addition to the dissociation kinetics indicated in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> <italic>may also be helpful. If oligomerization is just simply increasing the affinity to LC3 and ubiquitin binding, could an engineered p62 with multiple LIFRs fulfill similar purpose?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting these experiments. We have now tested the binding of p62 to LC3 at different concentrations. Instead of GUVs we have used beads since they also allowed us to conduct FRAP experiments without the complication of lateral diffusion of LC3B and the LC3B-p62 complexes on the membrane. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> show the association of wild type p62 as well as the delta PB1 and LIR mutants to LC3B coated beads at different concentrations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>shows the binding of wild type and delta PB1 p62 to LC3B-coated beads overs time.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F, G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3.</xref> show FRAP analyses of p62 bound to different densities of LC3B on the beads. In combination these FRAP analyses show that the avid binding of p62 to LC3B depends on the density of LC3B on the bead. At high densities the interaction is practically irreversible while at lower densities the effect of oligomerization is lost and the behaviors of oligomeric p62 is like that of the delta PB1 mutant.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref> shows a FRAP analysis of the interaction of p62 with different densities of ubiquitin on beads. The conclusion of this experiment is that, analogous to the interaction with LC3B, the binding of wild type p62 is more avid to higher ubiquitin densities.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers we have also constructed a p62 version with multiple LC3B interaction site (LIRs). In particular, we have introduced 3 additional LIR motifs next to the endogenous LIR of p62 delta PB1. The FRAP analysis beautifully shows that this 4xLIR mutants binds much more avidly to LC3B coated beads than the single LIR containing protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H and I</xref>).</p><p><italic>6) Oligomerization decreases the diffusion rate of p62 in the cytosol which may be a negative contributor to its dynamics and efficiency to recognize cargo. Therefore, it is possible that the extent of p62 oligomerization is low but enhanced by cargo binding or association with LC3. Could the author examine the effect of ubiquitin and LC3 on the extent of p62 oligomerization?</italic> </p><p>We have tested the effect of ubiquitin and LC3B binding on p62 oligomerization. To this end we have employed a pelleting assay as described previously by the Sachse and Johansen labs (Ciuffa et al., Cell Rep. 2015). The assay works well as the presence of p62 in the pellet fraction correlates with ability of p62 to oligomerize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B, 2C</xref>). In agreement with Ciuffa et al. we found no oligomerization disruption effect by LC3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>). Also, in agreement with Ciuffa et al. we found that ubiquitin disrupted p62 oligomers to a considerable extent. When we compared different ubiquitin chains for their effect on oligomerization we found that linear, K48-linked and K63-linked chains disrupted p62 oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Of these K48-linked chains had the strongest disruptive effect. However, oligomeric p62 still binds stronger to ubiquitin chains than to mono-ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p><italic>7) The author may consider revising the conclusion in the subsection â€œ&quot;Oligomerization of p62 renders binding to LC3B-coated surfaces irreversible&quot;.
