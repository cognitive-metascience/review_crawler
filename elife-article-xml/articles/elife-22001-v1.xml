network interactions. Synchronisation of oscillatory activity might contribute to WM by enabling the coordination of long-range processes. However, causal evidence for the way oscillatory activity shapes network dynamics and behavior in humans is limited. Here we applied transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to exogenously modulate oscillatory activity in a right frontoparietal network that supports WM. Externally induced synchronization improved performance when cognitive demands were high. Simultaneously collected fMRI data reveals tACS effects dependent on the relative phase of the stimulation and the internal cognitive processing state. Specifically, synchronous tACS during the verbal WM task increased parietal activity, which correlated with behavioral performance. Furthermore, functional connectivity results indicate that the relative phase of frontoparietal stimulation influences information flow within the WM network. Overall, our findings demonstrate a link between behavioral performance in a demanding WM task and large-scale brain synchronization.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22001.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22001.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22001.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Like an orchestra that relies on the coordinated efforts of its members, the brain depends on its many regions working together to perform tasks such as memorizing a phone number or the name of someone we recently met. Many areas in the brain that are involved in these processes are located far apart, and so performing these tasks efficiently depends on the regions being able to communicate and coordinate information. Rhythmic waves of electrical activity in the brain are considered to be essential to maintain the flow of information. These brain waves occur when many brain cells repeatedly send signals at the same time, and the precise ‘beat’ of the signals might be especially important when performing more complex tasks.</p><p>In recent years, cheap and safe electrical stimulation has shown promise in being able to influence brain waves. This technique can be used to investigate the importance of precise timing between brain waves and its impact on performing tasks, as well as changes in brain activity that occur when tasks are more complex. For example, is a person’s behaviour affected if electrical stimulation is used to make their brain waves more or less synchronized?</p><p>Violante et al. stimulated distant regions of the brain of volunteers and monitored how they performed in tasks with varying difficulty. When these regions were stimulated with the same ‘beat’ to make the brain waves more synchronized, the person performed better in the more difficult tasks. In these tasks, participants had to monitor number sequences, and spot repeated patterns in the remembered information. To better understand this effect Violante et al. performed brain stimulation while collecting brain scans. The scans showed that stimulation at the same ‘beat’ increases brain activity in the regions involved in task performance and changes the pattern of how regions communicate in the brain. This finding suggests that the ‘beat’ of brain waves is important for task performance, and that stimulating the brain externally can alter how regions in the brain communicate.</p><p>Future studies could extend these findings to patients, particularly those with the kind of damage to their brain that slows the communication between its distant regions. Stimulating these patients’ brains could help bypass the internal delays, and help them to complete everyday tasks more efficiently.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22001.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22001.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Working memory</kwd><kwd>tACS</kwd><kwd>oscillations</kwd><kwd>synchronization</kwd><kwd>brain networks</kwd><kwd>brain stimulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>103045/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Violante</surname><given-names>Ines R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>103429/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Lucia M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Externally induced synchronous/desynchronous oscillations during working memory performance reveal distinct patterns of brain activity and connectivity across large-scale networks recruited by the task.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cognitive processes depend on coordinated interactions among large-scale distributed brain networks. Flexible and rapid propagation of information across distant brain regions is necessary to support these functions. A prominent hypothesis is that information exchange within and between networks occurs through the oscillatory synchronization of neuronal activity, such that synchronous neuronal firing binds neurons into ensembles engaged in specific computational functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Varela et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fries, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Womelsdorf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fries, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parkin et al., 2015</xref>). Rhythmic synchrony increases network efficiency, a process thought to be particularly relevant for demanding cognitive processes such as working memory (WM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fries, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fell and Axmacher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fries, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Constantinidis and Klingberg, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Frontal and parietal brain regions support WM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prabhakaran et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pessoa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Todd and Marois, 2004</xref>). Oscillatory activity in the theta range (4–8 Hz) appears to organize local neuronal ensembles across distant regions during WM processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buzsáki, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sarnthein et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rutishauser et al., 2010</xref>). Theta power increases during complex manipulations of items in WM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sauseng et al., 2005</xref>), with increasing memory load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jensen and Tesche, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Payne and Kounios, 2009</xref>), and is correlated with WM performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jacobs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fuentemilla et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, the relative phases of these oscillations influence encoding and retrieval success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rizzuto et al., 2006</xref>). For example, frontoparietal theta synchrony with ~0° phase lag is associated with the maintenance and manipulation of information in WM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sauseng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Polanía et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>With the aim of providing causal evidence for the role of oscillatory synchronization during demanding WM performance, as well as to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms by which frontoparietal phase synchronization influences verbal WM, we conducted two experiments using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to selectively entrain endogenous brain rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antal and Paulus, 2013</xref>). In- and anti-phase theta frequency (6 Hz) stimulation was applied across two key nodes of the right frontoparietal network: the middle frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule. Similar tACS stimulation has previously been shown to produce phase-dependent modulations of WM performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Polanía et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we conducted two complementary experimental approaches. In Experiment 1 we used conventional continuous theta stimulation to investigate the role of frontoparietal phase synchronization on cognitive performance. Cognitive demands were varied by using a combination of choice reaction and N-back tasks of increasing difficulty. This allowed us to test the prediction that tACS effects would only be seen when cognitive demands were high. The right hemisphere was stimulated because increasing demand in verbal N-back conditions was associated with stronger activity and effective connectivity within the right hemisphere WM network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fedorenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dima et al., 2014</xref>), as well as a more pronounced effect of tACS on WM performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jaušovec et al., 2014</xref>). In Experiment 2 we investigated the neurobiological substrate of the phase dependent effects of tACS. Our fMRI-tACS experimental design used short trains of tACS that avoid aftereffects of the stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vossen et al., 2015</xref>) whilst maximizing power to detect changes in the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Functional (f) MRI is well suited to this purpose because BOLD: (1) provides a measurement of brain activity during tACS without complex artifacts that can severely contaminate traditional electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cabral-Calderin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vosskuhl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Noury et al., 2016</xref>); and (2) is unaffected by the phase of the applied stimulation.</p><p>We tested the following hypotheses: (1) behavioral WM performance is enhanced by entraining synchronous activity within a right frontoparietal network activated by WM demands; (2) regional brain activity in this frontoparietal network is modulated in a phase dependent manner; (3) changes in BOLD induced by phase-dependent network stimulation correlate with behavioral performance; (4) functional connectivity across distant brain regions is modulated in a phase-dependent manner, in agreement with computational and empirical evidence that phase synchronization enables flexible reconfiguration of information flow between brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Womelsdorf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akam and Kullmann, 2014</xref>). We found that synchronous (in-phase) stimulation caused an improvement in performance and led to increased frontoparietal activity when cognitive demands were high. These results show that external manipulations of large-scale brain synchronization can be used to shape activity and connectivity within brain networks, and those modulations are detectable using fMRI. We additionally demonstrate the important influence of underlying cognitive demand on the neural effects of tACS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Synchronous frontoparietal tACS improved working memory performance</title><p>In Experiment 1, we investigated the effects of tACS on the performance of two tasks with varying cognitive loads: a simple choice reaction time task (CRT) and a verbal N-back task with 1-back and 2-back difficulty levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The effects depend on the relative phase of the external oscillators and also the underlying cognitive state at the time tACS is applied. In particular, we showed that imposing theta frequency synchronously across the inferior parietal lobe and middle frontal gyrus improves verbal WM performance and increases frontal and parietal brain activity. The functional connectivity of the inferior parietal lobe was also modulated by tACS in a phase dependent manner. Frontal interactions increased with synchronous theta stimulation whereas posterior interactions increased with desynchronous stimulation, suggesting that information flow through brain regions involved in WM can be differentially affected by varying the phase of external stimulation. Therefore, we provide a direct demonstration of the role of phase synchronization in cognitive demanding WM processes and we showed the neural correlates associated with this process.</p><p>It has been proposed that tACS interacts with ongoing oscillations and the resultant neural modulations spread along brain networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fröhlich and McCormick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ali et al., 2013</xref>), with entrainment being more effective when the induced frequency matches the endogenous rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fröhlich and McCormick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reato et al., 2010</xref>). This leads to the prediction that stimulation is highly dependent on the underlying network dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alagapan et al., 2016</xref>). Our imaging results for the 2-back and CRT tasks strongly support these notions and show how the physiological effect of external oscillatory manipulations are highly dependent on the underlying cognitive state. While synchronous and desynchronous stimulation produced distinct activity and connectivity patterns in the 2-back task, they resulted in similar changes of activity and no effects on connectivity for the CRT task. Compared to the CRT, the 2-back task is more demanding and engages the frontoparietal network more heavily, which is observed both in terms of increased BOLD activity and theta power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Payne and Kounios, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heinzel et al., 2014</xref>)</p><p>Our behavioral findings strongly suggest a causal link between theta phase coupling in the frontoparietal network and cognition. We replicate the observation that synchronous tACS applied across the frontoparietal networks improves WM performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Polanía et al., 2012</xref>), and extend these results by showing that this cognitive enhancement is dependent on the demands of the cognitive task. Our observations that tACS had no effect on less demanding 1-back or CRT tasks suggests that the behavioral effects of entraining oscillations interacts with the extent that a network is already engaged by a cognitive task. Remarkably, synchronous tACS produced sufficient improvement in response times to make 2-back performance similar to the 1-back condition, which is typically associated with much faster responses.</p><p>Increased rhythmic synchrony across a network is thought to improve information processing by increasing network efficiency, an effect particularly important during demanding cognitive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fries, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deco et al., 2011</xref>). For example, theta synchrony between frontal and parietal brain regions increases during complex manipulations of items held in WM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sauseng et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly, our neuroimaging results show the neural correlates of this effect on network efficiency. Entraining synchronous activity across the right frontoparietal network was associated with increased activity within the inferior parietal lobe and middle frontal gyrus, regions known to play a key role in WM function. Activation in these regions increases with WM demands and its damage leads to impairments of WM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Curtis and D'Esposito, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berryhill and Olson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fedorenko et al., 2013</xref>). In keeping with these findings, we show that increased activity within the right inferior parietal lobe correlated with faster responses during the 2-back, supporting a link between neural activity and the behavioral effects of tACS. This is in agreement with the critical role of this region during WM maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Constantinidis and Steinmetz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pessoa et al., 2002</xref>), and the observations that disrupting its activity through transcranial magnetic stimulation affects performance in both spatial and verbal WM tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kessels et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mottaghy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Postle et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, during maintenance of items in WM the parietal cortex is positively associated with trial-by-trial performance and inter-individual differences in WM capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Todd and Marois, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu and Chun, 2006</xref>). The fact that a relationship with response times was observed for the parietal but not the frontal region might be explained by the different roles attributed to parietal and frontal cortices in verbal WM. Evidence suggests that these regions have different contributions to phonological storage and executive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paulesu et al., 1993</xref>). Moreover, our results are congruent with findings from other studies showing correlations between BOLD activity or connectivity density and response times in similar verbal WM tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Honey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tomasi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, by increasing neural activity in the parietal region, tACS might have interacted with the physiological mechanisms associated with response production.</p><p>Importantly, the changes in BOLD we observed were not constrained to regions close to the stimulation sites. Rather a more general effect across salience, visuospatial and basal ganglia networks was seen, which are all regions involved in WM performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pessoa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Owen et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, the stimulant drug methylphenidate has been shown to enhance WM performance and increase parietal activity in a similar verbal N-back task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tomasi et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that cognitive enhancement produced pharmacologically or electrically may converge on similar neural mechanisms.</p><p>As the maintenance of information in WM relies on the coordination of distant brain regions, the effects of tACS on functional connectivity may inform the mechanisms by which oscillations modulate long-range connectivity. During synchronous stimulation, functional connectivity increased between the IPL-electrode region and frontal parts of the frontoparietal network, that is, DLPFC. Increased frontoparietal functional connectivity has previously been observed during WM processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fell and Axmacher, 2011</xref>), is associated with higher accuracy and faster RTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Prado et al., 2011</xref>), and is linked to increased theta synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liebe et al., 2012</xref>). Our results extend these findings by showing how externally induced theta synchrony can increase frontoparietal interactions between the parietal cortex and DLPFC that are important for WM processing. This pattern was observed when the parietal region was used as a seed, but not for the frontal region. One possible explanation for this finding is that functional connectivity between the frontal and other brain regions was already operating at peak levels in the task periods without stimulation and could not be further modulated by tACS. A more intriguing possibility is that distinct frequency channels are responsible for carrying feedforward and feedback signalling. Such a distinction has been observed in the visual cortex, where feedforward influences are carried by theta and gamma band synchronization, while feedback influences by beta band synchronization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastos et al., 2015</xref>). In this framework, it is possible that tACS applied at the theta frequency would differentially enhance feedforward connectivity across the synchronized fronto-parietal network. Studies combining tACS with electrophysiological methods could help explore this hypothesis.</p><p>While synchronous stimulation resulted in increased functional connectivity between parietal and frontal areas, desynchronous tACS was associated with increased connectivity to occipital regions, which could suggest an increase in information exchange between higher- and low-level areas. The shift in parietal functional connectivity between frontal and posterior regions shows how altering phase synchrony might control long-range network interactions and so shape information flow. One interpretation of our findings is that high WM demands are normally associated with high levels of frontoparietal connectivity, and this can be enhanced by synchronous tACS applied across the network. Disrupting interactions across the network through desynchronous tACS increases parietal connections to the occipital lobe, perhaps as a result of the restoration of a ‘default’ pattern of functional connectivity normally observed in the absence of high levels of top-down cognitive control. This idea is supported by the notion that phase relations among neuronal groups could contribute to selective routing of information and shape effective connectivity, an argument supported by computational models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akam and Kullmann, 2014</xref>) and empirical evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Womelsdorf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Helfrich et al., 2014</xref>). Intracortical recordings show that altered phase relations between brain regions precede changes in neural activity, providing evidence that the influence of synchronizing activity across neuronal groups can be phase dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Womelsdorf et al., 2007</xref>). Converging evidence that this can be externally modulated is provided by the observation that in- and out-of-phase tACS applied in the gamma band modulates inter-hemispheric connectivity and shapes visual perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Helfrich et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our study has a number of limitations. First, there is unbalanced electric field distribution between the tACS conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is a consequence of using a common return electrode. Thus, when current was applied synchronously to the frontal and parietal electrodes the temporal return electrode received the sum of the applied currents to each electrode, while in the desynchronous condition the current in the return electrode is cancelled by the opposing phases of the frontal and parietal electrodes. Nevertheless, although synchronous and desynchronous tACS resulted in different current distributions in the brain, our results could not have been predicted by a current density model. Modulations of brain activity and connectivity were predominantly restricted to areas involved in task performance and no effects were observed in the cortical area underneath the temporal return electrode. These results further demonstrate that the effects of brain stimulation cannot be determined without taking into account the underlying brain dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reato et al., 2013</xref>) and provide additional support for the critical neural state-dependency of tACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feurra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ruhnau et al., 2016</xref>). Second, the area of stimulation was relatively large and potentially affected subregions with complex functional architecture and diverse effects on WM processing. Future work will need to use high-density multi-channel stimulators to improve the focality of the cortical effect of tACS. Third, the optimal frequency and phase is likely to suffer from inter-individual variability. However, the parameter space of possible stimulation regimes is very large and it is likely that other combinations of tACS parameters (that is, frequency, phase, intensity, etc.) will produce greater effects on cognition. The key to unlocking the potential of this technique for clinical use will be to understand the neural mechanisms governing the cognitive effects of the stimulation. Machine-learning techniques combined with real-time imaging could help select the ideal combination of parameters to induce the desired modulation of brain activity/connectivity in a subject-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lorenz et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, while our fMRI approach benefited from good spatial resolution in the absence of complex electrical artifacts, we are not able to specify which brain frequencies were modulated by our intervention, as the correspondence between brain oscillations and BOLD signal is not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Scheeringa et al., 2011</xref>) and tACS might induce cross-frequency coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reato et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Other studies have shown that additional forms of non-invasive transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), particularly transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulate WM performance. The majority of these studies targeted the DLPFC and recent meta-analyses have indicated small but significant effects of tDCS on WM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brunoni and Vanderhasselt, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mancuso et al., 2016</xref>). Broadly, these findings and ours show that tES is capable of modulating the neural processes associated with WM. But are tDCS and tACS acting through similar mechanisms? Although tDCS uses direct instead of an oscillatory current to modulate cortical excitability, anodal tDCS applied to the DLPFC increased oscillatory brain activity in alpha and theta frequency bands in occipito-parietal regions during a verbal WM task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zaehle et al., 2011</xref>). This indicates that the local changes in neuronal excitability induced by tDCS produced interactive effects that resulted in the modulation of oscillatory activity in distant cortical regions. Although this shows that tDCS interacts with the neural mechanisms associated with WM, future studies should carefully consider the biological processes they aim to target, as different tES modalities impact brain excitability to different degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Inukai et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study elegantly demonstrated that WM performance is very sensitive to the external stimulation parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alekseichuk et al., 2016</xref>). A study comparing different tES modalities could help answer this question. Such a study would benefit from applying a similar methodology to the one we employed, in which blocks of short durations of different tES modalities could be combined with fMRI.</p><p>Overall, our findings indicate a direct link between behavioral performance in a demanding working-memory task and large-scale brain synchronization across a right frontoparietal network activated by the task. We showed how manipulations of tACS phase modulate the underlying brain activity and that tACS can influence long-range connectivity in a phase- and brain state- dependent manner. More generally, our work shows the potential of performing simultaneous tACS-fMRI to understand the neural mechanisms underlying externally induced oscillatory synchronization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Experiment 1 included 10 healthy volunteers (six females, age range: 21–40 years, mean age ± SD: 28.6 ± 5.0), all right-handed.

In Experiment 1 participants performed two tasks, the choice-reaction task (CRT) and two versions of the N-back task: 1-back and 2-back. In Experiment 2 participants performed the CRT and the 2-back tasks in separate runs in a block design paradigm, with alternating periods of task (30 s) and fixation at a cross (20 s).</p><p>The CRT is a 2-alternative force choice paradigm used for testing general alertness and motor speed. Participants were instructed to respond as quickly and as accurately as possible, with the right or left index finger, to the presentation of a right or left pointing arrow (size = 3 degrees of visual angle horizontally and 2.26 vertically) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Each trial started with a fixation cross presented centrally (size = 1 × 1 degrees of visual angle) for 350 ms, followed by a left or right arrow (1200 ms) and then by a blank period of 450 ms. Participants performed 180 trials.</p><p>The N-back is a WM task that requires on-line monitoring, and manipulation of remembered information. Participants were presented with a single digit number (0–9) sequentially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Each digit (Arial font style, height was 2 degrees of visual angle) was displayed for 500 ms followed by a fixation (size = 1 × 1 degrees of visual angle) cross for 1500 ms. In the 2-back task participants detected a repetition of the digit occurring two trials before, whereas in the 1-back task they detected whether the stimulus matched the one presented in the previous trial. Target trials occurred in 25% of the trials. Participants performed 270 trials in Experiment 1 and 180 trials in Experiment 2. Subjects were instructed to respond as quickly and as accurately as possible using their right index finger.</p><p>Stimuli were designed using the Psychtoolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brainard, 1997</xref>) for Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA). In Experiment 1 responses were collected through a custom-made response box and in Experiment 2 through a fiberoptic response box (NordicNeuroLab, Norway), interfaced with the stimulus presentation PC.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)</title><p>Stimulation was delivered using two MR-compatible battery-driven stimulators (NeuroConn GmbH, Ilmenau, Germany). The stimulation electrodes (5 cm diameter ‘donut’ shaped rubber electrodes) were positioned with their center locations at F4 and P4 and the return electrode at T8, according to the International 10–20 system. Impedances were kept below 10 kΩ using a conductive paste (Ten20, D.O. Weaver, Aurora, CO, USA), which also held the electrodes in place. Stimulation was sinusoidal, 6 Hz frequency, peak-to-peak amplitude of 1000 μA, and no DC offset.</p><p>TACS was delivered in two different conditions: (1) <italic>Synchronous condition (0°)</italic> – Electrodes F4 and P4 with a 0° phase offset and return electrode at T8; (2) <italic>Desynchronous condition (180°)</italic> – same montage as in the ‘synchronous’ condition, but electrodes F4 and P4 had a 180° phase offset. In both conditions stimulation began with a 1 s ramp-up and ended with a 1s ramp-down. In the desynchronous condition the current in one channel was kept constant at 1000 μA after ramp-up for half a cycle.</p><p>In Experiment 1, participants performed one session of each tACS condition and sham in a pseudo-randomized cross-over design. Each condition was run in separated sessions at least one day apart (range 1–8 days, mean 2.5 ± 1.7). Stimulation was administered for the duration of the tasks, starting at the beginning of each task and finishing when the task was over, total stimulation duration was 26.5 min. During sham sessions, tACS was applied in the synchronous condition for 30 s at the beginning of each task. In Experiment 2, tACS was applied in a pseudo-randomized order for the duration of task (30s) or fixation blocks (20s), where a fixation cross was presented centrally. The application of short trains of tACS has the advantage of allowing the measurement of many periods of neural entrainment without an increase of oscillatory power due to tACS aftereffects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vossen et al., 2015</xref>). Each participant performed one fMRI run of each task and tACS condition (that is, 2-back synchronous tACS, 2-back desynchronous tACS, CRT synchronous tACS and CRT desynchronous tACS). The order of the runs was counterbalanced across participants. In each run participants performed 24 blocks (that is, six blocks/condition: ‘task + tACS ON’, ‘task + tACS OFF’, ‘fixation + tACS ON’, ‘fixation + tACS OFF’- see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Total stimulation duration in Experiment 2 was 20 min (11 min 36 s per run). A subset of participants (n = 13) were questioned after each block whether they perceived the tACS stimulation; the question ‘Have you had stimulation?” appeared on the screen for 4 s accompanied by the words ‘Yes’ in the lower right corner and ‘No’ in the lower left corner; participants were requested to press the corresponding button (right for ‘Yes’ and left for ‘No’). Experiment 2 was optimized to detect neurophysiological changes due to tACS by increasing signal-to-noise ratio and allowing computation of psycho-physiological interaction analyses.</p><p>Stimulators were controlled and monitored through Spike2 software via a Micro1401–3 data acquisition unit (both Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK). The beginning and end of each stimulation block was controlled via an external trigger sent to the Micro1401–3 from the computer running the experimental paradigm (which received TTL triggers from the MR scanner), this ensured that task and stimulation were synchronous to the scanner clock (Experiment 2). The experimental setup for Experiment 2 is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. In brief, the stimulators were placed outside the MR shielded room and the current from the stimulators was delivered into the scanner room after being filtered from RF noise by two filter boxes, one placed in the operator room and another inside the scanner bore, the latter was connected to the stimulation electrodes via a Y-cable. Phantom and pilot experiments were initially conducted to ensure that the experimental setup did not introduce artifacts in the fMRI signal. In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cabral-Calderin et al., 2016</xref>) the tACS montage employed in the study did not cause image artifacts.</p><p>For each subject that took part in Experiment 2 we computed the electric field distributions on the cortex resulting from the two tACS conditions using a realistic finite element model as implemented in SimNibs 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Opitz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Thielscher et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, different tissue types including white matter, grey matter, CSF, skin and skull were segmented and tetrahedral volume meshes of the head were generated using the SimNibs routine. In the case of the synchronous tACS condition three electrodes were included in the model: two anodes (F4 and P4) and one cathode (T8). In the case of the desynchronous tACS condition the current in the cathode is cancelled by the opposing flow of currents in the anodes; this condition was modeled with an anode and a cathode (P4 and F4). The localization of each electrode was defined by transforming the electrode center coordinates in MNI space to the space of the individual meshes (native FreeSurfer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/">http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/</ext-link>) RAS space).

In Experiment 2, participants’ demonstrated low accuracy for correctly detecting stimulation blocks (2-back task: tACS 0° = 34.52% ± 34.26; tACS 180° = 17.86% ± 26.52; CRT task: tACS 0° = 41.03% ± 27.73; tACS 180° = 5.13% ± 21.93), which were explained by participants either perceiving stimulation during non-stimulation periods, or not perceiving the stimulation at all. The latter could possibly be explained by habituation due to frequent short trains of stimulation. Importantly, there was no difference between the accuracy for perceiving stimulation between the synchronous and desynchronous tACS conditions in the 2-back task (t<sub>(13)</sub> = 1.59, p=0.136), indicating that our results were not influenced by participants perceiving the two tACS conditions differently.</p><p>There was no significant difference between tACS conditions (synchronous, desynchronous and sham) for any of the side effects (Chi Square tests), for Experiment 1.

Regressors included: (1) all task periods (task), to explain the variance associated with the task; (2) blocks of tACS stimulation during task; (3) blocks of tACS stimulation during fixation; (4) six movement regressors to account for movement-related noise; and (5) a nuisance regressor for stimulation perception (for subjects where this was assessed). Models were created with psychological terms for tACS stimulation during task, tACS stimulation during fixation and all task periods. For each model, the physiological term and the psychological term were used to create the PPI interaction term, the remaining regressors were also included in the model. The first-level PPIs were then entered into a group-level regression analysis for each model and tested with t-contrasts 1 or −1 to reveal positive or negative PPI effects, respectively. Higher-level analysis were performed for the contrasts: tACS 0° &gt; tACS OFF, tACS 180° &gt; tACS OFF in both directions. The final Z statistical images were thresholded using Gaussian Random Fields based cluster inference with an initial cluster-forming threshold of <italic>Z</italic> &gt; 2.3 and a family-wise error (FWE) corrected cluster-extent threshold of p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analyses were performed using SPSS (PASW Statistics Release 22.0.0) and Matlab (R2013b, MathWorks). For the behavioural tasks we calculated mean reaction times (RT) and accuracy (defined as the percentage of correct responses). Only correct RTs were included in the analysis. RTs were normally distributed (Shapiro–Wilk test) for all subjects and all conditions, with the exception of one subject for the CRT task in the sham condition. Data from this subject was included in the analysis and excluding this subject did not change the results. Analyses of behavioural data were performed using repeated-measures ANOVA and missing data handled using listwise deletion. Thus, data of nineteen participants were included for the behavioural analysis of Experiment 2. Effect sizes were measured by calculating the partial eta squared (η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>) for repeated-measures ANOVAs and Cohen’s d for post hoc t-test comparisons.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Thomas Reed for helping in data acquisition and Dr. Jonathan Howard for methodological and technical assistance.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Sabine Kastner as the Senior Editor.

Prior evidence has suggested that oscillatory activity in these brain regions occurring the theta range (4-8 Hz) is associated with working memory tasks, and that the relative phases of these oscillations impact performance in this domain. Extending prior work in this area, the investigators applied theta (6 Hz) transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)-a technology that can exogenously manipulate neuronal oscillatory activity-to right frontal and parietal regions thought to support working memory. In their first experiment, they found that stimulation enhanced working memory performance, specifically when subjects were engaged in a task in which working memory demands were high (in this case, a 2-back N-back task). In a second experiment, the investigators applied tACS in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and found that synchronous tACS applied during the working memory task increased parietal activity, which in turn correlated with enhanced performance. Moreover, the investigators found that the phase of tACS (synchronous= 00 relative phase; asynchronous= 1800 relative phase) directly influenced functional connectivity between within the presumed right frontoparietal working memory network. Reviewers were generally enthusiastic about this manuscript, and provided comments that were both constructive in nature and readily addressable.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the Introduction, the overarching term 'WM' is used, but only in one place in the Introduction is it noted that verbal WM is tested. It is important to clarify throughout the manuscript that verbal WM is the focus of the paper. A more comprehensive claim about WM in general would require data from multiple types of stimuli.</p><p>2) Methods/Results: In the Experiment 2 behavioral analyses, it is not entirely clear how the authors dealt with the fact that an unequal number of different subjects performed each of the two tasks – especially since it seems that the factor &quot;Task&quot; was treated as a within-subjects variable.</p><p>3) Results: Explain Experiment 2 behavioral results in more detail, specifically to indicate in which direction the changed RT's were linked with tACS condition. Include effect sizes.</p><p>4) In the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>—figure supplement (finite element modeling), please address why superior temporal regions seem to be the most strongly affected here.</p><p>5) Discussion: The authors should provide an explanation as to why the tACS effects were somewhat different in terms of BOLD activity and FC at the two electrode regions (parietal vs. frontal). In particular, why does BOLD activation at the parietal, but not frontal, electrode region correlate with performance? Similarly, why would increased FC within the frontoparietal network during synchronous tACS only be present when the parietal, but not frontal, electrode region is used as the seed? The reason for these differences is not obvious, and therefore should be addressed.</p><p>6) Discussion: Would the authors care to speculate how findings from forms of non-invasive stimulation, e.g., tDCS, relate to the current data? It seems as if this other literature would be relevant to the current Discussion and that it would add breadth to the interested audience.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22001.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) In the Introduction, the overarching term 'WM' is used, but only in one place in the Introduction is it noted that verbal WM is tested.

A more comprehensive claim about WM in general would require data from multiple types of stimuli.</italic></p><p>We have now revised the manuscript to clarify that verbal WM was tested.</p><p><italic>2) Methods/Results: In the Experiment 2 behavioral analyses, it is not entirely clear how the authors dealt with the fact that an unequal number of different subjects performed each of the two tasks – especially since it seems that the factor &quot;Task&quot; was treated as a within-subjects variable.</italic></p><p>The behavioral analysis of Experiment 2 was performed using repeated measures ANOVA. Indeed, due to exclusion criteria there were an unequal number of subjects per task, i.e. twenty-one for the 2-back and twenty for the CRT task. The method employed to deal with missing cases was listwise deletion, meaning that the analysis was performed only including the cases in which all variables were present. Thus, behavioral analysis for Experiment 2 was performed on nineteen subjects for whom both CRT and 2-back data was present. This is now specified in the Methods section (“Statistical analysis”) of the manuscript&quot;:</p><p>“Analyses of behavioral data were performed using repeated-measures ANOVA and missing data handled using listwise deletion. Thus, data of nineteen participants was included for the behavioral analysis of Experiment 2.”</p><p><italic>3) Results: Explain Experiment 2 behavioral results in more detail, specifically to indicate in which direction the changed RT's were linked with tACS condition. Include effect sizes.</italic></p><p>We have now included effect sizes for both Experiment 1 and 2 in the Results section. Effect sizes were measured by calculating the partial eta squared (η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>) for repeated-measures ANOVAs and Cohen’s d for post hoc t-test comparisons. This description was also included in the Methods section.</p><p><italic>4) In the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>—figure supplement (finite element modeling), please address why superior temporal regions seem to be the most strongly affected here.</italic></p><p>This is a consequence of the electrode montage used in the study which caused a unbalanced electric field distribution between the tACS conditions. Similarly to previous studies (Polaniaet al., Curr Biol 2012; 22(14): 1314-8; Polaniaet al., Nat Commun 2015; 6:8090), our montage included a common return electrode. This means that when current was applied synchronously to the frontal and parietal electrodes the temporal return electrode received the sum of the applied currents to each electrode, while in the desynchronous condition the current in the return electrode is cancelled by the opposing phases of the frontal and parietal electrodes. We have now addressed this more clearly in the Discussion section:</p><p>“…there is an unbalanced electric field distribution between the tACS conditions (see figure supplement 1). This is a consequence of using a common return electrode. […] These results further demonstrate that the effects of brain stimulation cannot be determined without taking into account the underlying brain dynamics (Reato et al., 2013) and provide additional support for the critical neural state-dependency of tACS (Feurra et al., 2013, Ruhnau et al., 2016).”</p><p><italic>5) Discussion: The authors should provide an explanation as to why the tACS effects were somewhat different in terms of BOLD activity and FC at the two electrode regions (parietal vs. frontal). In particular, why does BOLD activation at the parietal, but not frontal, electrode region correlate with performance? Similarly, why would increased FC within the frontoparietal network during synchronous tACS only be present when the parietal, but not frontal, electrode region is used as the seed? The reason for these differences is not obvious, and therefore should be addressed.</italic></p><p>One likely explanation for the distinct relationship between regional activity and behavior is that parietal and frontal cortices play distinct roles in verbal WM. A large amount of evidence supports different contributions, which would be expected to influence the effects of brain stimulation on reaction times. For example, evidence suggests that the regions have different contributions to phonological storage and executive control (Paulesuet al., Nature 1993; 362(6418): 342-5).</p><p>Similar relationships between parietal BOLD activity and reaction times have been reported before in working memory tasks. For example, Tomasi et al. observed a correlation between reaction times and BOLD signal in a similar task to ours (Neuroimage 2011; 54(4): 3101-10), while Honey et al. showed a reaction time-BOLD relationship in bilateral posterior parietal cortex (Honeyet al., Neuroimage 2000; 12(5): 495-503). Moreover, in a recent study resting state functional connectivity density in the right parietal lobule negatively correlated with RT for the 2-back task (Liuet al., Behav Brain Res 2017; 316: 66-73). Overall these findings link activity in the parietal cortex to reaction time on working memory tasks.</p><p>The possible explanations for the differential effects of tACS on frontal and parietal regions has now been extended in the Discussion section of the manuscript:</p><p>“The fact that a relationship with response times was observed for the parietal but not the frontal region might be explained by the different roles attributed to parietal and frontal cortices in verbal WM. […] Thus, by increasing neural activity in the parietal region, tACS might have interacted with the physiological mechanisms associated with response production.”</p><p>We also observed distinct effects of stimulation on parietal lobe functional connectivity. There are a number of possible explanations for this. It is possible that the ability to influence functional connectivity by stimulation might vary depending on the baseline state of a brain region. This is likely to vary across brain regions, which would therefore influence the effects of stimulation. For example, if frontal functional connectivity was already operating at peak levels during task periods without stimulation and could not be further modulated by tACS. A more intriguing possibility is that distinct frequency channels are responsible for carrying feedforward and feedback signalling. Such a distinction has been observed in the visual cortex, where feedforward influences are carried by theta and gamma band synchronization, while feedback influences by beta band synchronization (Bastoset al., Neuron 2015; 85(2): 390-401). In this framework it is possible that tACS applied at the theta frequency would differentially enhance feedforward connectivity across the stimulated fronto-parietal network. Further work will be needed to explore this question, for example by combining tACS with electrophysiological methods such as electrocorticography.</p><p>We now include a discussion of these points in the Discussion section of the manuscript:</p><p>“This pattern was observed when the parietal region was used as a seed, but not for the frontal region. […] Studies combining tACS with electrophysiological methods could help explore this hypothesis.”</p><p><italic>6) Discussion: Would the authors care to speculate how findings from forms of non-invasive stimulation, e.g., tDCS, relate to the current data? It seems as if this other literature would be relevant to the current Discussion and that it would add breadth to the interested audience.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have added a paragraph to the Discussion to elaborate on how other forms of non-invasive brain stimulation, particularly tDCS could modulate working memory processes and how those relate to the current data:</p><p>“Other studies have shown that additional forms of non-invasive transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), particularly transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulate WM performance. […] A study comparing different tES modalities could help answer this question. Such a study would benefit from applying a similar methodology to the one we employed, in which blocks of short durations of different tES modalities could be combined with fMRI.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
