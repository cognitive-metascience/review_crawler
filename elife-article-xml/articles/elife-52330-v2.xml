cancer treatments. However, a substantial population of patients is unresponsive. To rescue unresponsive patients, the mechanism of unresponsiveness to PD-1 blockade therapy must be elucidated. Using a ‘bilateral tumor model’ where responsive and unresponsive tumors were inoculated into different sides of the mouse belly, we demonstrated that unresponsive tumors can be categorized into two groups: with and without systemic immunosuppressive property (SIP). The SIP-positive tumors released uncharacterized, non-proteinaceous small molecules that inhibited mitochondrial activation and T cell proliferation. By contrast, the SIP-negative B16 tumor escaped from immunity by losing MHC class I expression. Unresponsiveness of SIP-positive tumors was partially overcome by improving the mitochondrial function with a mitochondrial activator; this was not successful for B16, which employs immune ignorance. These results demonstrated that the ‘bilateral tumor model’ was useful for stratifying tumors to investigate the mechanism of unresponsiveness and develop a strategy for proper combination therapy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Immunotherapy is a fast-emerging treatment area that turns the body’s own immune system against cancer. One powerful group of treatments are the PD-1 blockers. PD-1 is an inducible protein that is sometimes found on healthy immune cells called T cells and normally acts to stop T cells mistakenly attacking healthy cells. However, it can also prevent T cells attacking cancer. This happens when cancer cells make a protein called PD-1 ligand, which interacts with PD-1 to switch off nearby T cells. Antibodies that block PD-1 or PD-1 ligand can reactivate T cells, allowing them to destroy the cancer, but this PD-1 blocking therapy currently works in less than half of all patients who receive the treatment.</p><p>To mount a successful defense against cancer, a T cell needs to be able to perform two key tasks: recognize cancer cells and prepare to attack. T cells are alerted to the presence of the disease by MHC class I proteins on the surface of cancer cells holding up small fragments of molecules that are tell-tale sign that the cell is cancerous. To prepare to attack, a T cell depends on its mitochondria – the powerhouses of the cell – to send a cascade of signals inside the T cell that help it to activate and multiply. It is possible that cancer cells escape PD-1 blocking treatments by interfering with either one of these two tasks. They may either hide their MHC class I proteins to become invisible to passing T cells – a phenomenon known as “local immune ignorance”; or they may release long-range molecules to stop T cells preparing to attack – “systemic immune suppression”.</p><p>To explore these options further, Kumar, Chamoto et al. developed a new tumor model in mice. Each mouse had two tumors, one that responded to PD-1 blocking treatment and one that did not. The idea was that, if the unresponsive tumor was simply hiding from passing T cells, its presence should not affect the other tumor. But, if it was releasing molecules to block T-cell activation, the other tumor could become unresponsive to PD-1 blocking treatment too.</p><p>Kumar, Chamoto et al. examined different types of unresponsive tumor in this model system and found that they fell into two groups. The first group simply hid themselves from nearby T cells, while the second group released molecules to dampen all T cells. The identity of these molecules is unknown, but further experiments suggested that they likely work by blocking the mitochondria in T cells. In mice with these tumors, drugs that boosted mitochondria activity made anti-PD-1 treatment more effective.</p><p>If the findings in this mouse model parallel those in humans, it could open a new research area for immunotherapy. The next step is for researchers need to identify the molecule responsible for systemic immune suppression. This could help to make PD-1 blocking treatments more effective in people who do not currently respond.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cancer

immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade, particularly antibodies against programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1), has made a revolution in cancer treatments as this treatment has durable response even to terminal stage cancers and lesser side-effects compared to the conventional cancer treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brahmer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Couzin-Frankel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hodi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mahoney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Topalian et al., 2015</xref>). The success of clinical trials for the PD-1/PD-L1 axis blockade led the FDA to approve antibodies for PD-1 (e.g. nivolumab, pembrolizumab) or PD-L1 (e.g. Atezolizumab, Avelumab, Durvalumab) for different types of human cancers including metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), squamous cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, hodgkin's lymphoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and recently, for microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) cancers that include many late-stage cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chowdhury et al., 2018a</xref>).</p><p>Despite the impressive success rate of PD-1 blockade therapy, a significant fraction of patients is unresponsive. To further improve its efficacy, we must (i) identify biomarker(s) that predict the responsiveness/unresponsiveness and (ii) develop improved strategy including the combination therapy. For these improvements, we need to understand the mechanism of unresponsiveness to PD-1 blockade therapy. Most studies on biomarkers and resistance mechanisms have focused only on the tumor’s intrinsic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cristescu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ribas, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rieth and Subramanian, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wellenstein and de Visser, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zou et al., 2016</xref>). We need to elucidate the mechanism for unresponsiveness related to immune effector T cells to understand the complicated interaction between cancer and immunity. Several studies have worked on the unresponsive mechanism from the immunity side in different models. In one such model, the ‘Cold and Hot tumor hypothesis’, tumors can be roughly classified as ‘immunologically hot (inflamed)’ with an abundance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and ‘immunologically cold (noninflamed)’ with an absence of a sufficient population of pre-existing immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonaventura et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van der Woude et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, some groups claim that clinical failures in many patients could be due to an imbalance between T-cell reinvigoration and tumor burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borcoman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, the major immune effector cells for attacking tumors, are subject to negative regulation by multiple mechanisms in tumor-bearing hosts. Some of the well-known negative regulatory cells and soluble factors include myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), innate lymphoid cells (ILC), tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), regulatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Tregs), regulatory B cells (Bregs), transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), interleukin-10 (IL-10), adenosine, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and L-Kynurenine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Artis and Spits, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeNardo and Ruffell, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Facciabene et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sarvaria et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tauriello et al., 2018</xref>). Lack of MHC class I and neo-antigen on tumor cells also cause unresponsiveness because T cells cannot recognize the tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garrido et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McGranahan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rodríguez, 2017</xref>). The tumor microenvironment, influenced by the above mechanisms, allows tumor cells to escape from immune attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeNardo and Ruffell, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Russo and Protti, 2017</xref>). Due to this complexity of tumor and immunity interactions, it is difficult to determine which tumor employs which immune escape mechanism.</p><p>Energy metabolism mediated by mitochondrial activity regulates the fate of T cells. It has been reported that mitochondria play an important role in antigen-specific T cell activation through signaling of mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mallilankaraman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Murphy and Siegel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sena et al., 2013</xref>). We recently reported that mitochondria are activated in tumor-reactive CTLs during PD-1 blockade therapy in MC38 tumor-bearing hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chamoto et al., 2017</xref>). Boosting fatty acid oxidation with a metabolic modulator enhanced the PD-1 blockade effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chowdhury et al., 2018b</xref>). Therefore, attenuation of the mitochondrial activity of T cells by tumor-mediated factors could be an immune escape mechanism.</p><p>In this study, we developed a novel approach using a ‘bilateral tumor model’ and studied the immunosuppressive nature of unresponsive tumors to PD-1 blockade therapy. This model allowed us to categorize unresponsive tumors into two: those which have immune ignorance properties at tumor local sites and the others which have systemic immunosuppressive properties (SIP). SIP is mediated by small molecules to downregulate mitochondrial function directly and to inhibit T cell proliferation. Boosting the mitochondrial activity by the addition of bezafibrate, a pan-PPAR agonist, partially improved the efficacy of the PD-1 blockade against unresponsive tumors with SIP but not for tumors with immune ignorance at the local site.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Different immune responses between hosts with responsive and unresponsive tumors</title><p>We first determined which tumor was responsive and unresponsive using an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) to block PD-1 signal (PD-1 blockade) or the <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Although there are many unresponsive mechanisms, cancers employ at least two strategies to escape from the immune attack: local or systemic immune suppression. Some reports have suggested ‘hot tumors’ and ‘cold tumors’ to distinguish responsive and unresponsive tumors based on the level of immune cell infiltration in the tumor mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van der Woude et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is difficult to explain the molecular mechanisms of unresponsiveness by this definition because it explains the results of immune responses in local tumor areas, but not the induction phase of immune escape.</p><p>In this paper, we employed the bilateral tumor inoculation model, which can distinguish local immune ignorance from systemic immune suppression, and categorized unresponsive tumors into two groups, with or without SIP. Small molecule(s) with less than 3 kDa size which is released from SIP-positive tumors appear to attenuate mitochondria-mediated energy metabolism in T cells. We rule out the known factors such as suppressive cytokines, adenosine, Prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>) and kynurenine. Tumor cells show dysregulated cellular metabolism and the metabolic products often induce immune suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeBerardinis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Munn and Mellor, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vazquez et al., 2016</xref>). Although it has been reported that methyl-nicotinamide (MNA), which is converted by nicotinamide N-methyl-transferase (NNMT), acts as an immune suppressive factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gebicki et al., 2003</xref>), this compound showed no suppression at physiological levels (data not shown). Other metabolites could be candidates, which are derived from the tumor’s metabolic activity.</p><p>For successful PD-1 blockade therapy, the ‘tumor-immunity cycle’ needs to operate smoothly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Mellman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pio et al., 2019</xref>). Hindrance in the pathway at any step of antigen recognition, activation, recruitment and killing at the tumor site, DLN or bloodstream would lead to the unresponsive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mushtaq et al., 2018</xref>). DLN is generally considered as a place where naïve T cells are primed to effector T cells. Our bilateral tumor model analysis suggests that LLC systemically inhibits T cell priming at DLN of responsive tumor sides via suppressive factors, but B16 does not. However, it seems to contradict that T cells in DLN on the side of B16 were not activated in spite of the deficiency of SIP. This observation suggests that tumor recognition by the local tumor area is critical to trigger T cell priming in DLN and to establish a successful tumor-immunity cycle. Therefore, tumors lacking MHC take advantage of the ignorance or escape mechanism not only in the local tumor area but also in DLN. Given that LLC expresses MHC and is sensitive to the acquired immunity to some extent, it is reasonable that LLC but not B16 is susceptible to the combination therapy.</p><p>Mitochondrial activation is essential for the full activation of T cells. In our in vitro assay system for mitochondrial activities, we stimulated naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by anti-(CD3+CD28) mAb beads because CD28 in addition to CD3 signal is necessary for robust mitochondrial activation during the proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klein Geltink et al., 2017</xref>). Although our OCR data suggest that the suppressive factors downregulate the mitochondrial activity, ECAR also severely inhibited. Therefore, the suppressive factors may inhibit glycolysis, resulting in the attenuation of subsequent OXPHOS reactions. This hypothesis agrees with the fact that T cells rely on glycolysis more than OXPHOS when they differentiate from naïve to effector T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Menk et al., 2018</xref>). Another possible mechanism for suppression of mitochondrial function by the suppressive factors is inhibition of the downstream signals of CD3 and/or CD28 because these two signals are necessary for the upregulation of glycolysis and OXPHOS in T cells.</p><p>In this work, we applied bezafibrate to unresponsive LLC or CT26 tumors. We found this combination therapy partially restored the PD-1 blockade effect per the in vitro assays where bezafibrate partially removed the mitochondrial inhibition by the suppressive factors in the supernatant. This partial effect suggests that under the situation of ‘brake’ induced by the suppressive factors, the ‘acceleration’ by PGC-1α/PPAR activation would not fully work. To obtain the maximum benefit, we need to define the suppressive factors and remove the ‘brake’. Our data suggest the possibility of unknown small molecules for suppressive factors. The purification of this small molecule by bio-assays will enable us to identify its structure by mass spectrometry. Once we know such a compound, we may be able to find the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of this product and target them for combinatorial treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6N and BALB/c inbred mice were purchased from ‘The Charles River Laboratories, Japan (Kanagawa, Japan)’. <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> inbred mice lines were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Institute of Laboratory Animals, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University.

On the day of the experiment, all chemicals (e.g. Oligomycin, FCCP, and Rotenone/Antimycin A) were prepared in OCR media as per the manufacturer’s recommendation and the machine was calibrated using the calibrant buffer in the calibrant plate prior to the experiment. 400 thousand cells per well were seeded in the precoated XF<sup>e</sup>96 plate and the OCR/ECAR was measured. Different parameters from the OCR graph were calculated. ATP turnover was defined as follows: (last rate measurement before oligomycin) - (minimum rate measurement after oligomycin injection). Maximal respiration was defined as follows: (maximum rate measurement after FCCP) - (non-mitochondrial respiration). Spare respiratory capacity (SRC) was calculated by subtracting basal respiration from maximal respiration. We measured the ECAR value in the same well, which contained an optimal glucose level so the basal ECAR (or glycolysis) value is the reading we obtained immediately before oligomycin injection. We prepared the assay medium as described in the XF cell Mito Stress Test Kit (Kit 103015–100). The glucose concentration in this medium is 10 mM. In the classical glycolytic assay procedure (glucose-free media) the final concentration of glucose added to the port was 10 mM while measuring flux. The basal ECAR value in this classical method is calculated by subtracting the last rate measurement before the glucose injection from the maximum rate measurement before the oligomycin injection, which gives essentially the same value if calculated by our method. Glycolytic capacity was defined as the rate measured after the oligomycin injection.

attenuating the mitochondrial activity in T cells escape from PD-1 blockade therapy&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Guest Reviewing Editor and Jeffrey Settleman as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Madhusudhanan Sukmar (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Kumar A et al. described non-protein (heat stable) small molecule (less than 3kDa) soluble factors from murine tumor cells might be responsible for systemic T cell suppression through impairment of mitochondrial activity in vitro and in vivo by using bilateral transplanted in vivo tumor models and various metabolic and mitochondria assays. The authors classified responsive tumors (MC38 and GL271 in B6 mice, MethA in BALB/c mice) and unresponsive tumors (LLC and Pan02 in B6, CT26 in BALB/c) with this soluble factor mechanism. (B16 is an unresponsive tumor due to MHC loss, not due to soluble factors). The factors also downregulated glycolysis as evidenced by decreased ECAR. The mitochondrial activators bezafibrate partially reversed this immunosuppression in vivo. The authors concluded that such a soluble factor from tumor cells is one of the systemic immunosuppressive mechanisms through impairment of energy metabolism of T cells, and may be responsible for unresponsiveness of some cancers to PD-1 blockade.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This is an intriguing study showing that soluble factors from tumor cells systemically inhibit energy metabolism of anti-tumor T cells. Although the authors clearly demonstrated presence of non-protein small molecule soluble factors derived from some of the PD-1 Ab unresponsive murine tumor cell lines in multiple tumors and mice, some of the results are duplication of the previous reports such as the authors' own work (bezafibrates and mitochondrial activation potentiating immunotherapy) and others' reports such as T cell suppression by small molecules from tumor cells, and unresponsiveness of B16 through MHC class I loss. Therefore, the responsible molecules may be identified or their unique activity on energy metabolic pathway different from the previously reported immunosuppressive factors should be shown.</p><p>2) It is not clear whether the new soluble factors (systemic immunosuppressive property (SIP) factor) really affect specifically on energy metabolism including mitochondrial activity and glycolysis. The factors might non-specifically inhibit T cell activation and proliferation, resulting in impaired energy metabolism. Without identification of the molecules, the authors need to show the unique property of the factors that preferential inhibit energy metabolism pathway, not other T cell activation signaling and pathway, etc. Because the authors clearly showed multiple responsive and unresponsive murine tumor cell lines, comparative studies of metabolome for responsible molecules, and transcriptome for responsible enzymes and pathways, may be performed, and the results will lead to the mechanistic insights for the authors' intriguing findings and lead to the major advance in cancer immunology.</p><p>3) It is important to clarify if the impairment of mitochondrial activity by the SIP factors is dependent on PGC-1α and mitochondria biogenesis, because the authors and others (Scharping et al. Immunity 2016) have previously shown that mitochondrial biogenesis is inhibited in T cells, and bezafibrate enhances PGC-1α expression.</p><p>4) The authors analyzed T cells only in draining lymph nodes and T cell induction level. It is also important to analyze the effects on effector T cells in tumors. Transcriptional profiling of T cells cultured with boiled LLC supernatant for various times will provide some insights into the nature of the SIP factors.</p><p>5) The timing of implant of unresponsive tumors and responsive tumors in in vivo experiments may be changed. For example, responsive tumors on day 0, followed by injection of unresponsive tumors on day 6. The experiments will characterize the nature of the SIP factors.</p><p>6) Because the SIP factors inhibited T cells in vitro, similar activity is also be evaluated in various human cancer cell lines.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52330.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This is an intriguing study showing that soluble factors from tumor cells systemically inhibit energy metabolism of anti-tumor T cells.

In this paper, we have worked on the unresponsive mechanism. We first showed that bezafibrate in combination with PD-L1 mAb treatment improves the survival of the mice with unresponsive tumor (LLC and CT26), which produce T cell mitochondria-suppressive factors.</p><p>We tested the possibility of small molecules, which were previously reported (e.g., adenosine, PGE2 and kynurenine) to inhibit T cell proliferation. We quantified tumor cells transcript levels of responsible enzyme for above small molecules (e.g., surface enzymes CD39 and CD73 for generating adenosine and AMP; COX2 and mPGES1 for prostaglandin E2; IDO1 for generating suppressive factors after tryptophan degradation). However, we could not find a quantitative correlation between SIP-positive property and transcripts associated with above factor (please see Figure 6—figure supplement 4). Texts are updated in the manuscript (subsection “Secretion of immune inhibitory small molecules from SIP-positive tumors”, last paragraph).</p><p>Regarding ‘B16 through MHC class I loss’, we think these data are necessary due to the following two reasons: 1) it is known that B16 has different sublines that vary in their phenotypic expression according to laboratories. We need to specify the phenotype and unresponsive mechanism of our B16. 2) Contrast between B16 and LLC is important to confirm that LLC employ systemic immunosuppressive mechanism, but not local ignorance. We added this point in the subsection “The immunotherapy-resistant B16 tumor employs local immunological ignorance”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not clear whether the new soluble factors (systemic immunosuppressive property (SIP) factor) really affect specifically on energy metabolism including mitochondrial activity and glycolysis. The factors might non-specifically inhibit T cell activation and proliferation, resulting in impaired energy metabolism.

We found mitochondrial mass, potential, superoxide and cellular ROS were downregulated in the presence of LLC supernatant within 2 hours. This result indicates that LLC soluble suppressive factors inhibit mitochondria directly, but not mediated by cellular transcriptional activity. Further, to examine whether the mitochondrial inhibition by LLC SIP factor is specific to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells or non-specifically inhibit mitochondria, we performed the same experiment on purified B cells (B220<sup>+</sup> cells). We found the mitochondrial phenotype of B cells was reduced when cocultured with LLC supernatants but not with B16 supernatants. Therefore, LLC SIP factors inhibit mitochondria directly in general although they would affect less on cancer cells as they rely majorly upon glycolysis for energy demand. We have added these results in Figure 6F and Figure 6—figure supplement 3 and updated the manuscript text accordingly (subsection “Secretion of immune inhibitory small molecules from SIP-positive tumors”, second paragraph; Figure 6F legend).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is important to clarify if the impairment of mitochondrial activity by the SIP factors is dependent on PGC-1α and mitochondria biogenesis, because the authors and others (Scharping et al. Immunity 2016) have previously shown that mitochondrial biogenesis is inhibited in T cells, and bezafibrate enhances PGC-1α expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Since suppressive factors are downregulating the mitochondria in 2 hours, it is unlikely that PGC-1α protein expression or other transcription factors are involved. Indeed, the mRNA levels of PGC-1α/β in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells did not change in 2 hours when cocultured with supernatant as shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 3A. We updated the text in the revised manuscript accordingly (subsection “Secretion of immune inhibitory small molecules from SIP-positive tumors”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors analyzed T cells only in draining lymph nodes and T cell induction level. It is also important to analyze the effects on effector T cells in tumors. Transcriptional profiling of T cells cultured with boiled LLC supernatant for various times will provide some insights into the nature of the SIP factors.</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed T cells in tumor as well as draining lymph node. As shown in Figure 1E-F, Figure 2B-C, effector functions of intra-tumor T cells (T-bet and IFN-γ) and mitochondria activation parameters were higher in PD-1 blockade group compared to ctrl IgG group in responsive tumor-bearing hosts. As mentioned above in our response to comment #2, the suppressive factor inhibits mitochondria directly. It is unlikely that there will be drastic change in transcriptome in such a short time as 2 hours. Indeed, the transcript level of PGC-1α did not change as we have mentioned before.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The timing of implant of unresponsive tumors and responsive tumors in in vivo experiments may be changed. For example, responsive tumors on day 0, followed by injection of unresponsive tumors on day 6. The experiments will characterize the nature of the SIP factors.</p></disp-quote><p>We think swapping of tumors would not provide further insight in understanding the mechanism of unresponsiveness. Our purpose is to understand the immunosuppression caused by unresponsive tumors on the host’s immune response. We have experienced that when the responsive tumor got big size on day 8-9, PD-1 blockade effect became weak (data not shown). In such situation, it is difficult to address the properties of SIP factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Because the SIP factors inhibited T cells in vitro, similar activity is also be evaluated in various human cancer cell lines.</p></disp-quote><p>As per reviewers’ advice, we performed in vitro proliferation assay using the supernatants from human cancer cells. We found supernatants from some human cancer cell lines (like Colo205, ES2) inhibits T cells proliferation while some do not (like DU145, A549). We have included these data as ‘Figure 6—figure supplement 2’ and updated in the revised manuscript at relevant places (subsection “Secretion of immune inhibitory small molecules from SIP-positive tumors”, first paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
