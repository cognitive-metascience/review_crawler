In this study, we demonstrate Kirrel3 regulates target-specific synapse formation at hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) synapses, which connect dentate granule (DG) neurons to both CA3 and GABAergic neurons. Here, we show Kirrel3 is required for formation of MF filopodia; the structures that give rise to DG-GABA synapses and that regulate feed-forward inhibition of CA3 neurons. Consequently, loss of Kirrel3 robustly increases CA3 neuron activity in developing mice. Alterations in the Kirrel3 gene are repeatedly associated with intellectual disabilities, but the role of Kirrel3 at synapses remained largely unknown. Our findings demonstrate that subtle synaptic changes during development impact circuit function and provide the first insight toward understanding the cellular basis of Kirrel3-dependent neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09395.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09395.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09395.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nerve cells in the brain connect to each other via junctions called synapses to form vast networks that process information. Much like streets can be joined with stop signs, traffic lights, or exit ramps depending on the flow of traffic, different types of synapses control the flow of information along nerves in distinct ways.</p><p>In a region of the brain called the hippocampus, nerve cells called DG neurons are connected to other neurons by two different types of synapses. One type of synapse allows the DG neurons to activate CA3 neurons, while the second type allows the DG neurons to activate GABAergic neurons. These same GABAergic neurons can then inhibit the activity of the CA3 neurons. Therefore, through these two different types of synapses, DG neurons can both increase and decrease the activity of the CA3 neurons. This delicate balance of activity across the two types of DG synapses is very important for the hippocampus to work properly, which is critical for our ability to learn and remember.</p><p>Mutations in the gene that encodes a protein called Kirrel3 are associated with autism, Jacobsen's syndrome, and other disorders that affect intellectual ability in humans. Kirrel3 is similar to a protein found in roundworms that regulates the formation of synapses, but it is not known if it plays the same role in humans and other mammals. Now, Martin, Muralidhar et al. studied the role of Kirrel3 in mice.</p><p>The experiments show that Kirrel3 is produced in both the DG neurons and the GABAergic neurons, but not the CA3 neurons. Young mutant mice that lacked Kirrel3 made fewer synapse-forming structures between DG neurons and GABAergic neurons than normal mice, but the synapses that connect DG neurons to CA3 neurons formed normally. This disrupted the balance of activity across the two types of DG synapses and the CA3 neurons in the mutant mice were over-active.</p><p>Together, Martin, Muralidhar et al.'s findings show that altering the levels of Kirrel3 can alter the balance of synapses in the hippocampus. This may explain how even very small changes in synapse formation during brain development can have a big impact on nerve cell activity. The next challenge is to understand exactly how Kirrel3 helps build synapses, which may lead to the development of new drugs that help to rebalance brain activity in people that lack Kirrel3.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09395.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09395.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>Kirrel3</kwd><kwd>cell adhesion</kwd><kwd>synaptic specificity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH105426</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Megan E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001391</institution-id><institution>Whitehall Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3 year grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Megan E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

Therefore, neurons usually send and receive neural information with different synaptic partners. One way neurons differentially regulate activity among partners is by forming different types of synapses with each partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Williams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emes and Grant, 2012</xref>). This kind of synaptic target specificity is exquisitely exemplified by hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) synapses. MF synapses connect glutamatergic dentate granule (DG) neurons to glutamatergic CA3 neurons and GABAergic interneurons (GABA neurons). The main DG-CA3 synapse consists of a giant presynaptic bouton apposed to a multi-headed CA3 spine called a thorny excrescence (TE). In addition, filopodia project from the main bouton and synapse with nearby GABA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frotscher, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acsády et al., 1998</xref>). Filopodial MF synapses mediate feed-forward inhibition of CA3 neurons and are essential for hippocampal function during learning and memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Torborg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ruediger et al., 2011</xref>). Although main bouton and filopodial MF synapses are physically linked, they have different molecular and functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Toth et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McBain, 2008</xref>). This suggests DG neurons utilize specific cues to construct different types of synapses with CA3 and GABA neurons, but the identity of the target-specific cues is unknown.</p><p>Kirrel1, 2, and 3 (also known as Neph1, 3, and 2, respectively) are transmembrane immunoglobulin superfamily members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In mice, Kirrels have been studied during formation of the kidney slit diaphragm, an adhesive cell junction for filtering blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Donoviel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">George and Holzman, 2012</xref>) and in axon targeting of the olfactory and vomeronasal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Serizawa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Prince et al., 2013</xref>). In humans, copy number variations and exonic point mutations in the Kirrel3 gene are associated with intellectual disability, autism, and Jacobsen's syndrome, a rare developmental disorder that often includes intellectual disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhalla et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guerin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Michaelson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Neale et al., 2012</xref>).

Here, we demonstrate Kirrel3 is a target-specific cue at MF synapses. Kirrel3 specifically regulates development of DG-GABA MF filopodia, which are necessary to constrain excitatory drive to CA3 neurons after DG stimulation.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09395.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Kirrel3 is a synaptic molecule that mediates homophilic, trans-cellular adhesion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Synaptosomes from mouse hippocampi from P9, P21, and adult (P55) were immunoblotted for indicated proteins. lys; lysate. syn; synaptosome. 2 μg protein per lane.

Kirrel3 protein is enriched in synaptosomes prepared from hippocampal lysates with greatest enrichment at postnatal day (P) 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Next, we obtained Kirrel3 knockout mice, which were recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Prince et al., 2013</xref>) and prepared hippocampal neuron cultures from newborn wild-type and knockout mice. In hippocampal neurons cultured for 14 days in vitro (DIV), Kirrel3 localizes to puncta adjacent to the pre- and post-synaptic markers vGlut1 and MAGUK in wild-type but not knockout neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). This suggests that, like cadherins, Kirrel3 localizes to perisynaptic adhesion zones rather than the synaptic cleft. To determine if Kirrel3 is axonal, dendritic, or both, we analyzed the distribution of surface-expressed FLAG-Kirrel3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) in sparsely transfected neurons using live labeling. Surface FLAG-Kirrel3 is seen as puncta on axons and dendrites of 14DIV neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>). Moreover, even prior to synaptogenesis in 4DIV neurons, FLAG-Kirrel3 already has a punctate distribution in axons and dendrites and clusters at axon–dendrite contact points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>Kirrels can function via homophilic binding or heterophilic binding to nephrin, another Ig superfamily member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Serizawa et al., 2006</xref>). However, neither nephrin nor the other Kirrel family members, Kirrel1 and Kirrel2, have appreciable expression in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Putaala et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We noticed Kirrel3 clusters at cell junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>) and therefore we directly tested the adhesive ability of Kirrel3 homophilic interactions using a cell aggregation assay. We demonstrate Kirrel3 mediates trans-cellular homophilic binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, our data indicate Kirrel3 is present at early axon–dendrite contacts, localizes at or near synapses, and is a bona fide homophilic adhesion molecule, all of which implicate Kirrel3 in synapse development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Hippocampal DG and GABA neurons express Kirrel3</title><p>Next, we determined which hippocampal neurons express Kirrel3. In developing P14 and adult hippocampi, Kirrel3 mRNA is present in two cell types: (1) DG neurons and (2) scattered cells of the hilus and area CA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Correspondingly, Kirrel3 protein is present in the molecular and stratum lucidum layers of the hippocampus, containing DG dendrites and axons, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). It is also present in scattered cells of the hilus and area CA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and faintly in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare, which contains axons from entorhinal cortex. No Kirrel3 signal was detected in knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Instead, Kirrel3 knockout mice have farnesylated GFP in frame after exon 1 so they express membrane-associated GFP instead of Kirrel3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Prince et al., 2013</xref>). Examination of GFP expression in knockout mice indicates that again, Kirrel3 is selectively expressed by DG neurons and scattered cells of area CA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–O</xref>). Notably, we never observe GFP expression in CA3 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09395.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Hippocampal DG and GABA neurons express Kirrel3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>D</bold>) In situ hybridizations for Kirrel3 mRNA on adult P60–P70 hippocampal sections from WT (<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) and KO (<bold>D</bold>) mice.

This suggests they may be GABAergic interneurons. To test this, we co-stained P14 Kirrel3 heterozygous and knockout mice with antibodies against GFP to identify Kirrel3-expressing cells and GABA to identify GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–S</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We find that nearly all Kirrel3-expressing cells express GABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2S</xref>). Conversely, about 20% of all GABA neurons in area CA3 express Kirrel3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2S</xref>). We also co-stained with several common GABA neuron markers and find that two thirds (about 67%) of Kirrel3/GABA neurons express calbindin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P–S</xref>) and these Kirrel3-positive neurons make up about half of all calbindin-positive interneurons. Notably, glutamatergic DG neurons also highly express Kirrel3 and calbindin, providing a shared molecular profile between these neuronal populations. Kirrel3 cell populations are similar in P14 Kirrel3 heterozygous and knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that complete loss of Kirrel3 does not change cell fate or induce cell death of the neurons examined.

To test this, we analyzed MF presynaptic morphology in Kirrel3 wild-type and knockout mice at P14, the peak of MF synaptogenesis. DiI crystals were placed in the DG cell body layer of fixed brains. After 1 week, dye diffuses along DG axons and labels MF presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–G</xref>).

Mice were either removed from the home cage for immediate fixation (no stim) or allowed to explore an enriched environment for 25 min prior to fixation (stim). At this age, basal, unstimulated cFos expression is low regardless of genotype, but with stimulation, P14 knockout mice have a twofold increase in cFos-positive CA3 neurons compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). As a control, mice were recorded and exploration was comparable between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, the number of cFos-positive neurons did not significantly increase in wild-type mice after stimulation but this is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Waters et al., 1997</xref>) and likely reflects that at P14 the CA3 is dominated by inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, note wild-type E/I ratio is &lt;1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Torborg et al., 2010</xref>). Because Kirrel3 is expressed by entorhinal cortex axons that innervate the hippocampus, we also generally examined inputs to CA3 and DG neurons by recording miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). No significant differences between wild-type and Kirrel3 knockout neurons in mEPSC amplitude or frequency were found for either cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, our functional data support the hypothesis that Kirrel3 selectively regulates formation of filopodial DG-GABA MF synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Morphological defects in MF synapses persist in Kirrel3 knockout mice</title><p>MF synapse complexity peaks at P14 and is refined such that adult synapses have fewer filopodia and a larger main bouton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wilke et al., 2013</xref>). To investigate MF synapse maturation under sustained loss of Kirrel3, we analyzed MF morphology in adult (P60–P75) wild-type and knockout mice. Both genotypes have fewer filopodia as adults than at P14 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), suggesting age-dependent filopodia refinement is Kirrel3-independent. However, while P14 knockout mice have fewer filopodia with a normal main bouton, adult knockout mice have fewer filopodia and a smaller main bouton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–J</xref>). Thus, MF synapse defects worsen with age in Kirrel3 knockout mice. It is possible Kirrel3 is directly required for main bouton maturation or maintenance, but Kirrel3 is not expressed by CA3 neurons. Another possibility is that defects in the main bouton in adult knockout mice result from compensatory mechanisms enacted to dampen the dramatic increase in CA3 neuron excitability during development. To test this, we analyzed cFos expression in adult mice to determine if knockout CA3 neuron activity returns to normal. In support, unstimulated and stimulated cFos expression in CA3 neurons is similar between P60 adult wild-type and knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, our data suggest a model in which a reduction in MF filopodia during development leads to hyper-activation of CA3 neurons that, with time, causes homeostatic mechanisms to decrease the size of the main DG-CA3 MF synapse and return overall CA3 activity levels to a set point. This model remains to be tested in more detail in future studies. Interestingly, a battery of behavioral tests was recently performed on adult Kirrel3 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2015</xref>). Kirrel3 knockout mice have only mild hyperactivity and a moderate impairment in novel object recognition compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2015</xref>). Our results indicate CA3 neuron activity is significantly impaired in 14-day-old animals but returns to normal by 2 months of age. This may explain why adult Kirrel3 knockout mice have only moderate behavioral impairments and suggests that younger animals may have more severe behavioral problems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In summary, we demonstrate Kirrel3 is required for normal development of MF filopodia, the synaptic structures connecting DG and GABA neurons. Because Kirrel3 is a homophilic adhesion molecule expressed by DG neurons and calbindin-positive GABA neurons in hippocampal area CA3, our work suggests trans-cellular Kirrel3 interactions may stabilize MF filopodia contact and subsequent synapse formation between Kirrel3-expressing cells. Functionally, we demonstrate Kirrel3 is required to maintain feed-forward inhibition and constrain CA3 neuron activity in young animals. Although a few molecules have been shown to generally affect MF presynapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Danzer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Williams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lanore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wilke et al., 2012</xref>), Kirrel3 is among the first shown to selectively act on MF filopodia and our results provide evidence that main and filopodial MF synapse formation can be uncoupled. The role of calbindin-positive GABA neurons in the hippocampus is little studied, but our findings suggest they may receive a substantial fraction of DG MF input and be a critical component of feed-forward inhibitory circuits regulating CA3 activity.</p><p>Given that alterations in the Kirrel3 gene are associated with autism and intellectual disabilities, this work provides the first insight into cellular mechanisms that may underlie Kirrel3-dependent neurological disorders. Our work suggests Kirrel3 loss selectively reduces excitatory synapses made onto inhibitory neurons in hippocampal area CA3. Consequently, CA3 neurons are over-active in young Kirrel3 knockout animals. Altered E/I ratios are hypothesized to underlie neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baroncelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fakhoury, 2015</xref>), and our work suggests this may be an important circuit defect of Kirrel3-associated diseases. Interestingly, such a strong imbalance probably would not occur if all synapses were equally impaired. In this way, loss of synaptic specificity molecules can cause widespread circuit dysfunction. There is much evidence that hippocampal circuits are altered in autism and intellectual disabilities, but it is likely not the only brain region affected in these complex neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Philip et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zoghbi and Bear, 2012</xref>). Kirrel3 is also expressed by specific populations of neurons outside the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, Kirrel3 may also regulate formation of other specific types of synapses throughout the brain, which may further contribute to its association with neurodevelopmental disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse lines</title><p>Generation of the Kirrel3 knockout mouse line was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Prince et al., 2013</xref>).

Kirrel3-F<sub>c</sub> was transfected into HEK293 cells using PEI. Cells were incubated in OptiMEM (Life Technologies) media for 5 days. Then, the Kirrel3-F<sub>c</sub>-conditioned media was harvested and concentrated using Amicon Ultra filter units (Millipore). Kirrel3-F<sub>c</sub> concentration was estimated by Western blot using known concentrations of purified F<sub>c</sub> (Jackson Immuno) as a standard. Kirrel3-F<sub>c</sub> was pre-clustered by incubating it in OptiMEM plus anti-human Cy3 secondary antibodies at 1:100. Kirrel3-F<sub>c</sub> and control F<sub>c</sub> (used at ∼1 μg/ml) were then tested for binding to transfected HEK293 cells using the live label immunostaining method described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Synaptosome preparation</title><p>Synaptosomes were prepared according to methods described by Jones and Matus with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jones and Matus, 1974</xref>). Briefly, hippocampi were dissected from mice. Tissue was homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer (20% wt/vol) in ice-cold 0.32 M sucrose +20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 supplemented with protease inhibitors. Homogenates were cleared by spinning at 1000×<italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was spun at 17,000×<italic>g</italic> for 15 min. The pellet containing crude synaptosomes was resuspended in 0.32 M sucrose and 20 mM HEPES. Protein concentration was quantified with a BCA assay (Thermo Scientific). 2 μg of synaptosomal or cleared lysate proteins was loaded per lane for Western blot analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Western blot</title><p>Proteins were run on Bis-Tris gradient acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the iBlot system (Life Technologies). Membranes were incubated in blocking solution (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 3% wt/vol dry milk powder, and 0.05% Tween-20) for 10–60 min, primary antibody overnight at 4°C, washed, incubated in HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immuno) for 1 hr at room temperature and then detected using the Bio-Rad Clarity ECL kit on a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS+ imaging system. To prepare hippocampal lysates, 100 mg of hippocampal tissue was homogenized in 1 ml of reducing sample buffer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>MF presynapse analysis</title><p>DiI crystals (Life Technologies) were placed in the DG of perfused hippocampi and incubated at 37°C in 2% PFA for 1 week. MF synapses from the suprapyramidal bundle in area CA3a/b were imaged, deconvolved in AutoQuant3 (Bitplane), and analyzed in ImageJ. Filopodia length was analyzed in 3D using the Simple Neurite Tracer plug-in, while area and perimeter of the main bouton were analyzed in 2D.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Microiontophoresis and spine analysis</title><p>Neurons were microinjected with fluorescent dye as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dumitriu et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, P21 pups were perfused with 1% PFA in phosphate buffer (PB) for 1 min, followed by 4% PFA with 0.125% glutaraldehyde in PB for 9 min. The brains were extracted and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min. 200 μm-thick coronal hippocampal slices were cut on a vibratome. Slices were submerged in 0.1 M PB and viewed through an Olympus BX51WI microscope coupled to a light source and fluorescent filters. High-resistance (150–250 MΩ) glass pipettes were pulled on a Flaming/Brown P-97 Sutter pipette puller and backfilled with 10 mM Alexa568 (dissolved in 200 mM KCl, Life Technologies). The pipettes were mounted on a micromanipulator connected to an S44 Grass square pulse stimulator. The pipette tip was gently advanced in tissue towards the cell of interest. On contact and penetration, a step stimulus of 1–5 V was used to inject the dye in the cell. Filled neurons were imaged on a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>cFos analysis</title><p>P14 and adult P60 wild-type and knockout mice were either removed from the home cage for immediate fixation by transcardial perfusion (unstimulated) or allowed to explore an enriched environment for 25 min prior to fixation (stimulated). The enriched environment consisted of mice placed individually into a 40 × 40 clear plastic box containing five novel objects spaced 10 cm apart. Mice were allowed to explore freely for 25 min. Immunostaining was conducted as described in the above methods.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Image analysis and statistics</title><p>When possible, experiments were conducted by an experimenter blind to condition or genotype. Sample sizes were based on previous experiments or power analysis. Statistics were calculated in Prism (GraphPad). Intensity levels of some images were adjusted for visibility in publication but if so, the entire field of view and all comparable conditions were adjusted similarly. All images and conditions from the same experiment were collected and analyzed using the same confocal and analysis settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Mice were rapidly decapitated and their brains carefully removed and kept in iced, artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) with sucrose (in mM—sucrose 200, KCl 3, Na<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.4, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 3, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 26, glucose 10, and CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5). 300-μm thick transverse slices were cut on a Leica vibratome (Leica VT1200) and the slices were left at room temperature in the holding chamber, until recording. P14–P16 mice were used for E/I ratio experiments and P17–P21 mice were used for mEPSC experiments. Neurons were visualized by differential interference contrast using a bright light source and an infrared filter on an Olympus BX51WI microscope with attached Hitachi color CCD camera (KP-D20BU). For mEPSC recordings: slices were continuously superfused with aCSF containing (in mM) NaCl 126, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 26, KCl 3, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.4, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2.5, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 1, D-glucose 10, and TTX 1 bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>–5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The intracellular pipette solution for mEPSC recordings contained (in mM) cesium methylsulfonate 80, CsCl 60, HEPES 10, EGTA 1 (adjusted with CsOH), CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5, glucose 10, and QX-314 5, adjusted to 290–300 mOsm/Lt at pH 7.3. For E/I ratio experiments, the aCSF was as above but without TTX and the intracellular solution was (in mM) cesium methylsulfonate 132, CsCl 8, HEPES 10, EGTA 1 (adjusted with CsOH), CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5, glucose 10, and QX-314 5, adjusted to 290–300 mOsm/Lt at pH 7.3. DCG-IV 0.5 μM (CAS no. 147782-19-2, TOCRIS) was perfused in the ACSF in some E/I ratio experiments to verify the specificity of stimulation. Unless noted, chemicals were sourced from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA, United States).</p><p>Somatic whole-cell recordings were performed with Axon Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, CA, United States) in voltage clamp mode at 34 ± 1°C bath temperature for mEPSC experiments and at room temperature (∼22°C) for E/I ratio experiments. Data acquisition was performed via an Axon Digidata 1550 (Molecular Devices, CA, United States) with pClamp (Version 10, Molecular Devices, CA, United States). Current signals were sampled at 1 kHz and filtered with a 2-kHz Bessel filter. Patch pipettes with a tip resistance of 5–10 MΩ were pulled with a Flaming/Brown micropipette puller P-97 (Sutter Instruments and Co.) using borosilicate glass capillaries with filaments (1B150F-4, World Precision Instruments). Grass stimulator (S88, Grass Instruments) and bipolar tungsten electrodes (Harvard Apparatus, MA, United States, Ref. no. 72-0375) were used to deliver extracellular stimulation to the MF pathway at the hilus of the DG.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Hitoshi Sakano's laboratory for the Kirrel3 cDNA, Jean-Francois Cloutier for mice, Dimitri Tränkner for Matlab assistance, Jason Shepherd for manuscript comments, and the entire Williams lab.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor), Graeme Davis (Reviewing Editor), and two reviewers, one of whom, Nick Spitzer, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Martin, Muralidhar, and colleagues test whether the transmembrane Ig superfamily member Kirrel3 plays a role in mammalian synapse development. The authors hypothesize that perturbations of Kirrel3-dependent synapse targeting contributes to intellectual disability, as mutations of Kirrel3 have been associated with neurodevelopment disorders. The studies are well-designed and well-executed. The authors do a good job demonstrating that, in cultured hippocampal neurons, Kirrel3 is a hemophilic adhesion molecule and is present at the onset of synapse development, suggesting a similar role for the molecule in vivo. They provide evidence that other binding partners are not expressed in the same area of the hippocampus. They do a good job using anatomy to narrow their focus to DG and CA3, and provide convincing evidence that the absence of Kirrel3 disrupts the formation of MF filopodia.</p><p>Major criticism:</p><p>Intriguingly, the absence of Kirrel3 has an unexpectedly substantial impact on CA3 pyramidal cell activity in juveniles and on MF bouton morphology in adults. This is surprising because, according to the authors, Kirrel3 neurons represent a small subset of CA3 interneurons that are negative for common interneuron markers. This makes me wonder how such a small (and previously unknown) population could have a large impact in a developmental disorder. The findings would better illustrate the importance of Kirrel3 in hippocampal development (and might be important for subsequent electrophysiological and anatomical characterization of these neurons) if they included quantifications of the density of Kirrel3-positive interneurons in this area, the fractions of GABA-positive neurons in CA3 that are Kirrel3-positive compared to the fractions of other interneurons, and whether these fractions are unchanged in the mutant (using GFP as a marker).</p><p>Minor criticisms:</p><p>The authors claim that the change in MF bouton morphology indicates a homeostatic compensation for CA3 hyper excitability, but do not supply corresponding excitatory/inhibitory experiments to test whether this parameter has been corrected.

In the revised manuscript, we conducted a more thorough and quantitative analysis of the molecular identity of Kirrel3-positive interneurons. Because we still lack a suitable Kirrel3 antibody to routinely identify Kirrel3-expressing cells in wildtype mouse tissue, we conducted our analysis in P14 heterozygous and knockout mice, which have one or two copies respectively of GFP knocked in the Kirrel3 locus. We used GFP to identify Kirrel3-positive cells and made several new discoveries that are detailed in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>. First, nearly all Kirrel3-positive cells (excluding DG neurons) are in fact GABAergic (over 90%). Second, we included more GABAergic markers and discovered most Kirrel3 GABA neurons (67%) express calbindin-D-28K. A smaller fraction (&lt;20%) is somatostatin positive (the two markers are not always mutually exclusive). There is very little overlap with VIP, parvalbumin, or calretinin. Moreover, ∼20% of all GABA neurons in area CA3 express Kirrel3. These cell populations are very similar in P14 Kirrel3 heterozygous and knockout mice. This suggests loss of Kirrel3 does not change cell fate or induce cell death of the neurons examined and that wildtype mice likely have similar numbers. The role of calbindin-positive GABA neurons in the hippocampus is little studied but our new results suggest they may receive a substantial portion of DG mossy fiber input and are likely a critical component of feed forward inhibitory circuits that constrain CA3 activity.</p><p><italic>Minor criticisms:</italic></p><p><italic>The authors claim that the change in MF bouton morphology indicates a homeostatic compensation for CA3 hyper excitability, but do not supply corresponding excitatory/inhibitory experiments to test whether this parameter has been corrected. Such experiments would be an important contribution toward understanding the role of Kirrel3 in neurodevelopment disorders.</italic></p><p>We agree measuring E/I ratios of adult CA3 neurons after MF stimulation would provide additional data to test our hypothesis that adult mice have undergone homeostatic changes to correct CA3 hyper-excitability. Unfortunately, whole cell recording from adult CA3 hippocampal neurons is rarely reported because of the technical difficulty in obtaining quality recordings from healthy cells in adult tissue. CA3 neurons are particularly difficult and among the first hippocampal cells to undergo cell death in acute slices. We understand this is not an impossible experiment, but we hope the reviewers appreciate it is not trivial and has only been accomplished by a few labs with deep electrophysiology experience. After several months, we obtained some E/I recordings from P40-50 slices, but each time DCG-IV was added to confirm MF axon stimulation the cells were lost. They generally support our conclusion but we excluded them from the manuscript because of our inability to confirm they directly resulted from MF stimulation. Nonetheless, our cFos analysis in adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) supports our hypothesis and has led to our working model that will be tested in future studies. We revised the results and discussion to make it clear that the adult compensation effect is still a working model resulting from the many novel findings presented in this Short Report.</p><p><italic>The authors are unable to identify Kirrel3-positive neurons in wild-type mice, rendering many experiments – including direct examination of inhibitory neurotransmission at the MF-GABA synapse, or anatomical studies of the direct interaction of filopodia and Kirrel3-positive neurons – difficult to do.

We have exhaustively tested alternative conditions to optimize the antibody shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> (including changing detergents, fixation times, cryosectioning, and antigen retrieval methods) with no labeling improvement. Moreover, we tested antibodies from 5 commercial vendors and have not yet identified another antibody that specifically labels Kirrel3 in wildtype, but not knockout, mice by immunohistochemistry. Now that we discovered most Kirrel3-GABA neurons express calbindin, we are actively pursuing intersectional viral and transgenic strategies to label Kirrel3-GABA cells in wildtype and knockout mice. However, this is a long-term, on-going project that we hope the reviewers agree is outside the scope of this study.</p><p><italic>Please describe the mice used in the study either in the Results or Methods section (or at least refer to the paper if these are the same farnesylated GFP mice generated previously,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25"><italic>Prince et al., 2013</italic></xref><italic>).</italic></p><p>Kirrel3 knockout mice used in this study are the same mice as described previously in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Prince et al. 2013</xref>.

As such, we cannot conclude if the identified filopodia end in synaptic contacts or not. Elucidating this will require electron microscopy. We are currently conducting a follow-up study using electron microscopy to more precisely analyze filopodial synaptic defects in Kirrel3 knockout mice.</p><p><italic>In the subsection “Kirrel3 regulates CA3 neuron excitability driven by MF input” a citation is needed to document the selective inhibition of MF release by mGluR activation.</italic></p><p>Citations supporting the role of DCG-IV in selective inhibition of MF release were added to the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>In the subsection “MF presynapse analysis”, why was filopodial length analyzed in 3D and the perimeter of the main bouton analyzed in 2D? 3D would seem to be more accurate.</italic></p><p>We initially quantified the main bouton using 2D area and perimeter measurements (as reported) and 3D volumetric measurements, both by an experimenter blind to genotype. Though the 3D bouton analysis supports our hypothesis that the size of the main bouton is similar between WT and KO mice at P14 (WT = 25.1μm<sup>2</sup> ±12.27 st. dev. versus KO = 22.2μm<sup>2</sup> ±11.41, p=0.25 by t-test), we excluded these results from the manuscript because we find analyzing the main bouton volume by light microscopy is inaccurate. It tends to be 2-3 times larger than volumes reported by electron microscopy. MF boutons are highly irregular, sometimes hollow, shapes molded to multi-headed thorny excrescence spines. Analyzing these complex shapes by light microscopy in 3D is hampered by the resolution of confocal images in the Z direction and image analysis software tends to recognize these boutons as solid rounded shapes, artificially increasing the volume. In 2D, we can easily draw irregular shapes corresponding to z-projected MF bouton area and perimeter. It is more accurate to model filopodia length in 3D because it requires only quantification of lines. We assume filopodial volumes would also be inaccurate and this was not analyzed. Our values for WT filopodia number and length closely match previously reported values determined by electron microscopy. Regardless, all WT and KO images were similarly analyzed by an experimenter blind to genotype and are comparable.</p></body></sub-article></article>
