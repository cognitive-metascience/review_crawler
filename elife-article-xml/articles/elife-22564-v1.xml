Pavlovian conditioning experiments indicate that a retrieval cue can return a conditioned aversive memory to a labile state. However, means to enhance retrieval and render a memory more labile are unknown. We hypothesized that augmenting synaptic signaling during retrieval would increase memory lability. To enhance synaptic transmission, mice inhaled CO<sub>2</sub> to induce an acidosis and activate acid sensing ion channels. Transient acidification increased the retrieval-induced lability of an aversive memory. The labile memory could then be weakened by an extinction protocol or strengthened by reconditioning. Coupling CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation to retrieval increased activation of amygdala neurons bearing the memory trace and increased the synaptic exchange from Ca<sup>2+</sup>-impermeable to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors. The results suggest that transient acidosis during retrieval renders the memory of an aversive event more labile and suggest a strategy to modify debilitating memories.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22564.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22564.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>retrieval</kwd><kwd>reconsolidation</kwd><kwd>fear</kwd><kwd>acidosis</kwd><kwd>acid-sensing ion channels</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Jianyang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wemmie</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wemmie</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Welsh</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Activating ASIC channels in the amygdala makes a single reminder more effective at rendering consolidated fear memories labile and susceptible to modification.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fear memories that are excessive or inappropriately triggered can be disabling in disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder and phobias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Izquierdo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parsons and Ressler, 2013</xref>). These illnesses remain a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality, and better treatments are sorely needed. A common behavioral treatment has been extinction training (exposure therapy), in which the threatening cue is repeatedly presented without the feared negative consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Izquierdo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parsons and Ressler, 2013</xref>). However, extinction training does not erase the original memory, and thus it can reemerge with time, stress, and contextual cues.</p><p>Potentially more effective treatments might change the original memory so that the threatening stimulus is less strongly associated with the harmful event. An opportunity to do this arose with the realization that following acquisition and initial consolidation of a memory, the memory can be returned to a labile state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nader et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Monfils et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clem and Huganir, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong et al., 2013</xref>). While in the labile state it can be modified. This process has often been studied in rodents with Pavlovian aversive conditioning, also called fear conditioning. In commonly used auditory conditioning paradigms, a tone (conditioned stimulus) is paired with a foot shock (unconditioned stimulus), and at a later time freezing is measured when the tone is presented (conditioned response). If the memory is retrieved, for example by playing a single tone one day after aversive conditioning, the memory returns to a labile state. During theÂ &lt;6 hr period of lability, the memory can be modified (updated). For example, presenting an extinction protocol during the labile state can reduce the conditioned freezing response in rats and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nader et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Monfils et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clem and Huganir, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong et al., 2013</xref>). Studies in humans suggest a similar process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schiller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">BjÃ¶rkstrand et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, the response can be variable, depends on multiple factors, and is not always observed in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costanzi et al., 2011</xref>) or humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klucken et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Golkar et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, further increasing lability might make the memory more amenable to modification. However, the means to enhance lability are unknown.</p><p>Lateral amygdala neurons and glutamatergic transmission play a central role in the acquisition and retrieval of aversive memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maren, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Phelps and LeDoux, 2005</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms by which retrieval causes a consolidated memory to become labile are not fully understood. With aversive conditioning, synaptic strength increases, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-impermeable Î±-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl- 4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) receptors (CI-AMPARs) increase on lateral amygdala synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clem and Huganir, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong et al., 2013</xref>). Insight into the generation of the labile state came with the finding that retrieval initiates a swap from CI-AMPARs to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clem and Huganir, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong et al., 2013</xref>). However, the increase in CP-AMPARs is transient, and they are replaced by CI-AMPARs over a time course approximately the same as the period of memory lability. The switch to increased CP-AMPARs is a key molecular event that supports and is required for retrieval to render a memory temporarily labile.</p><p>In addition to glutamate receptors, lateral amygdala neurons also express acid sensing ion channels (ASICs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wemmie et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ziemann et al., 2009</xref>). ASICs are non-voltage gated Na<sup>+</sup>- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels that are activated by extracellular acidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deval et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sherwood et al., 2012</xref>). Previous studies identified protons as a neurotransmitter and ASICs as their postsynaptic receptor in lateral amygdala neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zha et al., 2006</xref>). Several observations suggest that proton:ASIC signaling modulates synaptic activity rather than serving as the major neurotransmitter-receptor pair. Proton:ASIC signaling has little effect on neurotransmission under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wemmie et al., 2002</xref>). ASIC excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) are small compared to glutamate-dependent EPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, extracellular acidification is not sufficient to induce long-term potentiation on its own; induction requires delivery of test pulses to the presynaptic neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2014</xref>). Yet, this signaling system is required for normal synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wemmie et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiang et al., 2015</xref>). Protons may be co-released into synapses with glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeVries, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Palmer et al., 2003</xref>), and proton:ASIC signaling may be particularly important during intense presynaptic stimulation, which causes the greatest reductions in extracellular pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">MacLean and Jayaraman, 2016</xref>). Importantly, ASICs are abundantly expressed in the amygdala and are required for normal amygdala-dependent memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ziemann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coryell et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>If aversive memories are to be modified, they must first return to a labile state. We hypothesized that enhancing synaptic signaling while presenting a retrieval cue would increase the lability of an aversive memory. Then, subsequent interventions could more effectively modify the memory. Because ASIC channel activity can enhance synaptic signaling and because ASICs are abundant in amygdala neurons, we tested the hypothesis that transient acidification during retrieval would increase memory lability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inhaling CO<sub>2</sub> enhances the ability of retrieval to render an aversive memory labile</title><p>Previous studies described auditory conditioning protocols in which a retrieval event followed by extinction could attenuate a fear-related memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Monfils et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clem and Huganir, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong et al., 2013</xref>). We used a similar paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). On day 1, mice were trained to associate 6 tones with 6 foot shocks in context X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). On day 2, the mice were placed in a different context (context Y) and a single tone (retrieval event) was presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thirty minutes later, all mice underwent an extinction protocol with two blocks of 20 tones in context Y (total of 39 tones for mice exposed to the retrieval tone) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). By the end of the extinction protocol, freezing fell to a low level. On day 7, mice were tested for spontaneous recovery by measuring freezing in response to tones in context Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

To acidify the brain, mice inhaled 10% CO<sub>2</sub>. We used CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation because it rapidly acidifies brain pH including in the lateral amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ziemann et al., 2009</xref>), the effect reverses quickly when CO<sub>2</sub> is stopped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ziemann et al., 2009</xref>), and it can be used safely in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey et al., 2005</xref>). Mice inhaled 10% CO<sub>2</sub> for 5 min before and then during presentation of the single retrieval tone for a total of 7 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

However, labile memories may also be strengthened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fukushima et al., 2014</xref>). We reasoned that if inhaling CO<sub>2</sub> during retrieval made a memory more labile, then it might also be more susceptible to strengthening by reconditioning. We used distinct contexts to avoid contextual effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). On day 1, mice were trained with 3 tones paired with foot shocks in context X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). On day 2, mice were randomly assigned to one of four groups, receiving a single retrieval tone or not, with or without 10% CO<sub>2</sub> in context Y. Thirty minutes after retrieval, all mice received an additional tone paired with a foot shock in context Z to recondition the memory.

As a result, the memory becomes more amenable to being weakened by extinction or strengthened by reconditioning. It is interesting that although inhaling CO<sub>2</sub> reduces pH throughout the brain, it had a specific effect on the response to a retrieval cue. Several findings suggest that inhaling CO<sub>2</sub> specifically altered activity in lateral amygdala synapses that were being activated by the retrieval cue and increased the lability of those connections. (1) Inhaling CO<sub>2</sub> by itself did not alter AMPAR exchange or the behavioral responses to extinction and reconditioning. (2) CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation begun after the retrieval cue did not alter the behavioral response to extinction. (3) Injecting acid alone directly into the amygdala did not increase AMPAR exchange. (4) By itself, CO<sub>2</sub> did not increase CREB phosphorylation. (5) CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation alone did not increase the percentage of lateral amygdala neurons that were active as reported by <italic>Fos</italic>-driven labeling of neurons that carried the memory trace. Nevertheless, in each of those five cases, simultaneous delivery of CO<sub>2</sub> (or acid injection) and retrieval enhanced the effect of retrieval presented alone. (6) Moreover, in contrast to thalamus:lateral amygdala synapses, for cortical:lateral amygdala synapses, where retrieval did not increase AMPA receptor rectification, pairing CO<sub>2</sub> with retrieval did not enhance AMPAR exchange.</p><p>How did combining CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation with retrieval make an aversive memory more labile? In the introduction, we briefly reviewed the evidence that acidosis activation of ASIC currents enhance neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2014</xref>). We speculate that proton:ASIC activity may enhance signaling at synapses while they are activated by the retrieval cue. Neurotransmission can reduce synaptic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Highstein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kreple et al., 2014</xref>), and increasing the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration will further reduce pH, thereby causing greater ASIC channel activation. ASIC currents may amplify post-synaptic increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> by providing a route for Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeation or by increasing depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ziemann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sherwood et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zha et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xiong et al., 2004</xref>). That conjecture is supported by our finding that stimulating lateral amygdala input produced a greater increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> when the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was elevated. It is also consistent with the finding of increased CREB phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sheng et al., 1990</xref>) by the combination of retrieval and CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation. It is also supported by the <italic>Fos</italic>-dependent labeling results; adding CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation during the retrieval cue further increased the fraction of neurons carrying the memory trace that were activated (shEGFP-labeled).</p><p>Previous work on the molecular basis of retrieval emphasized the abrupt and transient exchange from CI-AMPARs to CP-AMPARs in lateral amygdala synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clem and Huganir, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong et al., 2013</xref>). Our findings that acidosis further increased AMPAR exchange supports the critical role of CP-AMPARs. The data also suggest that increased activity at those synapses at the time of retrieval was responsible. The abundance of ASIC channels in the amygdala suggests that it may be particularly susceptible to this activity. However, we speculate that synapses in other brain regions might exhibit similar responses and that other behaviors, for example appetitive conditioning, might also be modified.</p><p>Translating knowledge about memory modification to humans with disease has so far achieved only limited success. Most studies have focused on behavioral and pharmacological interventions during the labile period that follows retrieval. There has been comparatively less emphasis on strategies to increase the lability of a retrieved memory, although the timing and context for retrieval have been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jarome et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2015</xref>).

For experiments, individual slices were transferred to a submersion-recording chamber and were continuously perfused with the 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% O<sub>2</sub> solution (~3.0 ml/min) at 22â25Â°C. Slices were visualized with infrared optics using an upright microscope equipped with differential interference contrast optics (Nikon ECLIPSE FN1, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014995">SCR_014995</ext-link>).</p><p>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from pyramidal neurons in the lateral amygdala. The pipette solution containing (in mM): 135 KSO<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, 5 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 4 MgATP, 0.3 Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, 0.5 K-EGTA (mOsmÂ =Â 290, adjusted to pH 7.25 with KOH). The pipette resistance (measured in the bath solution) was 3â5 MÎ©. High-resistance (&gt;1 GÎ©) seals were formed in voltage-clamp mode. Picrotoxin (100 ÂµM) was added to the ACSF throughout the recordings to yield excitatory responses. In AMPAR current rectification experiments, we applied D-APV (100 ÂµM) to block NMDAR-conducted EPSCs. To determine current rectification, the peak amplitude of ESPCs was measured ranging from â80 mV toÂ +60 mV in 20 mV steps. Rectification index was measured as the ratio between peak amplitude of EPSCs at â80 mV andÂ +60 mV. In EPSC ratio experiments, neurons were held at â80 mV to record AMPAR-EPSCs and were held atÂ +60 mV to record NMDAR-EPSCs. To determine AMPAR-to-NMDAR ratio, peak amplitude of ESPCs at â80 mV were measured as AMPAR-currents, and peak amplitude of EPSCs atÂ +60 mV at 70 ms after onset were measured as NMDAR-currents. To identify the NASPM-sensitive EPSCs, neurons were held at â80 mV in the presence of 100 ÂµM D-APV. NASPM (100 ÂµM) was applied to the slices during recording. To identify the effects of acid injection on AMPAR current rectification, we implanted a 5 mm 23G guide cannula (Plastics One) above the amygdala. The coordinates relative to bregma were: â1.2 mm anterioposterior;Â Â±3.5 mm mediolateral; â4.3 mm dorsoventral from the skull surface. Mice were allowed to recover for a minimum of 5 days following cannula implantation. On the day of behavioral testing, a 30G injector extending 1 mm beyond the tip of the guide cannula was inserted and 1 Âµl of saline (pH 3.0 or 7.35) was injected into the amygdala. The injecting solutions were (in mM) 140 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 HEPES, and 11 glucose. For the pH 3.0 solution we used 10 mM MES instead of 10 mM HEPES as the buffer. Five minutes after acid injections, a single tone was presented to retrieve memory, and 10 min after retrieval, brain slices were isolated for patch-clamp recording. Miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were collected at â80 mV holding potential in the presence of 1 ÂµM tetrodotoxin (TTX) and 100 Î¼M picrotoxin.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Transient Acidosis while Retrieving a Fear-Related Memory Enhances Its Lability&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have elected to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>These experiments explore the effect of brain acidification on modification of aversive memories in mice. The work provides evidence that carbon dioxide inhalation during presentation of retrieval cues makes memories more labile. The pathways implicated in the brain involve ASIC1 channels in the lateral amygdala that drive a conversion of excitatory synapses to express a higher proportion of Ca-permeable AMPARs, which make synapses from thalamus more subject to further plasticity, including extinction.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were favorable about the manuscript, and described the hypothesis as &quot;interesting, novel and [of] possible clinical relevance,&quot; the experiments as &quot;well executed and controlled,&quot; and the conclusions as &quot;appear[ing] well in line with the results of the experiments.&quot; One reviewer summarized the work as follows: &quot;Overall the manuscript is well written, well presented, and elucidates an exciting (and potentially therapeutic) phenomenon related to enhancing lability of aversive memories.&quot; Nevertheless, there were a number of concerns that will likely require additional experimentation. Most of these comments fit into the category of tying together the in vitro and in vivo data better. These concerns are summarized briefly here, and expanded on below in the reviewers' own words (&quot;Primary comments&quot;), so that you can have the benefit of their full comments.

Most of these comments fit into the category of tying together the in vitro and in vivo data better. These concerns are summarized briefly here, and expanded on below in the reviewers' own words (&quot;Primary comments&quot;), so that you can have the benefit of their full comments.

Whereas loss of the ASIC1a subunit eliminates all ASIC currents (in response to challenges of pH&gt;5) in amygdala neurons, PcTX1 only inhibits ASIC channels that are composed solely of ASIC1a subunits. But most ASIC1a subunits in amygdala neurons are in channels that also contain other ASIC subunits, i.e., they are ASIC1a heteromultimers. Moreover, in other experiments, we found that PcTx1 did not alter aversive conditioning or the response to it. We now make the text clearer that our results refer to ASIC currents and not to the ASIC1a subunit specifically (subsection âCO<sub>2</sub> enhancement of retrieval-induced lability requires ASICsâ).</p><p><italic>2) The behavioral data presented is interesting and supports the claim that CO2 present concurrently with the recall cue is required for the facilitation of the subsequent extinction or re-conditioning. Weaker however, is evidence of a common mechanism between the behavioral and slice experiments. Although the authors show that the Asic1a-/- mice were impaired in the reconditioning protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) At a minimum, the authors should demonstrate that a similar deficit could be observed with the extinction protocol present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. This would support their claims of clinical relevance in the Introduction and Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We certainly considered this experiment. However, we cannot meaningfully test the effect of extinction on behavior in ASIC1a-null mice. In wild-type mice the% of time freezing after retrieval is small, but we could see a further reduction when we added CO<sub>2</sub>. However, the% of time freezing in ASIC1a-null mice is smaller, and trying to test for a further reduction becomes problematic. Extraordinarily large numbers of mice would be required to test this and uncertainty could persist. That is one reason we tested loss of ASIC1a in a reconditioning experiment. Said another way, it is much easier to test for a loss of a robust increase than a loss of a very small reduction. The reconditioning experiment has the additional advantage that it uses a different protocol, and fulfills the prediction that if a memory is labile it could be either weakened or strengthened.</p><p><italic>The same general criticism extends to the lack of behavioral testing with the Tat-GluA2 peptide (Cazakoff and Howland, 2011; Dias et al. 2012).</italic></p><p>As suggested, we tested the effect of the Tat-GluA2 peptide on behavior; we show the data in the fourth paragraph of the subsection âCO<sub>2</sub> inhalation during retrieval augments the exchange of AMPA receptorsâ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>. These data show that blocking endocytosis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> impermeable-AMPARs inhibits the CO<sub>2</sub> enhanced lability of fear memory. We now also reference the two papers the reviewer noted. The results help tie together the in vitro and in vivo experiments and reveal the mechanisms.</p><p><italic>And in the mice with microinjections of acidic saline into the amygdala. A full set of consistent behavioral data across these treatments would greatly strengthen the link between the increased memory lability and the proposed mechanism.</italic> </p><p>We had also considered testing the effect of acid injection on behavior, but elected not to try for three reasons. First, we have another experiment with acid injection that links to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors and an experiment in slices with CO<sub>2</sub>. In addition, the lack of effects of CO<sub>2</sub> on ASIC1a-/- mice link CO<sub>2</sub> and ASICs. Second, this experiment requires cannula implants, amygdala microinjection, control injections, and behavior testing. Thus, it would consume a very large amount of time, much effort, and many animals. Third and most importantly, a positive result in this experiment would be fine, as it would be consistent with the conclusion. But, a negative result would be uninformative because of concern about the ability to target a sufficient amount of the relevant circuit bilaterally with an appropriate pH drop. Thus, we believe this experiment will not be revealing.</p><p><italic>Likewise, the Ca++ imaging experiments and tone-induced increase in pCREB should have been performed in the Asic1a-/- mice.</italic> </p><p>We have done the Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments in ASIC1a-null mice, as well as in wild-type mice (subsection âCO<sub>2</sub> enhances activation of amygdala neuronsâ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). While the pCREB experiments do support the Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments, they are not critical to the arguments in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) The results from the Tet-TAG experiment is a bit confusing. Why does retrieval fail to induce reactivation in the Asic1a-/- mice? The 30 minute post-training window allowed for shEGFP expression seems short â what was the rationale for this time point and would the authors expect more overlap at later time points?</italic> </p><p>For the Tet-TAG experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), we now say that we do not have an explanation for why retrieval alone did not increase colocalization in ASIC1a-null mice (subsection âInhaling CO<sub>2</sub> increases retrieval-dependent activity in neurons bearing the memory traceâ). The editor noted that we could delete this. However, we would like to retain it because of the comparison between the retrieval and the retrieval+CO<sub>2</sub> groups in wildtype mice. We used a 30 minute interval after retrieval because c-fos expression increases within minutes to hours. For example, one study found that c-fos expression peaked at 30 or 60 min and was markedly reduced at 120 min post-stress (Cullinan WE et al., 1995). Another study found an increase in mRNA expression 30 min after PTZ-induced seizures in rats (Barros VN et al., 2015). It is possible that we might have observed even more colocalization with a longer interval after retrieval, but we did not test that.</p></body></sub-article></article>
