translocates them into the nucleus during DNA replication. Mechanistic questions include H3- and H4-NLS redundancy toward Kap123 and the role of the conserved diacetylation of cytoplasmic H4 (K5ac and K12ac) in Kap123-mediated histone nuclear translocation. Here, we report crystal structures of full-length <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic> Kap123 alone and in complex with H3- and H4-NLSs. Structures reveal the unique feature of Kap123 that possesses two discrete lysine-binding pockets for NLS recognition. Structural comparison illustrates that H3- and H4-NLSs share at least one of two lysine-binding pockets, suggesting that H3- and H4-NLSs are mutually exclusive. Additionally, acetylation of key lysine residues at NLS, particularly H4-NLS diacetylation, weakens the interaction with Kap123. These data support that cytoplasmic histone H4 diacetylation weakens the Kap123-H4-NLS interaction thereby facilitating histone Kap123-H3-dependent H3:H4/Asf1 complex nuclear translocation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Karyopherin</kwd><kwd>histone</kwd><kwd>nuclear transport</kwd><kwd>Kluyveromyces lactis</kwd><kwd>diacetylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK111465</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Uhn-soo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000041</institution-id><institution>American Diabetes Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1-16-JDF-017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Uhn-soo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG050903</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Uhn-soo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000912</institution-id><institution>March of Dimes Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N019154-00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Uhn-soo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016R1A2B3006293</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Ji-Joon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013R1A1A2055605</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Ji-Joon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014K2A3A1000137</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Ji-Joon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2011-0031955</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Ji-Joon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural and biochemical studies of Kap123 revealed the mechanisms by which Kap123 recognizes H3- and H4-NLSs through two lysine-binding pockets and by which evolutionarily conserved diacetylation of H4-NLS facilitates Kap123-H3-NLS mediated nuclear translocation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The basic unit of eukaryotic chromatin is the nucleosome, where 146 base pairs of DNA wrap around a histone octamer composed of two copies of core histones H3, H4, H2A, and H2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">White et al., 2001</xref>). Each core histone contains an unstructured N-terminal tail that possesses NLSs and several known sites for post-translational modifications (PTMs) including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Strahl and Allis, 2000</xref>). These histone tail chemical modifications play important roles in controlling many DNA template-dependent processes, such as gene transcription, DNA replication, DNA repair, and histone deposition and nucleosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Strahl and Allis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cosgrove and Wolberger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jenuwein and Allis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krebs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marmorstein, 2001</xref>). The entirety of the genomic DNA, including the number of nucleosomes, is duplicated during S phase. While DNA polymerases replicate the genomic DNA, pre-existing nucleosomes undergo disassembly and reassembly processes from one parental chromatid to one of two sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ransom et al., 2010</xref>). Meanwhile, the same amount of nascent histones are synthesized at the cytosol and imported into the nucleus to meet the demand for nucleosome shortage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franco et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Verreault, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Histones H3 and H4 cytoplasmic assembly and nuclear translocation are relatively well illustrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keck and Pemberton, 2012</xref>). Several heat-shock proteins initially assist in histone H3 and H4 protein folding. Asf1, a H3/H4-specific histone chaperone, subsequently associates with the histones and forms a heterotrimeric H3:H4/Asf1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keck and Pemberton, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tyler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Natsume et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">English et al., 2006</xref>). Asf1 shields histones H3 and H4 from undesired non-specific interactions and safely delivers them into the nucleus for de novo nucleosome assembly. Newly synthesized histones also undergo a series of PTMs at the cytoplasm. Soon after their synthesis, histones H3 and H4 are prone to be acetylated mainly at the N-terminal tail, where their NLSs are located. The most evolutionarily conserved PTM identified to date is the diacetylation of histone H4 at K5 and K12 (H4 K5ac and K12ac) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sobel et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sobel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loyola et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jasencakova et al., 2010</xref>). Although highly conserved among eukaryotes, histone H4 K5 and K12 cytoplasmic diacetylation does not appear to be essential for cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ai and Parthun, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barman et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, in fungi, the diacetylation appears to be dispensable for nucleosome deposition, suggesting a potential role in the nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Macromolecules larger than 40 kDa cannot pass through the nuclear pore complex by simple diffusion and require the assistance of active transporters called karyopherins (Kaps) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stewart, 2007</xref>). The family of Kap proteins recognizes either NLS or the nuclear export signal in order to import or export cargo proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baake et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mühlhäusser et al., 2001</xref>). To date, nineteen human Kaps and fourteen budding yeast Kaps have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Görlich and Kutay, 1999</xref>). Among them, eleven human and ten budding yeast Kaps are known to mediate the import of cargo proteins to the nucleus and the rest are responsible for either unidirectional export or the bidirectional import/export process of cargo proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chook and Süel, 2011</xref>). Kap proteins share the common structural motif of helical tandem HEAT (<bold>H</bold>untingtin, elongation factor 3 (<bold><underline>E</underline></bold>F3), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2<bold><underline>A</underline></bold>), and the yeast kinase <bold><underline>T</underline></bold>OR1) repeats with a right-handed superhelical solenoid structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stewart, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mosammaparast and Pemberton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). The NLS is a structurally disordered region of cargo proteins that is composed of overall positively charged residues with limited sequence homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). Kap proteins mostly recognize NLSs through their inner concave surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marfori et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kobayashi and Matsuura, 2013</xref>). The lack of sequence conservation among NLSs allows a small number of Kap proteins to translocate a large number of nuclear proteins into the nucleus, which means that a single Kap protein can translocate many substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chook and Süel, 2011</xref>). Conversely, a single cargo protein can be imported via several Kap proteins. Kap123, the most abundant karyopherin in budding yeast, functions as a primary transporter for the H3:H4/Asf1 complex, whereas Kap121 acts as a secondary transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mosammaparast et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Although the nuclear import of histones is an important biological process in DNA replication, the detailed mechanism by which Kap proteins recognize and regulate histone-NLSs remains elusive. It is still not known how Kap123 recognizes the H3:H4/Asf1 complex. As both histones H3 and H4 are redundant and possess NLS peptides at their N-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mosammaparast et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackwell et al., 2007</xref>), Kap123 either recognizes both H3- and H4-NLSs simultaneously or associates with only one of them preferentially. It is also not clear whether and how PTMs, particularly histone H3 and H4 acetylation, impact H3:H4/Asf1 complex nuclear transport. Mutations of key H3- and H4-NLS lysine residues to glutamines, an acetylation mimic of the lysine residue, impaired H3-NLS- and H4-NLS-GFP reporter translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackwell et al., 2007</xref>). This suggests that acetylation of NLSs interferes with rather than promotes histone H3 and H4 nuclear translocation.</p><p>Here, we report crystal structures of full-length <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic> (<italic>Kl</italic>) Kap123 alone and in complex with NLS peptides of H3 and H4. We identify that there are two spatially separated lysine-binding pockets within Kap123 that specifically interact with H3- and H4-NLSs. The expected NLS consensus sequence for Kap123 interaction, derived from the Kap123-H3-NLS structure, is –X<sub>SH</sub>-K-X<sub>SH</sub>-(X)<sub>6 or more</sub>-K- (X<sub>SH</sub>: small hydrophobic amino acid, X: any amino acid). Structural comparison of Kap123-H3-NLS and Kap123-H4-NLS demonstrates that H3- and H4-NLSs share at least one of the lysine-binding pockets within Kap123, indicating that H3- and H4-NLSs are mutually exclusive with respect to Kap123 association. The structures also suggest that the acetylation of key lysine residues weakens the Kap123-NLS interaction by losing electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackwell et al., 2007</xref>). This indicates that the cytosolic acetylation of H3- and H4-NLSs, such as the conserved diacetylation of H4 K5 and K12, may interrupt the Kap123-dependent recognition of H3-/H4-NLSs during nuclear translocation. Based on structural observations and subsequent mutational analysis, we propose that the diacetylation of histone H4 (H4 K5ac and K12ac) may exclude H4-NLS from Kap123, thereby leading to the histone H3-dependent nuclear translocation of the H3:H4/Asf1 complex mediated by Kap123.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overall structure of full-length <italic>Kl</italic> Kap123</title><p>The crystal structure of full length <italic>Kl</italic> Kap123 was determined using the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) method and refined at 2.35 Å resolution with a crystallographic R value of 20.99% and a free R value of 23.49% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Kap123 does not recognize the specific sequence of the middle region (residues 15–22) of H3<sub>1–28</sub>-NLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,e</xref>). Only several peptide backbone interactions via hydrogen bond interactions are observed in-between Kap123 and H3<sub>1–28</sub>-NLS except key lysine residues (Fb). Even though bipartite binding has been observed in classical NLS models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fontes et al., 2000</xref>), the classical NLS-binding pattern is more continuous and binds on the surface, rather than via the binding pocket.

The negatively charged pocket composed of N980, E1016, and E1017 (repeats 21 and 22) and the positively charged ε-amine group of H3 K14 form several electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions, which provide specificity toward H3 K14.

Lysine residue acetylation abolishes electrostatic interactions thereby triggering H3<sub>1–28</sub>-NLS dissociation from Kap123. A previous H3-NLS-GFP reporter assay demonstrated that an acetylation mimic of K14 (K14Q), but not K9Q and K18Q, dramatically reduced GFP reporter nuclear localization, which is in good agreement with our structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackwell et al., 2007</xref>). The H3-NLS K14R mutation, which maintains the positive charge of the lysine side chain, showed a minor effect with respect to nuclear localization, indicating that the positive charge of Lys14 plays a key role in the nuclear translocation of H3-NLS mediated by Kap123 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackwell et al., 2007</xref>). To avoid any crystallographic artifacts in the Kap123-H3<sub>1–28</sub>-NLS interaction, we mutated residues located in the two lysine-binding pockets of Kap123 as well as key lysine residues at the H3<sub>1–28</sub>-NLS (K14 and K23) and monitored the affinity change by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Mutations of residues at the first lysine-binding pocket (Y926A, N980A, E1016A and E1017A) and the second lysine-binding pocket (S505A and S509A) substantially reduced H3<sub>1–28</sub>-NLS and Kap123 binding, indicating that the two lysine-binding pockets are indeed involved in H3<sub>1–28</sub>-NLS recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b,d</xref>).

However, the histone H3 acetylation pattern is inconsistent among species and loss of the conserved histone H4 diacetylation pattern at K5 and K12 generated by the Hat1 complex did not show any noticeable phenotype upon Hat1 deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ai and Parthun, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barman et al., 2006</xref>).

Accordingly, we introduced mutations in key lysine residues identified from the crystal structures. In agreement with previous reports, acetylation-mimic mutations of H3 K14 and K23 (H3 K14Q and H3 K23Q) as well as alanine substitution (H3 K14A and H3 K23A) decreased the affinity toward Kap123 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackwell et al., 2007</xref>). The double mutation of H3 K14/K23 (K14A/K23A and K14Q/K23Q) further reduced the affinity, demonstrating that H3 K14 and K23 are key residues for Kap123 association and that acetylation disrupts this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,c</xref>). The H4-NLS K16A or K16Q mutation also reduced the affinity toward Kap123 although the effect was mild probably owing to the additional contacts generated by H4-NLS R17 and R19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5b,d</xref>). Notably, H4-NLS<sup>K5Q/K12Q</sup> diacetylation mimic mutation reduced affinity more significantly than H4-NLS<sup>K16A</sup> or H4-NLS<sup>K16Q</sup>, suggesting that Kap123 has an additional binding site for H4-NLS in addition to K16. H4 K5 and K12 may play a more significant role in this recognition although the Kap123-H4<sub>1-34</sub>-NLS crystal structure failed to locate the electron density of these two lysines. Therefore, although H4 K16 recognition via the second lysine-binding pocket of Kap123 is more specific, but its contribution to the affinity might not be strong. However, H4 K5 and K12 may contribute more in Kap123-H4-NLS association as indicted in SPR experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b,d</xref>). Furthermore, the H3-NLS affinity toward Kap123 is fivefold higher than that of H4-NLS, indicating that H3-NLS is a better substrate for Kap123 association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Consistent with this result, Soniat <italic>et al</italic>. recently showed a similar result where 11-fold stronger interaction for Kapβ2-H3 than Kapβ2-H4 was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soniat et al., 2016</xref>). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that H4<sub>1–21</sub>-NLS peptides used for SPR experiments may not fully capture the Kap123 and histone H4 association although we did not observe any additional electron density for H4<sub>21–34</sub> in the Kap123-H4<sub>1–34</sub>-NLS crystal structure.

To validate this observation, we performed a competition assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Pre-incubated Kap123-H3-NLS was challenged by increased amounts of H4-NLS and the remaining amount of H3-NLS monitored after competition. If H3- and H4-NLSs compete for Kap123 association, the increased amount of H4-NLS would compete out H3-NLS from Kap123. As expected, gradually increased H4-NLS successfully competed out H3-NLS and the same phenomenon occurred in pre-incubated Kap123-H4-NLS with subsequent H3-NLS challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). This result demonstrated that H3- and H4-NLSs co-compete for Kap123 interaction. The former GFP reporter assay evidenced that the tri-acetylation mimic mutant of H4-NLS<sup>K5Q/K8Q/K12Q</sup> dramatically reduced the nuclear translocation, probably owing to a reduced affinity toward Kap123 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackwell et al., 2007</xref>). To test whether the tri-acetylation mimic mutant of H4-NLS was still capable of competing with H3-NLS for Kap123 association, we performed the competition assay in a condition where the pre-incubated Kap123-H3-NLS was challenged by an increased amount of H4-NLS<sup>K5Q/K8Q/K12Q</sup>. Unlike the wild-type H4-NLS, H4-NLS<sup>K5Q/K8Q/K12Q</sup> no longer competed with H3-NLS in Kap123 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since evolutionarily conserved histone H4 acetylation happens at K5 and K12, we further performed the competition assay using H4-NLS <sup>K5Q/K12Q</sup> and we consistently observed loss of competition by using H4-NLS <sup>K5Q/K12Q</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b,c</xref>). This strongly suggests that the conserved diacetylation pattern of cytoplasmic histone H4 within the H3:H4/Asf1 complex may exclude H4-NLS from Kap123 and allow the Kap123-H3-NLS complex formation during nuclear translocation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30244.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Competition assay of H3- and H4-NLSs (wild-type H4 and mutant H4<sup>K5Q/K12Q</sup>) toward Kap123 association.</title><p>Competition of H3<sub>1–59</sub>- and H4<sub>1–48</sub>-Sumo (<bold>a</bold>) as well as H3<sub>1–59</sub>- and H4<sub>1–48</sub> <sup>K5Q/K12Q</sup>-Sumo (<bold>b</bold>) toward Kap123 binding was monitored by amylose affinity pull-downs using MBP-tagged Kap123.

These include: (1) Kap123 recognition of H3- and H4-NLSs. It has not been clear whether one or both NLS signals were required for Kap123 recognition considering the fact that both histones H3 and H4 contain functionally redundant NLSs. (2) Potential role of the acetylation observed in the cytosolic pool of histones H3 and H4. Diacetylation of histone H4 K5 and K12 (H4 K5ac and K12ac) is the most conserved PTM among species; however, the exact biological role of this modification remains ill-defined. In the current study, we focus on addressing these two key questions using crystal structures of full-length <italic>Kl</italic> Kap123 in the presence of either H3<sub>1–28</sub>-NLS or H4<sub>1–34</sub>-NLS and subsequent biochemical and mutational analyses.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The consensus NLS sequence for <italic>Kl</italic> Kap123 recognition is –X<sub>SH</sub>-K-X<sub>SH</sub>-(X)<sub>6 or more</sub>-K-</title><p>To gain insights on how Kap123 recognizes the NLSs of histones H3 and H4, we determined crystal structures of a major karyopherin protein in budding yeast, Kap123, in the presence of H3<sub>1–28</sub>-NLS and H4<sub>1–34</sub>-NLS. Determined crystal structures indicate that both H3<sub>1–28</sub>- and H4<sub>1–34</sub>-NLSs interact with Kap123 through either one or both of the lysine binding pockets located in the inner curvature of Kap123. Analysis of how Kap123 interacts with histone H3<sub>1–28</sub>-NLS led to the potential NLS consensus sequence required for Kap123 association. The first lysine-binding pocket (repeats 20–22) of Kap123 captures K14 of H3<sub>1–28</sub>-NLS through both hydrophobic (Y926) and negatively charged (N980, E1016, and E1017) residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>). The first binding pocket only allows small hydrophobic amino acids (Gly or Ala) as neighboring residues (G13 and A15 in H3<sub>1–28</sub>-NLS) by making several backbone contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a</xref>). The second lysine-binding pocket (repeats 11–13) of Kap123 recognizes H3 K23 and makes additional backbone interactions with K23 neighboring residues (S22 and A24 of H3<sub>1–28</sub>-NLS) without strong amino acid preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3b</xref>). Notably, the two lysine-binding pockets of Kap123 are distally positioned and the distance between the Cα atoms of two bound lysines (H3 K14 and K23) is 26.6 Å, indicating that more than seven residues are required in between two key lysine residues. This results in –X<sub>SH</sub>-K-X<sub>SH</sub>-(X)<sub>6 or more</sub>-K- as a consensus sequence for Kap123 recognition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>H4<sub>1–34</sub>-NLS mainly interacts with Kap123 via the second lysine-binding pocket</title><p>A major structural difference between the Kap123-H3<sub>1–28</sub>-NLS and Kap123-H4<sub>1–34</sub>-NLS structures is the missing electron density of the first Kap123 lysine-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,d</xref>). This implies that Kap123 recognizes H4-NLS only through the second-lysine binding pocket. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that K5, K8, and K12 of H4-NLS make additional contacts with Kap123. A previous report showed that the replacement of four lysines at the H4-NLS-GFP reporter (K5, K8, K12 and K16) to alanines led to a defect in nuclear translocation whereas arginine substitution was normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glowczewski et al., 2004</xref>). Another study showed that the acetylation-mimic triple mutation of K5, K8, and K12 (K5Q/K8Q/K12Q) diminished the nuclear translocation of the H4-NLS-GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackwell et al., 2007</xref>). We also observed the diminished affinity of H4-NLS when we introduced the diacetylation-mimic mutations of H4<sup>K5Q/K12Q</sup> and found that the di-acetylation mimic H4-NLS<sup>K5Q/K12Q</sup> barely competed with H3-NLS in Kap123 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4b,d and</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6b</xref>). One possible explanation why we could not detect the electron density of H4 K5, K8 and K12 might be that K5 (<sub>4</sub>-GKG-<sub>6</sub>), K8 (<sub>7</sub>-GKG-<sub>9</sub>), and K12 (<sub>11</sub>-GKG-<sub>13</sub>) of H4-NLS share the same three consecutive amino acid sequence (GKG) and thus equally access the unidentified binding pocket of Kap123. Indeed, earlier studies showed that a single substitution of one of three lysines to glycine or glutamine did not display significant binding defect toward Kap123 indicating that these three lysines are functionally redundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackwell et al., 2007</xref>). The electron density generated by binding of each lysine may be canceled out and any one of them thereby failed to individually visualize above the noise level. Therefore, although the crystal structure of the Kap123-H4<sub>1–34</sub>-NLS complex only indicates that K16 of H4-NLS mainly associates with the second lysine-binding pocket of Kap123, one of three lysines of histone H4 (K5, K8, or K12) may additionally associate with Kap123. This indicates that H4 K16 weakly but specifically binds to Kap123 while H4 K5, K8, and K12 strongly but less specifically contributes to Kap123 recognition. Further studies are needed to examine the additional binding pocket of H4 K5, K8 and K12 within Kap123.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The extra-long helix of the Kap123 repeat 23 acts as a molecular ruler</title><p>The major structural difference between Kap123 and other known karyopherins is the extra-long helix of the repeat 23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This extended helix can reach to the ridge of repeats 12–14 by forming several charge interactions and hydrogen bond interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Previous small angle x-ray scattering and molecular dynamics simulation results indicated that the overall structures of Kap proteins are highly dynamic in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forwood et al., 2010</xref>). The lack of structural rigidity may allow Kap proteins to accommodate less conserved NLSs from different cargo proteins. However, the dynamic behavior of Kap123 is thought to be restricted owing to intramolecular interactions between repeats 12 and 14 and the extended helix of the repeat 23. This extended helix restricts the distance in-between two lysine-binding pockets. Indeed, disrupting this intramolecular interaction by either the point mutation of T1065K or the replacement of residues 1059–1071 to a GSGS linker in the extended helix of repeat 23 (R1058_GSGS_E1072) dramatically reduced the H3-NLS affinity toward Kap123 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, the intra-molecular interaction of the repeat 23 at Kap123 may play an important role in H3-NLS recognition of Kap123.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Association of H3-NLS with karyopherin-β2 (Kapβ2) may compete with other PY-NLSs</title><p>While we were preparing the manuscript, the crystal structure of the Kapβ2-H3-NLS complex was released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soniat and Chook, 2016</xref>). Kapβ2 is an importin that translocates many cargo proteins into the nucleus by recognizing proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signals (PY-NLSs) of substrates. Although Kapβ2 is not a major importin for core histones (histones H3, H4, H2A and H2B) and histones H3 and H4 do not contain PY-NLSs, Kapβ2 has been shown to recognize H3- and H4-NLSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soniat et al., 2016</xref>). The structural alignment of Kap123-H3<sub>1–28</sub>-NLS and Kapβ2-H3<sub>1–47</sub>-NLS complexes revealed that the binding pattern of H3-NLS is quite distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4a,b</xref>). This strongly suggests that H3-NLS adopts different conformations in order to associate with different Kap proteins. In the Kapβ2-H3<sub>1–47</sub>-NLS structure, H3<sub>1–47</sub>-NLS associates with the inner concave surface of the C-terminal half of Kapβ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soniat and Chook, 2016</xref>). Residues 11–19 of H3-NLS continuously bind on the inner surface of Kapβ2 and residues 20–27 form a 2-turn α-helix in order to make additional contacts with Kapβ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4b</xref>). Therefore, the H3<sub>1–47</sub>-NLS binding pattern to Kapβ2 apparently differs from the way that Kap123 recognizes H3<sub>1-28</sub>-NLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4b</xref>). Another notable observation is that the binding region of H3<sub>1–47</sub>-NLS within Kapβ2 overlaps with that of other known PY-NLSs, which may explain why Kap123 and its human homologue Importin-4 remain dominant transporters for H3- and H4-NLSs in vivo. Although the Kapβ2-H3<sub>1–47</sub>-NLS interaction is strong (K<sub>D</sub> of 77.1 nM), H3-NLS needs to compete with other PY-NLSs in order to associate with Kapβ2, which may limit Kapβ2 access to H3-NLSs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soniat et al., 2016</xref>). The unique bipartite binding mode observed in Kap123 may thus allow selective association with H3-NLS but not other NLSs, such as PY-NLSs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>The two lysine-binding pockets of Kap123 are not conserved in Kap121</title><p>In budding yeast, Kap123 and Kap121 demonstrate functional overlap in importing cargo proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chook and Süel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mosammaparast et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Timney et al., 2006</xref>).

Particularly, the extended repeat 23 helix of Kap123, whose mutation dramatically reduces the binding ability toward H3-NLS, is not conserved in Kap121 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Indeed, former reports showed that diacetylation of histone H4 K5 and K12 promotes the nuclear transportation in <italic>P. polycepthalum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ejlassi-Lassallette et al., 2011</xref>) and in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez et al., 2011</xref>). However, acetylation or acetylation mimics of lysine residues impaired H3- or H4-NLS-GFP reporter translocation, raising a question regarding the potential role of acetylation in nuclear transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackwell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glowczewski et al., 2004</xref>). Crystal structures of H3<sub>1–28</sub>-NLS-Kap123 and H4<sub>1–34</sub>-NLS-Kap123 provide further supporting evidence demonstrating that the acetylation of key lysine residues interrupts the Kap123 and NLS interaction by abolishing charge-charge interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2c,d and</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4c</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that the potential role of either H3- or H4-NLS acetylation is to exclude the binding of NLS toward Kap123 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Particularly, H4-NLS diacetylation at K5 and K12 will promote H3-NLS-dependent Kap123 association of the H3:H4/Asf1 complex, thereby facilitating H3-NLS-dependent nuclear translocation during S phase. This may provide selective translocation of histone H3 variants depending on their acetylation status by excluding commonly shared histone H4 from Kap123. In accordance with this speculation, different levels of K14 acetylation were observed in H3.1 (7%) and H3.3 (20%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loyola et al., 2006</xref>), although the K5 and K12 diacetylation pattern on histone H4 was preserved in H3.1, H3.3, and CENP-A pre-deposition complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loyola et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailey et al., 2016</xref>). Considering the fact that the large amounts of histones translocate during DNA replication, this minor difference may have significant difference in nuclear translocation preference. Follow-up studies are necessary to test this possibility. This observation also suggests that acetylation of H3-NLS, particularly at K14 and K23, may be a part of the regulation mechanism of histone nuclear import. Several groups previously observed H3 K14 acetylation in cytoplasmic histones H3 and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loyola et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailey et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30244.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of Kap123-dependent nuclear translocation of the H3:H4/Asf1 complex.</title><p>Schematic model of the potential role of histone H4 diacetylation during nuclear import. Newly synthesized histones H3 and H4 are associated and immediately protected by its specific chaperone, Asf1. The HAT1 complex subsequently acetylates K5 and K12 of histone H4 as a part of the H3:H4/Asf1 complex. Diacetylation of the H4-NLS, whose affinity toward Kap123 is already fivefold weaker than H3-NLS, further destabilizes the Kap123-histone H4 interaction. Therefore, Kap123 preferentially associates with the H3-NLS and allows for histone H3-dependent Kap123 association during nuclear translocation. It should be noted that there are several histone H3 variants available in eukaryotes but there is only one known histone H4 protein, which can be commonly shared by each histone H3 variant.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-30244-fig7-v2"/></fig><p>In the current study, we aimed to address two major issues associated with Kap123-dependent nuclear translocation of histones H3 and H4: (1) Kap123 recognition of the nuclear localization signals of histones H3 and H4; and (2) the role of post-translational modifications, particularly acetylation, in the nuclear import of histones H3 and H4. Our structural and biochemical observations demonstrate that Kap123 recognizes H3-NLS using two distally located lysine-binding pockets. In addition, the acetylation of key H3- and H4-NLS lysine residues negatively contributes to the Kap123-NLS association. Particularly, H4-NLS diacetylation may serve as an important step of the histone H3-dependent nuclear translocation of the H3:H4/Asf1 complex mediated by Kap123.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Full-length <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic> (<italic>Kl</italic>) Kap123 (residues 1–1113) protein was cloned into the pET3a vector with His<sub>X6</sub> tag and tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site at the N-terminus.

Kap123 is shown to have a unique binding mechanism that uses two lysine-binding pockets to bind histone NLS. Kap123 preferentially binds H3-NLS over H4-NLS, and histone acetyl-lysine mimics (glutamine substitutions) further weaken H4 binding.</p><p>The study provides molecular details into the nuclear import of newly synthesized histones, the findings of which will surely interest labs studying chromatin biology and the broader scientific community. We recommend that the manuscript be published, but the authors should incorporate some modifications as per the points below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Carefully distinguish the effect of H4 K5/K8/K12 binding to Kap123 from that of H4 K16 in the text. This is important since the Kap123-H4-NLS structure shows that the second lysine-binding pocket binds K16 of H4-NLS, yet direct Kap123 binding to H4 K5/K12 is a real possibility since it is the acetylation of these residues that affects Kap123 binding to H4.</p><p>2) Comment (in the Discussion) on the difference between the histone constructs used in this study in comparison to past studies, and how there may be additional contact residues in the histone globular domain to which karyopherins may also bind.</p><p>3) Models where cytoplasmic acetylation may modulate binding within an import complex where there are at least 2 NLSs, and/or that acetylation may help dissociate the complex more readily once in the nucleus are valid. However, please be sure to refer to all published data. Right now the text only discusses the observation that H4K5Q/K8Q/K12Q diminishes H4-NLS nuclear import in yeast (e.g. JBC 282:20142-50), but does not discuss results in other systems suggesting that H4 acetylation is important for nuclear import (e.g. JBC 286: 17714-21; MBC 22:245-55).</p><p>The authors should also not just focus on H4 in their Discussion and include the possibility that both the H3 NLS and H4 NLS may be acetylated to modulate binding.</p><p>4) Remove the subtitle 'Acetylation of key lysine residues at H3 1-28 -NLS interferes with Kap123 association', since no experiments are shown using acetyl H3 in this subsection.</p><p>5) The structural data is solid on its own.

Our SPR data also indicate that H4 K16 mutations are less significant than H4 K5/K12 mutations in Kap123 association. As we stated in the manuscript, the mutational effect of H4 K16 might be less significant due to additional contacts mediated by H4 R17 and R19. We expect that the H4 K16 interaction with the second lysine-binding pocket is specific but rather its affinity is relatively weak. However, H4 K5 and K12 may contribute more in Kap123 association based on SPR and competition assays. We updated the revised manuscript accordingly (subsection “Acetylation mimic mutations of H3- and H4-NLSs reduce the affinity toward Kap123” and subsection “H4<sub>1–34</sub>-NLS mainly interacts with Kap123 via the second lysine-binding pocket”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Comment (in the Discussion) on the difference between the histone constructs used in this study in comparison to past studies, and how there may be additional contact residues in the histone globular domain to which karyopherins may also bind.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers pointed out, we designed and used peptides of histone H3- and H4-NLSs (H3<sub>1–28</sub> and H4<sub>1–34</sub>) for our crystallographic studies based on the former publication (JBC, 2007, 282:20142-50). However, we used different sizes of H3- and H4-NLSs for SPR experiment (H3<sub>1–35</sub> and H4<sub>1–21</sub>) and the competition assay (H3<sub>1–59</sub> and H4<sub>1–48</sub>) partly based on crystal structures we determined and the former publication (JBC, 2002, 277:862-868), respectively. Particularly, H4<sub>1-21</sub> used for the SPR experiment may not fully restore the interaction with Kap123. Mosammaparast et al. (JBC, 2002, 277:862-868) suggested that the additional H4-Kap123 interaction might exist through H4<sub>22–42</sub>. Although we don’t see an additional interaction of H4<sub>22–34</sub> in our crystal structure (Kap123-H4<sub>1–34</sub>-NLS), additional interaction may exist in H4<sub>35–42</sub> or the electron density of additional interaction via H4<sub>22–34</sub> was not clearly visible like as the case of histone H4 K5, K8, and K12. We made additional comments in the Discussion accordingly (subsection “Acetylation mimic mutations of H3- and H4-NLSs reduce the affinity toward Kap123”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Models where cytoplasmic acetylation may modulate binding within an import complex where there are at least 2 NLSs, and/or that acetylation may help dissociate the complex more readily once in the nucleus are valid.

Acid Res. 45, 9319-9335]. Ejlassi-Lassallette et al. (MBC 22:245-55) showed that exogenously introduced histones H3:H4<sup>K5Q/K12Q</sup> improved the nuclear import in <italic>P. polycepthalum</italic>. Although their result is intriguing, we cannot directly compare their results to ours because several karyopherin proteins in addition to Kap123 homolog may participate in nuclear transportation of histones H3:H4 in vivo. Highly charged Flag tag at the N-terminal of histone H4 (DYKDDDDK epitope) may also contribute in nuclear import process. They also proposed that Hat1 participates in the nuclear transport of histones H3:H4, but it is widely known that Hat1 deletion does not have a significant phenotype and Imp4 associated histones H3:H4 contains Asf1a and Asf1b but not Hat1 (JBC 286:117714-21). Alvarez et al. (JBC 286:117714-21) performed the pull-down assay of Imp4 using pre-incubated with either wild-type H4<sub>2-20</sub> or tetra-acetylated H4<sub>2-20</sub><sup>K5/K8/K12/K16Ac</sup> peptides and subsequent addition of histone (H3:H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer for the competition. However, our crystal structure, SPR, and the competition assays all clearly show that acetylation of histone H4 K5/K8/K12/K16 weakens the Kap123 interaction. They further showed that histone H4-NLS<sup>K5Q/K12Q</sup> –EYFP improved nuclear import in vitro nuclear transportation assay using HeLa cell reticulocyte extract. However, this result does not agree with other earlier observation (JBC 282:20142-50), in which H4K5Q/K8Q/K12Q diminishes H4-NLS nuclear import in yeast. However, we agree on the reviewer’s point that we should include in the Discussion the potential effect of histone H3 acetylation. Our crystal structure and binding results clearly indicate that acetylation of histone H3 K14 and K23 significantly influences to the Kap123-H3 interaction and indeed H3 K14 acetylation has been described in former literatures although results vary in different species and different studies. We discussed this possibility in the revised manuscript (subsection “Diacetylation of H4-NLS may allow Kap123-H3 dependent nuclear translocation of the H3:H4/Asf1 complex”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Remove the subtitle 'Acetylation of key lysine residues at H3 1-28 -NLS interferes with Kap123 association', since no experiments are shown using acetyl H3 in this subsection.</p></disp-quote><p>Accordingly, we deleted the subtitle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The structural data is solid on its own.
