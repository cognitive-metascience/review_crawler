guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to target catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) and offers an alternative to genetic interventions for studying pervasive antisense transcription. Here, we successfully use click chemistry to construct DNA templates for sgRNA expression and show, rather than acting simply as a roadblock, sgRNA/dCas9 binding creates an environment that is permissive for transcription initiation/termination, thus generating novel sense and antisense transcripts. At <italic>HMS2</italic> in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, sgRNA/dCas9 targeting to the non-template strand for antisense transcription results in antisense transcription termination, premature termination of a proportion of sense transcripts and initiation of a novel antisense transcript downstream of the sgRNA/dCas9-binding site. This redefinition of the transcriptional landscape by CRISPRi demonstrates that it is not strand-specific and highlights the controls and locus understanding required to properly interpret results from CRISPRi interventions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPRi</kwd><kwd>transcription roadblock</kwd><kwd>strand-specificity</kwd><kwd>transcription initiation</kwd><kwd>transcription termination</kwd><kwd>HMS2 and GAL1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J001694/2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name><name><surname>Mellor</surname><given-names>Jane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>209897/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lamstaes</surname><given-names>Anna R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), which uses small guide RNAs to target catalytically dead Cas9 protein to chromatin, disrupts existing transcription units and generates new sites for initiation and termination of transcription on both strands of DNA.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic genomes are pervasively transcribed but the effect of this inter- and intragenic transcription is not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mellor et al., 2016</xref>). Of particular interest is the function of antisense transcription, which alters the chromatin in the vicinity of sense promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lavender et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Murray et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pelechano and Steinmetz, 2013</xref>), and is associated with repression, activation or no change in levels of the corresponding sense transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Murray et al., 2015</xref>). Discerning the mechanism by which antisense transcription functions in gene regulation is confounded by the difficulty in ablating antisense transcription without direct genetic intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bassett et al., 2014</xref>). A new approach, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Qi et al., 2013</xref>), can circumvent these issues by avoiding the need to manipulate endogenous DNA sequences. An endonucleolytically dead version of Cas9 (dCas9) is recruited by single base-pairing guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the non-template (NT) DNA strand, where it blocks transcription strand-specifically at the loci tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lenstra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Qi et al., 2013</xref>). In a further adaptation, dCas9 fusion with transcriptional repressors or activators allows both negative and positive regulations of transcription, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gilbert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>), but the strand-specificity is lost and thus is not suitable for strand-specific repression of antisense transcription. The sgRNA compenent of the CRISPRi system consists of two regions: a constant region (82 nt) that binds to dCas9 and a variable region (20 nt) that is responsible for targeting. The modular nature of the sgRNA lends itself to production from DNA templates constructed using synthetic copper(I)-catalysed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) click chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">El-Sagheer and Brown, 2010</xref>). The stable artificial triazole DNA linker generated is biocompatibile, being read and accurately copied by DNA and RNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Birts et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">El-Sagheer and Brown, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">El-Sagheer et al., 2011</xref>). We show that click chemistry is an efficient method for sgRNA template construction and that when combined with dCas9, these sgRNAs are as effective as sgRNAs produced from chemically synthesised full-length DNA templates at reducing levels of transcripts in vivo. However, it is still not completely understood how the CRISPRi system functions strand-specifically or why sgRNAs must target the non-template strand.</p><p>Here, we use the CRISPRi system to study the effect of blocking antisense transcription at loci with well-characterised sense:antisense transcript pairs. We have previously used a promoter deletion of the antisense transcript <italic>SUT650</italic> at the <italic>HMS2</italic> locus to show that <italic>SUT650</italic> represses <italic>HMS2</italic> sense transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>). Now we use CRISPRi to examine the effects of blocking <italic>SUT650</italic> antisense transcription to ask (i) whether <italic>SUT650</italic> represses <italic>HMS2</italic> sense transcription <italic>without</italic> a genetic intervention and (ii) whether CRISPRi is strand-specific using, in addition to <italic>HMS2</italic>, an engineered <italic>GAL1</italic> gene with a well-characterised antisense transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Murray et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2015</xref>).</p><p>The main conclusion from this study is that CRISPRi at the <italic>HMS2</italic> locus is not fully strand-specific and results in (i) premature termination of the sense transcript and (ii) initiation of a new unstable antisense transcript in the vicinity of the sgRNA binding site. As transcription from this new antisense initiation site extends in to the <italic>HMS2</italic> promoter, there is no net change in <italic>HMS2</italic> sense transcript levels. Thus, CRISPRi redefines the transcriptional landscape at <italic>HMS2</italic>. This suggests that routine use of CRISPRi for gene expression analysis will require rigorous analysis of transcript integrity and function before conclusions can be drawn.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DNA templates for sgRNA production can be made using click chemistry</title><p>CRISPRi-mediated transcriptional repression requires co-expression of a mature sgRNA and dCas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We designed three <italic>SUT650</italic>-targeting sgRNAs, located 59, 243 and 276 nucleotides downstream of the major <italic>SUT650</italic> TSS on the non-template strand (sgRNAs AS+59NT, AS+243NT, AS+276NT, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Note that there is considerable heterogeneity in the <italic>SUT650</italic> TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and thus in some cells, sgRNA AS+59NT may be binding upstream of the <italic>SUT650</italic> TSS. AS+243NT/dCas9 significantly (p=0.011) reduced <italic>SUT650</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> lanes 1 and 3, 2G) and this repression was comparable for the clicked and control full-length synthetic constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). However, there was no obvious effect of the other two sgRNAs/dCas9 on <italic>SUT650</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> lanes 1, 4 and 5, 2G). Consistently, we could only detect dCas9 binding to the site of sgRNA AS+243NT binding and not to the other two <italic>SUT650-</italic>targeting sgRNA binding sites tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

However, other factors such as sequence determinants can also influence repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Horlbeck et al., 2016a</xref>). These results at <italic>GAL1</italic> and <italic>HMS2</italic> confirm CRISPRi is suitable for reducing levels of antisense transcripts in yeast but controls are needed for each sgRNA designed to ensure that repression has been achieved.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CRISPRi repression of <italic>SUT650</italic> induces a new shorter antisense transcript at <italic>HMS2</italic></title><p>At <italic>HMS2</italic>, sgRNA AS+243NT/dCas9 was able to reduce <italic>SUT650</italic> transcript levels significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>). Since <italic>SUT650</italic> is a substrate for the major cytoplasmic 5’−3’ exonuclease Xrn1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, lanes 1 and 2), we investigated whether the CRISPRi-induced <italic>SUT650</italic> reduction was due to direct repression of <italic>SUT650</italic> transcription and/or a reduction in <italic>SUT650</italic> stability. Whilst <italic>SUT650</italic> was not stabilised upon <italic>XRN1</italic> deletion in the strain expressing AS+243NT/dCas9, supporting previous studies that CRISPRi operates via a transcriptional block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Qi et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, lanes 3 and 6, transcript B), we detected a shorter antisense transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, lane 6, transcript B<sup>t</sup>). To map transcript B<sup>t</sup>, we used a series of Northern blotting probes across the locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). With antisense-specific probes H1 and H2 in the <italic>HMS2</italic> gene promoter and 5’ coding region, respectively, we could detect antisense transcript B<sup>t</sup>, indicating that it extends into the <italic>HMS2</italic> sense promoter. However, probe H4 at the 3’ end of the <italic>HMS2</italic> gene was unable to hybridise to B<sup>t</sup>, indicating that B<sup>t</sup> initiates upstream of this site. So whilst CRISPRi successfully blocked the original <italic>SUT650</italic>, a new Xrn1-sensitive unstable antisense transcript (B<sup>t</sup>) was created. This is potentially due to changes in the chromatin structure caused by AS+243NT/dCas9 binding to this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Horlbeck et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Isaac et al., 2016</xref>) or by blocking <italic>SUT650</italic>, creating an environment that is permissive for transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Murray et al., 2012</xref>).

To our surprise, in addition to the full-length <italic>HMS2</italic> sense transcript (A), we detected a considerably shortened <italic>HMS2</italic> sense transcript (A<sup>t</sup>). Since the combined levels of the truncated and full-length transcripts are similar to those in the strain not expressing an sgRNA, independent of the presence of <italic>XRN1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, lanes 1 and 3 or 2 and 6), we hypothesised that the AS+243NT/dCas9 complex bound within the <italic>HMS2</italic> coding region may be causing partial premature sense transcription termination, leading to transcript A<sup>t</sup>. Thus, we mapped the 3’ end of <italic>HMS2</italic> S by Northern blotting using a series of strand-specific probes across the locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Both transcripts A and A<sup>t</sup> could clearly be detected using the probes upstream of the AS+243NT/dCas9 binding site (probes H1, H2, H3), but the truncated transcript was undetectable using probe H4 downstream of this site. Thus, the transcriptional block caused by AS+243NT/dCas9 is not strand-specific and re-defines the transcriptional landscape at the <italic>HMS2</italic> locus by creating a chromatin environment that is suitable for both transcription initiation and termination. To see if we could more directly target and block <italic>HMS2</italic> sense transcripts, we designed three sgRNAs to bind the non-template strand adjacent to PAM sites near the <italic>HMS2</italic> sense TSS (S+77NT, S+106NT, S+179NT) and monitored their effects on both <italic>HMS2</italic> sense and antisense transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Thus, new transcription units are generated that result in novel sense and antisense transcripts of varying stabilities that are therefore not always detectable.

Additionally, the locus contains a self-splicing site that produces a mature transcript without additional machinery, allowing precise production of a mature sgRNA without any unwanted extensions.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. We have attached the reviewers' comments for you below.</p><p>As you will see, the reviewers find your study of great interest to the community, but have also suggested that the paper is technical in nature and somewhat lacks mechanistic insight. We are willing to consider a revised version of your manuscript addressing the comments/concerns of the reviewers, specifically reviewer 2.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In recent years, transcriptional interference by antisense RNA transcription has been recognized as a relatively frequent means to regulate mRNA expression. Tools enabling antisense transcription arrest without directly affecting sense transcription are required to study the mechanism mediating this effect. The recently reported CRISPRi system, using a modified, partially defective, Cas9 (dCas9) appeared as ideally suited for this since it has been shown to be able to trigger transcription termination in a site specific and, most importantly, strand specific manner, without altering the genomic sequence.</p><p>This short report shows that this strand specificity is actually not true at all loci. In addition, it describes an example in which the binding of the guide RNA actually induces spurious transcription initiation, suggesting that it markedly perturbs the local chromatin environment.</p><p>I think that the data are suitably convincing. Note, by the way, that this referee has made the similar (unpublished) observations that the termination by this system was not strand specific at yet another locus.</p><p>Although one could argue that the main results presented in this manuscript are negative results, I personally think that they are well worth being published to warn further investigators who would wish to use this system and a short report in <italic>eLife</italic> might seem appropriate for that.</p><p>The position of the 5'-end of SUT650 seems incorrectly assigned. Indeed, if one refers to the TIF-seq data from the original Pelechano paper, the main transcription start site for SUT650 (position 705244 on the Crick strand of chromosome X; this is also consistent with the data from Malabat et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2015) would be located about 60 nucleotides DOWNSTREAM of the AS-44NT sgRNA binding site (position 705184). Thus, as the other SUT650 sgRNA targeting sequences, AS-44NT would actually be located within the SUT650 transcribed region, downstream from its TSS and not upstream. It could thus not be considered as a &quot;control&quot; sgRNA. Could the authors verify this point and, if this is correct, modify the text, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> accordingly? This would in no way modify the conclusions of the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this paper by Howe et al., the authors assess the potential of CRISPRi for strand-specific transcriptional perturbation in budding yeast. They study two genes in depth – GAL1 and HMS2 – and compare the effectiveness of CRISPRi to previous approaches (for example deletion of cis-acting motifs such as the TATA box) in wt and Xrn1 deletion strains. Their primary conclusion is that CRISPRi works well in some cases and not in others and requires careful controls. For example, the authors show that the system does repress antisense transcription, but at one of the two studied loci (HMS2), an additional antisense transcript appears from a new initiation site, and the sense transcript is prematurely terminated. In addition, they present a clever tool based on click chemistry for quickly making gRNA. Although I don't find the main conclusion revelatory, I commend the authors for their thoroughness. Certainly, this message is one that bears reporting, although I am not quite convinced this result clears the bar for an <italic>eLife</italic> paper.</p><p>1) The authors show that CRISPRi represses the antisense transcript at a GAL1 model gene. They then check whether this repression has transcriptional effects on GAL1 sense transcription and they conclude there is no difference in galactose. However, previous work has shown that antisense at the GAL locus works mostly under repressive conditions. Have the authors repeated this experiment in glucose or raffinose?</p><p>2) The authors show that CRISPRi repression at the HMS2 locus results in a changed transcriptional landscape. Replacement of the HMS locus by URA does not have the same effect, and they suggest that CRISPRi binding causes these additional transcripts. However, it is unclear whether the new transcripts at HMS2 appear because of removal of the antisense, which in itself could change the chromatin landscape and thus the transcriptional landscape, or whether it arises because of binding of dCas9. The same authors have previously published that removal of the GAL10 ncRNA by genetic methods (point mutations of the transcription factor binding sites) also results in additional transcripts not visible in the wildtype (Murray et al., 2015, supplementary figure S5C). Given these findings, it remains unclear whether the new antisense transcript indeed results from the CRISPRi binding. Moreover, it is noteworthy that additional transcripts are also found in some genetic mutants. Control experiments are therefore required for both methods.</p><p>3) The Xrn1 sensitivity is a confounding factor, and I am not sure that strain should be the gold standard for CRISPRi not working. The whole point is that one can get blocking or perturbation in the absence of genetic manipulation. So, for example one concluding sentence &quot;CRISPRi is not as effective as a genetic mutation in reducing levels of either the GAL1 or HMS2 AS transcripts&quot; should end with &quot;[…] in the Xrn1 deletion.&quot;</p><p>4) In a related point, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> is a critical part of the argument. The lower panel needs to have significance calculated between the TATA mutant and AS+112NT, since these bars look pretty similar to this referee.

However, with a hit rate of ~1 in 2, this reviewer is not convinced by authors' claim that sgRNAs targeting the sense transcript have no effect on antisense transcription. Perhaps the coverage was simply too low to obtain a functional repressive sgRNA. The authors should perform high-density sgRNA tiling experiments (targeting both template and non-template) for either GAL1-AS or SUT650 (not necessary to do both loci). I feel this experiment will dramatically improve the manuscript and instill clarity into the context requirements for CRISPRi mediated repression.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29878.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In recent years, transcriptional interference by antisense RNA transcription has been recognized as a relatively frequent means to regulate mRNA expression. Tools enabling antisense transcription arrest without directly affecting sense transcription are required to study the mechanism mediating this effect. The recently reported CRISPRi system, using a modified, partially defective, Cas9 (dCas9) appeared as ideally suited for this since it has been shown to be able to trigger transcription termination in a site specific and, most importantly, strand specific manner, without altering the genomic sequence.</p><p>This short report shows that this strand specificity is actually not true at all loci. In addition, it describes an example in which the binding of the guide RNA actually induces spurious transcription initiation, suggesting that it markedly perturbs the local chromatin environment.</p><p>I think that the data are suitably convincing. Note, by the way, that this referee has made the similar (unpublished) observations that the termination by this system was not strand specific at yet another locus.</p><p>Although one could argue that the main results presented in this manuscript are negative results, I personally think that they are well worth being published to warn further investigators who would wish to use this system and a short report in eLife might seem appropriate for that.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for recognising the importance of this work as a warning to other researchers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The position of the 5'-end of SUT650 seems incorrectly assigned. Indeed, if one refers to the TIF-seq data from the original Pelechano paper, the main transcription start site for SUT650 (position 705244 on the Crick strand of chromosome X; this is also consistent with the data from Malabat et al., eLife, 2015) would be located about 60 nucleotides DOWNSTREAM of the AS-44NT sgRNA binding site (position 705184). Thus, as the other SUT650 sgRNA targeting sequences, AS-44NT would actually be located within the SUT650 transcribed region, downstream from its TSS and not upstream. It could thus not be considered as a &quot;control&quot; sgRNA. Could the authors verify this point and, if this is correct, modify the text, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> accordingly? This would in no way modify the conclusions of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and apologise for our oversight. We note that there is a large heterogeneity in the position of the transcription start site for SUT650 and the one we had chosen previously (position 705149, published in Nguyen et al., 2014) is one of the many sites. We have now discussed the transcript heterogeneity in the main body of the text and included a supplementary figure with the Pelechano TIF-seq data to illustrate this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have also renamed the HMS2 strains in the text and figures based on the new AS-targeting sgRNA positions relative to the major SUT650 TSS at position 705244 identified by this reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this paper by Howe et al., the authors assess the potential of CRISPRi for strand-specific transcriptional perturbation in budding yeast. They study two genes in depth – GAL1 and HMS2 – and compare the effectiveness of CRISPRi to previous approaches (for example deletion of cis-acting motifs such as the TATA box) in wt and Xrn1 deletion strains. Their primary conclusion is that CRISPRi works well in some cases and not in others and requires careful controls. For example, the authors show that the system does repress antisense transcription, but at one of the two studied loci (HMS2), an additional antisense transcript appears from a new initiation site, and the sense transcript is prematurely terminated. In addition, they present a clever tool based on click chemistry for quickly making gRNA. Although I don't find the main conclusion revelatory, I commend the authors for their thoroughness. Certainly, this message is one that bears reporting, although I am not quite convinced this result clears the bar for an eLife paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their support of the message we are trying to convey to the community. We feel that <italic>eLife</italic>, with its reputation for thoroughness and research integrity, would be an ideal journal for publishing this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors show that CRISPRi represses the antisense transcript at a GAL1 model gene. They then check whether this repression has transcriptional effects on GAL1 sense transcription and they conclude there is no difference in galactose. However, previous work has shown that antisense at the GAL locus works mostly under repressive conditions. Have the authors repeated this experiment in glucose or raffinose?</p></disp-quote><p>As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, we observed no leaky expression of GAL1 sense transcript in glucose (t=0) in the absence of the antisense and the sense induction kinetics are similar to the control. We have included a sentence in the manuscript text to explain this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors show that CRISPRi repression at the HMS2 locus results in a changed transcriptional landscape. Replacement of the HMS locus by URA does not have the same effect, and they suggest that CRISPRi binding causes these additional transcripts. However, it is unclear whether the new transcripts at HMS2 appear because of removal of the antisense, which in itself could change the chromatin landscape and thus the transcriptional landscape, or whether it arises because of binding of dCas9. The same authors have previously published that removal of the GAL10 ncRNA by genetic methods (point mutations of the transcription factor binding sites) also results in additional transcripts not visible in the wildtype (Murray et al., 2015, supplementary figure S5C). Given these findings, it remains unclear whether the new antisense transcript indeed results from the CRISPRi binding. Moreover, it is noteworthy that additional transcripts are also found in some genetic mutants. Control experiments are therefore required for both methods.</p></disp-quote><p>The point made here by this reviewer is a valid one – we are unable to infer whether it is the binding of sgRNA/dCas9 or the loss of the antisense that is causing the initiation of the new transcripts. It would be experimentally very difficult to show this and we have now clarified the two possible reasons for new transcripts in the text.</p><p>However, the main point is that, independent of what is causing the initiation of the new antisense transcript, in the CRISPRi strain, transcription is occurring in the antisense direction into the HMS2 sense promoter and so no conclusions could be made about the function of SUT650 in sense regulation in this strain. The fear is that some investigators may use the CRISPRi system without the proper controls and the current set of experiments is intended to highlight how important these controls are.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Xrn1 sensitivity is a confounding factor, and I am not sure that strain should be the gold standard for CRISPRi not working. The whole point is that one can get blocking or perturbation in the absence of genetic manipulation. So, for example one concluding sentence &quot;CRISPRi is not as effective as a genetic mutation in reducing levels of either the GAL1 or HMS2 AS transcripts&quot; should end with &quot;… in the Xrn1 deletion.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise that we were not clear about the reason for performing the experiments in the XRN1 delete and have now clarified this in the text. We chose to use the deletion of XRN1 to stabilise any transcripts that may be being produced in the CRISPRi strains but then rapidly degraded so that, if the experiment is done in an XRN1<sup>+</sup> background, the transcript could not be detected. This is important mechanistically because often it is the act of antisense transcription that may cause the effect on neighbouring/overlapping transcription units rather than the antisense transcript itself (e.g. Murray et al., 2015). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, both the TATA mutant and AS+112NT have undetectable GAL1 AS in the top panel. However, upon XRN1 deletion, a little GAL1 AS is stabilised in the TATA mutant but much more is stabilised in the AS+112NT strain. We interpret this to indicate that there is more leaky but unstable GAL1 AS transcript in the AS+112NT strain than in the TATA mutant strain and thus it is true to say that CRISPRi is not as effective as a genetic mutation in reducing levels of GAL1 AS transcriptionin the presence or absence of XRN1. The same logic can also be applied to the new unstable Xrn1-sensitive HMS2 AS transcripts that appear in the AS+243NT (previously called AS+148NT) strain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In a related point, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> is a critical part of the argument. The lower panel needs to have significance calculated between the TATA mutant and AS+112NT, since these bars look pretty similar to this referee. Moreover, the similarity between these measurements suggests that the lower panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> is not quite a representative image.</p></disp-quote><p>We have found it very difficult to quantify blots with very low signal levels so we apologise that the image did not appear to be representative of the accompanying quantification. We have now included a more rigorous background subtraction step for the GAL1 AS Northerns and hope that the reviewer is satisfied with the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. We have also included significance values here. The same alteration in the quantification of GAL1 AS transcript levels has been repeated for the other GAL1 AS blots and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> has therefore been remade accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Lastly, given that CRISPRi does represses the antisense transcript in both loci tested in the study in a strand-specific manner, the title is a bit misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown that CRISPRi only works strand-specifically at GAL1, because at HMS2, both the sense and the antisense transcripts are blocked. However, we agree that the original title perhaps didn’t reflect this fully so have now changed it to include the words ‘at all loci’: ‘CRISPRi is not strand-specific at all loci and redefines the transcriptional landscape’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, despite technical issues, I nevertheless find their argument that CRISPRi can have locus-specific effects to be convincing.

We wish to publish this work to highlight how important it is that these controls are done or perhaps to suggest that CRIPSRi may not always be a suitable technique if the correct controls cannot be performed.</p><p>We have also added mechanistic insight in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, where we have performed a ChIP experiment for Cas9 and show that dCas9 is present at the site of sgRNA binding for the sgRNA that successfully represses HMS2 AS transcript but not at those sgRNAs that do not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript Howe and collaborators in the Mellor and Brown labs explore the molecular basis of CRISPRi transcriptional interference in the context of yeast anti-sense transcription.

We apologise if this was confused in the text and have clarified this section. We included the (negative) results from the 3 sense-targeting sgRNAs again to reiterate the fact that not all sgRNAs are effective and this is an important control to do. We included the HMS2 AS data from the sense sgRNA strains as a control for the sgRNAs also not working on the template strand.</p><p>As stated above, we are not aiming to investigate what makes some sgRNAs cause effective transcript repression and others not. We do not feel that testing more sgRNAs would significantly add to the conclusions of the paper, which were that a) CRIPSRi does not always repress transcription b) CRISPRi is not always strand-specific and c) CRISPRi can induce novel transcripts that would confound any analysis. It is also relevant that the highest CRISPRi activity with unfused dCas9 was observed using PAM sites near the relevant TSSs (Qi et al., 2013) as we have done here. Using PAM sites that are more distant from the TSS is unlikely to add any insight into the conclusions we have made here.</p></body></sub-article></article>
