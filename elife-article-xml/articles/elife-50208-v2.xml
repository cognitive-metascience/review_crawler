of skeletal development, is highly activated in cartilage and bone tumors. Yet deletion of <italic>Ptch1</italic>, encoding an inhibitor of IHH receptor Smoothened (SMO), in chondrocyte or osteoblasts does not cause tumorigenesis. Here, we show that <italic>Ptch1</italic> deletion in mice Prrx1<sup>+</sup>mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) promotes MSC proliferation and osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation but inhibits adipogenic differentiation. Moreover, <italic>Ptch1</italic> deletion led to development of osteoarthritis-like phenotypes, exostoses, enchondroma, and osteosarcoma in Smo-Gli1/2-dependent manners. The cartilage and bone tumors are originated from Prrx1<sup>+</sup> lineage cells and express low levels of osteoblast and chondrocyte markers, respectively. Mechanistically, <italic>Ptch1</italic> deletion increases the expression of Wnt5a/6 and leads to enhanced β-Catenin activation. Inhibiting Wnt/β-Catenin pathway suppresses development of skeletal anomalies including enchondroma and osteosarcoma. These findings suggest that cartilage/bone tumors arise from their early progenitor cells and identify the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway as a pharmacological target for cartilage/bone neoplasms.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50208.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bone and cartilage tumors are among the most common tumors in the skeleton, often affecting the limbs. Bone tumors, also called osteosarcomas, usually occur in growing children and teenagers, and they are often resistant to conventional chemo- and radio-therapies. Surgery is the only treatment option, but this can lead to long-lasting damage that impairs the quality of life of these patients. Thus, there is a need to find new drug targets for these diseases. Unfortunately, no good laboratory-based systems exist that mimic these human cancers, hindering research into these tumors.</p><p>One way to create a laboratory-based model for cartilage tumors and osteosarcomas is to reproduce the signaling that is present in the human tumors in a mouse. A signaling pathway called Hedgehog signaling is overactive in human cartilage and bone tumors. The activity of this pathway can be increased by deleting a gene called <italic>Ptch1</italic>; but mice do not form tumors when this gene is deleted in their mature cartilage and bone cells.</p><p>Now, Deng, Li et al. report that deleting <italic>Ptch1</italic> in mesenchymal stem cells, early-stage cells that can give rise to cartilage and bone cells, generates a mouse model for osteosarcoma and cartilage tumors. The mice with these <italic>Ptch1</italic> deficient cells developed tumors with overactive Hedgehog signaling in cartilage and bone. Deng, Li et al. also performed biochemical experiments to show that Hedgehog signaling turned on another signaling pathway called Wnt signaling. Treating the mice that had mesenchymal cells lacking <italic>Ptch1</italic> with a drug that inhibits Wnt signaling reduced the growth of cartilage and bone tumors.</p><p>These data suggest that deleting <italic>Ptch1</italic> in mouse mesenchymal stem cells can mimic human cartilage tumors and osteosarcomas. More experiments will be needed to explain how the Hedgehog and Wnt signaling pathways interact in these tumors. Finally, further studies will need to investigate if inhibiting Wnt signaling might become a useful therapy for human patients with osteosarcoma in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hedgehog</kwd><kwd>bone tumor</kwd><kwd>mesenchymal stem cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFA0103602</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Huijuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFA0800803</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Baojie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81520108012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Baojie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91542120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Baojie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Columbia University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Schaefer Research Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Baojie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cartilage and bone tumors arise from chondrocyte or osteoblast progenitors but not differentiated cells or multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) via the IHH-Wnt/β-Catenin pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway controls embryonic pattern formation and organogenesis, adult stem cells homeostasis and tissue maintenance, and is involved in the etiology of various tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briscoe and Thérond, 2013</xref>). Ligand (Indian, Sonic, or Desert Hedgehog) engagement to receptor Smoothened (Smo) relieves the inhibition of Patched 1 (Ptch1) and upregulates Gli1/2 proteins, which increase the expression of proteins including Myc, Cyclin D, and Bcl2 and promote cell proliferation. Hedgehogs also activate the Rho/Rac pathway and increase the expression of Cyclin B in Smo-independent manners, which are regarded as the non-canonical pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briscoe and Thérond, 2013</xref>). Human genetic studies have identified germline mutations in <italic>Ptch1</italic> as the cause of Gorlin syndrome, which is characterized by basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, cartilage tumors, and ectopic ossification during adolescence and early adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hahn et al., 1996</xref>). Some of the patients also develop holoprosencephaly and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noor et al., 2010</xref>). Inhibitors for Smo or Gli1/2 are developed to treat the related tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amakye et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>IHH is mainly expressed in prehypertrophic chondrocytes and osteoblasts at puberty stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kindblom et al., 2002</xref>). Genetic studies have shown that IHH signaling regulates proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts and chondrocytes during skeletal development and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lanske et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maeda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohba et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">St-Jacques et al., 1999</xref>). IHH regulates chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation mainly via PTHrP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lanske et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Williams et al., 2018</xref>), while IHH regulates osteoblast differentiation by controlling Runx2 expression via the canonical and non-canonical pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, Wnt/β-Catenin signaling, a crucial regulator of skeletal development and remodeling, has been shown to mediate the effects of IHH signaling on osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canalis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hill et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yoshida et al., 2004</xref>), but act upstream of and parallel to IHH signaling in chondrocyte survival and hypertrophy, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mak et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, Hh signaling in mature osteoblasts upregulates RANKL expression and enhances osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mak et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, IHH signaling plays critical roles in skeletal development and remodeling.</p><p>Enchondromas and osteosarcomas are among the most common skeleton tumors and they are generally resistant to conventional chemo- and radio-therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amakye et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kansara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nazeri et al., 2018</xref>). There is an urgent need to identify druggable targets for treatment of these disorders, yet this is hampered by incomplete understanding of pathogenesis of these tumors and a lack of animal models that resemble the human disorders. Cartilage/bone tumors often show activated Hh signaling, resulted either from mutations in <italic>EXT1/2</italic>, <italic>PTH1R</italic>, or <italic>SMO</italic> or from elevated expression of hedgehog ligands or Gli proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amary et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hopyan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pansuriya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tarpey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tiet et al., 2006</xref>). However, activation of Hh signaling, for example by deletion of <italic>Ptch1</italic> alone, in chondrocytes or osteoblasts does not cause tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruce et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use <italic>Prrx1-CreERT; Ptch1<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice to study the functions of Hh signaling in mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) during adolescence and show that activation of Hh signaling promotes MSC proliferation and osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation but suppresses MSC adipogenic differentiation and leads to development of osteoarthritis-like phenotypes, enchondroma, and osteosarcoma. <italic>Ptch1</italic> deletion executes these functions via the canonical Hh pathway and activation of Wnt/β-Catenin pathway. This study thus sheds light on the origin of enchondroma and osteosarcoma and identifies Wnt/β-Catenin as a drug target for cartilage/bone tumor treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Ptch1</italic> deletion in Prrx1<sup>+</sup> MSCs in young mice resulted in distorted joints and ectopic bone formation</title><p>To investigate the functions of Hh signaling in postnatal bone growth, we ablated <italic>Ptch1</italic> in Prrx1<sup>+</sup> MSCs using inducible <italic>Prrx1-CreERT</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kawanami et al., 2009</xref>), due to embryonic lethality of <italic>Prrx1-Cre; Ptch1<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruce et al., 2010</xref>).

This is in stark contrast to deletion of <italic>Ptch1</italic> in osteoblasts or chondrocytes and suggests that stemness or differentiation status of the cell plays a critical role in cartilage/bone tumorigenesis. We further show that <italic>Ptch1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>enchondromas and osteosarcomas are derived from Prrx1<sup>+</sup> lineage located at cartilage and periosteal bone, respectively and they express limited levels of markers for differentiated chondrocytes and osteoblasts, respectively. This is in line with the roles of Hh signaling in maintaining cancer stem cells. Although Prrx1<sup>+</sup> MSCs located at different places including the periosteal bones have tri-lineage differentiation potentials, no tumor contains both chondrocytes and osteoblasts in <italic>Prrx1-CreERT; Ptch1<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice. These results, together with previous studies showing that multipotent stem cells must commit to unipotent progenitors in order for <italic>Ptch1</italic> deficiency to promote growth of medulloblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schüller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang et al., 2008b</xref>), suggest that enchondroma and osteosarcoma are originated from the early chondrocyte and osteoblast progenitors derived from the Prrx1<sup>+</sup> MSCs. The underlying reason may be that progenitor cells have much greater proliferation activity than differentiated cells and multipotent stem cells.</p><p>The <italic>Prrx1-CreERT; Ptch1<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mouse line is one of the few models for cartilage/bone tumors. Other models include mice with chondrocyte-specific Gli-2 overexpression and mice with chondrocyte-specific <italic>Ext1</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirata et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hopyan et al., 2002</xref>). While Gli proteins can be activated by Erks, Akt1, and other pro-proliferating signals, Ext1/2 control synthesis of heparin sulphate and mutations of Ext genes may cause IHH diffusion and other effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jones et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, deletion of <italic>Ptch1</italic> in osteoblasts using human osteocalcin-Cre in p53<sup>+/-</sup>but not p53<sup>+/+</sup> background could induce osteosarcoma formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we show that <italic>Ptch1</italic> deletion in Gli1-marked chondrocytes and osteoprogenitors does not cause tumorigenesis. Thus, <italic>Prrx1-CreERT; Ptch1<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mouse represents a unique model useful for dissecting the initiation and progression of both enchondroma and osteosarcoma and for testing drug candidates to target these two tumors.</p><p>In addition, we show that Hh signaling promotes MSC proliferation and MSC osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation but inhibits MSC adipogenic differentiation. While MSC-specific <italic>Ptch1</italic> deletion reproduces some of the phenotypes observed in chondrocyte- and/or osteoblast-specific <italic>Ptch1</italic> knockout mice, for example decreased body weight, body length and/or joint deformation, differences are also evident. <italic>Prrx1-CreERT; Ptch1<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice show unaltered bone mass, whereas <italic>Ptch1</italic> deletion in mature osteoblasts leads to a loss of bone mass due to increased bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mak et al., 2008</xref>). While deletion of <italic>Ptch1</italic> in Col2 chondrocytes results in a delay in hypertrophic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mak et al., 2006</xref>), we show that deletion of <italic>Ptch1</italic> in MSCs results in enhanced hypertrophic growth. In addition, <italic>Ptch1</italic> deletion in MSCs causes much severe joint deformation and exostoses and only <italic>Ptch1</italic> deletion in MSCs induces cartilage/bone tumor formation. These findings suggest that Hh activation-induced overproliferation and tumorigenesis occur in MSCs but not in differentiated daughter cells. We have previously reported that ectopic expression of HB-EGF or deletion of <italic>Tsc1</italic> (an mTOR inhibitor) in MSCs produces much severe cartilage and bone defects than similar genetic manipulation in chondrocytes and/or osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that in the process of osteoblast and chondrocyte production, important regulation may occur at stages of stem cell expansion and commitment.</p><p>It is known that Hh signaling promotes cell proliferation, inhibits apoptosis, and promotes tumorigenesis via the canonical and non-canonical pathways. Our current study clearly shows that the canonical pathway plays a critical role in <italic>Ptch1</italic> deficiency-induced enchondroma and osteosarcoma formation, as inhibitors for Smo or Gli1/2, which are developed as candidate drugs to treat cartilage and bone tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amakye et al., 2013</xref>), suppressed tumorigenesis. In addition, we find that Wnt5a/6 are up-regulated in-<italic>Ptch1</italic> deficient MSCs and that β-Catenin is highly activated in mouse enchondroma and osteosarcoma samples. Previous studies have shown that canonical Wnt/β-Catenin signaling is essential for skeletal lineage differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hill et al., 2005</xref>), and Wnt/β-Catenin signaling is also activated in most of the human cartilage/bone tumor samples, which is correlated with activation of Hh signaling. Functionally, inhibition of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling impedes development of cartilage/bone tumors and other skeletal growth defects. These findings underscore the roles played by the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway in Hh signaling-induced cell proliferation and tumorigenesis and suggest that inhibitors for Wnt/β-Catenin pathway may be useful for treating cartilage/bone tumors, especially the ones that are resistant to Hh signaling inhibitors.</p><p>Our findings thus uncover a functional link between Hh signaling and Wnt/β-Catenin signaling in MSC proliferation/differentiation, skeletal growth, and tumor formation. However, previous studies have revealed that in Col2<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes, Wnt/β-Catenin may act upstream of or parallel to IHH pathway in controlling cell survival and joint development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mak et al., 2006</xref>). Although Hh pathway-driven development of basal cell carcinoma can be mediated by increased Wnt/β-Catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2008a</xref>), this is not a common theme as only a limited number of samples display this link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adolphe et al., 2006</xref>). Overall, these findings suggest that the functional link between Hh signaling and Wnt/β-Catenin may be specific to MSCs and progenitors of osteoblasts and chondrocytes. This is consistent with the pro-proliferation activity of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling in osteoblastogenesis and chondrogenesis.</p><p>In summary, our study has uncovered unanticipated functions of Hh signaling in MSCs, many of which are not observed in the daughter cells of MSCs. Hh activation promotes MSC proliferation and osteoblastic and chondrogenic differentiation but inhibits MSC adipogenic differentiation and leads to development of osteoarthritis, exostoses, and cartilage/bone tumors. Mechanistically, Hh signaling executes its pleiotropic effects via increasing the expression of a couple of Wnt molecules and enhancing Wnt/β-Catenin activation. Moreover, our genetic evidence suggests that enchondroma and osteosarcoma are derived from early progenitors of chondrocytes and osteoblasts and that Wnt/β-Catenin can be targeted to treat cartilage/bone tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains</title><p>All mouse work was carried out following the recommendations from the National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, with the protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai, China [SYXK (SH) 2011–0112].

Both HH and Wnt signals have implicated in bone tumor formation such as osteosarcoma and enchondroma; thus their involvement is not novel. This manuscript suggests that by inactivation Ptch1 in postnatal (P14) bone marrow MSCs using the <italic>Prrx1-CreERT</italic> in mice, this would induce a constitutive activation of the Smo pathways in these cells, that subsequently contributes to a high incidence for the formation of osteosarcoma and enchondroma. They showed a correlation between activation of the HH pathway to Wnt, and propose that in this context of the MSCs, HH act upstream of Wnt. However, they further propose that osteosarcoma and enchondroma are formed from distinct progenitor lineages and not from a common multi-potential MSC pool. In support of their hypothesis, they provided evidence for the direct involvement of the HH pathway by inhibiting SMO and Gli2 in mice to suppress the formation of osteosarcoma and enchondroma, as with the inhibition of the Wnt pathway in mice.</p><p>While the data is interesting and supportive through association, more direct links are needed to support their claims. A major concern for me is the lack of a clear study of the initial pool of cells that were labeled in the cell tracing experiment, and thus the cells in which <italic>Ptch1</italic> are inactivated. They must show a thorough analysis of the cells in the axial and appendicular bones/cartilage and bone marrow immediately after the 4 days of TAM injection, and not 2.5 months later. Further, an elected time course study after TAM injection till 2.5 months would be informative and necessary as to the proliferative and differentiation of cells. It seem odd to me that the periosteal cells are labeled if Prrx1 only target MSCs. If it is indeed a more differentiated or committee pool of MSCs for the skeletal lineage, this would be interesting but need to be established.</p><p>The link between HH and Wnt is supportive, but not definitive. In development, the relationship between these two pathways is complex and context dependent. They propose that the function of HH in MSCs and chondrocytes, but this could just be the context that they are different cells, and therefore, the downstream outcomes are different.</p><p>Based on the concerns above, there is substantial correction and additional data required for further consideration.</p><p>In addition, while in general, the figures and data are of good quality, the presentation needs to be more stringent to provide the basic information for readers to follow and understand the key points. Generally, there is a lack of details in the description and labeling of the figures, with readers having to second guess what samples and what region(s) of the skeletal elements are being described.

We found that Prrx1 could mark cells at the growth plate, endosteal bones, periosteal bones, and bone marrow in long bones (Figure 5A). However, it labelled much fewer osteoblasts and chondrocytes in the vertebrae (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B), suggesting that vertebral bones have different origins from long bones. This is consistent with our observation that deletion of <italic>Ptch1</italic> in <italic>Prrx1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells did not affect vertebrae bone mass and cartilage or develop tumors (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Moreover, the time course analysis showed that tumors developed early at day 14 for enchondroma and day 30 for osteosarcoma-like mass after induction of <italic>Ptch1</italic> deletion (Figure 5A, Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>Recent studies have identified SSCs (MSCs) in the growth plate genetically marked by PthrP, periosteal SSCs marked by Cathepsin K, and perisinusoidal MSCs marked by Gremlin 1, Nestin, and LepR. SSCs isolated from these places have the potential to differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. While previous studies have shown that Prrx1-marked BM-MSCs have tri-lineage differentiation potentials, we found that periosteal <italic>Prrx1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells also have osteoblast, chondrocyte, and adipocyte differentiation potentials (Figure 5—figure supplement 2B-D). We further showed Prrx1-marked BM-MSCs account for more than 50% of adherent cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A). These results suggest that <italic>Prrx1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells isolated from BM and periosteal bones are MSCs with multi-lineage potencies. Since deletion of <italic>Ptch1</italic> in mature osteoblasts and chondrocytes (including Gli1<sup>+</sup> osteoprogenitors and chondrocytes) does not cause tumorigenesis (Figure 3—figure supplement 3), we conclude that it is the early progenitors that are transformed. Moreover, even after becoming tumor cells, they continue to progress into the specific lineage. We conclude that Prrx1 may mark cells at several places in the skeleton that have tri-lineage differentiation potentials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The link between HH and Wnt is supportive, but not definitive.
