We used pathway-specific chemogenetic inhibition to investigate how rats’ mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine circuits contribute to the expression and modulation of reward seeking and retrieval. Inhibiting ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons disrupted the tendency for reward-paired cues to motivate reward seeking, but spared their ability to increase attempts to retrieve reward. Similar effects were produced by inhibiting dopamine inputs to nucleus accumbens, but not medial prefrontal cortex. Inhibiting dopamine neurons spared the suppressive effect of reward devaluation on reward seeking, an assay of goal-directed behavior. Attempts to retrieve reward persisted after devaluation, indicating they were habitually performed as part of a fixed action sequence. Our findings show that complete bouts of reward seeking and retrieval are behaviorally and neurally dissociable from bouts of reward seeking without retrieval.

Coordinating the discrete reward-seeking and reward-retrieval behaviors that make up these action sequences is important for efficient foraging. When rewards are sparse or otherwise difficult to obtain, attempts to retrieve them are often unnecessary and should therefore be withheld to conserve energy and minimize opportunity costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stephens and Krebs, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Niv et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with this, studies on self-paced instrumental behavior show that the ability to efficiently pattern reward-seeking and -retrieval responses based on task demands (e.g., reinforcement schedule) can strongly impact the rate at which rewards are obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ostlund et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wassum et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matamales et al., 2017</xref>). However, such behaviors must remain sensitive to changes in internal and external states. For instance, environmental cues that signal reward availability increase attempts to seek out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Estes, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corbit and Balleine, 2016</xref>) and retrieve reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marshall and Ostlund, 2018</xref>). While the ability to develop and modify action sequences is normally adaptive, this process may become dysregulated in certain conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joel and Avisar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Korff and Harvey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frederick and Cocuzzo, 2017</xref>) and drug addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tiffany, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Graybiel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Volkow et al., 2013</xref>), leading to maladaptive behaviors. Despite this, the behavioral and neural mechanisms responsible for regulating reward seeking and retrieval are not well understood.</p><p>Previous studies strongly implicate dopamine in learning new action sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Graybiel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jin and Costa, 2015</xref>). While other findings suggest that dopamine is not as important for the expression of well-established action sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Levesque et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wassum et al., 2012</xref>), it remains possible that dopamine contributes to action sequence performance when changes in task conditions prompt a reorganization of reward seeking and retrieval. For instance, previous studies indicate that the tendency for reward-paired cues to motivate reward-<italic>seeking</italic> behavior critically depends on dopamine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dickinson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ostlund and Maidment, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wassum et al., 2011</xref>), particularly in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wyvell and Berridge, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lex and Hauber, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wassum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ostlund et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitken et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, we recently found that such cues do not simply provoke reward-seeking behavior (e.g., lever pressing), they also increase the likelihood that such behavior will be followed by an attempt to retrieve reward (e.g., food-cup approach)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marshall and Ostlund, 2018</xref>). Although this finding suggests that reward-paired cues preferentially motivate complete bouts of reward seeking and retrieval, it has yet to be established if this modulation of action sequence performance depends on dopamine.</p><p>Dopamine may also contribute to regulating attempts to seek out and retrieve a reward when the value of that reward changes. Self-paced, instrumental reward-seeking actions are normally performed in a goal-directed manner, such that they are sensitive to changes in reward value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balleine and Dickinson, 1998</xref>). However, they can develop into inflexible stimulus-response habits with extended training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dickinson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dickinson et al., 1995</xref>). In contrast, it is not well understood how changes in reward value modulate attempts to retrieve rewards produced through instrumental reward-seeking behavior. For example, it has been suggested that rats’ tendency to approach the food cup after lever pressing may represent a discrete goal-directed action – one that is selected independently of the initial decision to press the lever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rescorla, 1964</xref>). Alternatively, rats may concatenate the press-approach sequence to form an <italic>action chunk</italic>, which can then be selected and deployed as a single unit of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lashley, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Graybiel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jin and Costa, 2015</xref>). Action chunks are thought to represent a special form of habit, or behavioral chain, in which each element of the chain automatically elicits the next response. This allows for efficient action sequencing but comes with a decrease in behavioral flexibility. Once an action chunk has been initiated, it should be automatically completed without further consideration of reward value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dezfouli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smith and Graybiel, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we applied a chemogenetic approach to investigate the role of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system in action sequence performance in rats. We used a combination of well-established behavioral assays and novel microstructural analyses to selectively probe the influence of reward-paired cues and expected reward value on the regulation of reward-seeking and -retrieval responses. We found that inhibiting dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or their inputs to the NAc, but not the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), reversibly disrupted cue-motivated reward seeking, but spared the tendency for reward-paired cues to trigger complete bouts of seeking and retrieval. These dopamine manipulations had no impact on rats’ tendency to adjust their reward-seeking behavior in response to reward devaluation. Importantly, attempts to retrieve reward were not suppressed by reward devaluation, suggesting that this behavior was the product of action chunking.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effects of response-contingent feedback about reward delivery on reward retrieval</title><p>We first characterized the relationship between reward-seeking and -retrieval responses when rewards are sparse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Rats were trained to lever press on a RI-60s schedule, such that this action was often nonreinforced and only occasionally earned food pellet delivery into a recessed food cup. Not surprisingly, we found that the probability of food-cup approach was elevated for several seconds after performance of the lever-press action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). This timeframe for press-contingent food-cup approach behavior is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicola, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marshall and Ostlund, 2018</xref>), and was relatively consistent across the current experiments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We therefore used a cutoff value of 2.5 s to identify reward-retrieval attempts. To control for reward-retrieval <italic>opportunities</italic>, which were contingent on lever pressing, our analysis focuses on a normalized measure – the proportion of lever presses that were followed by food-cup approach.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43551.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Microstructural organization of instrumental behavior.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hungry rats were trained to perform a self-paced ‘reward seeking’ task, in which pressing a lever was intermittently reinforced with food pellets (RI-60s schedule).

This was confirmed in subsequent tests, during which lever pressing produced either 1) pellet dispenser cues and actual pellet delivery (Food and Cues), 2) pellet dispenser cues only (Cues Only), or 3) no pellet dispenser cues or pellet delivery (No Food or Cues). Here too, we found that food-cup approaches were more likely after reinforced than nonreinforced lever presses, regardless of whether pellet dispenser cues were presented alone or together with actual food delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <italic>t</italic>s(8) ≥ 13.74, <italic><styled-content style="background-color: #ffffff;">p</styled-content></italic>s &lt;0.001; the overall frequency of lever pressing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and the frequency of complete bouts of presses that were followed by an approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) are presented for comparison). Although pellet dispenser cues were clearly an effective trigger for rats to shift from the lever to the food cup, they also made these shifts spontaneously, indicating that they had developed the tendency to perform the complete press-approach action sequence.

In contrast, CNO pretreatment significantly disrupted expression of CS+ induced lever pressing in the hM4Di group (Drug * CS Period * CS Type interaction, p&lt;0.001). hM4Di rats showed a CS+ specific elevation in lever pressing when pretreated with vehicle (CS Period * CS Type interaction, p&lt;0.001) but not CNO (CS Period * CS Type interaction, p=0.684).

We therefore conducted a more focused analysis of CS+ induced changes in lever-press performance (PIT score: CS+ - pre-CS+; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which confirmed that CNO significantly suppressed this behavioral effect in the hM4Di group (<italic>t</italic>(17) = −3.83, p&lt;0.001), but not in the mCherry group (<italic>t</italic>(13) = −1.21, p=0.249).

Interestingly, we found that the proportion of presses that were followed by a food-cup approach was actually <italic>greater</italic> for the devalued lever than for the valued lever (Lever effect, p=0.040). This effect was driven by the fact that lever presses that were not followed by approach were more strongly suppressed by reward devaluation than presses that were directly followed by an approach (Press Type * Lever interaction, p&lt;0.001; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1G</xref> for full generalized linear mixed-effects model output).</p><p>It was not possible to analyze the impact of reward devaluation on noncontingent approach responses performed at test because this behavior was associated with both the valued and devalued reward. However, other findings from our lab (data not shown) from studies involving a single reward-type indicate that noncontingent approaches are readily suppressed by reward devaluation, in contrast to response-contingent approaches. This is in line with previous reports that food-cup approach behavior is generally sensitive to reward devaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balleine, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thrailkill and Bouton, 2017</xref>), particularly if it is elicited by Pavlovian reward-predicted cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holland and Straub, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We investigated the role of mesocorticolimbic dopamine circuitry in regulating reward-seeking (lever pressing) and reward-retrieval responses (press-contingent food-cup approach). Consistent with a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marshall and Ostlund, 2018</xref>), we found that noncontingent CS+ presentations increased reward seeking, generally, but also increased the likelihood that rats would attempt to retrieve reward after performing such actions. These behaviors were differentially mediated by the mesolimbic dopamine system. Specifically, chemogenetic inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons or their inputs to NAc, but not mPFC, disrupted the excitatory influence of the CS+ on reward seeking, but spared that cue’s ability to increase attempts to retrieve reward. These behaviors were also differentially sensitive to reward devaluation, which suppressed reward seeking but actually increased the likelihood that rats would attempt to retrieve reward. VTA dopamine neurons inhibition did not impact the influence of reward devaluation on either component of behavior.</p><p>We found that attempts to retrieve reward by transitioning from the lever to the food cup were executed in a habitual manner, without consideration of reward value, consistent with action chunking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dezfouli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smith and Graybiel, 2016</xref>). However, task performance was not limited to these press-approach action chunks. When rats pressed the lever but were not reinforced (with food or cues), they would occasionally check the food cup but often omitted this response. This sporadic pattern of reward retrieval is adaptive given that strict press-approach action sequencing is unnecessary under such conditions, when rewards are sparse and uncertain. Instead, rats seemed to vacillate between two different strategies when initiating the lever-press response, performing it as part of a complete action chunk (press-approach) or as a discrete action (press only). These distinct patterns of reward seeking appeared to be differentially sensitive to reward devaluation. While rats were generally less likely to lever press for the devalued reward than for the valued reward, press-approach action chunks tended to be less sensitive to reward devaluation than presses that were not followed by approach. Because of this differential sensitivity to reward devaluation, the <italic>proportion</italic> of all lever presses followed by an attempt to retrieve reward was actually <italic>greater</italic> for devalued action than for the valued action. Such findings supports the connection between action chunking and habitual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Graybiel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dezfouli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smith and Graybiel, 2016</xref>), and suggest that moment-to-moment control over self-paced, reward-seeking behavior may shift back and forth between habit and goal-directed systems.</p><p>PIT testing revealed that the CS+ generally increased lever pressing, but disproportionately increased the performance of press-approach action chunks, at least relative to their otherwise low frequency of occurring in the absence of the CS+. This finding further bolsters the connection between action chunking and habitual control given previous reports that habitual reward-seeking actions are particularly sensitive to the motivational effects of reward-paired cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holland, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wiltgen et al., 2012</xref>). However, while press-approach action chunks were elevated during the CS+, they still accounted for only a minority (between 30% and 50%) of lever presses that were performed during these trials. Most lever presses evoked by the CS+ were <italic>not</italic> followed by a food-cup approach, and it was this component of the PIT effect that was selectively disrupted by chemogenetic inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons or their inputs to NAc. The ability of the CS+ to promote press-approach chunks was, in contrast, completely spared by these manipulations. Consistent with this, we found that the response-suppressive effect of NAc dopamine terminal inhibition varied across rats based on the way they normally responded to the CS+. Rats that responded to that cue with a large increase in discrete lever presses (i.e., <italic>without</italic> subsequent food-cup approach) showed the greatest suppression. We suggest that this may reflect differences across rats in their sensitivity to the dopamine-dependent motivational effects of reward-paired cues.</p><p>Previous studies have found that dopamine receptor antagonists either selectively suppress lever pressing without affecting concomitant food-cup approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nelson and Killcross, 2013</xref>), or suppress both types behavior to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wassum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ostlund et al., 2012</xref>). Even this latter finding is consistent with dopamine contributing more to reward seeking than reward retrieval, since a reduction in reward seeking creates fewer opportunities to retrieve reward. Interpreting these findings is problematic, however, because such studies typically have not applied microstructural analyses, like those used here, to distinguish between press-contingent and noncontingent food-cup approaches. One exception is a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicola (2010)</xref> showing that blocking dopamine receptors in the NAc attenuates cue-triggered lever pressing without impacting the latency of subsequent food-cup approach behavior. Building on such findings, the current study used the PIT paradigm to show that the mesolimbic dopamine system specifically mediates the motivational influence of reward-paired cues on reward seeking but not their dissociable ability to increase the likelihood that such actions will be followed by an attempt to retrieve reward.</p><p>Our previous studies monitoring mesolimbic dopamine release during PIT performance are also interesting to consider together with the current findings. For instance, we found that CS+ evoked phasic dopamine release in the NAc correlates with that cue’s effect on lever pressing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wassum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ostlund et al., 2014</xref>) but not food-cup approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitken et al., 2016</xref>). We also found that individual CS+ evoked lever presses are temporally correlated with transient bouts of phasic dopamine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ostlund et al., 2014</xref>). The current findings suggest that this relationship between NAc dopamine release and cue-motivated reward seeking may be stronger for discrete presses that are performed without a subsequent food-cup approach than for complete press-approach chunks. This question remains to be investigated, and would help resolve whether the mesolimbic dopamine system is involved in modulating reward seeking, generally, or whether its activity becomes uncoupled from the execution of action chunks, which may become differentially associated with nigrostriatal dopamine system activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jin and Costa, 2010</xref>).</p><p>While dopamine is known to play a crucial role in forming new action chunks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Graybiel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jin and Costa, 2015</xref>), its role in the expression of previously learned action chunks is less clear. Our findings indicate that VTA dopamine circuitry does not play a necessary role in the execution of press-approach action chunks, regardless of whether they are self-initiated or are prompted by a reward-paired cue. This is generally compatible with previous findings. For instance, dopamine receptor blockade suppresses action sequence performance early but not late in training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Levesque et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wassum et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, the phasic NAc dopamine release that normally precedes action sequence performance tends to become attenuated as rats acquire efficient task performance, presumably through action chunking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cacciapaglia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wassum et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klanker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 2016</xref>). That said, the mesolimbic dopamine system continues to contribute to action sequence tasks that require considerable effort, such as the execution of a long series of lever presses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fischbach-Weiss et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Inhibiting VTA dopamine neurons did not impact rats’ sensitivity to reward devaluation, which is consistent with other findings in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dickinson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lex and Hauber, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lex and Hauber, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wassum et al., 2011</xref>). Such findings are interesting given that regions innervated by this dopamine system, including the NAc and mPFC, are known to make important contributions to goal-directed decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradfield and Balleine, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sharpe et al., 2019</xref>). Of course, dopamine likely contributes to goal-directed decision making in more demanding tasks that require greater cognitive resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Floresco, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cools, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Westbrook and Braver, 2016</xref>).</p><p>It is also notable that inhibiting mPFC dopamine terminals had no detectable effects on expression of PIT, since food-paired cues are known to elicit dopamine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassareo and Di Chiara, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feenstra et al., 1999</xref>) and neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Homayoun and Moghaddam, 2009</xref>) in the mPFC. It is possible that the dissociable effects of NAc versus mPFC dopamine terminal inhibition reported here may relate to inherent differences between the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine systems, which include regional differences in release kinetics and in the density of dopamine terminals or receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lammel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weele et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mahler et al., 2019</xref>). However, previous lesion studies suggest that the mPFC may not be an essential component of the circuitry that mediates PIT performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cardinal et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corbit and Balleine, 2003</xref>), which is more in line with the current results.</p><p>Our findings may also have implications for understanding the role of dopamine in pathologies of behavioral control such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In the signal attenuation model of OCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joel and Avisar, 2001</xref>), rats learn that response-contingent cues no longer signal that an instrumental reward-seeking action will produce reward. In this case, the logical organization of reward-seeking and -retrieval actions disintegrates, such that rats exhibit persistent reward seeking, typically without attempting to collect reward from the food cup. It was previously reported that blocking D1-dopamine receptors disrupts expression of these incomplete bouts of compulsive-like reward seeking, without affecting the production of complete bouts of reward seeking and retrieval, which continue to be performed on some test trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joel and Doljansky, 2003</xref>). Considered in this light, our findings suggest that the mesolimbic dopamine system may mediate the tendency for reward-paired cues to promote this potentially compulsive component of cue-motivated reward seeking. This link deserves further research, and may facilitate research to advance understanding and treatment of compulsive disorders like OCD and addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Joel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>In total, 89 male and female Long-Evans Tyrosine hydroxylase (Th):Cre+ rats (hemizygous Cre+) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Witten et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mahler et al., 2019</xref>) and wildtype (WT) littermates were used for this study.

The source of significant interactions was determined by secondary mixed-effects models identical to those described above but split by the relevant factor of interest. For analyses in which a significant main effect had more than two levels, post-hoc tests of main effects employed MATLAB’s <italic>coefTest</italic> function, and interactions were reported in-text as the results of ANOVA <italic>F</italic>-tests (i.e., whether the coefficients for each fixed effect were significantly different from 0).</p><p>When analyzing data from PIT experiments, the ability of the CS+ to selectively increase performance of a response (relative to the CS-) over baseline (pre-CS) levels was indicated by a significant CS Type * CS Period interaction. We were particularly interested in treatment-induced alterations in the expression of this effect, as indicated by significant 3-way and 4-way interactions involving this CS Type * CS Period term, in combination with Drug and/or Group factors. We were also interested in potential main effects of Drug and/or Group factors, reflecting broad, cue-independent behavioral effects. While statistical output tables include a summary of all fixed effects included in the model, only these theoretically interesting findings are discussed in the main text. Lower level interactions involving only CS Type <italic>or</italic> CS Period, but not their combination, are provided in the output tables but are not discussed in the main text given that they may be the product of incidental or spurious behavioral differences across cue conditions.</p><p>PIT Scores (CS+ – pre-CS+) were calculated for more focused analysis of CS+ elicited lever pressing. One-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to assess the effect of CNO for each group. Because inhibiting VTA dopamine neurons or their NAc terminals predominantly disrupted the ability of the CS+ to elicit lever presses that were not followed by an approach response, we also assessed if differences across rats in their tendency to exhibit such behavior in the Vehicle Test (PIT score; presses without approach) correlated with differences in their sensitivity to the response-suppressive effect of CNO on CS+ elicited lever pressing (CNO – Vehicle; PIT score, all presses).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge the assistance of Christy N Munson in the acquisition of behavioral data.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: All experimental procedures that involved rats were approved by the UC Irvine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol AUP-17-68) and were in accordance with the National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43551.020</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Generalized linear mixed-effects model outputs.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-43551-supp1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43551.021</object-id><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-43551-transrepform-v2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated and analyzed during this study are included in supporting files.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Stan Floresco (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, at least in its current form.</p><p>Halbout and colleagues performed a series of experiments to determine the role of VTA dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in reward-seeking behaviors in a Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT) task. Specifically, the authors sought to separate whether dopamine regulates reward expectancy or motivation (response vigor). The authors show that chemogenetic inhibition of dopamine neurons impaired CS-induced lever pressing but not entry into the reward port (reward retrieval) induced directly by the sensory stimuli associated with food delivery. Based on the idea that the reward retrieval is caused by reward expectancy whereas CS-induced lever pressing is due to motivation, the authors conclude that VTA dopamine neurons regulate motivation (response vigor) but not reward expectancy.</p><p>All the reviewers thought that this study addresses an important question: identifying the exact role that this population of dopamine neurons plays in reward-seeking behavior. They agreed that this study uses very careful behavioral observations and a nice combination of behavioral paradigms, and obtained important data. However, the overall assessment of the study somewhat varied among the reviewers, as you can see below. After discussion, we thought that the definitions of some terms such as 'reward expectancy' are not very clear. 'Reward expectancy' is rather a broad term and has been used differently in different fields. It is not obvious whether 'motivation' and 'reward expectancy' are completely separated, in the first place. Also, reward expectancy may, in some literature, imply a narrower definition corresponding to that required for goal-directed behaviors. Overall, the definition of reward expectancy based on reward retrieval behavior is not very convincing (please see the comment by reviewer 1 and 2) and some of the results (devaluation experiments) appear to contradict the idea of 'reward expectancy'. Furthermore, as reviewer 1 pointed out, there appear to be alternative explanations of the data. In total, we thought that these terminologies and the interpretation of the results require significant revisions for clarify and consistency. Please also note that <italic>eLife</italic> is a general bio logy journal, and writing has to be understandable to readers outside a subfield. Additionally, the reviewers were concerned by the relatively small effects. Specifically, in some experiments (Experiment 2 [Figure 3B] and Experiment 3 [Figure 4B and Figure 4—figure supplement 2]), it appears that CNO alone had a strong effect on behavior and the results using a summary statistics ('CNO suppression') are not very convincing.</p><p>Given the above concerns, we cannot proceed with the current manuscript. Due to the potential importance of the data, however, we would like to suggest the authors to submit a revision plan if the authors think that they can address the major concerns raised by the reviewers. The revision plan should respond to the reviewers' main criticisms and describe specifically how the paper would be changed to address them, including whether new experiments would be performed. We would like to use the revision plan to make a final decision as to whether a revision is a viable approach for this manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Halbout et al. use fine-grained analysis of behavior in a Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT) task to assay whether VTA dopamine neurons facilitate the general PIT effect via increasing reward expectancy (as opposed to enhancing cue-triggered motivation). This is an important question, as answering it would help to further define dopamine function. The authors' strategy is to use the probability of reward port entry after an operant response as an index of reward expectancy. This measure is not reduced by chemogenetic inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons even though this manipulation effectively reduces the main PIT effect of enhanced operant responding during presentation of Pavlovian cues. The authors conclude that dopamine does not enhance PIT via promoting reward expectancy. Instead, dopamine enhances PIT via its contribution to cue-triggered motivation, and an additional non-dopamine-dependent component of PIT is the result of enhanced reward expectancy due CS+ presentation.</p><p>Although for the most part the results are convincing from the technical perspective, the interpretation completely depends on the authors' claim that port entries occurring shortly after an operant response are an index of reward expectancy. The authors support this claim by showing, in an instrumental task identical to the one used in the PIT experiments, that cues presented after the operant response that signal reward delivery (pellet drop) increase the probability of a port entry. However, this unsurprising result is entirely consistent with an alternative interpretation that the authors have apparently not considered. That is that port entry is simply the next step after the lever response in a chunked skilled action sequence. Such sequences are most likely a form of stimulus-response habit in which the stimulus is the previous action. In addition, because pellet drop occurs after the lever press and predicts reward, it could also participate in S-R habit learning. In this scenario, a lever press followed by pellet drop would simply activate the response (port entry) more strongly than either stimulus alone. Supporting this interpretation, the authors show that port entry after lever pressing is strongly resistant to outcome devaluation – a hallmark of S-R habits. It is therefore perplexing that the authors use this behavior as an index of reward expectancy – a component of goal-directed and cognitive forms of behavior, which should be sensitive to devaluation precisely because the value of the expected reward is reduced.</p><p>The authors go on to show that during the PIT test, not only does the CS+ increase the probability of the operant response relative to control periods (e.g., CS-), but it also increases the probability that any individual operant response will be followed by a port entry. They further show that chemogenetic inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons or terminals in the accumbens during the PIT test reduces the CS-induced increase in operant responding while leaving intact the probability of port entry after an operant response. The authors conclude that although a CS-triggered increase in reward expectancy drives a component of the PIT effect (those operant responses followed by port entry), an additional component is not driven by expectancy (operant responses not followed by port entry), and dopamine contributes to PIT via the latter mechanism, likely via enhancing cue-triggered motivation.</p><p>To accept this interpretation, one must accept the assertion that operant-entry sequences are the result of reward expectancy to a greater extent than operant responses occurring without a subsequent entry. As described above, this claim is suspect. It is certainly interesting that inhibition of dopamine neurons has a greater effect on single operants than operant-entry sequences, but there are alternative explanations. For instance, the authors' devaluation experiment suggests that operant actions that are not followed by port entry are sensitive to devaluation and are therefore likely controlled by action-outcome goal-directed associations. In contrast, the post-devaluation increase in frequency of operant-entry sequences suggests that operant-entry behavior is at least partially controlled by stimulus-response habit associations. In this scenario, dopamine facilitates the influence of a Pavlovian CS+ on goal-directed behavior but not habit behavior. Under the assumption that reward expectancy is more important for goal-directed than habit behaviors, this is roughly the opposite of the authors' conclusion. What the authors may have found is something perhaps even more intriguing: that CSs in the PIT test can influence habit-based behaviors at least as strongly as goal-directed behaviors. Of course, one might expect the neural mechanism of such effects to be different (as an interaction between Pavlovian and action value representations is possible only with goal-directed behaviors), and it is therefore informative that dopamine contributes only to facilitation of goal-directed behaviors.</p><p>In summary, the authors have found something intriguing in the resistance of operant response-port entry sequences to inhibition of dopamine neurons and dopamine terminals in the accumbens. However, their interpretation is not adequately supported by their data, some of which in fact contradict their conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This article by Halbout and colleagues describe a series of experiments aimed at clarifying the contribution of the dopaminergic innervation of the ventral striatum in the interaction between Pavlovian and instrumental responses in an appetitive context. The study is well designed and this question should be relevant for neuroscientists interested in the neural basis of decision-making and motivation.</p><p>I have, however, a series of issues with the manuscript:</p><p>The terminology is very confusing, and the theoretical frame is globally difficult to grasp. There are many concepts that are used to capture very simple behaviors, even in the Results section (reward seeking, exploration, reward expectancy, motivation, vigor etc.). Could the authors make a set of simple predictions based on a simple theoretical frame and describe how they decide to operationalize the questions? There are places in the text when it is the case, but I'm afraid that there is a drift in the issues at stake between the Abstract and the Discussion.</p><p>The description of the methods is too superficial. It might be sufficient for specialists in the field (conditioning in rats) and/or people who know the work of this team, but not for a more general audience. Typically, including the contingencies and the timing of the reward schedules in the different tasks would help.</p><p>I am having some trouble reconciling the conclusions of the authors and the data, as shown by the figure:</p><p>Experiment 1: Again, the text is difficult to read but it seems to me that there are two things going on here: the operant behavior of these animals in the task is very 'habitual' (as opposed to goal-directed), since the rate of lever pressing decreases very little when reward is omitted (Figure 1D). In line with that, presumably, animals almost only try to collect the reward when they get a direct evidence (cue) that it has been delivered. So reward does not drive action and actions do not predict reward, and animals are left with Pavlovian processes to anticipate the reward. Is there more to it than that? If yes, it would require precise quantitative predictions and measures to demonstrate it. I would avoid the word 'exploration', unless the authors can demonstrate that animals try to get the reward by exploring another potential way to get the reward (e.g. another lever). Here, action seems to be driven much more by compulsion/ habits than exploration.</p><p>Experiments 2 and 3:</p><p>Looking at Figure 3B (Experiment 2) and Figure 4B and Figure 4—figure supplement 2 (Experiment 3), CNO alone has a strong effect on behavior and the difference between mCherry and hM4Di animals is really small. Not even sure it is significant, on the scale of the experiment. For example, in Experiment 2, Figure 3D shows a greater effect of CNO on response to CS- than CS+. Again, when looking at all the bars, I don't understand the conclusions.</p><p>In Experiment 2, to test the prediction regarding the role of DA in PIT, they should test the interaction between 3 factors (CNO vs. Vehicle; mCherry vs. hM4Di and pre vs. post CS+). By the way, why using the pre/post CS+ when there is a CS- condition, which seems a priori as a better reference for assessing the specificity of the Pavlovian effects of the CS+, as opposed to general effect of having a stimulus? Looking at the data, CNO abolishes the increase in responding evoked by the CS+, and the major difference between mCherry and hM4Di is in the pre CS+ period… If the authors really want to take into trial to trial variability, they could use a relative measure (pre vs. post, on a trial by trial basis) but compare the effect of CS+ with the effect of CS- to assess PIT, and the influence of the various manipulations.</p><p>It is essentially the same thing for experiment 3: the effect of CNO (here in the NAc) vs. vehicle is much bigger than the difference between mCherry and hM4Di. Ok, injecting CNO in the MFC has no effect, but this is potentially because the concentration of DA receptor (targeted by the CNO…) is smaller there than in the ACC. Separate issue, but as I mentioned above, describing what is essentially compulsive/habitual lever pressing as 'exploratory seeking' does not help.</p><p>Given these, I am not sure that any of the conclusions regarding the role of DA really stands. Again, the experimental design as a whole is excellent, I believe, and the results are interesting in terms of clarifying the neural and behavioral processes at stake in PIT, but ample revision are needed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is a very interesting and cleverly-designed study that parses our how mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) transmission may be involved in the ability of Pavlovian cues to invigorate reward seeking, using a well-established Pavlovian-to-Instrumental transfer test. Using DREADD approaches to silence dopamine cell bodies they show that suppressing DA activity blocks or attenuates the PIT effect. Moreover, this appeared to be mediated primarily by DA activity in the accumbens, but not prefrontal cortex. What was particularly important about these findings is that the authors conducted a sophisticated microstructural analysis of behavior, focusing on how often rats may approach the food cup (as a measure of reward expectancy). This analysis showed that, even though reducing DA activity suppressed the increase in lever pressing induced by Pavlovian, reward-associated cues, it did not affect approaches to the food cup, suggesting that DA's role in this context is to enhance motivation, but not reward expectancy. They also showed that reducing DA activity did not influence how reinforcer devaluation altered responding.</p><p>This is a well-designed study that has important implications for teasing out what DA does (and does not do) in modulating reward seeking. The analyses are sound, and the Discussion is fair and scholarly. I have no major issues with the paper, but a few relatively minor points the authors should attend to.</p><p>1) Subsection “Pavlovian conditioning”, was a 10 Hz tone used? Or 10 kHz (I'm not sure rats can hear 10 Hz).</p><p>2) &quot;After a session of Pavlovian conditioning, rats were given a 30-min extinction session&quot; – based on the preceding section, it's unclear what happened.

In rats trained to perform an instrumental task, reward devaluation reduced operant performance in an extinction test, but left operant response-port entry sequences relatively unaffected, indicating that performance of operant-entry sequences is most likely a stimulus-response habit. These results make the subtle but important point that even though cues that motivate reward seeking increase the number of action sequences performed via a mesolimbic dopamine-dependent mechanism, the performance of the sequence once it is initiated is independent of mesolimbic dopamine. This point is in line with previous work from the authors and others, and its support with microstructural behavioral analysis provides a careful and useful addition to the field.</p><p>This version of the paper includes additional control experiments, and the authors' new interpretations are much better supported by their data than previously. However, the authors should address a few additional points.</p><p>1) The authors present evidence that the chunked operant-entry action sequence is resistant to devaluation. However, it is possible that port entry behavior is simply resistant to devaluation whether or not the entry follows an operant response. The authors show that animals make &quot;noncontingent food cup approaches&quot; (i.e., port entries), but do not analyze the rate of this behavior in any of their tasks. The argument that operant responses are resistant to devaluation because they are part of a chunked, habit action sequence would be strengthened if entries that are NOT part of such sequences were not resistant to devaluation.</p><p>2) It would also be interesting to know whether noncontingent entries in the PIT test are dependent on dopamine/mesolimbic dopamine.</p><p>3) Systemic CNO had a greater effect on PIT than intra-accumbens CNO. The authors should discuss the possible reasons for this.</p><p>4) Figure 4F and the similar supplementary figure are hard to understand. First, the X axis should be more descriptive (i.e., refer to CS-induced increase in lever presses without approach). Second, the Y axis reads &quot;CNO suppression&quot;, but apparently greater suppression is represented by more negative numbers. This is counterintuitive. I think the authors are trying to say that the impact of CNO positively correlates with the impact of the CS on lever presses without approach, but they write that there is a negative correlation. The figure legend adds to the confusion by saying that the Y axis is &quot;PIT Score for vehicle test – PIT Score for CNO test&quot;. If that's the case, then the lower PIT scores in CNO should result in positive values, not the predominantly negative values shown in the figure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors seriously improved the manuscript and they addressed my previous remarks.

The authors support this claim by showing, in an instrumental task identical to the one used in the PIT experiments, that cues presented after the operant response that signal reward delivery (pellet drop) increase the probability of a port entry. However, this unsurprising result is entirely consistent with an alternative interpretation that the authors have apparently not considered. That is that port entry is simply the next step after the lever response in a chunked skilled action sequence. Such sequences are most likely a form of stimulus-response habit in which the stimulus is the previous action. In addition, because pellet drop occurs after the lever press and predicts reward, it could also participate in S-R habit learning. In this scenario, a lever press followed by pellet drop would simply activate the response (port entry) more strongly than either stimulus alone. Supporting this interpretation, the authors show that port entry after lever pressing is strongly resistant to outcome devaluation – a hallmark of S-R habits. It is therefore perplexing that the authors use this behavior as an index of reward expectancy – a component of goal-directed and cognitive forms of behavior, which should be sensitive to devaluation precisely because the value of the expected reward is reduced.</p><p>The authors go on to show that during the PIT test, not only does the CS+ increase the probability of the operant response relative to control periods (e.g., CS-), but it also increases the probability that any individual operant response will be followed by a port entry. They further show that chemogenetic inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons or terminals in the accumbens during the PIT test reduces the CS-induced increase in operant responding while leaving intact the probability of port entry after an operant response. The authors conclude that although a CS-triggered increase in reward expectancy drives a component of the PIT effect (those operant responses followed by port entry), an additional component is not driven by expectancy (operant responses not followed by port entry), and dopamine contributes to PIT via the latter mechanism, likely via enhancing cue-triggered motivation.</p><p>To accept this interpretation, one must accept the assertion that operant-entry sequences are the result of reward expectancy to a greater extent than operant responses occurring without a subsequent entry. As described above, this claim is suspect. It is certainly interesting that inhibition of dopamine neurons has a greater effect on single operants than operant-entry sequences, but there are alternative explanations. For instance, the authors' devaluation experiment suggests that operant actions that are not followed by port entry are sensitive to devaluation and are therefore likely controlled by action-outcome goal-directed associations. In contrast, the post-devaluation increase in frequency of operant-entry sequences suggests that operant-entry behavior is at least partially controlled by stimulus-response habit associations. In this scenario, dopamine facilitates the influence of a Pavlovian CS+ on goal-directed behavior but not habit behavior. Under the assumption that reward expectancy is more important for goal-directed than habit behaviors, this is roughly the opposite of the authors' conclusion. What the authors may have found is something perhaps even more intriguing: that CSs in the PIT test can influence habit-based behaviors at least as strongly as goal-directed behaviors. Of course, one might expect the neural mechanism of such effects to be different (as an interaction between Pavlovian and action value representations is possible only with goal-directed behaviors), and it is therefore informative that dopamine contributes only to facilitation of goal-directed behaviors.</p><p>In summary, the authors have found something intriguing in the resistance of operant response-port entry sequences to inhibition of dopamine neurons and dopamine terminals in the accumbens. However, their interpretation is not adequately supported by their data, some of which in fact contradict their conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our original focus on <italic>reward expectancy</italic> was confusing. This was partly due to our unconventional use of that term, which we did not intend to be synonymous with <italic>goal-directed control</italic> given evidence that reward expectancies can guide action selection in a manner that is independent of reward value during PIT performance (Colwill and Rescorla, 1990; Rescorla, 1994; Holland, 2004). But we now believe this framework for data interpretation was unclear and unnecessary. We have therefore omitted the term reward expectancy altogether, and have substantially revised the manuscript to focus on the broader topic of how dopamine contributes to the control of instrumental reward-seeking and reward-retrieval actions, while explicitly contrasting goal-directed (devaluation-sensitive) and habitual (devaluation-insensitive) accounts of behavior. From this perspective, we agree with the reviewer’s conclusion that press-contingent food-cup approaches were performed habitually, suggesting the use of a press-approach behavioral chain or action chunk. This interpretation is also compatible with our finding that reward-paired cues strongly increase production of press-approach chunks, given previous studies showing that habitual behavior is particularly sensitive to the motivational influence of such cues (Holland, 2004; Wiltgen et al., 2012).</p><p>As the reviewer notes, presses that were not followed by food-cup approach were particularly sensitive to reward devaluation. We have elaborated on our discussion of this issue (subsection “Inhibiting dopamine neurons spares the sensitivity of reward-seeking actions to reward devaluation”, last paragraph; Discussion, second paragraph, documents with colored text) and added a new analysis to help develop this finding (Figure 5D; Supplementary file 1G). However, we do not believe this is a defining feature of such actions. For instance, the variable-interval training protocol used in our PIT experiments is known to support habit formation. Thus, even discrete lever presses (without approach) performed during PIT tests were likely to have been insensitive to devaluation, had this been assessed. We suggest that such discrete lever presses are not exclusively aligned with either habitual or goal-directed control. Indeed, others have argued that repetitive lever pressing without subsequent food-cup approach may model OCD-like <italic>compulsive checking</italic> behavior, which we discuss in the last paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] I have a series of issues with the manuscript:</p><p>The terminology is very confusing, and the theoretical frame is globally difficult to grasp. There are many concepts that are used to capture very simple behaviors, even in the Results section (reward seeking, exploration, reward expectancy, motivation, vigor etc.). Could the authors make a set of simple predictions based on a simple theoretical frame and describe how they decide to operationalize the questions? There are places in the text when it is the case, but I'm afraid that there is a drift in the issues at stake between the Abstract and the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that our original framework was confusing. As noted in our comments to reviewer #1, we have thoroughly revised the manuscript to correct this problem. Also, as noted above, we have adopted unambiguous terms for behavior in the Results section and figures, and have operationalized more complex or ambiguous terms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The description of the methods is too superficial. It might be sufficient for specialists in the field (conditioning in rats) and/or people who know the work of this team, but not for a more general audience. Typically, including the contingencies and the timing of the reward schedules in the different tasks would help.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any omissions and have added to this part of the Materials and methods section to make sure that these and other important details are specified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am having some trouble reconciling the conclusions of the authors and the data, as shown by the figure:</p><p>Experiment 1: Again, the text is difficult to read but it seems to me that there are two things going on here: the operant behavior of these animals in the task is very 'habitual' (as opposed to goal-directed), since the rate of lever pressing decreases very little when reward is omitted (Figure 1D). In line with that, presumably, animals almost only try to collect the reward when they get a direct evidence (cue) that it has been delivered. So reward does not drive action and actions do not predict reward, and animals are left with Pavlovian processes to anticipate the reward. Is there more to it than that? If yes, it would require precise quantitative predictions and measures to demonstrate it. I would avoid the word 'exploration', unless the authors can demonstrate that animals try to get the reward by exploring another potential way to get the reward (e.g. another lever). Here, action seems to be driven much more by compulsion/ habits than exploration.</p></disp-quote><p>We generally agree with and have adopted this habit-based interpretation, as noted in our comments to reviewer #1. We have also avoided using exploration, exploratory reward seeking, and other ambiguous terms, as noted above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Experiments 2 and 3:</p><p>Looking at Figure 3B (Experiment 2) and Figure 4B and Figure 4—figure supplement 2 (Experiment 3), CNO alone has a strong effect on behavior and the difference between mCherry and hM4Di animals is really small. Not even sure it is significant, on the scale of the experiment. For example, in Experiment 2, Figure 3D shows a greater effect of CNO on response to CS- than CS+. Again, when looking at all the bars, I don't understand the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewers #2 and #3 both noted that systemic CNO may have had a nonspecific (hM4Di-independent) effect on lever pressing and that this should be acknowledged in the text. Consistent with this observation, our analysis of Total Lever Presses in Experiment 2 (Figure 3B) found a significant Drug x CS Period x CS Type interaction (<italic>p</italic> = 0.007), indicating that CNO partially suppressed lever pressing in a manner that was not necessarily limited to the hM4Di group. While this and related findings were indicated in the statistical output table for this analysis (Supplementary file 1A), we had not given it appropriate attention in the main text. We have edited the manuscript to acknowledge this potential nonspecific CNO effect (subsection “Inhibiting dopamine neurons during Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer preferentially disrupts cue-motivated reward seeking, but not reward retrieval”, third paragraph). However, we also emphasize that this partial, nonspecific suppression of lever pressing does not account for the hM4Di-<italic>dependent</italic> effects of CNO that support our main conclusions. As noted in the Results section (see the aforementioned paragraph), we found a significant Group x Drug x CS period x CS type interaction (<italic>p</italic> =.002), indicating that the effects of CNO on PIT performance was more disruptive for the hM4Di group than for the mCherry group. Further analysis of data from the hM4Di group (excluding mCherry data) revealed a significant Drug x CS period x CS type interaction (p &lt;.001). This group showed a CS+ specific increase in pressing during the vehicle test (CS period x CS type interaction, p &lt;.001), but showed no such effect when tested on CNO (CS period x CS type interaction, p =.684). In contrast, analysis of data from the mCherry group (excluding hM4Di data) found a CS+ specific increase in lever pressing (CS Period x CS Type interaction, p &lt;.001) that was not significantly altered by CNO (Drug x CS Period x CS Type interaction, p =.780). This null effect in the mCherry group is in line with a recently published study led by Dr. Kate Wassum (coauthor) that systemic CNO treatment does not significantly disrupt expression of the PIT effect in DREADD-free rats (Collins et al., 2019), which is cited in the current manuscript. It is also important to note that the same systemic CNO treatment did not significantly affect lever-press performance in Experiment 4 (Figure 5B). Based on these results and others noted below, we believe our original conclusions are strongly supported by the data, though we agree that they should be discussed in the context of potential nonspecific CNO effects.</p><p>We have also added an acknowledgement of the potential for CNO microinfusions to produce a partial nonspecific suppression in lever pressing in the mCherry rats used in Experiment 3B (subsection “Surgery”; Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Importantly, this effect did not reach significance (Drug * Site * CS Period * CS Type interaction, <italic>p</italic> =.068) and was driven by intra-mPFC (not NAc) CNO injections. Moreover, further analysis revealed that CNO did not significantly disrupt the CS+ induced increase in lever pressing (PIT score) in either group (<italic>p</italic>’s &gt;.165). These findings indicate that the disruption of PIT detected in Experiment 3A (Figure 4C and 4D) following intra-NAc CNO injections in rats expressing hM4Di in VTA dopamine neurons resulted from local dopamine terminal inhibition and not a nonspecific action of that drug.</p><p>As detailed below, we believe that reviewer #2’s separate concern about effect sizes stems partly from variability in lever press rates across groups, drug conditions, and CS periods, which tended to obscure the effect of chemogenetic dopamine neuron inhibition on the increase in lever pressing that is specifically attributable to noncontingent CS+ presentation. In the next comment section, we develop the rationale behind our analysis of CS+ elicited behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Experiment 2, to test the prediction regarding the role of DA in PIT, they should test the interaction between 3 factors (CNO vs. Vehicle; mCherry vs. hM4Di and pre vs. post CS+). By the way, why using the pre/post CS+ when there is a CS- condition, which seems a priori as a better reference for assessing the specificity of the Pavlovian effects of the CS+, as opposed to general effect of having a stimulus? Looking at the data, CNO abolishes the increase in responding evoked by the CS+, and the major difference between mCherry and hM4Di is in the pre CS+ period… If the authors really want to take into trial to trial variability, they could use a relative measure (pre vs. post, on a trial by trial basis) but compare the effect of CS+ with the effect of CS- to assess PIT, and the influence of the various manipulations.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, we have included a description of the significant Drug (CNO vs. Vehicle) x Group (mCherry vs. hM4Di) x CS period (pre vs. CS) interaction for CS+ trials (i.e., omitting CS- trials) (<italic>t</italic>(120) = -2.53, <italic>p</italic> =.013) in the Results section (subsection “Inhibiting dopamine neurons during Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer preferentially disrupts cue-motivated reward seeking, but not reward retrieval”, third paragraph), which further supports the conclusion that inhibiting VTA dopamine neurons suppressed the ability of the CS+ to stimulate lever pressing.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the CS- is an essential control for evaluating the behavioral effects of the CS+ that specifically depend on that cue’s relationship with reward. However, it is not sufficient to simply contrast levels of responding during CS+ and CS- presentations without controlling for local baseline rates of responding during pre-CS periods. This is particularly important in PIT studies because lever press rates fluctuate sporadically due to the lack of reinforcement at test. For this reason, virtually all PIT studies control for pre-CS response levels (Holmes et al., 2010; Cartoni et al., 2016). It is for this reason that our primary analysis of PIT data always incorporates both CS Type (CS+ vs. CS-) and CS Period (pre-CS vs. CS) as factors, in addition to Drug (CNO vs. Veh) and Group (e.g., AAV group for Experiment 2 or injection site for Experiments 3A and 3B). When interpreting the results of these complex analyses, our main focus is on interactions involving <italic>both CS Type and CS Period</italic>, which reflects the ability for the CS+ but not the CS- to selectively increase responding relative to their cue-specific baseline levels. Main effects of Drug and Group are also of interest, as they represent general (cue-independent) behavioral effects. However, lower level interactions involving <italic>only CS Period or CS Type</italic> are harder to interpret because they are likely driven – to some degree – by incidental or nonspecific differences in pre-CS response rates, effects which are either uninteresting (random) or are better captured by the main effects of Drug or Group. Therefore, while the supplementary tables outline the full output of our main analyses (Supplementary file 1A-G), our discussion of results within the main text focuses on the results of most interest (i.e., main effects of Drug, Group, the Drug * Group interaction, or any interactions involving <italic>both</italic> CS Period and CS Type). We have modified the “Statistical Analysis” subsection of the Materials and methods to make this aspect of our data interpretation explicit to readers (third paragraph).</p><p>Incidental and/or nonspecific differences in pre-CS response rates can also make it difficult for readers to identify the source of the complex interactions expressed in raw data (total presses) in Figures 3B and 4B (each has 16 bars, including pre-CS periods). Therefore, we now include an analysis of <italic><underline>PIT scores</underline></italic> isolating CS+ induced changes in pressing (CS+ – pre-CS+; see Figures 3C, 4D, and Figure 4—figure supplement-2). This is a widely-used measure of the PIT effect (Pecina et al., 2006; El-Amamy and Holland, 2007; Bertran-Gonzalez et al., 2013; Laurent et al., 2016; Laurent et al., 2017; Alarcon et al., 2018; Panayi and Killcross, 2018) and facilitates data interpretation for general readers. This secondary analysis is also useful for confirming the source of potential drug effects on CS+ elicited behavior. We have used this analysis in place of the admittedly confusing and less compelling CNO suppression analysis that had been used in the original manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is essentially the same thing for Experiment 3: the effect of CNO (here in the NAc) vs. vehicle is much bigger than the difference between mCherry and hM4Di. Ok, injecting CNO in the MFC has no effect, but this is potentially because the concentration of DA receptor (targeted by the CNO…) is smaller there than in the ACC.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment also raises another important point about our experimental design and statistical analysis, which depends heavily on within-subject comparisons (e.g., CS type, CS period, Drug). Not only is it crucial to consider baseline (pre-CS) response rates, as discussed above, it is essential to take into account unintended, presumably incidental, between-subject differences in PIT performance when evaluating the effect of CNO. For instance, in the Vehicle test of Experiment 2, rats in the hM4Di group showed a slightly stronger CS+ induced increase in lever pressing, relative to the mCherry group. These between-subject differences in off-drug PIT performance should be controlled for when assessing within-subject effects of CNO (Figure 3B). Similarly, for Experiment 3B (Figure 4—figure supplement 2), rats in the mCherry NAc group happened to show a relatively modest increase in lever pressing to the CS+ in their Vehicle test. Importantly, CNO administration did not significantly suppress this PIT effect and, in fact, was associated with a nonsignificant <italic>increase</italic> in CS+ elicited pressing. As noted above, this result indicates that the tendency for intra-NAc CNO administration to disrupt PIT performance in hM4Di expressing rats in Experiment 3A (see Figures 4C and 4D) was not due to a nonspecific drug effect.</p><p>One additional wrinkle to Experiment 3 is that Experiment 3B was conducted separately as a control study to analyze potential nonspecific CNO effects. While we used the same basic procedure as in Experiment 3A, direct comparisons between experiments are tempting but difficult to interpret. We believe that the critical question to ask when evaluating such data is whether CNO produced an effect in DREADD-free rats that accounts for the main findings, as is common in related studies (Augur et al., 2016; Laurent et al., 2016; Marchant et al., 2016; Campese et al., 2017; Lichtenberg et al., 2017; Alcaraz et al., 2018; Hsu et al., 2018; Collins et al., in press). Our findings demonstrate that this was not the case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Separate issue, but as I mentioned above, describing what is essentially compulsive/habitual lever pressing as 'exploratory seeking' does not help.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we have omitted this terminology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given these, I am not sure that any of the conclusions regarding the role of DA really stands. Again, the experimental design as a whole is excellent, I believe, and the results are interesting in terms of clarifying the neural and behavioral processes at stake in PIT, but ample revision are needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these constructive comments and hope that our extensive revisions have adequately addressed their concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is a very interesting and cleverly-designed study that parses our how mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) transmission may be involved in the ability of Pavlovian cues to invigorate reward seeking, using a well-established Pavlovian-to-Instrumental transfer test. Using DREADD approaches to silence dopamine cell bodies they show that suppressing DA activity blocks or attenuates the PIT effect. Moreover, this appeared to be mediated primarily by DA activity in the accumbens, but not prefrontal cortex. What was particularly important about these findings is that the authors conducted a sophisticated microstructural analysis of behavior, focusing on how often rats may approach the food cup (as a measure of reward expectancy). This analysis showed that, even though reducing DA activity suppressed the increase in lever pressing induced by Pavlovian, reward-associated cues, it did not affect approaches to the food cup, suggesting that DA's role in this context is to enhance motivation, but not reward expectancy. They also showed that reducing DA activity did not influence how reinforcer devaluation altered responding.</p><p>This is a well-designed study that has important implications for teasing out what DA does (and does not do) in modulating reward seeking. The analyses are sound, and the Discussion is fair and scholarly. I have no major issues with the paper, but a few relatively minor points the authors should attend to.</p><p>1) Subsection “Pavlovian conditioning”, was a 10 Hz tone used?

However, the authors should address a few additional points.</p><p>1) The authors present evidence that the chunked operant-entry action sequence is resistant to devaluation. However, it is possible that port entry behavior is simply resistant to devaluation whether or not the entry follows an operant response. The authors show that animals make &quot;noncontingent food cup approaches&quot; (i.e., port entries), but do not analyze the rate of this behavior in any of their tasks. The argument that operant responses are resistant to devaluation because they are part of a chunked, habit action sequence would be strengthened if entries that are NOT part of such sequences were not resistant to devaluation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the question of whether response-contingent and noncontingent approach responses differ in their sensitivity to reward devaluation is an important one. However, we are limited in our ability to analyze this issue in with the current data set. For our reward-specific devaluation, both rewards are retrieved from the same food cup. This makes it impossible to distinguish between noncontingent (press-independent) food cup approaches based on whether they are motivated by the devalued vs. non-devalued reward. We have indicated this reason for not including noncontingent approach analysis in the Results section (subsection “Inhibiting dopamine neurons spares the sensitivity of reward-seeking actions to reward devaluation”, last paragraph). We also note that other findings from our lab (not shown) from studies using a single action-outcome contingency task indicate that noncontingent approaches are indeed readily suppressed by reward devaluation, in contrast to press-contingent approaches. These findings are in line with previous reports that devaluation suppresses food-cup approach behavior (e.g., Balleine, 1992; Thrailkill and Bouton, 2017), including when those approaches are directly elicited by Pavlovian conditioned stimuli (Holland and Straub, 1979; Lichtenberg et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It would also be interesting to know whether noncontingent entries in the PIT test are dependent on dopamine/mesolimbic dopamine.</p></disp-quote><p>Our analysis of noncontingent entries during PIT testing (Figure 3—figure supplement 3, Figure 4—figure supplement 4) indicates that VTA dopamine inhibition (CNO in hM4Di expressing rats) does not disrupt this aspect of behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Systemic CNO had a greater effect on PIT than intra-accumbens CNO. The authors should discuss the possible reasons for this.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a passage (subsection “Pathway-specific inhibition of dopamine projections to NAc, but not mPFC, disrupts cue-motivated reward seeking but not retrieval”, second paragraph) discussing this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4F and the similar supplementary figure are hard to understand. First, the X axis should be more descriptive (i.e., refer to CS-induced increase in lever presses without approach). Second, the Y axis reads &quot;CNO suppression&quot;, but apparently greater suppression is represented by more negative numbers. This is counterintuitive. I think the authors are trying to say that the impact of CNO positively correlates with the impact of the CS on lever presses without approach, but they write that there is a negative correlation. The figure legend adds to the confusion by saying that the Y axis is &quot;PIT Score for vehicle test – PIT Score for CNO test&quot;. If that's the case, then the lower PIT scores in CNO should result in positive values, not the predominantly negative values shown in the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this figure panel and caption were generally confusing and have made several changes to clarify what is being presented. We continue to prefer using a measure (CNO-Vehicle) for which negative numbers reflect the degree of suppression is desirable. But we have corrected the caption and avoided directly using the term negative correlation in the main text (subsection “Pathway-specific inhibition of dopamine projections to NAc, but not mPFC, disrupts cue-motivated reward seeking but not retrieval”, fifth paragraph), which we agree may confuse readers. Importantly, the direction of the correlation statistic and nature of the measures used are clearly presented in the text and figures.</p></body></sub-article></article>
