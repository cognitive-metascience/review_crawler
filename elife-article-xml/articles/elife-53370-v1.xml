The <italic>A. japonicus</italic> kisspeptin system functions in multiple tissues that are closely related to seasonal reproduction and metabolism.

Neurosecretory centers, one of the major output systems in the animal brain, secrete neuropeptides and nonpeptidergic neuromodulators to regulate developmental, behavioral and physiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tessmar-Raible, 2007</xref>). Understanding the evolutionary origin of these centers is an area of active investigation, mostly because of their importance in a range of physical phenomena such as growth, metabolism, or reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tessmar-Raible et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zandawala et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The hypothalamus constitutes the major part of the ventral diencephalon in vertebrates and acts as a neurosecretory brain center, controlling the secretion of various neuropeptides (hypothalamic neuropeptides) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burbridge et al., 2016</xref>). Beyond vertebrates, similar neurosecretory systems have been seen in multiple protostomian species, including crustaceans, spiders, and mollusks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hartenstein, 2006</xref>). Specific to echinoderms, which occupy an intermediate phylogenetic position asdeuterostomian invertebrate species with respect to vertebrates and protostomes, increasing evidence, collected from in silico identification of hypothalamic neuropeptides and the functional characterization of a vasopressin/oxytocin (VP/OT)-type signaling system, suggests the existence of conserved signaling elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zandawala et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Odekunle et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The hypothalamic neuropeptide kisspeptins, encoded by the <italic>Kiss1</italic> gene and most notably expressed in the hypothalamus, share a common Arg-Phe-amide motif at their C-termini and belong to the RFamide peptide family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roseweir and Millar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Uenoyama et al., 2016</xref>). Exogenous administration of kisspeptins triggers an increase in the circulating levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and gonadotropin in humans, mice, and dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gottsch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dhillo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dhillo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albers-Wolthers et al., 2014</xref>). Accumulating evidence suggests that the kisspeptin system functions as a central modulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis to regulate mammalian puberty and reproduction through a specific receptor, GPR54 (also known as AXOR12 or hOT7T175), which is currently referred to as the kisspeptin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muir et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kirby et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Javed et al., 2015</xref>). Following the discovery of kisspeptins and kisspeptin receptors in mammals, a number of kisspeptin-system paralogous genes have been revealed in other vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pasquier et al., 2014</xref>), and a couple of functional kisspeptin and its receptor have also been demonstrated in amphioxus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, kisspeptin-type peptides and their corresponding receptors from echinoderms have been annotated in silico, on the basis of the analysis of genome and transcriptome sequence data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mirabeau and Joly, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elphick and Mirabeau, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Semmens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Semmens and Elphick, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Suwansa-Ard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). However, to our knowledge, neither the kisspeptin-type peptides nor the corresponding receptors have been experimentally identified and functionally characterized in non-chordate invertebrates. This raises an important question: does the kisspeptin signaling system have an ancient evolutionary origin or did it evolve de novo in the chordate/vertebrate lineages?</p><p>Here, we addressed this question by searching for kisspeptin and its receptor genes in a non-chordate species, the sea cucumber <italic>Apostichopus japonicus</italic>. It is one of the most studied echinoderms and is widely distributed in temperate habitats in the western North Pacific Ocean, being cultivated commercially on a large scale in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Purcell et al., 2012</xref>). We uncovered kisspeptin-like and kisspeptin receptor-like genes by mining published <italic>A. japonicus</italic> data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>) using a bioinformatics approach. Their signaling properties were characterized using an in vitro culture system. Through the evaluation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and other intracellular signals, we found that <italic>A. japonicus</italic> kisspeptins activate two receptors (AjKissR1 and AjKissR2) via a GPCR-mediated G<sub>αq</sub>/PLC/PKC/MAPK signaling pathway in a mammalian cell line. Although likely, it remains to be determined whether the same signaling cascade also occurs in vivo in its seemingly conserved function in reproductive control. Finally, we revealed the physiological activities of this signaling system both in vivo and ex vivo, and we demonstrated the involvement of the kisspeptin system in reproductive and metabolic regulation in <italic>A. japonicus</italic>. Collectively, our findings indicate the existence of a kisspeptin signaling system in non-chordate deuterostome invertebrates and provide new evidence to support the ancient evolutionary origin of the intracellular signaling and physiological functions mediated by this kisspeptin system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tessmar-Raible et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In silico identification of kisspeptins and kisspeptin receptors</title><p>The putative <italic>A. japonicus</italic> kisspeptin precursor gene (<italic>AjpreKiss</italic>) was identified in silico from transcriptome data and cloned from anterior part (ANP, containing the nerve ring) tissue samples by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The full-length cDNA (GenBank accession number MH635262) was 2481-bp long and contained a 543-bp open reading frame (ORF), encoding a 180-amino-acid peptide precursor (AjpreKiss) with one predicted signal peptide region and four cleavage sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Two mature peptides with amide donors for C-terminal amidation—a 32-amino-acid kisspeptin-like peptide with a disulﬁde-bond (AjKiss1a) and an 18-amino-acid kisspeptin-like peptide (AjKiss1b)—were predicted (sequences listed in the 'Key Resources Table').

In particular, significant expression and cell membrane localization of AjKissR1 was detected in oocytes, indicating the consistent molecular property of AjKissR1 in vivo and in vitro. From the TES sections, significant fluorescence signal from the kisspeptin precursor, but only a weak signal from AjKissR1, can be detected in spermatogenic epithelium.

Both putative mature peptides have a C-terminal Leu-Pro-Phe-amide motif, instead of the Arg-Phe-amide motif common in vertebrate kisspeptins, and exhibit a much lower identity with vertebrate kisspeptin sequences.

Likewise, neuropeptides AjKiss1a and AjKiss1b could potentiate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling by binding the human kisspeptin receptor HsKiss1R and the zebrafish kisspeptin receptors DrKiss1Ra/b, similar to the corresponding active decapeptides. This, to our knowledge, is the first experimental data directly confirming the connection between the kisspeptin systems of vertebrates and <italic>A. japonicus</italic>, therefore proving that this peptide system is present and active in non-chordate deuterostome species. Considering the high conservation of the neuropeptides in different echinoderms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Semmens and Elphick, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zandawala et al., 2017</xref>), our findings strongly suggest that the kisspeptin signaling system that exists in <italic>A. japonicus</italic> may be extend to other taxa in this phylum.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conserved G<sub>αq</sub>/PLC/PKC/MAPK intracellular pathway mediated by the <italic>A. japonicus</italic> kisspeptin system provides insights into the evolution of kisspeptin signaling</title><p>It is well established that in mammals, Kiss1R is a typical G<sub>αq</sub>-coupled receptor, triggering intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and the PLC/PKC signaling cascade in response to agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kirby et al., 2010</xref>). However, accumulating evidence shows that in teleosts, although both kisspeptin receptors preferentially activate the G<sub>αq</sub>-dependent PKC pathway, one of them is also capable of triggering the G<sub>αs</sub>-dependent PKA cascade in response to kisspeptin challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohga et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biran et al., 2008</xref>). Using CRE-Luc and SRE-Luc reporting assays, which help to discriminate between the AC/PKA and PLC/PKC signaling pathways, an amphioxus kisspeptin receptor was shown to trigger significant PKC but not PKA signaling when stimulated by two kisspeptin-type peptides using heterologous expression in cultured HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, our data showed that, upon synthetic peptide stimulation, both AjKissR1 and AjKissR2 induced a rapid and transient rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in a G<sub>αq</sub> inhibitor FR900359-sensitive manner. Further functional characterization demonstrated that both AjKissR1 and AjKissR2 induced ERK1/2 activation via a G<sub>αq</sub>/PLC/PKC cascade. Although the G<sub>αs</sub> protein has been implicated in the teleost kisspeptin receptors-mediated signaling pathway, we failed to collect distinct evidence to prove the involvement of G<sub>αs</sub>-dependent signaling in the <italic>A. japonicus</italic> kisspeptin system. Taken together, it is more likely that G<sub>αq</sub>-coupled signaling is highly conserved in the kisspeptin signaling systems from <italic>A. japonicus</italic> to mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Reproductive and metabolic regulatory functions identified in <italic>A. japonicus</italic> revealed the ancient physiological roles of the kisspeptin system</title><p>Diverse physiological functions of the kisspeptin system have been reported in vertebrate species. In mammals, it is widely established that the kisspeptin signaling system is essential for HPG axis regulation, leading to reproductive control. Furthermore, the hypothalamic kisspeptin neurons have been found to stimulate pituitary gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons, which express the kisspeptin receptor, providing a neural pathway for the mammalian kisspeptin neuronal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oakley et al., 2009</xref>). In non-mammalian species, especially in teleosts, the reproductive function of the kisspeptin system is still controversial in light of the normal reproductive phenotypes observed in fish in the absence of kisspeptins. A new theory has been proposed in which the nonreproductive functions beyond HPG regulation are the conserved roles of kisspeptins in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakajo et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we applied multiple approaches to analyze the potential functions of the recently identified kisspeptin in <italic>A. japonicus</italic>, aiming to provide some insights into the ancient physiological roles of the kisspeptin system.</p><p>In the present study, the expressional distribution of the <italic>A. japonicus</italic> kisspeptin and its receptor proteins in multiple tissues suggests the involvement of the kisspeptin signaling system in the regulation of both reproductive and non-reproductive functions. The seasonal fluctuation of kisspeptin and receptors transcripts, consistent with the reproductive development process, indicates the possible functional involvement of this system in the control of seasonal reproduction in <italic>A. japonicus</italic>. Interestingly, the unequally expressed kisspeptin and receptor protein levels in gonads, comparatively high kisspeptin precursor level in testis, and high kisspeptin receptor protein levels in ovary tissue demonstrated in our study, suggests differential functions of the kisspeptin system in different genders of sea cucumber. Further investigation using both in vivo and in vitro experiments indicated a role for the kisspeptin signaling system in regulating metabolic balance and gut function in sea cucumber. Combining the feeding regulatory function of VP/OT-type neuropeptides characterized in echinoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Odekunle et al., 2019</xref>) and the cross-talk between kisspeptin and VP/OT neural systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Higo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seymour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakajo et al., 2018</xref>), we suggest that a role of kisspeptin signaling in the regulation of the VP/OT system may exist in echinoderms, and the possible interaction between these two systems and an evolutionarily conserved function of the kisspeptin system is worthy of further exploration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Comparable concentrations of proteins were then electrophoresed on a 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk, then probed with rabbit anti-AjKissR1 serum (1:1000), followed by detection using HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Beyotime). Samples were probed in parallel with anti-tubulin antibody (Beyotime) as control for protein loading.</p><p>To detect AjpreKiss or its mature peptide in different tissues of sea cucumber, tissues were sampled and treated following the same protocol for receptor detection. Comparable concentrations of proteins were then electrophoresed on a 15% SDS polyacrylamide gel (preparation of 20 mL gel solution: 4.6 mL dH<sub>2</sub>O, 10.0 mL 30% polyacrylamide solution, 5.0 mL 5 mol/L Tris [pH8.8], 0.2 mL 10% SDS solution, 0.2 mL 10% ammonium persulphate solution, 8.0 μL TEMED) and transferred to PVDF membranes (180 mA, 40 min for Kiss detection and 180 mA, 70 min for tubulin detection). Membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk, then probed with rabbit anti-AjKissR1 serum (1:1000), followed by detection using HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Beyotime).

HEK293 cells expressing FLAG–AjKissR1 or FLAG–AjKissR2 were washed with PBS that contained 0.2% bovine serum albumin (FACS buffer). We designed and synthesized an N-terminal FITC-labeled AjKiss1a peptide (see 'Key resources table'). Different kisspeptins were diluted in the FACS buffer to different concentrations, then added to cells that were incubated on ice for 60–90 min. Cells were washed thrice with the FACS buffer and re-suspended in the FACS buffer with 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. The binding activity of the indicated kisspeptin peptides with AjKissR1 or AjKissR2 was determined by measuring the fluorescence of FITC and was presented as a percentage of total binding.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Immunofluorescence assay on paraffin-embedded tissue sections</title><p>Paraffin sections were baked at 60°C for 2–4 hr and placed in xylene for 15 min, twice. The slides were washed twice in 100% ethanol for 10 min each, then in 95% ethanol for 10 min, 85% ethanol for 5 min, 70% ethanol for 5 min, and 50% ethanol for 5 min, followed by washing with dH<sub>2</sub>O for 5 min, and finally washing with PBS for 5 min. Antigen unmasking was performed in sodium citrate buffer (pH 6) for 10 min at 97°C, and then cooled to room temperature. Endogenous peroxidases were blocked by 10 min incubation in 3.0% hydrogen peroxide. Nonspecific antigens were blocked by a 60 min incubation in 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBST. Slides were incubated with primary antibodies overnight after removing the blocking solution, followed by 2 hr incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibodies (FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), Beyotime).

substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Your work is an impressive analysis of the kisspeptin signaling system ranging from the in silico identification, receptor deorphanization to functional tests in the sea cucumber. This is not only interesting in the context of the evolution of neuropeptidergic systems in bilaterians in general, but particularly also in understanding possible evolutionary ancient mechanisms underlying animal seasonality.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Existence and functions of hypothalamic kisspeptin neuropeptide signaling system in a non-chordate deuterostome species&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Maria Ina Arnone (Reviewer #2); Vera Terblanche (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Wang et al. performed a detailed study of the echinoderm Kisspeptin/receptor system, using the sea cucumber <italic>Apostichopus japonicus</italic> as a model. They identified 2 preprohormones and three receptors, of which they study both peptide hormones and two receptors in detail. They performed phylogenetic analyses, receptor activation and signaling studies, Western blot analyses and immunohistochemistry. The authors also provide an initial characterization of this peptidergic system in <italic>Apostichopus japonicus</italic> physiology. Based on those studies they come to important conclusions about the evolutionary conservation of the kisspeptin system.</p><p>Their findings are of potential great interest, being the first demonstration of functioning of this system outside vertebrates, with important implications for the understanding of the evolution of vertebrate (neuro)secretory systems, as well as seasonal regulation of reproduction and physiology.</p><p>However, the manuscript requires several essential improvements especially in its presentation (details below).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The technical information necessary to evaluate the manuscript is either missing or spread across various places. This includes all primary metadata, sequences of synthetic peptides used for receptor, physiological and antibody studies. Metadata are entirely missing. In case of the peptides, it is not specified in the main text whether the synthetic Kiss peptides used in the experiment are amidated. This could only be found when digging through the supplementary tables.</p><p>2) Connected to the missing technical information, there is insufficient information on the replicates used in the different studies. For instance, regarding the Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization experiments (Figure 2B1 and B2). How representative are these experiments? How many times were they repeated and how reproducible were the results? In other cases a number &quot;n&quot; for replicates is mentioned, but it is unclear how the replicates (e.g., technical, biological) were defined.</p><p>3) The phylogenetic trees require major improvements. De-code accession numbers in trees for species to make it better understandable to the reader without having to consult the databases for every branch. This is essential to see what the tree is really showing (and how representative it is.)</p><p>The critical bootstrap value for the Kisspeptin family preprohormone group is only 34 – this means there is no real support for this group as a common branch and hence, in a strict sense, this would argue against a common evolutionary ancestry. On the other hand- such seemingly unsupported grouping is not totally uncommon for preprohormones across larger phylogenetic distances (e.g. due to the relative shortness of the peptide chains that can be used for the comparison), but then the authors need to discuss this issue and provide other reasons (such as their receptor homology, deorphanization and cross-binding studies) to argue their case for a preprohormone group that derived from a common evolutionary ancestor. Genomic gene structure information on the pre-prohormone could provide additional support (e.g. exon/intron boundaries; microsyntheny).</p><p>4) Figure 5D, E: The data on EGFP-PKC isoform recruitment to the plasma membrane assays shown in Figure 5D are not convincing. In some cases the potential membrane signal is largely obscured by the high cytoplasmic expression. Is there a way to quantify this using a histogram? Maybe this figure is also not strictly necessary to support the findings.</p><p>5) The specificity of the antibodies raised against AjKiss1b-10 and AjKISS-R1 is of major concerns.</p><p>There should be experiments showing that the antibody recognizes specifically the antigen. For protein blots, this could be achieved by probing lysates of non-transfected and transfected mammalian neuroendocrine cells, which could process the AjKiss precursor. The same goes for immunofluorescence, e.g. compare transfected and plasmid-only transfected tissue culture cells. In AjKISS-R1 transfected cells does the antibody signal co-localize with the GFP signal to the membrane?</p><p>Protein blots:</p><p>What kind of gel did the authors use for this experiment in Figure 6A? AjKiss1b-10 is 10 amino acid long (~ 1.1 kDa). Since peptides this small are unlikely to be retained after transfer to PVDF, the authors should specify the experimental procedure to obtain this blot. Molecular weight markers would be useful to confirm the signals from the Aj tissues sampled are from the unprocessed or the partially processed precursor or the mature peptide. Was the anti-AjKiss1b-10 raised against the amidated peptide? If so, why the signals from the mature peptide are not detected (&quot;Western Blot analysis of <italic>A. japonicus</italic> kisspeptin precursor&quot;)? Why is Kisspeptin detected in OVA by western and not by immunofluorescence?</p><p>6) There are further major omissions of explanations throughout the text, e.g.:</p><p>In Figure 4A, the authors completely omit to discuss the PTX treatment shown in the panels. Does PTX stand for Pertussis toxin? The authors need to mention this treatment in the text and explain the reason to use PTX.</p><p>Explain AjKiss1b-10 in the text. Same for in the Figure 4 legend. Please consider that not all readers are familiar with the literature on Kisspeptins or neuropeptides in general. Also, please, pick one naming system and keep using it; i.e., use either Kp or Kiss or Kisspeptin. Same for receptor naming.</p><p>Subsection “In silico identification of Kps and Kp receptors”, first paragraph: is that the same sequence identified by Swansa-ard et al./Chen et al? If yes state that and those lines can be omitted as it also repeats the Introduction.</p><p>Figure 5A1. What time (5 min, 10 min, etc. stimulation) the concentration-dependence blots refer to?</p><p>Figure 5A2 (bar graph). Why isn't the strongest signal for AjKissR2 set at 100% as in the case of AjKissR1?</p><p>Figure 6D. Upper left panel. What treatment is this?</p><p>Figure 6F. Explain what tissue index measures.</p><p>Figure 7: Why does this figure indicate presence of only one kisspeptin receptor in sea cucumber if the presented study finds two?</p><p>Substantial editing work is needed to allow readers to more easily follow the data. Generally, the figure legends and the Materials and methods section need the most attention.</p><p>Figures. Make larger panels, please. Some of the labels on the panels were very difficult, if not impossible, to decipher (for instance, 1C, 1E, 5A, 5B, 5C). Check for typos in the figure labels (for instance, Figure 2B: 1 μM instead of 1 um).</p><p>Materials and methods.</p><p>Animals should not be listed as &quot;Materials&quot;. Transient and stable HEK293 cells expressing AjKissRs were generated, but it is not explained why.

The work presented by the authors does not support this claim, but rather implies that the molecular system itself (including the use of Gaq-PKC cascade in Kp signalling) is likely an ancestral state and is now used by the vertebrate hypothalamus. To draw evolutionary conclusion about an ancestral hypothalamic system the study would have to include other markers for vertebrate hypothalamic cell types (e.g. nkx2.1) and compare how kisspeptin localizes relative to the expression of these other markers. Furthermore, some places of kisspeptin detection- OVA, Tes, ANP- don't make sense with an &quot;ancestral neurosecretory system&quot; in the sense of an ancestral tissue unit. The authors should revise their text, heading and conclusions according to this, rather pointing out the molecular conservation, as well as the possibly interesting conserved link in the regulation of seasonal reproduction.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Existence and functions of hypothalamic kisspeptin neuropeptide signaling system in a non-chordate deuterostome species&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We find it pretty unusual that an antibody that was generated against an amidated peptide would now only rather recognize the precursor (or if we played devil's advocate- a much larger band in the Western that could have nothing to do with the actual peptide). We would thus ask the authors to insert a cautionary sentence in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53370.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The technical information necessary to evaluate the manuscript is either missing or spread across various places. This includes all primary metadata, sequences of synthetic peptides used for receptor, physiological and antibody studies. Metadata are entirely missing. In case of the peptides, it is not specified in the main text whether the synthetic Kiss peptides used in the experiment are amidated. This could only be found when digging through the supplementary tables.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers suggested, in the revised manuscript, we have added the primary metadata in xlsx or txt format linked with the figures in main text or the supplementary figures, and the Key Resources Table is now incorporated within the main text at the very beginning of the Materials and methods section to provide the detailed information about the sequences and amidation of indicated synthetic peptides, as well as the characters of antibodies, especially for the customized polyclonal antibody for AjKiss1b-10 and AjKissR1. We thank the reviewers for their suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Connected to the missing technical information, there is insufficient information on the replicates used in the different studies. For instance, regarding the Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization experiments (Figure 2B1 and B2). How representative are these experiments? How many times were they repeated and how reproducible were the results? In other cases a number &quot;n&quot; for replicates is mentioned, but it is unclear how the replicates (e.g., technical, biological) were defined.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided the information on the replicates used in different experiments, which is now introduced in every figure legend and the “n” for animals or sample numbers is also clearly denoted in the revised manuscript as the reviewers suggested, and we thank the reviewers for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The phylogenetic trees require major improvements. De-code accession numbers in trees for species to make it better understandable to the reader without having to consult the databases for every branch. This is essential to see what the tree is really showing (and how representative it is.)</p><p>The critical bootstrap value for the Kisspeptin family preprohormone group is only 34 – this means there is no real support for this group as a common branch and hence, in a strict sense, this would argue against a common evolutionary ancestry. On the other hand- such seemingly unsupported grouping is not totally uncommon for preprohormones across larger phylogenetic distances (e.g. due to the relative shortness of the peptide chains that can be used for the comparison), but then the authors need to discuss this issue and provide other reasons (such as their receptor homology, deorphanization and cross-bindind studies) to argue their case for a preprohormone group that derived from a common evolutionary ancestor. Genomic gene structure information on the pre-prohormone could provide additional support (e.g. exon/intron boundaries; microsyntheny).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out these issues. The abbreviated Latin names of species and protein names are now represented in trees, instead of accession numbers, to make it better understandable to the readers. To get more representative trees for preprohormone groups, a new strategy for ML tree construction is now applied in kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptor phylogenetic analyses. As introduced in the Materials and methods section of the revised text, our new approach mainly includes using Constraint-based Multiple Alignment Tool (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/cobalt/cobalt.cgi?CMD=Web) for the multiple protein sequence alignment, and the FastTree program (version 2.1) for construction of the trees based on WAG and CAT model, and providing local support values based on the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test. For the phylogenetic tree of peptides, the poorly aligned regions from the multiple sequence alignment are automatically removed by trimAl. The trees were then visualized through Evolview web server. The revised phylogenetic tree for kisspeptin analysis represents much higher local support value for topological stability of the tree. Though, in the current tree, the AjKiss is clustered with predicated kisspeptin from other two sea cucumbers and then grouped with chordate kisspeptins under the high local support value of 81%, we still believe that the bioinformatical analysis can’t support the definition of this screened Kisspeptin-like gene. We do agree with reviewers that gene structure information on the pre-prohormones could provide additional support and now it has been provided in the revised Figure 1. The conserved gene structure is displayed from comparative analysis of sea cucumber, zebrafish and human <italic>preKiss</italic> genes. We believe that these data, combined with the receptor homology, deorphanization and cross-binding results from our studies, should be sufficiently convincing to demonstrate the evolutionary homology of AjKiss and chordate kisspeptins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 5D, E: The data on EGFP-PKC isoform recruitment to the plasma membrane assays shown in Figure 5D are not convincing. In some cases the potential membrane signal is largely obscured by the high cytoplasmic expression. Is there a way to quantify this using a histogram? Maybe this figure is also not strictly necessary to support the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers pointed out, we have performed additional experiments to address the concern on PKC isoform recruitment to the plasma membrane assays using plasmids of GFP-tagged rat PKC isoforms (α, βI, βII and δ) (details are shown in Key Resources Table) and obtained much more convincing data. As shown in the now revised Figure 6D and E, upon activation by AjKiss<sup>-1</sup>b, PKCα, βI and βII were clearly translocated to the plasma membrane, but not PKCδ. These new data suggest that PKCα, βI and βII are involved in the AjKissR1 and R2-mediated downstream signaling pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The specificity of the antibodies raised against AjKiss1b-10 and AjKISS-R1 is of major concerns.</p><p>There should be experiments showing that the antibody recognizes specifically the antigen. For protein blots, this could be achieved by probing lysates of non-transfected and transfected mammalian neuroendocrine cells, which could process the AjKiss precursor. The same goes for immunofluorescence, e.g. compare transfected and plasmid-only transfected tissue culture cells. In AjKISS-R1 transfected cells does the antibody signal co-localize with the GFP signal to the membrane?</p></disp-quote><p>Detection of kisspeptin in non-transfected vs. transfected mammalian neuroendocrine cells should be a good approach for the analysis of intracellular processing and for assessing specificity of the antibody. We tried to develop this expression system using transfected mammalian neuroendocrine cells but failed due to their slow growth hence very difficult to culture. In addition, we were not allowed to enter the laboratory until now due to the coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>Therefore, to provide conclusive evidence of the antibody specificity raised against AjKiss1b-10, instead, we have collected fresh tissue samples from the sea cucumber for western blotting. As shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1A, one band of AjKiss1b-1 (or AjKiss1b) and another about 20 KDa band can be detected. This 20 KDa band in tissue samples should be <italic>Apostichopus japinicus</italic> Kisspeptin precursor (theoretically deduced molecular weight of AjpreKiss is 20.29 KDa).</p><p>For assessing the specificity of anti- AjKissR1 anti-body, we performed western blot and immunofluorescence assays in HEK293 cells. As shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1B and C, using anti- AjKissR1 antibody by western blot, we detected a 65 KDa band of AjKissR1-EGFP (theoretically deduced molecular weight 68 KDa) from HEK 293 cells; we also showed a 45 KDa band from the sea cucumber ovarian sample (theoretically deduced molecular weight 43.46 KDa). Using the immunofluorescence assay, co-localization of Cy3 and GFP in AjKissR1-expressing cells, but not in AjKissR2-expressing cells, was observed by confocal microscopy. Collectively, these data have demonstrated that the antibodies raised against AjKiss1b-10 and AjKISS-R1 are specifically recognizing the targeted proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Protein blots:</p><p>What kind of gel did the authors use for this experiment in Figure 6A? AjKiss1b-10 is 10 amino acid long (~ 1.1 kDa). Since peptides this small are unlikely to be retained after transfer to PVDF, the authors should specify the experimental procedure to obtain this blot. Molecular weight markers would be useful to confirm the signals from the Aj tissues sampled are from the unprocessed or the partially processed precursor or the mature peptide. Was the anti-AjKiss1b-10 raised against the amidated peptide? If so, why the signals from the mature peptide are not detected (&quot;Western Blot analysis of <italic>A. japonicus</italic> kisspeptin precursor&quot;)? Why is Kisspeptin detected in OVA by western and not by immunofluorescence?</p></disp-quote><p>To detect kisspeptin precursor or its mature peptide in different tissues of sea cucumber, protein samples were electrophoresed on a 15% SDS polyacrylamide gel (details are provided in the Materials and methods section of revised text) and transferred to PVDF membranes (180 mA, 40 min for kisspeptin detection). Molecular weight markers imaged in bright field are now provided to show the size of the bands (as shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1). The results indicate that the detected signal mainly shows the unprocessed precursor.</p><p>The anti-AjKiss1b-10 antibody was raised against the amidated peptide, but the signals from the mature peptide are not detected, because the concentration of the mature peptide in tissue samples is too low to be detected; it may also be possible that this antibody does not recognize the CONH<sub>2</sub> group.</p><p>In the current study, we detected kisspeptin precursor in OVA by western, but not by immunofluorescence. This may be due to the specific structures and components of oocytes, as well as the characteristics of the antibody. The presence of the ligand in widely distributed secretory vesicles, which is usually involved in kisspeptin processing and transporting (Hiroko Murakawa, et al., 2016), may be difficult to detect in big oocytes (about 150-200 μm in diameter) by confocal microscopy. For western blotting, the lipids and associated proteins (main components) in mature oocytes are eliminated during sample preparation, consequently increases the concentration of kisspeptin, making it detectable by western blot. Alternatively, it may be also due to the characteristics of the antibody. In fact, many commercially available antibodies are only good for western, not for histochemistry. We explained this inconsistence in revised main text as “the inconsistency with results from the western blotting assay vs. immunofluorescence may be either due to specific structures and components of oocytes, or the characteristics of the antibody”.</p><p>Murakawa, H., Iwata, K., Takeshita, T., and Ozawa, H.

In sea cucumber, aestivation is directly related to metabolism and reproduction, and PK expression and activity is an important physiological index for metabolism and reproduction. Although we don’t have strong evidence to support the functional role of kisspeptin in aestivation of sea cucumber, our data indicate the important role of kisspeptin in the regulation of reproductive development and the metabolic balance of sea cucumber. These two different physiological processes arise simultaneously in the seasonal reproduction of <italic>Apostichopus japonicus</italic> (Ru et al., 2017 and 2018). Moreover, the latest data from Ru’s research (data unpublished, paper under revision) indicate that reproduction causes a significant increase in oxygen consumption in <italic>A. japonicus</italic>, and sea cucumber can accommodate the high oxygen demand by accelerating respiratory rate (this is consistent with the elevation of <italic>PK</italic> RNA expression level of respiratory tree under kisspeptin administration). Meanwhile, Ru’s research also found the decreased appetite during reproductive development which should be related with the degeneration of intestine. Collectively, we believe that kisspeptin administration induces both metabolic regulation (expressional elevation of <italic>PK</italic> and degeneration of intestine) and reproductive control (expression of kisspeptin and its receptor in germline).</p><p>Ru, X., Zhang, L., Liu, S., and Yang, H.

The work presented by the authors does not support this claim, but rather implies that the molecular system itself (including the use of Gaq-PKC cascade in Kp signalling) is likely an ancestral state and is now used by the vertebrate hypothalamus. To draw evolutionary conclusion about an ancestral hypothalamic system the study would have to include other markers for vertebrate hypothalamic cell types (e.g. nkx2.1) and compare how kisspeptin localizes relative to the expression of these other markers. Furthermore, some places of kisspeptin detection- OVA, Tes, ANP- don't make sense with an &quot;ancestral neurosecretory system&quot; in the sense of an ancestral tissue unit. The authors should revise their text, heading and conclusions according to this, rather pointing out the molecular conservation, as well as the possibly interesting conserved link in the regulation of seasonal reproduction.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers suggested, we have removed “originally evolved in this hypothalamic neuropeptide system”, and added one sentence “G<sub>αq</sub>-coupled signaling is highly conserved in the kisspeptin signaling systems from <italic>A. japonicus</italic> to mammals”.

So, while ex vivo experiments show ERK (i.e., MAPK cascade) involvement (Figure 7C and D) the authors have not shown that in/ex vivo Aj kisspeptin signaling involves PLC and PKC.</p><p>We would thus suggest to rephrase this in the following way (or something similar):</p><p>&quot;Through the evaluation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and other intracellular signals, we found that <italic>A. japonicus</italic> kisspeptins activate two receptors (AjKissR1 and AjKissR2) via a GPCR-mediated Gαq/PLC/PKC/MAPK signaling pathway in a mammalian cell line.

It recalls the Figure 4 source data. Here, there is a mislabelling, as the linked excel files has individual worksheet labelled as 3A, 3B etc. – they should be 4A, 4B etc, instead. The authors should check all their supplementary files for correct labelling.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected these labels and checked all the labels in our supplementary files. Besides, an error of data in the source data sheet of “Figure 7H FEB” (cells C27-C29) was found and the source data file (Figure 7E+F+H metadata), as well as the heatmap in Figure 7, was corrected accordingly in revision.

Our results showed that no significant accumulation of cAMP was detected in response to agonist treatment&quot;. We could not find any experiment in the manuscript measuring cAMP accumulation. The authors should amend the text accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>This statement has been removed and an additional sentence “we failed to collect distinct evidence to prove the involvement of G<sub>αs</sub>-dependent signaling in <italic>A. japonicus</italic> Kisspeptin system.” was added following “Although the G<sub>αs</sub> protein has been shown to be implicated in the teleost kisspeptin receptors-mediated signaling pathway,”. These sentences were amended accordingly. We thank the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) All images of the Western blots are over-contrasted. This needs to be corrected and size markers also added to Figure 7 (not just the figure supplement).</p></disp-quote><p>We have checked and revised all images of the Western blots as the reviewers suggested. Besides, we found that the WB images in Figure 7—figure supplement 3B, for the inhibitory activity of pep234 in AjKissR2 mediated ERK signaling, was upside down in the previous version. We have also corrected the data in revision. We thank the reviewers for pointing out this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Carefully check for missing and correct scalebars. Figure 3: According to the scale bar these HEK cells are huge. Sure the scale bar is correct? Figure 6D, E: scale bars are entirely missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the incorrect and missing scalebars. We have checked all the scalebars referring to primary data. The “20 μm” in Figure 3 was marked by mistake, and it has been revised as “10 μm”. The scalebars in Figure 6 have been added. Meanwhile, the scale bars in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 were adjusted too. We thank the reviewers for pointing out this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) There is still some remaining concern about the specificity of the antibody against AjKiss1b. We find it pretty unusual that an antibody that was generated against an amidated peptide would now only rather recognize the precursor (or if we played devil's advocate- a much larger band in the Western that could have nothing to do with the actual peptide). We would thus ask the authors to insert a cautionary sentence in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewers for this comment. We have added a cautionary sentence, “However, the failure to detect mature peptide fragment using anti-AjKiss1b-10 indicates that the further development of antibodies with highsensitivityandspecificity might be required to clarify the mature kisspeptin location in <italic>A. japonicus</italic> tissues. ” following suggestion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
