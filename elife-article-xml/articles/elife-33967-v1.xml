Genes from <italic>Drosophila</italic> such as <italic>atonal</italic> (<italic>ato</italic>) and genes of the Achaete-Scute gene complex (AS-C) define the proneural regions that have the potential for neural fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker and Brown, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertrand et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gómez-Skarmeta et al., 2003</xref>). At least two pathways restrain proneural gene activity and neurogenesis. Lateral inhibition mediated by the Notch pathway blocks neural fate determination by extinguishing proneural gene expression from most proneural cells, with only those that maintain proneural gene expression becoming determined as neural precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertrand et al., 2002</xref>). When the Notch pathway is blocked, entire proneural regions can differentiate as neural cells, whereas ectoderm outside of proneural regions is generally unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heitzler and Simpson, 1991</xref>). The second restriction is the expression of the Inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) proteins, exemplified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> by Extra macrochaetae (Emc), which contain HLH domains but lack a basic DNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benezra et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ellis et al., 1990</xref>). Emc (or, in mammals, ID1-4) antagonizes functions of proneural bHLH proteins by forming inactive heterodimers with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benezra et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ellis et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cabrera et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ellis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Norton, 2000</xref>).</p><p>The transcription patterns of proneural genes are highly regulated. Surprisingly, therefore, uniform expression of a proneural gene can be sufficient for a normal pattern of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rodríguez et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brand et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Domínguez and Campuzano, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Usui et al., 2008</xref>). It has been suggested that a pre-exisiting spatial distribution of Emc defines a prepattern of competence for proneural gene function that can help define a restricted pattern of neurogenesis even if proneural gene transcription is uniform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cubas and Modolell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Usui et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Troost et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with this model, Emc protein levels are low in proneural regions and neural precursor cells, potentially sensitizing these cells to respond to proneural proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cubas and Modolell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhattacharya and Baker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Troost et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that the spatial regulation of Emc expression is important for neural patterning.</p><p>An important aspect of Emc expression is the regulatory relationship between Emc and Da. Da is required for Emc protein expression, which has been thought to reflect transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhattacharya and Baker, 2011</xref>). On the other hand, Emc limits Da expression, potentially by heterodimerizing with Da to prevent transcriptional autoregulation of <italic>da</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhattacharya and Baker, 2011</xref>). Variation in Emc levels may be responsible for all spatial distinctions in Da levels, because in the absence of <italic>emc</italic> Da levels are both high and uniform in all <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues yet examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhattacharya and Baker, 2011</xref>). Emc can be considered a negative feedback regulator of Da, and some E- and ID- protein genes regulate one another similarly in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhattacharya and Baker, 2011</xref>). Because of their low Emc, most proneural regions express higher levels of Da protein, which is expected to further enhance their competence for productive proneural protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cronmiller and Cummings, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vaessin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brown et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhattacharya and Baker, 2011</xref>). These reciprocal changes in Emc and Da levels have been seen in proneural cells from all imaginal discs. If Emc expression is restored to proneural regions, changes in Da level do not occur and proneural gene function is affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhattacharya and Baker, 2011</xref>).</p><p>One reason for regulation of Da expression is that proliferating, non-proneural imaginal disc cells cannot tolerate high levels of Da (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhattacharya and Baker, 2011</xref>). They respond by regulating the Hippo pathway and other genes to repress cell proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrade-Zapata and Baonza, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang and Baker, 2015a</xref>). In mammals also, E-proteins and ID-proteins are critical regulators of cell cycle and of cell senescence, and accordingly are tumor suppressors and oncoproteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lasorella et al., 2014</xref>). In B cells, negative feedback of ID3 on autoregulation of the E-protein TCF3 represents an important barrier to the development of Burkitt’s Lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Richter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmitz et al., 2012</xref>). Mammalian E-proteins and ID-proteins are also associated with multiple neurocognitive diseases, including Pitt Hopkins Syndrome, schizophrenia and Rett Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang and Baker, 2015b</xref>).</p><p>Our initial focus was the cross regulation of Emc and Da. The results did not indicate the homeostatic feedback that had been expected, and instead revealed extensive regulation of Emc expression at the level of protein stability, controlled by its binding partners. In most cells, Emc levels were simply matched to Da levels, apparently as a consequence of stabilization of Emc protein by Da. Once proneural genes were expressed, these alternative dimerization partners affected Da and Emc levels in multiple proneural regions including: the morphogenetic furrow of the eye imaginal disc, corresponding to a stripe of cells expressing the proneural gene <italic>ato</italic> that sweeps across the imaginal disc progressively defining the onset of retinal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Treisman, 2013</xref>); the wing imaginal disc, where <italic>ac</italic> and <italic>sc</italic> expression specifies dorsal and ventral rows of presumptive sensory bristles of the anterior wing margin(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skeath and Carroll, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Skeath et al., 1994</xref>); the notum region of the wing disc, which differentiates sensory bristles of the adult thorax(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gómez-Skarmeta et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with the notion that Emc levels were regulated post-translationally, patterning could continue almost normally when the only source of Emc protein was a uniformly-transcribed transgene. Our findings indicate that Emc (and Da) levels don’t define prepattern that precedes regulated proneural gene expression, but are patterned downstream of proneural gene activity. However, proneural proteins are not sufficient to destabilize Emc proteins at all locations. Therefore, other mechanisms must exist that contribute to define the proneural prepattern.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Da and emc protein levels are proportional to da gene dose</title><p>Da and Emc show fairly uniform protein levels in most imaginal disc cells but they change dynamically in proneural regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cronmiller and Cummings, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhattacharya and Baker, 2011</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). We first investigated the non-proneural regions. If Da and Emc levels were kept even by homeostatic negative feedback, they should compensate for modest changes in expression levels. We decided to compare protein levels in cells homozygous for a null allele (‘clones’), heterozygous for a null allele and a wild type allele (non-recombined cells), and homozygous for wild type alleles (‘twin-spots’). Since the <italic>da</italic> and <italic>emc</italic> genes map to different chromosomes, parallel mitotic recombination of both chromosomes can generate up to nine different genotypes in the same tissue (1. <italic>da</italic><sup>-/-</sup>; <italic>emc</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, 2.<italic>da</italic><sup>-/-</sup>; <italic>emc</italic><sup>-/+</sup>, 3. <italic>da</italic><sup>-/-</sup>; <italic>emc</italic><sup>+/+</sup>; 4. <italic>da</italic><sup>-/+</sup>; <italic>emc</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, 5. <italic>da</italic><sup>-/+</sup>; <italic>emc</italic><sup>-/+</sup>, 6. <italic>da</italic><sup>-/+</sup> <italic>emc</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, 7. <italic>da</italic><sup>+/+</sup>; <italic>emc</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, 8. <italic>da</italic><sup>+/+</sup>; <italic>emc</italic><sup>-/+</sup>, 9. <italic>da</italic><sup>+/+</sup>; <italic>emc</italic><sup>+/+</sup>).

Although other proneural prepatterns may exist, Emc is regulated downstream of proneural genes, not upstream.

It seems that uniform Da levels outside proneural regions reflect uniform transcription from the simple <italic>da</italic> proximal promoter region, with no contribution from the Da-dependent <italic>da</italic> transcription.</p><p>The matching of Emc protein levels with levels of Da led us to discover that Emc protein was short-lived in S2 cells unless Da was co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We hypothesize that the Emc protein level in vivo is significantly influenced by protein stability and depends on the amount of Da protein available to form heterodimers. Emc and Da proteins may approach 1:1 stoichiometry in imaginal disc cells, with most (if not all) Da and Emc molecules existing as heterodimers. This simple model could explain the lack of evidence for Da-dependent <italic>da</italic> transcription, and the failure of <italic>da</italic> mutations alone to enhance growth, even though <italic>da</italic> can inhibit growth in the absence of <italic>emc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhattacharya and Baker, 2011</xref>), because Da is heterodimerized with Emc outside of proneural regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Dependence of Emc on Da for stability probably breaks down above a certain threshold, since it is possible to achieve higher Emc levels in over-expression experiments, and for strong Emc over-expression to affect development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baonza et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam and Montell, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The finding that Emc stability depended on Da prompted us to re-evaluate the effects of other potential heterodimer partners. We showed that proneural bHLH proteins were required for reducing Emc levels in the morphogenetic furrow of the eye disc, anterior wing margin, and in SOP primordial of the notum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). Previous studies of the eye had drawn the opposite conclusion, because of studies of an <italic>ato</italic> mutation that encodes a protein expected to lack a functional DNA binding domain but that could contain an intact HLH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhattacharya and Baker, 2011</xref>). Because changes in Emc and Da levels correlated with expression of an Ato HLH domain, which mediates dimerization, it is likely to be changes in heterodimer partners that altered the levels of Da and Emc proteins in the morphogenetic furrow. We also saw that changes in Emc and Da levels that occur at the anterior wing margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–I</xref>) depended on the AS-C, and the same may be true for the SOP cells of the thorax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Another group reported that some aspects of the Emc pattern in the notum primordium were independent of AS-C(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Troost et al., 2015</xref>). Although we confirmed this finding using clones of an AS-C deletion (the <italic>sc<sup>10.1</sup></italic> genotype used before might encode a mutant Sc protein that perhaps could heterodimerize), these patterns reflect mainly regions where Emc is higher than elsewhere. We would describe three levels of Emc in the notum: regions of highest Emc, which do not include proneural regions and where Da expression is not modified; SOP cells, where Emc is reduced and Da elevated; the rest of the notum, where Emc and Da levels are relatively uniform and resemble those of the wing pouch or eye disc. Proneural regions (as defined by Sca-LacZ expression) lie within the latter regions. In our view, the notum region of the wing disc differs from other imaginal discs in that Emc and Da levels are not altered in proneural regions, but only in neural precursor cells themselves, where these changes depend on AS-C. It is worth mentioning that regions of higher Emc are not unique to the notum: the eye disc often has higher Emc along the equatorial region of the anterior eye disc, where it is known that higher <italic>emc</italic> transcription is induced by Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhattacharya and Baker, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Despite the importance we demonstrate for proneural proteins in regulating Emc, ectopic Ato or Sc proteins were not sufficient to lower Emc levels prematurely or outside of neurogenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). In proneural regions, proneural proteins may have different properties from the proteins expressed ectopically in other cells. Interestingly, ectopic expression of either Emc or Ato achieved lower protein levels in the vicinity of the morphogenetic furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>Our findings challenge the view that Emc levels define a prepattern for neurogenesis sufficient to impose a normal pattern of neurogenesis on a uniform proneural expression pattern, because we found that most variation in Emc levels was downstream of proneural genes. Consistent with this, uniform <italic>emc</italic> transcription was sufficient for most patterns of Emc and Da protein expression and most neural patterning, showing that if Emc contributed to a proneural prepattern, it was not essential for it. This result parallels the earlier discovery that almost normal thoracic neurogenesis can occur in the presence of only uniform AS-C transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rodríguez et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Usui et al., 2008</xref>), and suggests that the basis for the neural prepattern could lie elsewhere, for example in post-translational modification of HLH proteins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker and Brown, 2018</xref>). When Emc is expressed ectopically, we do see that Emc protein levels accumulate differently in some locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), and this is seen for proneural proteins also, consistent with undescribed factors that determine expression level of these proteins. It can’t yet be ruled out, however, that transcriptional regulation of proneural genes and of <italic>emc</italic> each provide redundant patterning information, because we have not investigated whether neural patterning would be normal if <italic>both emc</italic> and proneural genes were transcribed uniformly. In addition, even though the <italic>emc</italic> expression pattern may not be the source of prepattern, Emc may still be a component of the mechanism, since it clearly does suppress neural differentiation at inappropriate locations, which in many cases are locations where ectopic proneural genes seem unable to destabilize Emc.</p><p>Like Emc, mammalian ID1, ID2 and ID3 proteins are also short-lived proteins degraded through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and there is evidence they can be stabilized by heterodimerization with E-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deed et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bounpheng et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lingbeck et al., 2005</xref>). Our studies of the simpler <italic>Drosophila</italic> system indicate that in most cells the E-protein Da is the major single determinant of ID protein stability. It is possible this will be found to be the case in mammalian cells also, which typically express multiple E-proteins and ID-proteins, although it might be necessary to examine cells that lack all mammalian E-proteins. A recent study suggested that Da is made less stable by heterodimerization with Sc, and that Da-Sc heterodimers also affect Enhancer-of-split protein stability and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kiparaki et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the equilibrium and dynamics of HLH protein dimerization and stability must change when transcription of proneural bHLH genes begins and ends when proneural regions are established and decay, and may also be affected by the Notch signaling that induces expression of bHLH proteins from the E(spl)-C. It would be of interest, in the future, to investigate the binding properties HLH dimer species and the dynamics of their mixtures more quantitatively than has been done in the past.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>emc</italic></td><td/><td>FlyBase: FBgn0000575</td><td/></tr><tr><td>gene (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>da</italic></td><td/><td>FlyBase: FBgn0267821</td><td/></tr><tr><td>gene (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>ato</td><td/><td>FlyBase: FBgn0010433</td><td/></tr><tr><td>gene (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>sc</td><td/><td>FlyBase: FBgn0004170</td><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent (D. melanogaster)</td><td><italic>da[3]</italic></td><td>PMID: 3802198</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>emc[AP6]</italic></td><td>PMID: 7947322</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>emc[Δ1]</italic></td><td>this study</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaste</italic>r)</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>act &gt; CD2&gt;Gal4, UAS-GFP</italic></td><td>PMID: 9053304</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>ato[1]</italic></td><td>PMID: 8196767</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>ato[3]</italic></td><td>PMID: 7635049</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>emc-GFP[YB0040]</italic></td><td>PMID: 17179094</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>emc-GFP[YB0067]</italic></td><td>PMID: 17179094</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>P{PZ}emc[04322]</italic></td><td>PMID: 9529525</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>Df(1)sc[B57]</italic></td><td>PMID: 2510998</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>Df(1)sc[10-1]</italic></td><td>PMID: 3111716</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-HA-da</td><td>PMID: 25579975</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>UAS-ato.ORF-3HA</italic></td><td>PMID: 23637332</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>UAS-sc</italic></td><td>PMID: 8978666</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>UAS-ato-4</italic></td><td>PMID: 8324823</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>UAS-emc5.3</italic></td><td>PMID: 10804180</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>cell line (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>S2</td><td>DGRC</td><td>Stock Number: 6</td><td/></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>anti-βGal (mouse)</td><td>DSHB</td><td>40-1a</td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>anti-ElaV (rabbit)</td><td>DSHB</td><td>7E8A10</td><td>(1:50)</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>anti-Da (mouse)</td><td>PMID: 3802198</td><td/><td>(1:200)</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>anti-Emc (rabbit)</td><td>Y.N.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Regulation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ID protein Extra macrochaetae by proneural dimerization partners&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> as the findings at this stage.</p><p>Specifically, two of the three reviewers, who are all experts in your field, request a significant number of additional experiments to bolster your conclusions. The data and hypothesis have potential, but it is most likely that it will take more than two months to address the concerns and we can therefore not accept the manuscript. Furthermore, from some of the current inconsistencies between data and text pointed out in all three reviews, the consultations suggest that the suggested work may well show far more complexity to the regulatory network that will require a significantly more fine-tuned model. We suggest that you carefully read the reviews and determine if you are willing and able to address these concerns. If you can detail that this is indeed feasible and decide to submit a manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic> rather than elsewhere, we will be pleased to afresh consider an extensively edited and revised manuscript in which you address all key concerns and decide if it should be reviewed.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Li and Baker report a very interesting set of observations suggesting complex post-transcriptional, and very likely post-translational cross-regulation between Proneural Proteins (Ato, Ac-Sc), E-Proteins (Da) and ID proteins (Emc) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Building upon previous work by the same group, the authors uncover evidence consistent with the idea that heterodimer formation between Emc and Da may compete with heterodimer formation between Da and Ato/Ac-Sc and that this competition to a significant degree determines Emc levels and thus potentially neurogenic regions in the fly PNS.</p><p>While the idea of a critical role for post-translational regulation of key proteins in neurogenesis, in this case that of ID proteins, is very interesting and consistent with a growing body of evidence supporting this notion, this study does not provide sufficient evidence for the mechanisms of such regulation and its impact on neurogenesis. Much more work is needed to consolidate the findings, extend them to a level that allows the extraction of a model and understand their consequences for cell fate transitions in the nervous system.</p><p>1) The genetic evidence presented is largely consistent with the model, but not entirely. In subsection “Da and Emc protein levels are proportional to da gene dose” it is stated that the evidence in Figure 2 argues against homeostatic feedback regulation because &quot;In the background wild type for emc (i.e. emc+/+), cells with two copies of the wild type da gene had almost twice as much Da protein as cells with only one copy (Figure 2M)&quot;. Looking at Figure 2M, this is clearly not the case. The levels of Da protein are far less than double. In contrast in emc-/- cells the levels of Da are more than double the gene dosage. This, in fact, is precisely consistent with homeostatic feedback. On the same page, it is stated, correctly, that Da levels are indistinguishable between emc-/+ and emc+/+. Again, this seems precisely what one would predict from homeostasis: that it buffers against minor changes in the dosage of the regulator. Thus, the very notion the study start with discounting seems to be supported by, rather than contradicted by, this particular set of data.</p><p>2) Aside from measuring steady state protein levels in S2 cells, the paper lacks biochemical evidence for the model, particularly for competition between Emc and Proneural Proteins for forming heterodimers with Da. More biochemical and and genetic evidence is needed to demonstrate this model. For example, there are no in vitro competition experiments performed. Another example: the difference in the effect of the two Ato alleles (Ato1 vs Ato3) is intriguing and an important piece of data. It is consistent with the idea that the bHLH domain in needed as opposed to the transcriptional activity, but Ato3 lacks much more than the bHLH domain. A more careful dissection is needed.</p><p>3) There is clear evidence in the paper for a complex set of regulatory interactions, because over expression of Ato has no effect on Emc levels and because there is clearly some level of transcriptional control. The paper however provides no data to explain these effects, and how both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms interact to ensure the precision of the Emc pattern.</p><p>4) What are the implications for neurogenesis for interfering with the post-translational regulation of Emc?</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This paper addresses the role of Emc (Id in mammals) in patterning proneural domains in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Earlier studies have indicated that Emc provides a pre-pattern that is decoded by Da to direct the pattern of proneural gene expression. The proposed decoding mechanism involved positive regulation of proneural factors by Da, titration (inhibition) of Da by Emc and Da auto-regulation. The data presented here challenges this view.</p><p>First, the authors nicely show that the physiological levels of Emc proteins are set by the level of Da proteins (Figure 2; this effect does not seem to be mediated by a transcriptional regulation of emc by Da, Figure 7) and that Emc is stabilized by Da in S2 cells (Figure 3). They further show that the presence of a mutant/inactive Ato protein is sufficient to up-regulate Da, possibly via a stabilization mechanism (not further investigated here), and to down-regulate Emc (Figure 4). How Ato down-regulates Emc remains, however, unclear. Based on the findings reported in Figure 2 and Figure 3, a possible mechanism would be a competition for the binding of Da, resulting in the destabilization of free Emc. However, since ectopic Ato (or Sc) is not sufficient to down-regulate Emc (Figure 5), this mechanism is not favored. Another possibility would be that Ato (or Sc) represses the transcription of the emc gene. However, Ato is not required to repress emc transcription in the morphogenetic furrow. Thus, how Emc is down-regulated in proneural domains at the mRNA and protein levels remain unclear. Also, the functional significance of this down-regulation for proneural patterning is not clear (more generally, whether the patterned expression of emc is relevant for its function remains to be addressed; see below). Finally, the authors suggest that Da is required to activate (or at least maintain) emc gene expression, but only in a region close to/ahead of the furrow in the eye disc (Figure 7; emc is then repressed in the furrow; and Da does not seem to be required in wings).</p><p>In summary, this manuscript reports one interesting finding i.e. Da stabilizes Emc and sets Emc protein levels. However, the extent to which this mechanism contributes to the endogenous Emc protein pattern is not entirely clear to me. This manuscript also reports a new model (Figure 8) suggesting that the pattern of Ato/Sc is established in response to positional information independently of the Emc pattern and that Emc protein levels are merely a read-out of proneural activity.

Also, the model predicts that changes in the level of expression of the emc gene should have no significant effect on proneural patterning. This should be tested.</p><p>2) A potential limitation of this study is that it challenges a view proposed by several groups (Modolell, Simpson, Klein) who worked on a slightly different context (proneural clusters of the dorsal thorax).

Earlier work from the same group had shown that Da activates emc expression, which then feeds back to repress da transcription by preventing Da from activating a da autoregulatory enhancer (Bhattacharya et al., 2011). The complex Emc expression pattern was thought to provide a prepattern for neural differentiation, in the sense that Da/proneural activators would be more active in regions of lowest emc expression.

It also paves the way for deciphering the biological consequences of these important HLH heterodimerization properties, adding the interesting twist of stability regulation. That said, I have a few concerns that I will list below:</p><p>a) The authors focus their &quot;narrative&quot; on how Emc does not represent a proneural prepattern, but rather reflects a proneural &quot;response&quot;. I would say that it is both. They themselves show that the complex RNA pattern of emc does not depend (much) on Da or proneural factors, so this is patterned by something else. Granted, this complex pattern is greatly &quot;evened out&quot; at the protein level, thanks to the mutual interactions described by the authors. Still some proneural cluster &quot;lows&quot; in Emc protein (e.g. the morphogenetic furrow) have a clear proneural-independent transcriptional component, so they are expected to predispose these areas to become neurogenic, namely act as a prepattern. I would change the narrative in such a way to clarify that emc contributes to the prepattern (it cannot be the entire prepattern, since there is still some patterning of bristles in the absence of emc), but at the same time it is itself modulated by proneural activity (at the protein level). After all, whether Emc is or is not a prepatterning factor seems of lesser importance than the dissection of its molecular mode of action.</p><p>b) They should point out that the previously reported activation of emc transcription by da was a misinterpretation of the destabilization of Emc in da null clones and that instead Da only affects transcription of emc behind the morphogenetic furrow (and that only modestly, as shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1).</p><p>c) They should point out that the dependence of Emc on Da levels does break down after a certain threshold. Overexpression of emc in Figure 2O-R causes an enormous increase of Emc protein without concomitantly increasing Da. Probably the degradation machinery of Emc is saturated. Intriguingly Da may also play some role even at these unnaturally high Emc levels, since in the furrow, where Da is engaged by Ato, this excess Emc seems to accumulate less. Therefore, its high accumulation in non-proneural regions is not solely because of saturation of the degradation machinery, since the latter seems to work better in the furrow.</p><p>d) The language needs to be improved. There are many places where the text is hard to follow and the meaning difficult to extract. Probably, with a thorough rewriting, the scientific points (a-c) above will also become clearer.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Regulation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ID protein Extra macrochaetae by proneural dimerization partners&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The new experiment showing that uniform moderate levels of EMC driven by an exogenous promoter rescue neurogenesis certainly support the conclusion that post-transcriptional modulation of EMC is key to patterning neurogenesis. The new data showing that Da protein levels increase linearly with gene dosage are more convincing. Finally, the in vivo data showing that availability of Da regulates EMC protein levels are very nice.</p><p>What remains rather circumstantially substantiated in my view is their mechanistic model of the regulation of EMC protein levels by Proneural proteins by competition for Da. I agree with the authors that the few data they have in this regard do not contradict this notion, and I in fact like the idea mostly because it fits the strong response of EMC to Da levels within the proneural domain under wild type conditions. I am surprised that they were unable to express Atonal in S2 cells to test their model more directly because expression of Ato in vitro has been reported previously.</p><p>The idea that the proneural pre-pattern depends on Da and Proneural proteins, not ID proteins is novel and interesting. Furthermore, it fits nicely with the emerging paradigm that post-transcriptional/translational modification of bHLH proteins is a key determinant of neurogenesis. The authors could do a better job referencing that literature in their Discussion section.</p><p>In summary, the authors' model is the simplest and most parsimonious explanation of their data, but their advance of a specific mechanism for their observations remains relatively weak.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This paper challenges the commonly held view that the ID factor Emc acts as a prepattern regulator of proneural activity during neurogenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Emc is known to heterodimerize with the E protein Da, thereby blocking its DNA-binding activity, hence its ability to regulate proneural gene expression. This paper reports on an alternative model whereby Da would stabilize Emc in the absence of proneural factor and proneural factors, patterned independently of Emc activity, would negatively regulate this stabilizing activity of Da towards Emc to generate the observed pattern of Emc protein accumulation.</p><p>Several interesting observations support this model. First, in contexts of low proneural activity (S2 cells, wing pouch), the accumulation levels of Emc proteins appear to depend on Da levels. The analysis of Emc and Da levels in da, emc clones is really nice (Figure 2) and the stabilization of Emc by Da in S2 cells is clear (Figure 3).</p><p>Second, in the proneural region of the eye, Ato is required for the accumulation of Da and the down-regulation of Emc in neural cells (Figure 4). The analysis of the ato1 and ato3 mutations is convincing. The observation that Emc is stabilized in the absence of Ato (Figure 4D and Figure 6) is interesting. However, how Ato destabilizes Emc is not understood: Ato does not appear to be sufficient to destabilize Emc (Figure 7). It is also not clear whether Ato acts indirectly via Da.</p><p>Third, non-patterned expression of the emc gene largely rescues the emc mutant phenotype (Figure 8), indicating that Emc transcription does not provide key patterning cues.</p><p>In summary, the strength of this paper is that it convincingly shows that the current model needs to be revised. Further experiments are, however, needed to strengthen the alternative model proposed here.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It would be nice to confirm the changes seen in Da levels by IF using Western blots, for instance by comparing Da levels in emc+/+ vs emc+/- discs (and Emc in da+/+ vs da+/- tissues). Please test.</p><p>2) Figure 2E: it is not clear whether the increased Da levels seen in emc mutant cells result from protein stabilization (indicative of Emc targeting Da for degradation, as suggested by Figure 3F) or from increased transcription (due for instance to ectopic/premature expression of proneural factors). Please clarify.</p><p>3) Figure 3G: please control that nub&gt;da does not affect emc gene expression (in situ, enhancer-trap…)</p><p>4) Subsection “Ato is required for altering Da and Emc levels in the morphogenetic furrow”. The conclusion that Da up-regulation is transcriptional and bHLH-mediated needs to be supported by experimental evidence. Could the authors exclude the possibility that Emc also targets Da for degradation (see Figure 3F)?</p><p>5) Subsection “AS-C is required for altering Da and Emc levels in wing disc proneural regions”: This conclusion is not convincing. I find it hard to compare Da levels based on different IF experiments. Clonal analysis is required.</p><p>6) Subsection “AS-C is required for altering Da and Emc levels in wing disc proneural regions”: Whether AS-C regulates Emc/Da levels in sensory cells is difficult to study in the absence of these cells. The data shown in Figure 5B-D are not convincing.</p><p>7) Figure 7B: heterogenous levels of Ato appear to be detected in the non-proneural region (Figure 7B). Therefore, a per-cell quantification of the relative Emc/Da levels is needed (Figure 7A). It would be nice to test whether Ato levels correlate with Emc/Da levels. Also, what is causing the observed heterogeneity in Ato levels?</p><p>8) Figure 7—figure supplement 1A: the clone of act&gt;ato cells (right) exhibits high Emc and high Da levels. This seems to contradict the model whereby Ato competes Emc for binding Da. Please comment.</p><p>9) Figure 8: what is the phenotype of emcD1/emcAP6 flies? are these mRNA null? what is the emc mRNA pattern in the mutant and rescued eye discs?

Also, is the emc mutant combination used in Figure 8 protein null?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33967.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specifically, two of the three reviewers, who are all experts in your field, request a significant number of additional experiments to bolster your conclusions. The data and hypothesis have potential, but it is most likely that it will take more than two months to address the concerns and we can therefore not accept the manuscript. Furthermore, from some of the current inconsistencies between data and text pointed out in all three reviews, the consultations suggest that the suggested work may well show far more complexity to the regulatory network that will require a significantly more fine-tuned model. We suggest that you carefully read the reviews and determine if you are willing and able to address these concerns. If you can detail that this is indeed feasible and decide to submit a manuscript to eLife rather than elsewhere, we will be pleased to afresh consider an extensively edited and revised manuscript in which you address all key concerns and decide if it should be reviewed.</p><p>In addition to a complete rewrite of the manuscript, we have added three additional experiments requested by reviewers and which strengthen the paper: (1) We extended the analysis of Da protein levels in <italic>da</italic> gene doses from 0-2 to 0-4; (2) We showed that uniform transcription of <italic>emc</italic> is sufficient to rescue nearly all gene expression patterns and most of the <italic>emc</italic> mutant phenotype; (3) We explored the regulation of Emc and Da in the notum region of the thorax and explained how our findings are related to previously-published models.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Li and Baker report a very interesting set of observations suggesting complex post-transcriptional, and very likely post-translational cross-regulation between Proneural Proteins (Ato, Ac-Sc), E-Proteins (Da) and ID proteins (Emc) in Drosophila. Building upon previous work by the same group, the authors uncover evidence consistent with the idea that heterodimer formation between Emc and Da may compete with heterodimer formation between Da and Ato/Ac-Sc and that this competition to a significant degree determines Emc levels and thus potentially neurogenic regions in the fly PNS.</p><p>While the idea of a critical role for post-translational regulation of key proteins in neurogenesis, in this case that of ID proteins, is very interesting and consistent with a growing body of evidence supporting this notion, this study does not provide sufficient evidence for the mechanisms of such regulation and its impact on neurogenesis. Much more work is needed to consolidate the findings, extend them to a level that allows the extraction of a model and understand their consequences for cell fate transitions in the nervous system.</p><p>1) The genetic evidence presented is largely consistent with the model, but not entirely. On page 8 it is stated that the evidence in Figure 2 argues against homeostatic feedback regulation because &quot;In the background wild type for emc (i.e. emc+/+), cells with two copies of the wild type da gene had almost twice as much Da protein as cells with only one copy (Figure 2M)&quot;. Looking at Figure 2M, this is clearly not the case. The levels of Da protein are far less than double. In contrast in emc-/- cells the levels of Da are more than double the gene dosage. This, in fact, is precisely consistent with homeostatic feedback. On the same page, it is stated, correctly, that Da levels are indistinguishable between emc-/+ and emc+/+. Again, this seems precisely what one would predict from homeostasis: that it buffers against minor changes in the dosage of the regulator.</p><p>Thus, the very notion the study start with discounting seems to be supported by, rather than contradicted by, this particular set of data.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 1 complained that Figure 2M (now Figure 2E in the revised submission) shows that the da+/+ genotype encodes less than twice the amount of Da protein as the da(+/-) genotype, supporting the idea of feedback regulation of Da levels rather than discrediting it.</p><p>There are multiple responses to this criticism.</p><p>The First is that although the reviewer is correct about the relative values of these particular two datapoints, their conclusion is not supported by the rest of the quantification in this and related Figures. We have now measured the relative levels of Da protein in da[+/+] versus da[+/-] cells in 4 independent experiments in the emc[+/+] genotype (Figure 2E, Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, and twice in Figure 2G) as well as once in the emc[+/-] genotype (in Figure 2E). In all the other cases the Da protein level was clearly doubled by doubled Da gene dose. In addition, 3x and 4x Da gene dose has now been added (Figure 2G) and also look linear. In addition, it is not the level for da[+/+] in Figure 2E that was unexpectedly low, it is that the level for da[+/-] was anomalously high. Although the da[+/-] emc[+/+] datapoint in Figure 2E is a little higher than in the other da[+/-] examples, it is not statistically different from them. The same graph shows that the Da level in da[+/ +] is identical to the Da level in da[+/+] emc[+/-]. In fact, we suspect the reviewer might have missed the latter datapoint because it is partially covered by the former and have changed the format of the graphs to help make this clearer. These da[+/+] genotypes also have indistinguishable Emc protein levels (Figure 1F) so how can the identical Da levels be evidence for feedback? It is unfortunate that the First graph of Da protein levels encountered is this one that contains an outlier, and we experimented with different orders of presentation, or moving Supplemental figures into the main Figure, but it is just more logical for the argument to present Figure 2E First, so we have kept the order of presentation and added a comment to the Figure legend.</p><p>The second response is to emphasize that while these gene dose experiments certainly generated our hypothesis, this was then tested in a very stringent assay when we over-expressed Emc without seeing any diminution in Da levels in nonproneural cells (Figures 2H,I). This lack of effect of even very high Emc levels is inconsistent with the notion of continuous transcriptional feedback that maintains constant Da levels (please see subsection “Da and Emc protein levels are proportional to da gene dose”).</p><p> <italic>2) Aside from measuring steady state protein levels in S2 cells, the paper lacks biochemical evidence for the model, particularly for competition between Emc and Proneural Proteins for forming heterodimers with Da. More biochemical and and genetic evidence is needed to demonstrate this model. For example, there are no</italic> in vitro <italic>competition experiments performed. Another example: the difference in the effect of the two Ato alleles (Ato1 vs Ato3) is intriguing and an important piece of data. It is consistent with the idea that the bHLH domain in needed as opposed to the transcriptional activity, but Ato3 lacks much more than the bHLH domain. A more careful dissection is needed.</italic> </p><p>We acknowledge that we have not directly shown that Emc and proneural proteins compete for Da in vitro. Such an experiment is not trivial to do with EMSA assays. Because neither Emc/Da nor Emc/Ato heterodimers would bind DNA, only Ato/Da heterodimers could be quantified directly. Because Ato does not bind DNA except as a Ato/Da heterodimer, whether Emc disrupts DNA binding through interaction with Ato or with Da would have to be inferred indirectly. Our lab is considering measuring the interactions directly by biophysical means e.g. analytical ultracentrifugation, but these experiments will be more time-consuming. We also have to take account of what projects can gain funding. Because the significance of directly measuring the affinities of various HLH proteins is not yet generally apparent (perhaps because our work is still unpublished), at present it is a common opinion among grant reviewers that such experiments represent an incremental increase in knowledge of little practical significance. In this regard we state that in vitro data like that suggested by the reviewer would provide further support to our model (Discussion section). We suggest that our paper should stimulate more interest in these questions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There is clear evidence in the paper for a complex set of regulatory interactions, because over expression of Ato has no effect on Emc levels and because there is clearly some level of transcriptional control. The paper however provides no data to explain these effects, and how both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms interact to ensure the precision of the Emc pattern.</p></disp-quote><p>It is clear from several reviewers’ comments that data on the transcriptional regulation of Emc was complicating while adding little to the manuscript and we have removed most of this data.

Earlier studies have indicated that Emc provides a pre-pattern that is decoded by Da to direct the pattern of proneural gene expression. The proposed decoding mechanism involved positive regulation of proneural factors by Da, titration (inhibition) of Da by Emc and Da auto-regulation. The data presented here challenges this view.</p><p>First, the authors nicely show that the physiological levels of Emc proteins are set by the level of Da proteins (Figure 2; this effect does not seem to be mediated by a transcriptional regulation of emc by Da, Figure 7) and that Emc is stabilized by Da in S2 cells (Figure 3). They further show that the presence of a mutant/inactive Ato protein is sufficient to up-regulate Da, possibly via a stabilization mechanism (not further investigated here), and to down-regulate Emc (Figure 4). How Ato down-regulates Emc remains, however, unclear. Based on the findings reported in Figure 2 and Figure 3, a possible mechanism would be a competition for the binding of Da, resulting in the destabilization of free Emc. However, since ectopic Ato (or Sc) is not sufficient to down-regulate Emc (Figure 5), this mechanism is not favored. Another possibility would be that Ato (or Sc) represses the transcription of the emc gene. However, Ato is not required to repress emc transcription in the morphogenetic furrow.

Also, the functional significance of this down-regulation for proneural patterning is not clear (more generally, whether the patterned expression of emc is relevant for its function remains to be addressed; see below). Finally, the authors suggest that Da is required to activate (or at least maintain) emc gene expression, but only in a region close to/ahead of the furrow in the eye disc (Figure 7; emc is then repressed in the furrow; and Da does not seem to be required in wings).</p><p>In summary, this manuscript reports one interesting finding, i.e. Da stabilizes Emc and sets Emc protein levels.

We think our Findings apply in all three developmental contexts, but macrochaetae differ in that Emc and Da levels are modulated only in SOP cells, not in the proneural groups, at least at the stages we have examined. Troost et al. have described lower Emc in notum proneural regions but we describe this differently (subsection “AS-C is required for altering Da and Emc levels in wing disc proneural regions”, Figure 5B-D). Unlike the morphogenetic furrow or wing margin, where Emc protein virtually disappears, Emc levels in notum proneural regions seem the same as those in non-neural regions of the wing disc or eye disc. When Troost et al. describe them as ‘lower’ they appear to mean lower than certain other regions of the notum where Emc levels are in fact unusually high.

Therefore, its high accumulation in non-proneural regions is not solely because of saturation of the degradation machinery, since the latter seems to work better in the furrow.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the dependence of Emc on Da breaks down above a certain threshold and discuss this in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) The language needs to be improved. There are many places where the text is hard to follow and the meaning difficult to extract. Probably, with a thorough rewriting, the scientific points (a-c) above will also become clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the previous manuscript was not as clear as desirable and believe</p><p>the revised manuscript is improved significantly.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The revised manuscript is much improved, especially as it is more focused on the main message. The new experiment showing that uniform moderate levels of EMC driven by an exogenous promoter rescue neurogenesis certainly support the conclusion that post-transcriptional modulation of EMC is key to patterning neurogenesis. The new data showing that Da protein levels increase linearly with gene dosage are more convincing. Finally, the in vivo data showing that availability of Da regulates EMC protein levels are very nice.</p><p>What remains rather circumstantially substantiated in my view is their mechanistic model of the regulation of EMC protein levels by Proneural proteins by competition for Da. I agree with the authors that the few data they have in this regard do not contradict this notion, and I in fact like the idea mostly because it fits the strong response of EMC to Da levels within the proneural domain under wild type conditions. I am surprised that they were unable to express Atonal in S2 cells to test their model more directly because expression of Ato in vitro has been reported previously.</p></disp-quote><p>A citation to the prior expression of Atonal in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells would be most helpful, as we have yet to find such a report</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The idea that the proneural pre-pattern depends on Da and Proneural proteins, not ID proteins is novel and interesting. Furthermore, it fits nicely with the emerging paradigm that post-transcriptional/translational modification of bHLH proteins is a key determinant of neurogenesis. The authors could do a better job referencing that literature in their Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We added a sentence about post-translational modification of proneural proteins and a reference to an upcoming review (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, the authors' model is the simplest and most parsimonious explanation of their data, but their advance of a specific mechanism for their observations remains relatively weak.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This paper challenges the commonly held view that the ID factor Emc acts as a prepattern regulator of proneural activity during neurogenesis in Drosophila. Emc is known to heterodimerize with the E protein Da, thereby blocking its DNA-binding activity, hence its ability to regulate proneural gene expression. This paper reports on an alternative model whereby Da would stabilize Emc in the absence of proneural factor and proneural factors, patterned independently of Emc activity, would negatively regulate this stabilizing activity of Da towards Emc to generate the observed pattern of Emc protein accumulation.</p><p>Several interesting observations support this model. First, in contexts of low proneural activity (S2 cells, wing pouch), the accumulation levels of Emc proteins appear to depend on Da levels. The analysis of Emc and Da levels in da, emc clones is really nice (Figure 2) and the stabilization of Emc by Da in S2 cells is clear (Figure 3).</p><p>Second, in the proneural region of the eye, Ato is required for the accumulation of Da and the down-regulation of Emc in neural cells (Figure 4). The analysis of the ato1 and ato3 mutations is convincing. The observation that Emc is stabilized in the absence of Ato (Figure 4D and Figure 6) is interesting. However, how Ato destabilizes Emc is not understood: Ato does not appear to be sufficient to destabilize Emc (Figure 7). It is also not clear whether Ato acts indirectly via Da.</p><p>Third, non-patterned expression of the emc gene largely rescues the emc mutant phenotype (Figure 8), indicating that Emc transcription does not provide key patterning cues.</p><p>In summary, the strength of this paper is that it convincingly shows that the current model needs to be revised. Further experiments are, however, needed to strengthen the alternative model proposed here.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It would be nice to confirm the changes seen in Da levels by IF using Western blots, for instance by comparing Da levels in emc+/+ vs emc+/- discs (and Emc in da+/+ vs da+/- tissues). Please test.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to measure Da levels by western blot using a monoclonal antibody and to measure Emc levels using anti-GFP labeling of the Emc-YFP strain. Unfortunately, we were unable to detect endogenous levels of either protein by western blotting and so could not perform these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2E: it is not clear whether the increased Da levels seen in emc mutant cells result from protein stabilization (indicative of Emc targeting Da for degradation, as suggested by Figure 3F) or from increased transcription (due for instance to ectopic/premature expression of proneural factors). Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We also think this is an interesting question and have been trying to assess experimentally whether Da is primarily restrained at the transcriptional level, as suggested previously (Bhattacharya and Baker, 2011), or at the level of protein stability, as Figure 3F suggests might be possible. So far, we do not have a uniform conclusion. We added a sentence to the paper raising the possibility that Da stability might be relevant to levels in vivo (subsection “Emc is stabilized by Da in S2 cells”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3G: please control that nub&gt;da does not affect emc gene expression (in situ, enhancer-trap…)</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown previously that ectopic Da expression in fact does elevate <italic>emc</italic> transcription (Bhattacharya et al., 2011, Figure 2C). Another reviewer previously asked us now to show that ectopic Da also leads to more Emc protein, consistent with our current model, and that is why we added Figure 3G to the manuscript. We could also remove Figure 3G again if preferred, but since it was requested by a previous reviewer we added to the figure legend that higher <italic>emc</italic> transcription is expected in this experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “Ato is required for altering Da and Emc levels in the morphogenetic furrow”. The conclusion that Da up-regulation is transcriptional and bHLH-mediated needs to be supported by experimental evidence. Could the authors exclude the possibility that Emc also targets Da for degradation (see Figure 3F)?</p></disp-quote><p>The experimental data do not lead to a uniform conclusion at present (see point 2 above). Therefore, we changed the text in subsection “Ato is required for altering Da and Emc levels in the morphogenetic furrow” to include both possibilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “AS-C is required for altering Da and Emc levels in wing disc proneural regions”: This conclusion is not convincing. I find it hard to compare Da levels based on different IF experiments. Clonal analysis is required.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and this is why we based our definitive conclusions on clonal analysis with a complete deletion of AS-C in Figures 4H,I. We only included sc[10-1] because a reviewer of the previous manuscript asked that we explore the conclusions published by other groups regarding notum patterning in light of our findings. Since those other studies have used the viable sc[10-1] allele, we also included it here for comparison. We could not find any sc[10-1] FRT strain available, and although one should be easy to generate we could not have done so and performed the clonal analysis within two months. We could remove this sc[10-1] data, but in our opinion it might as well be included. We modified the Results section to indicate that a clonal analysis with sc[10-1] could provide stronger results (subsection “AS-C is required for altering Da and Emc levels in wing disc proneural regions”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “AS-C is required for altering Da and Emc levels in wing disc proneural regions”: Whether AS-C regulates Emc/Da levels in sensory cells is difficult to study in the absence of these cells. The data shown in Figure 5B-D are not convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>The cells are present, but not specified as sensory cells. As such there are no markers that could identify them for double labeling, so this cannot be further clarified experimentally. We agree that the failure to find single cells with lower Emc could be equivocal, but we do think it is more significant that we cannot find the single cells with higher Da. Figure 5D shows that we can find these high Da/low Emc SOP cells in the wild type. We changed the text of the Results and Discussion sections to make the uncertainties clear (subsection “AS-C is required for altering Da and Emc levels in wing disc proneural”, Discussion section). This is another example where we only present data on the notum in response to the previous reviewer that requested this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 7B: heterogenous levels of Ato appear to be detected in the non-proneural region (Figure 7B). Therefore, a per-cell quantification of the relative Emc/Da levels is needed (Figure 7A). It would be nice to test whether Ato levels correlate with Emc/Da levels. Also, what is causing the observed heterogeneity in Ato levels?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a per-cell analysis as requested. The data are shown in Figure 7 panels C and D and Figure 7—figure supplement 1C and 1D and described in subsection “Proneural genes are not sufficient to regulate Da or Emc protein levels.”). We saw no evidence that Emc levels were lower in the scattered cells with higher Ato levels. We did see a weak trend towards more Da in high Ato-cells, which is consistent with the slightly higher Da levels already noted in cells expressing ectopic Ato (Figure 7A and Figure 7—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>The cause of the heterogenous Ato levels is a mystery at present.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 7—figure supplement 1A: the clone of act&gt;ato cells (right) exhibits high Emc and high Da levels. This seems to contradict the model whereby Ato competes Emc for binding Da. Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is part of the data for suggesting that Ato is not sufficient to degrade Emc at ectopic locations (subsection “Proneural genes are not sufficient to regulate Da or Emc protein levels.”). Since ectopic Ato expression in wing discs significantly alters wing disc development, perhaps some effects on Emc and Da levels could be indirect. Overall, however, the data do not clearly support the notion that Ato leads to Emc degradation at ectopic locations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 8: what is the phenotype of emcD1/emcAP6 flies? are these mRNA null? what is the emc mRNA pattern in the mutant and rescued eye discs? Is the latter similar to the protein pattern shown in 8C? does the UAS-ems construct contain the 3'UTR of the emc gene? Does it matter? Also, is the emc mutant combination used in Figure 8 protein null?</p></disp-quote><p>We added brief description of the emc<sup>∆1</sup> allele and the emc<sup>AP6</sup>/emc<sup>∆1</sup> genotype (subsection “Uniform Emc transcription supports neural patterning”; subsection “<italic>Drosophila</italic> Strains”). emc<sup>∆1</sup> is an early frame-shift allele and protein null, one of two such alleles we generated by Crispr. We will describe these alleles in detail elsewhere, we do not believe it is of sufficient interest to do so here. We used the transheterozygous emc<sup>AP6</sup>/emc<sup>∆1</sup> genotype for the rescue experiments to exclude the possibility of linked mutations on the extant <italic>emc<sup>AP6</sup></italic> chromosome. We did not sequence the UAS-emc5.3 construct. This was described by Baonza et al., (2000) as “a full-length <italic>emc</italic> cDNA” so it might include endogenous 3’ UTR that could encode post-transcriptional regulation eg by miRNAs. Therefore we are careful to refer only to uniform transcription in this experiment, although please note that the antibody stainings included in this paper show uniform protein expression in the relevant areas after uniform transcription.</p></body></sub-article></article>
