socio-economic and health impacts. We sequenced nuclear genomes of <italic>Chromera velia</italic> and <italic>Vitrella brassicaformis</italic>, free-living non-parasitic photosynthetic algae closely related to apicomplexans. Proteins from key metabolic pathways and from the endomembrane trafficking systems associated with a free-living lifestyle have been progressively and non-randomly lost during adaptation to parasitism. The free-living ancestor contained a broad repertoire of genes many of which were repurposed for parasitic processes, such as extracellular proteins, components of a motility apparatus, and DNA- and RNA-binding protein families. Based on transcriptome analyses across 36 environmental conditions, <italic>Chromera</italic> orthologs of apicomplexan invasion-related motility genes were co-regulated with genes encoding the flagellar apparatus, supporting the functional contribution of flagella to the evolution of invasion machinery. This study provides insights into how obligate parasites with diverse life strategies arose from a once free-living phototrophic marine alga.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06974.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06974.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06974.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Single-celled parasites cause many severe diseases in humans and animals. The apicomplexans form probably the most successful group of these parasites and include the parasites that cause malaria. Apicomplexans infect a broad range of hosts, including humans, reptiles, birds, and insects, and often have complicated life cycles. For example, the malaria-causing parasites spread by moving from humans to female mosquitoes and then back to humans.</p><p>Despite significant differences amongst apicomplexans, these single-celled parasites also share a number of features that are not seen in other living species. How and when these features arose remains unclear. It is known from previous work that apicomplexans are closely related to single-celled algae. But unlike apicomplexans, which depend on a host animal to survive, these algae live freely in their environment, often in close association with corals.</p><p>Woo et al. have now sequenced the genomes of two photosynthetic algae that are thought to be close living relatives of the apicomplexans. These genomes were then compared to each other and to the genomes of other algae and apicomplexans. These comparisons reconfirmed that the two algae that were studied were close relatives of the apicomplexans.</p><p>Further analyses suggested that thousands of genes were lost as an ancient free-living algae evolved into the apicomplexan ancestor, and further losses occurred as these early parasites evolved into modern species. The lost genes were typically those that are important for free-living organisms, but are either a hindrance to, or not needed in, a parasitic lifestyle. Some of the ancestor's genes, especially those that coded for the building blocks of flagella (structures which free-living algae use to move around), were repurposed in ways that helped the apicomplexans to invade their hosts. Understanding this repurposing process in greater detail will help to identify key molecules in these deadly parasites that could be targeted by drug treatments. It will also offer answers to one of the most fascinating questions in evolutionary biology: how parasites have evolved from free-living organisms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

We note five key nodes on the evolutionary paths to present-day apicomplexans: the alveolate ancestor; the common ancestor of <italic>Apicomplexa</italic> and chromerids, termed the proto-apicomplexan ancestor; the apicomplexan ancestor; the ancestor of apicomplexan lineages, for example, coccidia and hematozoa; and extant apicomplexans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Protein-coding genes from the 26 species were clustered by OrthoMCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Li et al., 2003</xref>) into groups of homologous genes, hereafter defined as orthogroups. We note that an orthogroup could have homologous genes from different species (putative orthologs) or from the same species (putative paralogs arising from gene duplications). Gains or losses of orthogroups are displayed as green or red sections of a pie on the phylogenetic tree in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Divergence of the proto-apicomplexan ancestor from the alveolate ancestor (Stage I) was accompanied by losses of 1668 and gains of 2197 orthogroups (sum of the two ‘pies’ in Stage I). Transition of the free-living proto-apicomplexan ancestor to the apicomplexan ancestor (Stage II) is accompanied by many gene losses (3862 orthogroups) but few gains (81 orthogroups) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Divergence of coccidians, for example, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, from the apicomplexan ancestor (Stage III) is characterized by modest changes (537 losses; 414 gains), whereas divergence of hematozoans, for example, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp., is marked by drastic losses (1384 losses; 77 gains) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Further divergence of apicomplexan taxa beyond Stage III is characterized by modest, lineage-specific gains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Functional composition of gained genes at various stages will be discussed in later sections. Paucity of gained genes (81 orthogroups) during Stage II indicates that the genome of the free-living ancestor possessed most of the genes that were present in the common ancestor of apicomplexans and survived in their present-day descendants.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06974.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Gene content changes during apicomplexan evolution.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Gains and losses of orthogroups inferred based on Dollo parsimony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Csuros, 2010</xref>).

We sought to characterize in detail the dynamics of gene loss across apicomplexan evolution, particularly for components of molecular processes that are hallmarks of free-living lifestyle. We performed a systematic analysis of the cellular components involved in: (1) cellular metabolic pathways; (2) the endomembrane trafficking systems, regulating the movement of molecules across intracellular compartments in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Leung et al., 2008</xref>); and (3) the flagellum, a highly conserved apparatus for motility in aqueous environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib176">Silflow and Lefebvre, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The inferred proto-apicomplexan ancestor, like present-day chromerids, possessed complete metabolic pathways for sugar metabolism, assimilation of nitrate and sulfite, and photosynthesis-related functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">Appendix 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Unlike in other photosynthetic algae, both <italic>Chromera</italic> and <italic>Vitrella</italic> initiate heme synthesis in the mitochondrion using aminolevulinate synthase (C4 pathway), which thus far has been found only in a few eukaryotic heterotrophs, such as <italic>Euglena gracilis</italic>, dinoflagellates, and apicomplexans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Kořený et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib200">van Dooren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Danne et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">Appendix 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Both chromerids and apicomplexans encode modular multi-domain fatty acid synthase I (FASI)/polyketide synthase enzymes and single-domain FASII components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).

This was previously demonstrated in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, an apicomplexan that possesses both FASI and FASII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Mazumdar and Striepen, 2007</xref>). Likely, the proto-apicomplexan ancestor was a phototrophic alga harboring characteristic metabolic features previously found only in apicomplexan parasites, especially with regard to plastid-associated metabolic functions (see above and other examples in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">Appendix 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Kořený et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib200">van Dooren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Danne et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Transition to an apicomplexan ancestor (Stage II) was accompanied by the loss of metabolic processes including photosynthesis and sterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The apicomplexan ancestor appeared to possess a significant complement of enzymes in various pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Lim and McFadden, 2010</xref>). The differentiation of apicomplexan lineages (Stage III) was accompanied by further lineage-specific losses: for example, loss of FASI in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp, loss of FASII in <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp., which has also lost the apicoplast, and loss of enzymes mediating polyamine biosynthesis in all lineages except <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). These support the notion that enzymes involved in cellular metabolism critical for free-living organisms were not completely lost during the transition to the apicomplexan ancestor, but were further lost during subsequent differentiation and host-adaptation of apicomplexan lineages.</p><p>The proto-apicomplexan had a nearly complete repertoire of the endomembrane trafficking complexes, and much of this repertoire persisted through to the apicomplexan ancestor (Stage II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Hager et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Klinger et al., 2013a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3">Appendix 3</xref>). Differentiation of apicomplexan lineages (Stage III) was accompanied by lineage-specific losses, for example, loss of the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport II (ESCRTII) in all lineages except in piroplasms, whereas some components were retained across all lineages, such as the retromer complex components and clathrin, both systems implicated in invasion processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Pieperhoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib195">Tomavo et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3">Appendix 3</xref>).

Some of these components that were present in chromerids were absent in specific apicomplexan lineages as well as in dinoflagellates and ciliates, further clarifying that these losses are independent, lineage-specific events rather than ancient, shared events.</p><p>All known components of flagella were present in the proto-apicomplexan ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A,B</xref>). Most of the components were retained in the apicomplexan ancestor (Stage II), but losses occurred as apicomplexan lineages differentiated (Stage III). Components of intraflagellar transport, which are typically essential for assembling flagella, were lost in the other lineages except in coccidians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A,B</xref>). The basal body proteins, which support an organizing center for microtubules, were lost from piroplasms. Some striated fiber assemblin (SFA) proteins, typically associated with basal body rootlets, were maintained in all apicomplexan lineages including piroplasms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A,B,D</xref>); their presence has been hailed as evidence that some flagellar-proteins are repurposed for new functions in apicomplexans (see below) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Francia et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In summary, one of the major events during apicomplexan evolution is progressive, continued loss of components important for free-living organisms. While Stage II was accompanied by a massive loss of such components including those implicated in photosynthesis, the apicomplexan ancestor still possessed many proteins, which were lost later during differentiation of lineages with diverse life strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Emergent features of apicomplexans</title><p>Evolution of present-day apicomplexan parasites was accompanied not only by gene losses as noted above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) but also by gene gains.

For <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and <italic>T. gondii</italic>, we compiled three classes of protein-coding genes directly or indirectly involved in parasitic processes of apicomplexans based on in silico prediction or information from previous functional studies (‘Materials and methods’).

Stage II was accompanied by over-represented gains of various cytoskeletal components, including alveolins, those of the actomyosin complex (e.g., myosins) and glideosome-associated proteins with multiple membrane spans 1 and 3 (GAPM1 and GAPM3), suggesting that the molecular machinery powering gliding motility, which is essential for host cell invasion arose during evolution to apicomplexans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Frenal et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app4">Appendix 4</xref>). Gene gains during Stage I were over-represented by proteins with ‘RBD abundant in Apicomplexans’ (RAP, Pfam: PF08373) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Lee and Hong, 2004</xref>), many of which were conserved as one-to-one orthologs across descending lineages, suggesting development of evolutionarily conserved functions before apicomplexans and chromerids diverged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Chromerid genomes encode many orthologs of apicomplexan cytoskeletal proteins (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app4">Appendix 4</xref>), including GAPM2, a member of an important protein family for apicomplexan cytoskeletal structure and gliding motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Bullen et al., 2009</xref>), and the IMC sub-compartment protein family (ISP), implicated in establishing apical polarity and coordinating the unique cell cycle of apicomplexans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Poulin et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5E</xref>). These data suggest that some components existed in the free-living proto-apicomplexan ancestor and were subsequently repurposed for parasitic processes of apicomplexans.</p><p>The <italic>Chromera</italic> and <italic>Vitrella</italic> genomes encode many proteins that are specific to chromerids yet contain functional domains implicated in molecular processes of apicomplexan parasites. For example, there are chromerid-specific proteins with domain architectures similar to those in apicomplexan extracellular proteins, including those previously implicated in host interactions and described in apicomplexans only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app5">Appendix 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Presence of such chromerid proteins implies some commonality in extracellular recognition and cross-species interactions and this correlates well with the presumed associations with the coral holobiont (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Janouškovec et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Cumbo et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, chromerid genomes encode numerous apiAP2 proteins, more abundant than dinoflagellates, suggesting that they have expanded in the proto-apicomplexan ancestor after it split from dinoflagellates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Many of the chromerid apiAP2 proteins belong to putative paralogous clusters, suggesting that their expansion was driven by gene duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="app" rid="app6">Appendix 6</xref>). Only a small subset of the apiAP2 proteins are shared across apicomplexans, suggesting that the large apiAP2 complement in the proto-apicomplexan ancestor has diversified independently in descending lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>In summary, genes encoding critical components of the parasitic lifestyle of apicomplexans were gained at different stages of apicomplexan evolution, some implying subsequent specialization to particular host niches, but others suggesting early adaptations before committing to parasitic lifestyle. This is evident by chromerid orthologs of many such proteins, for example, RAP proteins and specialized cytoskeletal components. Further, chromerid genomes encode chromerid-specific proteins that are not detected as orthologs of apicomplexan proteins but still have functional domains implicated in parasitic processes in apicomplexans. Together, these data imply that a molecular transition had occurred in free-living ancestors of apicomplexans, providing a foundation for host–parasite interactions and further adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Conserved gene expression programs in the proto-apicomplexan ancestor</title><p><italic>Chromera</italic> and <italic>Vitrella</italic> genomes allowed us to reconstruct the gene content of the free-living ancestor of apicomplexans. To infer their putative functions using genome-wide gene expression information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Hu et al., 2010</xref>), we cultured <italic>Chromera</italic> under 36 different combinations of temperatures, iron and salt concentrations, and generated their gene expression profiles by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Box et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, we have obtained a publicly available growth perturbation data set for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Hu et al., 2010</xref>).

Such an orthogroup pair, that is, those with conserved co-expression between the two species, would include candidate genes that have been co-regulated together during apicomplexan evolution, from the free-living ancestor to present-day parasites due to conserved functions. This approach, successfully utilized by several studies in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib187">Stuart et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Mutwil et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Gerstein et al., 2014</xref>), led to the following two observations in this study.</p><p>Many RAP genes appeared during Stage I and have been conserved across the descending phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), but their precise cellular roles are unknown. For 11 out of 12 orthogroups with RAP domains, co-expressed orthogroups overlapped significantly (Fisher's exact test, p &lt; 0.05) between <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>Chromera</italic>, suggesting involvement of RAP proteins in cellular processes evolutionarily conserved across apicomplexans and chromerids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

We have randomly chosen three <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> RAP genes with predicted mitochondrial localization signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15-data">Supplementary file 6</xref>) and confirmed experimentally by 3′ endogenous gene-tagging with reporter epitopes that all three are localized to the organelle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Some of the orthogroups co-expressed with orthogroups containing RAP domains encode protein products predicted to be metabolic enzymes, implying possible involvement of RAPs in mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Consistent with this, the <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> lineage that has a highly reduced mitochondrion lacking both the genome and most canonical metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib207">Xu et al., 2004</xref>) is the only apicomplexan group to have also lost its RAP repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Loss of RAPs along with a set of mitochondrial functions in this lineage is consistent with a mitochondrial role for RAPs.

We identified several modules or groups of co-expressed orthogroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In one of the co-expression modules (numbered 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4E</xref>), 9 out of 10 orthogroups are co-expressed with a gene encoding SFA (Cvel_872), a key protein for organizing the basal bodies of the flagellar apparatus in algae and the apical complexes in apicomplexans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Kawase et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Francia et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We note that SFAs are the only flagellar components found in all apicomplexans tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A</xref>).

This module include various types of genes implicated in host cell invasion processes of apicomplexans such as genes encoding rhoptry protein ROP9, apical sushi protein ASP, and gliding motility components GAP40 and GAPM2. The apical complex has been postulated to have emerged from the flagellar apparatus and associated cellular transport systems in free-living algae, based on ultrastructural evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Okamoto and Keeling, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Portman et al., 2014</xref>). These results suggest that, in the free-living ancestor, some of the genes implicated in the invasion process of present-day apicomplexans were functionally associated with those implicated in flagellar motility, providing the much-needed genetic evidence for the postulate. We speculate that a group of functionally related proteins associated with the flagellar apparatus was repurposed as a module of the apical complex and became a foundation for the invasion machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Analysis of <italic>Chromera</italic> and <italic>Vitrella</italic> genomes has enabled insights into how apicomplexan parasites have evolved from free-living ancestors.

The genome of free-living photosynthetic ancestors encodes many component proteins previously assumed to be restricted to the parasitic apicomplexan lineages. Such pre-existing components, including those of what would later become part of the invasion machinery, were co-opted during evolution to facilitate a successful parasitic lifestyle in multiple hosts.

After scaffolding, gapfiller and IMAGE were run as above, followed by ICORN. The 1725 scaffolds (spanning 16.02 Mb) representing bacterial contamination were removed.

Statistical threshold defined by the Pfam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Finn et al., 2014</xref>) database was used. We aligned AP2 sequences in apicomplexan species based on PfamA AP2 (PF00847), and built apicomplexan-specific AP2 (apiAP2) hidden Markov model (HMM), and scanned the predicted protein-coding genes for apiAP2 domains; we annotated api-AP2 DNA-binding transcription factor genes with both domain and sequence E values to be less than 10<sup>−3</sup>.

Some putative parasite genes were inferred based on orthology by OrthoMCL clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Li et al., 2003</xref>) with closely related species with results from functional studies. We performed exhaustive literature searches to manually curate individual genes, to define rules for in silico searches across the proteomes of this study, and to categorize the identified genes based on their localization and function. The categories of parasite genes are defined as follows.</p><sec id="s3-5-1"><title>Cytoskeleton</title><p>The cytoskeleton of an organism provides the necessary structural framework for the maintenance of cell shape and integrity. We compiled two groups of cytoskeletal proteins, IMC associated proteins and actomyosin complex. First, IMC associated proteins, comprises alveolin proteins, a membrane occupation and recognition nexus protein (MORN), which associate with IMC and spindle poles and are indispensible for asexual and sexual development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ferguson et al., 2008</xref>). IMC sub-compartment proteins (ISPs) are critical for establishing apical polarity in the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Poulin et al., 2013</xref>). Second, components of actomyosin motor complex, which powers the characteristic gliding motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib181">Soldati-Favre, 2008</xref>), comprises actin, myosin, tubulin, gliding associated proteins (GAPs), aldolase, and various actin-regulatory proteins, which will assist actin in the process of quick polymerization–depolymerization cycles between F-actin and G-actin during this process. Examples of actin-regulatory proteins are Arp2/3 complex and formins (FH2) for nucleation; F-actin capping for filament regulation; coronin for cross-linking/bundling and profilin, CAP, cofilin/ADF and gelsolin for monomer treadmilling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Baum et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5-2"><title>Extracellular proteins</title><p>Extracellular proteins are defined as parasite proteins, which are localized either on the surface or secreted off the parasite. They are released in a concerted manner to ensure successful adhesion to the surface, entry into the host cell, multiplication, and escape. Extracellular proteins can be categorized as (1) ‘exportome’ are proteins translocated to the host cytoplasm, membranes, and nucleus crossing the boundary membrane parasitophorous vacuole (PV); and (2) ‘others’, which stay on the parasite surface or released from the parasite, but not into the host intracellular space. The exportome genes are released mostly from the parasite's secretary organelles such as rhoptries and dense granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Ravindran and Boothroyd, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib197">Treeck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Mundwiler-Pachlatko and Beck, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Bougdour et al., 2014</xref>). Some of these genes possess host targeting or also known as the Plasmodium export element (PEXEL). Many PEXEL-negative proteins have been identified too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Hsiao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Mundwiler-Pachlatko and Beck, 2013</xref>). These genes are sorted and targeted through a specialized structure known as Maurer's cleft formed in the host cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Mundwiler-Pachlatko and Beck, 2013</xref>). These genes are mostly kinases, proteases, and surface molecules, which modulate the host and hijack the host machinery in favor of parasitic growth and host immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib197">Treeck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Bougdour et al., 2014</xref>).

The overall pipeline comprises of two steps: de novo detection and classification. In the first step, the scaffolds are split into smaller batches (∼1000 batches of 200 kb each). These genomic fragments were aligned against each other to detect the HSPs (High-scoring pairs) using BLASTER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Quesneville et al., 2003</xref>). HSPs are then clustered using a combination of three methods such as GROUPER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Quesneville et al., 2003</xref>), RECON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bao and Eddy, 2002</xref>), and PILER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Edgar and Myers, 2005</xref>). Structure-based LTR retrotransposons (RTs) detection tools such as LTRharvest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ellinghaus et al., 2008</xref>) and LTR finder, which are based on 100–1000 bp long terminal repeats with a 1 kb–15 kb separation and target site duplication site at vicinity of 60 bp to the two terminal repeats. These LTRs detected are clustered using BlastClust. Multiple sequence alignment of each cluster was performed using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004). Each cluster aligned was searched against Repbase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Jurka et al., 2005</xref>) using BLASTER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Quesneville et al., 2003</xref>) and HMMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>). A consensus feature was detected for each aligned cluster. Further PASTEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Flutre et al., 2011</xref>), which is based on the Wicker classification, was used for consensus classification.</p><p>The repeats were annotated as follows. The genomic chunks were randomized and HSPs were detected using BLASTER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Quesneville et al., 2003</xref>), CENSOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Jurka et al., 1996</xref>), and RepeatMasker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib191">Tempel, 2012</xref>). These HSPs were filtered and combined. Again, full-length genomic scaffolds were compared to Repbase using MATCHER. Satellite and simple repeats were detected using the mreps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Kolpakov et al., 2003</xref>), TRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Benson, 1999</xref>), RMSSR (RepeatMasker). Finally, a long-join procedure was followed to combine the nested repeats. The whole annotation was exported to a genome-browser readable GFF3 file.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Clustering homologous genes</title><p>OrthoMCL 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Li et al., 2003</xref>) was used with a default inflation parameter (I = 1.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Chen et al., 2006</xref>) to generate groups of homologous genes (defined as orthogroups), which could have homologs from different species (putative orthologs) or from the same species (putative paralogs from gene duplications). For some genes of high interest, we manually inspected the alignments of the protein sequences within the orthogroup, which were done with MAFFT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>). We assigned Pfam domains to an orthogroup if more than half of the genes in an orthogroup were assigned the Pfam domains.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Sub-cellular localization prediction</title><p>There are several tools available for a general eukaryotic sub-cellular localization prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Du et al., 2011</xref>), but they are not applicable to alveolates due to its unique chloroplast membrane arising from secondary endosymbiosis. Therefore, HECTAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Gschloessl et al., 2008</xref>), which was developed for the bipartite sub-cellular prediction, was used. There is no stand-alone version of HECTAR, and the online version allows only one sequence at a time. We implemented a modified HECTAR algorithm as a PERL script for batch prediction of the whole proteomes. Each protein sequence was predicted for signal sequence using SignalP 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bendtsen et al., 2004</xref>), the signal sequence is cleaved, and the remaining amino acid sequence was used as input for the transit peptide prediction by TargetP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Emanuelsson et al., 2000</xref>). Sequences with both signal peptide and the transit peptide (either chloroplast or mitochondria) are predicted to be in the chloroplast. Sequences without the signal peptide but with the transit peptide (either chloroplast or mitochondria) are predicted to be in mitochondria. Sequences with signal peptide, without transit peptide, and predicted by TargetP to be secretory are classified as secretory proteins.</p><p>For the RAP proteins, we tested the validity of our sub-cellular localization prediction in two ways. First, we compared our in-house algorithm with other published tools: TargetP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Emanuelsson et al., 2000</xref>), MitoProt2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Claros and Vincens, 1996</xref>), iPSORT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bannai et al., 2002</xref>), and PredSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Petsalaki et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15-data">Supplementary file 6</xref>, only mitochondrial prediction is shown). We found that our mitochondrial prediction for RAP genes is in concordance with other methods. Second, we experimentally verified mitochondrial localization in <italic>T. gondii</italic> by 3′ tagging of the endogenous genes with the coding sequence for the hemagglutinin epitope for three RAP proteins that were predicted to target to mitochondria with high probability.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A statistical environment software R was used for most of the analyses and generating parts of figures. An R package <italic>vioplot</italic> was used to generate the violin plot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Hintze and Nelson, 1998</xref>).

Amino acid sequences were aligned using MAFFT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>), highly variable sites were edited by trimAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Capella-Gutierrez et al., 2009</xref>) and after manual inspection. The resulting alignment of 33,997 amino acid positions was used to construct trees by a maximum likelihood (ML) method and Bayesian inference. The ML tree was computed using RAxML 8.1.16 by gamma corrected LG4X model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib183">Stamatakis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Le et al., 2012</xref>). Robustness of the tree was estimated by bootstrap analysis in 1000 replicates. Bayesian tree was constructed by PhyloBayes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Lartillot and Philippe, 2004</xref>) using two-infinite mixture model CAT-GTR as implemented in PhyloBayes 3.3f. Two independent chains were run until they converged (i.e., maximum observed discrepancy was lower than 0.2), and the effective number of model parameters was at least 100 after the first 1/5 generation was omitted from topology and posterior probability inference. All clades in the tree were supported with posterior probability 1.00 and 100% bootstraps, except for one node, which representing the common ancestor of human <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. was supported by 99% bootstrap.</p><p>We performed the gene gain and loss analysis based on Dollo parsimony using Count software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Csuros, 2010</xref>). This approach allows reconstructing gene contents at observed species and at hypothetical ancestors, and gene gains and losses at branching points. The Dollo parsimony strictly prohibits multiple gains of genes. To test for validity of this assumption, we repeated analyses based on parsimony settings allowing multiple gene gains or on a phylogenetic birth-and-death model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Csuros, 2010</xref>) and reached the same conclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have also repeated the analysis using Wagner's parsimony, allowing multiple gains per tree with gain penalty of 2 or greater, and obtained similar results (data not shown). For the analysis of metabolic enzymes, endomembrane trafficking system components, and flagellar apparatus components, the ancestral presence was inferred based on Dollo parsimony from the presence of components in the observed species. For the endomembrane trafficking component analysis, we assumed that the last common ancestor had a complete repertoire of the components.</p><p>We have inferred the evolutionary age of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>T. gondii</italic> genes as the early node on the phylogenetic tree where the most distant species have genes with significant sequence homology (reciprocal BLASTP E value &lt;10<sup>−10</sup> and clustering with OrthoMCL).</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Comparison of gene expression network between <italic>Chromera velia</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic></title><p>We studied if orthologs of <italic>Chromera</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> show similar gene expression changes to physiologically equivalent growth conditions. Identifying equivalent conditions is difficult as the two species have completely different lifestyles and live in different environments. Instead, we tested if a given gene and its ortholog would show correlated expression patterns with the same set of genes (and orthologs), allowing a way to compare gene expression behavior measured under different conditions. To uncover gene-to-gene co-expression relationships, the organisms from whom transcriptomes are sampled must be exposed to various growth conditions. This approach has been successfully used in other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib187">Stuart et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Hu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Mutwil et al., 2011</xref>). For <italic>Chromera</italic>, we generated RNA-seq-based transcriptome under combinations of varying salt concentrations, iron concentrations, and temperature changes, resulting in 36 unique combinations (see ‘Materials and methods’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). For <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, we obtained previously published microarray-based gene expression data sets of 144 unique conditions from 23 time series, representing stresses from various growth-inhibiting compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Hu et al., 2010</xref>). It has been shown that gene expression data generated using different molecular platforms are reproducible and accurate enough for cross-platform comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib204">Woo et al., 2004</xref>). Based on each data set, we calculated Spearman correlation coefficients <italic>rho</italic> between all possible pairs from the 1918 orthogroups shared between <italic>Chromera</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (1918 × 1918 matrix). We also calculated a 1918 × 1918 weighted adjacency matrix using CLR algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Faith et al., 2007</xref>) as implemented in an R package <italic>minet</italic> (with parameters of method = ‘clr’, estimator = ‘mi.shrink’, and disc = ‘equalfreq’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Meyer et al., 2008</xref>). Expression level of multiple genes in a given orthogroup was averaged. To rule out any potential systematic biases associated with averaging expression levels of homologous, yet distinct genes, we repeated some of the analyses with 1560 orthogroups that have one-to-one orthologs between the two species and reached the same conclusions (data not shown). A pair of genes (or orthogroup) were determined as co-expressed if the Spearman's correlation coefficient <italic>rho</italic> is greater than 0.3 and if the value from the weighted adjacency matrix of the network is greater than 0.01. We calculated an odds-ratio to measure the extent of conservation of co-expressed genes: (# of genes co-expressed in both species) × (# of genes co-expressed in none of the species)/([# of genes co-expressed in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> only] × [# of genes co-expressed in <italic>C. velia</italic> only]), and Fisher's exact test was used to assess the statistical significance. For calculation of the odds-ratios, co-expression was determined based on correlation coefficient to minimize count granularity in the two-by-two table.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the KAUST Bioscience Core Laboratory personnel for sequencing specific Illumina libraries used in this project, KAUST Computational Bioscience Research Center for providing computing resources, Gordon Langsley (Institut Cochin, Inserm U1016, Paris) and Anthony Holder (The Francis Crick Institute, London) for comments on the manuscript draft.

characteristics.</title><p>The statistics of the genome assembly and annotation are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>. There was bacterial contamination in 20% and 80% of the sequence reads in <italic>Chromera</italic> and <italic>Vitrella</italic>, respectively. There was a high amount of low-complexity DNA sequence repeats and TEs in <italic>Chromera</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). By various bioinformatics methods (‘Materials and methods’), we generated assemblies containing 5953 and 1064 scaffolds for <italic>Chromera</italic> and <italic>Vitrella</italic>, respectively. The total number of predicted genes differed between <italic>Chromera</italic> and <italic>Vitrella</italic> primarily due to significant differences in TE gene content between the two chromerids but the number of expressed genes was similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>We examined how genomes of the chromerids and other species were organized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The median gene length is roughly the same between the two chromerids. The number of introns in a given gene was similar between the chromerids, although the size of introns was larger in <italic>Chromera</italic> than in <italic>Vitrella</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Compared to these chromerids, the number of introns in Apicomplexa was drastically less, raising the possibility that introns were compacted and reduced during apicomplexan evolution, which would need to be confirmed with further detailed investigation. For many genes (13,912 and 17,569 respectively for <italic>Chromera</italic> and <italic>Vitrella</italic>), we were able to assign 5′ and 3′ UTRs, using strand-specific transcriptome (RNA-seq) data sets. The distance between the protein-coding genes in <italic>Vitrella</italic> was short (median 92 base-pairs (bp)), indicating compactness of its genome. On the other hand, such distance was longer in <italic>Chromera</italic> (median 989 bp). Determining whether the common ancestor of chromerids had a compact genome or not would require analysis of genomes from more closely related species. There are three possible orientations by closely spaced neighboring genes can be clustered, that is, those with short intergenic spaces between the gene boundaries: tandem, head-to-head, or tail-to-tail. In both <italic>Chromera</italic> and <italic>Vitrella</italic> genomes, closely spaced (&lt;1000 bp) genes were in head-to-head orientation more often than expected by chance (data not shown). It was previously shown that many neighboring genes in head-to-head clusters showed correlated expressions across various conditions; however, most of the co-expressions were modest; instead, head-to-head clustering is a major mechanism for stabilizing transcription of genes in fundamental cellular processes rather than for co-regulating the two genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib205">Woo and Li, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib171">Russell et al., 2013</xref>). Head-to-head clustering probably provided evolutionary and regulatory stability to genes involved in fundamental cellular processes. Other related species had different gene orientations, for example, the dinoflagellate <italic>Symbiodinium microtinum</italic> has tandem clusters driven by tandem gene duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib175">Shoguchi et al., 2013</xref>). Given the dynamic nature of genome organization, we propose that different groups of species evolved different strategies for genome organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib205">Woo and Li, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Repetitive sequences constitute a significant proportion of eukaryotic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Fedoroff, 2012</xref>). Thus, they play a significant role in evolution of host genomes. Systematic TE clustering, classification, and annotation were performed on 1064 <italic>Vitrella</italic> scaffolds (72.7 Mb genome—72,700,666 bp) and 5953 <italic>Chromera</italic> scaffolds (193.6 Mb genome—193,664,168 bp) Chromera. In both species, Class I elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib191">Tempel, 2012</xref>) make up a larger proportion of the genome than Class II elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib191">Tempel, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The RT domain variation shows that <italic>Eimeria tenella</italic> TEs grouped separately and are not related to chromerid TEs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>), suggesting gains of TEs in <italic>E. tenella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib168">Reid et al., 2014</xref>) independently from chromerids. <italic>Vitrella</italic> forms a separate clade in the phylogenetic analysis of the RT domains.</p></sec></boxed-text></app><app id="app2"><title>Appendix 2</title><boxed-text><sec id="s7" sec-type="appendix"><title>Metabolism.</title><sec id="s7-1"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s7-1-1"><title>Reconstructing global metabolic map based on KEGG</title><p>Global metabolic pathways were mapped to KEGG metabolic pathways for the predicted protein-coding gene sets for the 26 species. KEGG ortholog (KO) assignments for the respective proteomes were made using the KO identification tools available on the KEGG website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.jp/tools/kaas">http://genome.jp/tools/kaas</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Moriya et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Kanehisa et al., 2014</xref>), and then the assigned KO numbers were used to identify and map metabolic pathways using the ‘Search and color pathway’ tool available on the KEGG site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.jp/kegg/tool/map_pathway2.html">http://genome.jp/kegg/tool/map_pathway2.html</ext-link>). The output of this mapping exercise was then manually inspected to compile the set of enzymes present in all major metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>As KEGG is very strict in mapping orthologs and assigning KO numbers (so as to minimize false positives), we found numerous pathway holes (missing enzymes), many of which were readily apparent as false negatives. In order to resolve this, we then resorted to identifying orthologs from OrthoMCL-DB for all the genomes compared here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Chen et al., 2006</xref>). The resulting ortholog assignments were then used to manually verify presence/absence of missing enzymes for filling pathway holes where possible. This curated data, based on both KEGG and OrthoMCL assignments, were used to generate the final mapping of enzymes to pathways, and using this info a metabolic pathway network was drawn to represent all major pathways involved in carbohydrate, energy, fatty acid, lipid, isoprene, steroid, amino acid, nucleotide, cofactor, polyamine, and redox metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Based on the enzymes mapped, we calculated the completeness of metabolic pathways by comparing the fraction of enzymes present for each pathway in each species. The complete set of enzymes mapped to each pathway (originally taken from KEGG and further curated to eliminate non-specific entries) is given in column B of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>. The fractional values were then color-coded and the resulting data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. In order to visualize the retention, loss or gain of higher level metabolic functions, the fraction of enzymes mapped to these pathways is indicated as a pie chart for hypothetical ancestors of selected apicomplexan groups and chromerids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We used presence of enzymes across the species and the phylogenetic relationship to infer presence of enzymes in the hypothetical ancestors based on Dollo parsimony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Csuros, 2010</xref>). Dollo parsimony is based on an assumption that it is unlikely that the same enzymes were gained multiple times independently in different lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s7-1-2"><title>Phylogeny of heme pathway enzymes, the urea pathway CPS and enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis.</title><p>Predicted proteins from <italic>Vitrella</italic> (Chromera heme pathway is already published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Kořený and Oborník, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Kořený et al., 2011</xref>]) were searched for enzymes involved in the synthesis of tetrapyrroles (aminolevulunuic acid [ALA] synthase, ALAS; ALA dehydratase, ALAD; Porphobilinogen deaminase, PBGD; Uroporphyrinogen synthase UROS; Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, UROD; Coproporphyrinogen oxidase, CPOX; Protoporphyrinogen oxidase, PPOX; and Ferrochelatase FeCH).

The column temperature was maintained at 30°C. The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive and negative ion detection modes at +4 kV and −4 kV with capillary temperature at 220°C. Nitrogen was employed as shielding and auxiliary gas for both polarities. Mass range of 140–1400 Da was scanned every 0.5 s to obtain the full scan ESI mass spectra of lipids. For investigation of the lipid molecules structures the collisionally induced decomposition multi-stage ion trap tandem mass spectra MS<sup>2</sup> in both polarity settings were simultaneously recorded with a 3 Da isolation window.

These organisms are also capable of assimilating both nitrate and sulfite and can generate energy from photosynthesis as well as mitochondrial respiration. A full complement of enzymes involved in sugar and sugar derivative metabolism, such as glycolysis, Kreb's cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, inositol mono- and poly-phosphate formation, polysaccharide formation, and amino- and nucleotide-sugar formation, is encoded by the chromerids. Chromerids are also capable of synthesizing sulfoquinovosyl-diacyl-glycerol lipids, which are found associated with the chloroplast in photosynthetic organisms. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> illustrates a complete representation of all major pathways mapped to chromerids in comparison to selected apicomplexan lineages.</p><p>Generally, <italic>Chromera</italic> and <italic>Vitrella</italic> have similar sets of metabolic enzymes.

Apicomplexans are non-photosynthetic and therefore lack all associated metabolic activities including photosynthetic carbon fixation. Interestingly, however, all plastid-bearing parasites have retained only the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR)/ferredoxin redox system of the photosynthetic electron transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Lim and McFadden, 2010</xref>). In photosynthetic organisms, this redox system mediates the transfer of electrons originating from water to NADP+, resulting in the formation of NADPH (cofactor for fatty acid biosynthesis and Calvin cycle), and it is likely that this role is conserved in chromerids. In apicomplexans, the source of electrons for generating reduced ferredoxin is not clear, but it is evident that reduced ferredoxin is required for generating reducing equivalents and is a cofactor for several plastid-associated enzymes, including those involved in isoprene synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Lim and McFadden, 2010</xref>). Other notable pathways missing in apicomplexans but present in the chromerids include the following: glyoxalate pathway; steroid biosynthesis; synthesis of aromatic and branched-chain amino acids; purine synthesis; and synthesis of cofactors such as thiamine, riboflavin, and nicotinate ribonucleotide.</p><p>Despite the reduced metabolic capabilities, certain core metabolic functions are conserved in chromerids as well as in all apicomplexan parasites, and many of these are likely to be essential. These pathways include: glycolysis; synthesis of ubiquinone, inositol-P derivatives, GPI-anchor, mono-, di- and tri-acyl glycerol, isoprene derivatives, and N-glycans; a subset of scavenge reactions for purine and pyrimidine bases and their conversion to nucleotides; glycine–serine inter-conversion; one-carbon folate cycle and S-adenosyl-methionine formation. There are many metabolic pathways that are retained in specific apicomplexan lineages but shared with the chromerids (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The following are notable examples of pathways shared between chromerids and a apicomplexan lineage: with <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, polyamine synthesis; with <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, conversion of serine to tryptophan; with <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, branched-chain amino acid degradation, synthesis of aspartate, lysine, and methionine; synthesis of molybdopterin, biopterin, pyridoxal-phosphate, and pantothenate cofactors. Surprisingly, with respect to the chromerids and other apicomplexans, <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> appears to be the only apicomplexan lineage to have gained a metabolic function of conversion of thymidine to dTMP by thymidine kinase. In addition, the type I and II pathways for fatty acids biosynthesis show lineage-specific distribution in apicomplexans and chromerids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We can also find example of pathways that have been lost in a lineage-specific manner. For example, the ability to synthesize the di-saccharide trehalose is missing only in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. However, the most dramatic loss of metabolic function in a single lineage can be found in cryptosporidia. These parasites are devoid of all plastid- and mitochondria-associated metabolic functions and other pathways involved in the synthesis of ribose-P, pyrimidine, most amino acids, heme, fatty acids (de novo), and isoprene units. It seems that the lack of mitochondrial oxidative pathways in cryptosporidia led to loss of the ability to generate flavin nucleotide (FMN/FAD) and lipoic acid cofactors.</p><p>In order to cope with loss of metabolic pathways, parasites have evolved various mechanisms for scavenging the required nutrients and metabolites from their respective hosts. For example, metabolites such as heme, fatty acids, steroids (specifically cholesterol), and sphingolipids are known to be scavenged by various apicomplexans as needed from their respective hosts.</p><p>According to the metabolic pathway maps, certain metabolic functions, which are coupled to each other, have been either retained or lost concomitantly in various species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). For example, piroplasms and cryptosporidia lack de novo fatty acid biosynthesis along with the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme complex (plastid-associated in apicomplexans), which is known to supply acetyl CoA units for fatty acid synthesis. On the other hand, these parasites have retained the ability to convert pantothenate to co-enzyme A, which is required for the activation of fatty acids scavenged from the hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Leonardi et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, activities of the serine hydroxyl methyl transferase and thymidylate synthase enzymes are coupled to each other and to one-carbon folate metabolism. Therefore, these three metabolic functions are retained in all parasites.</p></sec></sec></boxed-text></app><app id="app3"><title>Appendix 3</title><boxed-text><sec id="s9" sec-type="appendix"><title>Endomembrane trafficking system.</title><sec id="s9-1"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The predicted proteomes of the 26 species in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> have been searched for endomembrane trafficking components.

Several of the aforementioned families are involved in trafficking within the late endosomal system in opisthokont models and so may be associated with the evolution of the rhoptries and micronemes within the apicomplexan or myzozoan lineage. Consistent with this idea, some cases of reduction were not limited to Apicomplexa, and could be observed in the sister phyla of the ciliates and dinoflagellates.</p><p>This pattern of loss raises the question of what losses correlate with the transition to parasitism and which are pre-adaptive, arising more deeply in the lineage.

Though this ancestral complement appears to have been reduced in ciliates in the ESCRTI and III complexes, and a few components are missing from dinoflagellate taxa, numerous gene duplications have occurred as well, suggesting sculpting of the machinery. By comparison, apicomplexan parasites exhibit significant reductions in their ESCRT machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Leung et al., 2008</xref>). Cryptosporidia, coccidia, and plasmodia appear to lack any subunits of the ESCRTI and II complexes. ESCRTIII conservation is better, though no apicomplexan encodes Vps24, and multiple taxa have lost Vps20 as well. A similar pattern is seen for the ESCRTIII-a machinery, with piroplasmids encoding only Vps46 and Vps4. Coccidia additionally encode Vps31, and cryptosporidia Vps60, whereas plasmodia encode all subunits (rodent parasites like <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi</italic>), or lack Vps31 (human or simian parasites like <italic>P. falciparum</italic>). <italic>Chromera</italic> and <italic>Vitrella</italic> possess all ESCRT subunits except for the ESCRT-III component CHMP7, which is rarely found outside the opisthokont supergroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Leung et al., 2008</xref>). This observation suggests two conclusions regarding the evolution of the ESCRT machinery within alveolates: massive gene loss within the Apicomplexa occurred recently, after the split from the proto-apicomplexan ancestor, and some losses of machinery shared between apicomplexans and other alveolates are due to independent losses. An excellent example of this latter case is that of Vps37, which is present only in chromerids, but in no other alveolate included in the current study, suggesting its function was dispensable in a large number of lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s10-2"><title>APs</title><p>The APs are heterotetrameric complexes that select cargo for inclusion into transport vesicles at organelles of the late secretory system and endocytic system.

They share a core of four subunits with complex-specific proteins (Vps3 and 8 for CORVET and Vps39/41 for HOPS). Though all taxa encode the complete VpsC core of the HOPS/CORVET complex, all taxa except for <italic>T. gondii</italic> only appear to encode the CORVET-specific interactor Vps3. <italic>Chromera</italic> and <italic>Vitrella</italic>, like Apicomplexa, possess the entire VpsC core complements as well as the HOPS component Vps41 and both CORVET components.</p><p>Chromerids exhibit complex life cycles, from immotile vegetative cells to multi-cellular sporangia, and occasionally motile flagellated cells. Both lineages contain numerous potential locales for intracellular trafficking including mitochondria, plastid, starch granules, flagella, micronemes, and, in <italic>Chromera</italic>, the chromerosome. Additionally, vesicular traffic to the sporangial/cyst wall has been visualized in both lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Oborník et al., 2012</xref>). Our results indicate that chromerids possess an appropriately complex complement of membrane trafficking machinery to achieve these requirements.</p><p>Though MVBs have not been explicitly imaged or characterized in either lineage to date, both <italic>Chromera</italic> and <italic>Vitrella</italic> encode a complete set of ESCRT machinery, suggestive of the presence of functional MVBs. These may play a key role in modulating surface protein expression in various life cycle stages. Importantly, the close evolutionary position of <italic>Chromera</italic> and <italic>Vitrella</italic> to Apicomplexa suggests that the extensive decrease in ESCRT subunit conservation in Apicomplexa occurred in the immediate ancestor and is not an ancestral feature of a more inclusive group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Leung et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Particularly, the lack of some ESCRT subunits such as Vps37 in ciliates and dinoflagellates is most parsimoniously attributed to multiple independent losses. Further evidence for a complete set of ESCRT machinery in the last common alveolate ancestor comes from the conservation of all subunits to the exclusion of CHMP7 in the outgroup stramenopile taxa and in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>. The absence of CHMP7 in all taxa is not unusual, as it is lost in numerous taxa across eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Leung et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Conservation of adaptin subunits is striking, particularly the complete retention of AP5 in chromerids. In an initial study of seven organisms from the SAR supergroup (the group in which chromerids belong to), only two (<italic>B. natans</italic> and <italic>T. gondii</italic>) were found to encode the complex; conservation across eukaryotes was similarly sparse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Hirst et al., 2011</xref>). The presence of a complete AP5 complex in chromerids and coccidians may be indicative of a conserved function in both lineages. Likewise, the retention of an almost complete AP5 in cryptosporidia and plasmodia may have functional significance or may simply represent a reductive evolutionary process that has not yet reached completion. The complete lack of AP5 in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. reichenowi</italic> supports the latter view. As with the ESCRT complexes, the presence of AP1-5 in chromerids suggests the loss of AP3 and AP5 observed in some Apicomplexa is secondary, as well as the loss of AP5 in <italic>Perkinsus marinus</italic>, and in both ciliate lineages.</p><p>Presence of a complete VpsC core along with an additional CORVET subunit Vps3 in the majority of apicomplexan genomes suggests the potential for a modified HOPS/CORVET complex that interacts with Rab5 to direct tethering at the micronemes/rhoptries. This is in keeping with the view of rhoptries/micronemes as divergent endolysosomal organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Klinger et al., 2013b</xref>). However, chromerids do not appear to possess rhoptries, although chromerids possess cellular components analogous to micronemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Oborník et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">2012</xref>). More HOPS/CORVET subunits were found to be conserved in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, which are the only apicomplexan to date to be described as possessing a canonical lysosome-like compartment<sup>5</sup>, suggesting that complete complexes are retained in these lineages because they are required for trafficking to canonical lysosome-related organelles as well. Additionally, <italic>Chromera</italic> possesses the chromerosome, which often displays intralumenal vesicles similar to MVBs, suggesting it may also be derived from endosome-like organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Oborník et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, apicomplexans possess unusual endomembrane compartments including atypical Golgi and endosome-derived invasion organelles such as micronemes and rhoptries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Klinger et al., 2013b</xref>). Modifications in the complement of membrane trafficking machinery, including the loss of key protein complexes found in most eukaryotes, have been observed in the apicomplexan lineage, potentially associated with the specialization of the endomembrane system. The absence of some components (Exocyst, Vps39, Trs120, Tip20) within <italic>Chromera</italic> and <italic>Vitrella</italic> suggests pre-adaptation to parasitism deeper in the apicomplexan lineage. By contrast, the presence of near complete complements of key machinery (AP1-5, ESCRTs, COG) absent in many apicomplexans, pinpoints the timing of the losses at the colpodellid/apicomplexan transition.</p></sec></sec></boxed-text></app><app id="app4"><title>Appendix 4</title><boxed-text><sec id="s11" sec-type="appendix"><title>Apical complex and cytoskeleton.</title><p>Motility is an essential feature of many living organisms. Some organisms utilize microtubule-based specialized structures such as flagella and cilia for locomotion. Some use actin-based structures like filopodia, lamellipodia, and pseudopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Frenal and Soldati-Favre, 2009</xref>), which are exploited in the amoeboid crawling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Pollard and Borisy, 2003</xref>) or bacterial and viral movement into and between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib185">Stevens et al., 2006</xref>). Apicomplexan parasites use an unconventional actin-based mode of locomotion known as gliding motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Morrissette and Sibley, 2002</xref>). This mechanism allows the parasites to move fast in the absence of canonical microtubular and actin-based structures. Gliding motility is mediated by the apical complex, which is a cellular structure common to all apicomplexan parasites. In the apical complex, proteins secreted from specialized secretory organelles, microneme and rhoptries, mediate adhesion to the cell substrate during motility and invasion or formation of a PV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Baum et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Actin-based gliding motility is essential for apicomplexan invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib180">Skillman et al., 2011</xref>). Apicomplexan gliding motility undergoes actin polymerization/depolymerization for their directional motility with other associated protein classes such as actin-like proteins (ALP), actin-related protein (ARP), capping protein (CP), formin, profilin and cofilin/ADF. Actins elongate in the form of filaments and push the membrane forward. Arp2/3 complex (one of the ARPs) mediates the initiation of new branches on pre-existing filaments. After some growth, CP terminates the elongation of the filaments. Cofilin/ADF promotes de-branching and de-polymerization. Profilin mediates the refilling of ATP-actin monomer pools, which are used for elongation through catalyzing ADP-ATP exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Baum et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Foth et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We identified and compared genes encoding actins and other related components in the 26 species according to a method described by a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Baum et al., 2006</xref>). Chromerids share homology with Apicomplexa for most of the actin, ALP and ARP classes. For example, both chromerids possess actin 1 (ACT1), actin-related (ARP), and actin-like (ALP) homologs. There were fewer actin genes in apicomplexans than in chromerids, indicating losses during apicomplexan evolution. The patterns of losses were the same for closely related species, suggesting non-random, lineage-specific losses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5C</xref>).</p><p>Arp2/3 complex, a nucleator of actins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Machesky et al., 1994</xref>), consists of seven subunits that regulate actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Mullins et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Fehrenbacher et al., 2003</xref>). Initially identified in <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Machesky et al., 1994</xref>), Arp2/3 complex is conserved in most eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Gordon and Sibley, 2005</xref>). We could not identify genes encoding subunits of Arp2/3 complex in both chromerids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5C</xref>). Also, all subunits were not found in apicomplexan species, consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Gordon and Sibley, 2005</xref>). Individual subunits are important, as subunit ARPC4/p20 was shown to be essential for a complete, functional Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Gournier et al., 2001</xref>). Different subunits were identified in different phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5C</xref>). Within Apicomplexa, ARPC1 and ARPC4 were present in <italic>Cryptosporidium hominis</italic> and <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic>, and ARPC1 and ARPC2 in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp<italic>.</italic> <italic>S. minutum</italic>, a dinoflagellate, contains genes for most of the subunits except ARPC1. This suggests that the common ancestor of Myzozoa (chromerids, apicomplexans, and dinoflagellates) had all the subunits, and they were lost in different lineages. Genes encoding ALP1, hypothesized to function as Arp2/3-like nucleator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Gordon and Sibley, 2005</xref>), were found in apicomplexans and also in <italic>Vitrella</italic> (Vbra_266.t1). FH2-domain (Pfam-PF02181) containing formins are members of another actin nucleator gene family. They produce unbranched filaments unlike Arp2/3 complex, which induces branched filaments. Both chromerids possess formin1 (FRM1) and formin 2 (FRM2) homologs, which are conserved in all the other studied species as well. Although <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp<italic>.</italic> maintained a 1-1 orthology for both FRM1 and FRM2, we found a coccidian-specific FRM3 (TGME49_213370), suggesting a lineage-specific expansion. Maintenance of some formins across chromerids and apicomplexans and lack of Arp2/3 complex suggest their importance, perhaps reflecting a switch from Arp2/3 complex to formins for actin nucleation during the evolution of Apicomplexa. Taken together, it seems that an Arp2/3 independent actin nucleation mechanism had already evolved before Apicomplexa and chromerids, and losses of ARP have probably begun too, although inferring the exact timing and sequence of losses will require studying more closely related species such as Colpodella.</p><p>We analyzed coronins, a major conserved gene family with a multifunctional role in actin regulation and vesicular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib172">Rybakin and Clemen, 2005</xref>). These are WD40-repeat containing proteins, which represent the only candidate for actin bundling in apicomplexan parasites. Coronins inhibit the nucleating activity of Arp2/3, unlike other known Arp2/3-binding proteins. We observed absence of coronins in both chromerids, which is consistent with the notion that they, functionally linked to the Arp2/3 complex, were lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5C</xref>). Although parasite homologs do not have the microtubule-binding domain of canonical coronins, but essential amino acid residues are conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Gandhi et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, coronin could be playing a role in stabilizing F-actin scaffolds or having an alternative role in vesicular transport in apicomplexan parasites.</p><p>Profilins are actin-binding proteins that supply pools of readily polymerizable actin monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Baum et al., 2006</xref>). Genes encoding profilins were found in all 26 species studied except for an oomycete (<italic>P. ultimum</italic>) and diatoms (<italic>P. tricornutum</italic>, <italic>Thalassiosira pseudonana</italic>). Apicomplexa-specific profilins have βmini1 and βmini2 domains, which provide an extended interface with actin and formed the structural basis of their actin-binding function in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Kucera et al., 2010</xref>) and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Kursula et al., 2008</xref>). These domains are not found in other eukaryotes. Sequence alignment of these profilins reveals an intriguing observation that <italic>Vitrella</italic> (Vbra_7301.t1) had these β-domains previously thought to be specific to Apicomplexa, with partial conservation in Chromera (Cvel_18957.t1) and in dinoflagellate <italic>P. marinus</italic> (XP_002774080). The β-domains were not detected in other non-apicomplexan species. All species studied has had only one profilin gene except for chromerids where we observed 2 in <italic>Chromera</italic> and 3 in <italic>Vitrella</italic>, including an one-to-one ortholog of the apicomplexan profilin in both chromerids.</p><p>Cyclase-associated proteins (CAPs) are evolutionary conserved G-actin-binding proteins, which participate in filament turnover regulation by acting on actin monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Chaudhry et al., 2010</xref>). CAP proteins are made up of three significant regions: N-terminal adenylate cyclase binding domain (CAP_N, linked to the cAMP-RAS signaling), a central proline-rich segment, and a C-terminal actin-binding domain (CAP_C). Apicomplexans do not possess the N-terminal (CAP_N) domain altogether with few genes in stramenopiles and in <italic>Vitrella</italic> (Vbra_7026.t1) also showing a similar pattern of loss. However, the <italic>Chromera</italic> gene Cvel_8488.t1 possesses both domains. This suggests the dispensable nature of CAP_N domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5C</xref>), and we speculate that in parasites CAP functions are reduced to actin sequestration only.</p><p>The F-actin capping, CapZ duplex, a dimer of α- and β-CPs, prevents polymerization from the ‘barbed’ (plus) end. It is conserved across Apicomplexa except for in piroplasms. It is also conserved in most of the species studied including stramenopiles, dinoflagellates, and both chromerids. In Apicomplexa, several gelsolin domain-containing proteins were found but they are unlikely to be functionally related and are speculated to be Sec23/Sec24-like proteins, which function in vesicular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Baum et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Cofilin/ADF genes promote de-branching of actin filaments and are well conserved among species studied. However, plasmodia differ from the rest of the Apicomplexa species in having an additional copy of the ADF gene.

Members of piroplasmids such as <italic>Theileria annulata</italic> and <italic>Theileria parva</italic> have the fewest genes among the apicomplexan species examined, likely because piroplasms do not require motility for intracellular invasion. On the other hand, we detected the most complete myosin family repertoire in <italic>Chromera</italic> and <italic>Vitrella.</italic> We detected certain myosin families in some apicomplexan genera, but not among non-apicomplexan species, indicating lineage-specific gains (data not shown).

Ultrastructures reminiscent of micronemes have been observed in both chromerids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Oborník et al., 2012</xref>); consistent with this, we identified EC proteins having domains and architectures typical of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> micronemal secretory proteins. Examples include expansions of proteins containing SUSHI, EGF, TSP1, and vWA domains (data not shown). Chromerids possess unique architectures of proteins containing the macrophage perforin (MacPerf) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4E</xref>), which, previously found in apicomplexans and ciliates (as large expansions), are thought to function in apicomplexans to mediate membrane lysis during host cell egress and tissue traversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">Roiko and Carruthers, 2009</xref>).

We scanned the protein-coding gene sets of the 26 species using the apicomplexan-specific apiAP2 HMM, which was constructed with the AP2 domain sequences from apicomplexan species. We found that apiAP2 genes were abundant in both chromerids and in all apicomplexans. ApiAP2 genes were moderately abundant in the two dinoflagellates and rare or absent in ciliates and stramenopiles, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). There were very few apiAP2 genes that were shared between apicomplexans and non-apicomplexan species; most were shared between closely related species, that is, from the same clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These lineage-specific apiAP2 genes in the present-day species could have arisen from de novo gene birth or modification of the full-length sequences of existing genes beyond recognition. In the former case, the proto-apicomplexan ancestor had a small set of apiAP2 genes. In the latter case, the common ancestor already had a large set of apiAP2 genes, which continued to change, giving the appearance of ‘new’ clade-specific genes. The latter case, the turnover scenario, is more parsimonious because, according to the de novo gene birth scenario, apiAP2 genes must have expanded independently in every descending lineage from the proto-apicomplexan ancestor. In summary, our data support the notion that massive apiAP2 expansion occurred in the common ancestor before Apicomplexa and chromerids split, and the apiAP2s continued to change as the common ancestor split into chromerids and apicomplexans, which continued to radiate and adapt to their host niches and life cycle strategies.</p><p>We sought to determine if gene duplication and divergence was a significant mechanism for the expansion and the turnover of apiAP2 genes. The number of apiAP2 genes that have other homologous apiAP2 genes within the species based on OrthoMCL clustering, which are likely mediated by paralogous expansions, was high (93 out of 136) in chromerids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In <italic>Vitrella</italic>, we identified one cluster of 50 homologous apiAP2 genes. This means that gene duplication played an important role in expanding apiAP2 gene repertoire in chromerids. The number was significantly less (5 out of 13) in dinoflagellates than in chromerids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We suspect that gene duplication and diversifications drove expansion of apiAP2 genes significantly after the split of dinoflagellates. In apicomplexan species, evidence for recent duplications was sparse, as only 4 out of 409 apiAP2 genes had homologous copies in the same species. This does not necessarily mean that apiAP2 genes do not duplicate readily in apicomplexans, but rather that redundant copies of apiAP2 are quickly lost or diversified beyond recognition in part by selective pressure to reduce gene repertoires and genome sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Katinka et al., 2001</xref>) and due to higher rate of sequence divergence in parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Hafner et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that plant genomes contain a large repertoire of <italic>AP2</italic> genes, and that plant AP2 domains evolved from an endonuclease domain in a cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Magnani et al., 2004</xref>). According to our phylogenetic analysis, AP domains among bacteria are many and diverse, with both plant-like and apicomplexan-like AP2s (data not shown). We did not find significant homology with bacterial AP2 genes at the full gene length level. It is not clear if the originally transferred AP2 gene has evolved beyond recognition or if only the domain has been transferred to these eukaryotes. The exact genetic events that led to acquisition of AP2s in apicomplexans are not clear. However, what is the most probable scenario is that AP2 domains in alveolates came from bacteria and have expanded in myzozoans, independent of those in plants. Both functional studies and more taxon sampling would be required for elucidating how AP2s in alveolates were acquired in the first place.</p></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="article-commentary" id="SA1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06974.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Nordborg</surname><given-names>Magnus</given-names></name><role>Reviewing editor</role><aff><institution>Vienna Biocenter</institution>, <country>Austria</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>eLife posts the editorial decision letter and author response on a selection of the published articles (subject to the approval of the authors).

The central goal of the paper, then, is to infer what kind of changes (gene loss, gene gain, genome evolution) have taken place in the transition from free-living to parasitic lifestyles.</p><p>What I am struck by after several readings is how much of the analyses focus on apicomplexan organisms. I suppose this is natural, given the importance of these organisms, but it made me wonder how much of this paper was a re-analysis of data which are already published, since no apicomplexan data were actually generated for this work. In particular, since the genomes of <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> and <italic>Perkinsus</italic> are available and are really do not appear to be too much for divergent from <italic>Apicomplexa</italic> compared with <italic>Vitrella</italic> and <italic>Chromera</italic> (at least as drawn in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> of this paper), I wondered what insight was new here and what was a rehashing of old data (with, of course, the addition of two new species). As such, I looked into a couple of the specific points mentioned in the Abstract, the evolution of the endomembrane trafficking system and the AP2 proteins, and how the results described in this paper relate to other published work.</p><p>The similarities are pretty substantial. Taking the first example of the trafficking system, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref> is very, very similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> from Klinger et al. 2013 PloS One 8: e76278. Not only are the figures similar, but so are the conclusions. I suppose this is not surprising, given that the senior author on the PLoS One paper is also a co-author on this manuscript, but it does concern me that much of the other results of this paper are not really that new or surprising. It argues against the claims of novelty reported in this paper, i.e., “Analysis of <italic>Chromera</italic> and <italic>Vitrella</italic> genomes has enabled the first genomic insights into how apicomplexan parasites have evolved from free-living ancestors, clearly delineating genes gained and lost at various stages of the evolution.” I would say that the data reported here seem to have “enabled the finest-scale genomic insights” of what genes have been lost during the evolution of parasitism, but seems to have not “enabled the first genomic insights”.</p><p>This concern is also relevant in the discussion of AP2 evolution. For example, in Balahi et al. 2005 Nucleic Acids Research 33: 3994, the authors state that “Detailed analysis of the apicomplexan genomes of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> showed that they entirely lacked conserved DNA binding domains of specific TFs found across the eukaryotic crown group, such as the homeo, bZip, bHLH and Fkh domains,” and “Thus, starting from a core set of at least nine proteins inherited from the ancestral form, the ApiAP2 family appears to have proliferated further through independent duplications as the different apicomplexan lineages emerged”. This seems to be very similar to what is stated in the present manuscript, e.g.: “Gains of apiAP2 genes, together with general reduction in other DNA binding proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1E</xref>), appeared to have led to the dominant role of apiAP2 genes in present-day apicomplexans.” This conclusion seems to have been easily drawn with data available before the manuscript under consideration here (and the Balahi NAR paper was not cited).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06974.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary statement</italic>:</p><p><italic>The importance of the new Chromerid genomes is the light they shed on the evolution of the</italic> Apicomplexa<italic>.

The chromerid genomes and transcriptomes were indispensible for the new insights on the evolution of apicomplexan parasites. Dinoflagellates, other potential outgroup to apicomplexans, have diverged much further away from apicomplexans than chromerids have, and have undergone drastic, unique genomic and cellular changes (Janouškovec, Horák et al. 2010, Oborník, Modrý et al. 2012, Obornik and Lukes 2013). The available <italic>Perkinsus marinus</italic> genome sequence is highly fragmented, and there is no peer-reviewed paper describing the genome, and <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> genome sequence covers only 616Mb of the estimated 1.5Gb of the whole genome, according to the authors’ own estimate (Shoguchi, Shinzato et al. 2013). The low quality of their genomes hampers their utility as primary outgroups.</p><p>Without the chromerid genomes, i.e. with ciliate and dinoflagellate genomes only, our conclusions would have been vastly different. First, we tested one of our main claims that very few genes were gained without the chromerid genomes or the dinoflagellates genomes. The apicomplexan ancestor comprised 4859 orthogroups, of which only 81 were gained during Stage II. Without the chromerid genomes, 785 out of the 4859 orthogroups would have been inferred as gained after Stage I. Because of the chromerid genomes, we were able to conclude that most of the genes present in the apicomplexan ancestor were present in the free-living apicomplexan ancestor. In contrast, without the dinoflagellate genomes, only 207 orthogroups (compared to 785 without chromerids) would have been inferred as gained. Second, we identified 260 <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> genes that are directly or indirectly implicated in parasitic processes (the categories listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and share homology with free-living species. 27 were shared with the chromerid genome but not in the other free-living species. Examples of such genes include key components of gliding motility (GAP40 (Frenal, Polonais et al. 2010) and GAPM2 (Bullen, Tonkin et al. 2009)) and the inner membrane complex (ISP). In contrast, there were only two genes shared with the dinoflagellate genomes but not with the chromerid genome. While the dinoflagellate genomes reinforced our conclusion, it would have led us to the conclusion we reached in this study.</p><p>Also, we have generated comprehensive gene expression resources across 36 unique conditions based on RNA-seq, providing functional genomic information for the outgroup to the apicomplexans. In fact, the cross-species gene co-expression network analysis was indispensible for conclusions drawn in the study.</p><p>As for overlap with the Klinger et al. 2013 paper, although our figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2– figure supplement 3</xref>) appear reminiscent of the previously published figure, the actual information included are drastically more, and the insights drawn are quite different from the previous study. Specifically, the 2013 paper analyzed only the MTCs, one of the three-endomembrane system gene sets analyzed in this manuscript. Our analysis also expanded the taxon sampling as compared with the 2013 paper and previous evolutionary analyses of membrane-trafficking machinery in apicomplexans. This enabled several new insights. Firstly, with the chromerid genomes in our analyses, we have concluded that some of the components missing in apicomplexans and other alveolates are not due to ancestral loss but due to multiple, independent losses in the various alveolate lineages. This is the case for Vps37 in the ESCRTs and several COG subunits in the MTCs, among others. Secondly, we now clarify that the proto-apicomplexan ancestor had a nearly complete endomembrane repertoire. This pinpoints that the progressive losses of endomembrane components (e.g. ESCRT 1 and 2, AP3, and COG) began after the chromerid apicomplexa split, concurrent with the transition to parasitism. By showing the presence of this gene set in the proto-apicomplexan, we better understand the dynamics of gene loss as occurring gradually and differentially by apicomplexan lineages in adaptation to specific niches. Thirdly, in direct contrast to the results from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Hirst et al. 2011</xref> PLoS Biology paper first reporting the AP5 complex, we find AP5 to be widespread amongst apicomplexan lineages, including in the malaria parasite. Nonetheless, to address the fact that there were concerns about the novelty of the endomembrane analyses based on the three endomembrane protein sets analyzed, we have now included in the revised manuscript data from two additional endomembrane component sets implicated in biogenesis of the invasion organelles (Tomavo, Slomianny et al. 2013). The manuscript has now been revised to highlight all of these points.</p><p>With reference to the Oberstaller et al.<italic>,</italic> 2014 and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Balaji et al., 2005</xref> studies, our analyses based on the chromerid genome offers several insights not observed by past studies. It was previously thought that expansion of apiAP2 have occurred by independent duplication in different apicomplexan lineages, as Reviewer #3 has pointed out from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Balaji et al 2005</xref>: <italic>“</italic>…the ApiAP2 family appears to have proliferated further through independent duplications as the different apicomplexan lineages emerged”. While our analyses confirmed this observation, our inclusion of chromerids addressed a very important, different question: did the free-living proto-apicomplexan ancestor heavily utilized apiAP2 proteins like present-day apicomplexans? Our findings support the notion that apiAP2 have drastically expanded in the proto-apicomplexans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="app" rid="app6">Appendix 6</xref>). We observed a small repertoire of apiAP2 proteins in <italic>Perkinsus</italic> compared to that in chromerids, again underscoring the indispensability of the chromerid genomes for our conclusion. Also, the proto-apicomplexan ancestor genome encoded many proteins with canonical DNA Binding Domains (DBDs), suggesting that apiAP2 proteins were major, but not dominant, regulators of gene expression, and that the dominance of apiAP2 came after subsequent loss of proteins with DBDs during and after transition to apicomplexans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1C</xref>). Our study for the first time pinpointed the sequence of evolutionary events because of the chromerid genomes. Importantly, we found evidence for gene duplication driving evolution of apiAP2, which has been postulated by Balaji et al. but not observed before, addressing how a large repertoire of such critical drivers of parasitism could have arisen (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app6">Appendix 6</xref>).</p><p><italic>Given that</italic> eLife <italic>is a broad interest journal, please be more precise when discussing “pre-existing parasitism genes” and similar. You write as if it were surprising that genes implicated in parasitism were present in the ancestor, but where else could they have come from? Also, their ancestral function was obviously not parasitism. Clearly you understand this, as will many or most of your readers, but please avoid jargon nonetheless</italic>.</p><p>We thank and agree with the Reviewing editor for this valuable comment. We did not articulate the concept well in the manuscript which have led to the confusion on why would a non-parasite have ‘parasitism’ genes? We have modified the text, avoiding using jargons without definitive meanings, to convey the intended concept behind “pre-existing parasitism genes”: the group of genes (e.g. flagellar genes, some EC proteins) that were repurposed (or neo-functionalized) from their normal cellular roles in free-living organisms to molecular processes that are essential for life cycle of obligate parasites, including intracellular invasion.</p><p>In the manuscript, we also clarify a related concept that needs extra clarifications. We have concluded that many of the components that are now effectively exploited by apicomplexans as highly successful parasites were gained in this lineage prior to their commitment to parasitism. The section describing putative functions of genes based on RNA-seq analysis provide some clues to why they were present amongst the free-living, photosynthetic ancestors, represented by the chromerids.</p><p><italic>We were also surprised that no attempt was made to test for evidence of accelerated evolution of the genes implicated in parasitism</italic>.</p><p>It is an interesting, important question whether adaptation to parasitism would correlate with accelerated evolution of genes involved in parasitic mechanisms (Woolfit and Bromham 2003, Castillo-Davis, Bedford et al. 2004, Bromham, Cowman et al. 2013, Duchene and Bromham 2013). However, it is impractical to test for this in apicomplexans for two reasons. First, a measure of accelerated evolution requires establishment of a basal rate of evolution within the lineages being examined. However, apicomplexans, and related lineages dinoflagellates and ciliates, are notorious for their overall high evolutionary rates. This is evident by the long branches in all of these groups in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and is consistent with most published phylogenies. The reasons for this are unknown, but this does not correlate with parasitism alone. Second, while accelerated evolution of molecules can be associated with specialization, in this case for parasitism, it is also associated with loss of function and gradual accumulation of mutations. In apicomplexans we see multiple independent cases of pathway loss; indeed this is one of the important observations of this study. Thus, these two independent drivers of accelerated evolution in apicomplexans would further confound efforts to measure relative evolutionary rate associated with adaption to parasitism.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p><italic>This study describes the generation and analysis of two Chromerid genomes.

However, while King et al. deals with evolution of multi-cellularity in metazoans from unicellular choanoflagellates (increased organismal complexity), our study deals with evolution of parasites from free-living species (mostly loss of complexity but increase in host-adaptive specialization).

For the analyses of evolutionary ages of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> genes, we have curated the genes in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> mostly by computational prediction method (again which were uniformly applied to all sequences in all species; for example, HMMER search of the RAP genes, apiAP2 genes, other DNA-binding domain, other RNA-binding domains, alveolins, actins and myosins).</p><p><italic>In the last paragraph of the subsection headed “Ancestral gene content of free-living and parasitic species”, there is a suggestion that apicomplexans have undergone massive gene loss due to a switch to a parasitic lifestyle. This is based on the presence and absence of large numbers of orthogroups. However an alternative explanation is that instead of losing many of these so called ‘core’ genes, they have simply undergone significant sequence divergence in the apicomplexan lineage, which might not be so surprising given the considerable changes in host tropism, life cycle, morphology etc. (in the first paragraph of the aforementioned subsection). The authors may be correct in their interpretation, however, this reviewer found the description of orthogroupings particularly confusing. For example, can orthogroupings contain singletons?

The drastic net loss of genes in apicomplexans compared to chromerids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) would support the explanation of gene loss. Also, very specific set of genes were lost or conserved; for example, while enzymes of the TCA cycle were conserved, most of the photosynthesis-related components were lost; we argue that a large set of genes were lost because they are no longer necessary, rather than that they have evolved into genes with new functions. Although we cannot completely rule out cases consistent with the alternative explanations, we find that for most of the cases our explanation is more parsimonious and consistent with the findings of this study.</p><p>Orthogroups refers to a group of homologous sequences across all genes and across all species. They can be one sequence (singleton), or a group of paralogs and/or orthologs depending on the evolutionary event. While the term orthogroup does not describe the precise evolution event, unable to distinguish orthology from paralogy, it is extremely practical and powerful because it allows us to collectively describe a singleton, putative orthologs, and paralogs. The term orthogroup is being increasingly used in the literature (Amborella Genome 2013, Lovell, Wirthlin et al. 2014, Dey, Jaimovich et al. 2015).

The central goal of the paper, then, is to infer what kind of changes (gene loss, gene gain, genome evolution) have taken place in the transition from free-living to parasitic lifestyles</italic>.</p><p><italic>What I am struck by after several readings is how much of the analyses focus on apicomplexan organisms. I suppose this is natural, given the importance of these organisms, but it made me wonder how much of this paper was a re-analysis of data which are already published, since no apicomplexan data were actually generated for this work. In particular, since the genomes of</italic> Symbiodinium <italic>and</italic> Perkinsus <italic>are available and are really do not appear to be too much for divergent from</italic> Apicomplexa <italic>compared with</italic> Vitrella <italic>and</italic> Chromera <italic>(at least as drawn in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1A</italic></xref> <italic>of this paper), I wondered what insight was new here and what was a rehashing of old data (with, of course, the addition of two new species). As such, I looked into a couple of the specific points mentioned in the Abstract, the evolution of the endomembrane trafficking system and the AP2 proteins, and how the results described in this paper relate to other published work</italic>.</p><p><italic>The similarities are pretty substantial. Taking the first example of the trafficking system,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3"><italic>Figure 2–figure supplement 3</italic></xref> <italic>is very, very similar to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>from Klinger et al. 2013 PloS One 8: e76278. Not only are the figures similar, but so are the conclusions. I suppose this is not surprising, given that the senior author on the PLoS One paper is also a co-author on this manuscript, but it does concern me that much of the other results of this paper are not really that new or surprising. It argues against the claims of novelty reported in this paper, i.e., “Analysis of</italic> Chromera <italic>and</italic> Vitrella <italic>genomes has enabled the first genomic insights into how apicomplexan parasites have evolved from free-living ancestors, clearly delineating genes gained and lost at various stages of the evolution.” I would say that the data reported here seem to have “enabled the finest-scale genomic insights” of what genes have been lost during the evolution of parasitism, but seems to have not “enabled the first genomic insights”</italic>.</p><p><italic>This concern is also relevant in the discussion of AP2 evolution. For example, in</italic> <italic>Balahi et al. 2005</italic> <italic>Nucleic Acids Research 33: 3994, the authors state that “Detailed analysis of the apicomplexan genomes of Plasmodium falciparum and</italic> Cryptosporidium parvum <italic>showed that they entirely lacked conserved DNA binding domains of specific TFs found across the eukaryotic crown group, such as the homeo, bZip, bHLH and Fkh domains,” and “Thus, starting from a core set of at least nine proteins inherited from the ancestral form, the ApiAP2 family appears to have proliferated further through independent duplications as the different apicomplexan lineages emerged”. This seems to be very similar to what is stated in the present manuscript, e.g.: “Gains of apiAP2 genes, together with general reduction in other DNA binding proteins (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1"><italic>Figure 2–figure supplement 1E</italic></xref><italic>), appeared to have led to the dominant role of apiAP2 genes in present-day apicomplexans.” This conclusion seems to have been easily drawn with data available before the manuscript under consideration here (and the Balahi NAR paper was not cited)</italic>.</p><p>In our opinion, the manuscript, in its revised form, provides unprecedented insights into how obligate intracellular parasites of terrestrial animals and human have evolved from free-living marine algae. Our detailed genomic, transcriptomic and cell-biological analyses of <italic>Chromera velia</italic> and <italic>Vitrella brassicaformis</italic> reveal that free-living algal ancestors possessed the molecular toolkits that when rewired and repurposed gradually giving rise to disease-causing apicomplexan parasites, including those that cause malaria, toxoplasmosis and cryptosporidiosis. We provide a comprehensive roadmap of evolutionary changes characterized by gene loss and cellular innovations associated with parasitism during the genesis and radiation of <italic>Apicomplexa</italic>. Hence, we firmly believe that this study is of significant interest to a wide audience in <italic>eLife</italic>. We have addressed all of the concerns raised by Reviewer #3 as a part of response to the Summary statement of the editors above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
