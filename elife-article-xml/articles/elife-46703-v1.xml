Loss of <italic>ztf-11</italic> leads to upregulation of non-neuronal genes and reduced neurogenesis. Ectopic expression of <italic>ztf-11</italic> in epidermal lineages is sufficient to produce additional neurons. ZTF-11 functions together with the MuvB corepressor complex to suppress the activation of non-neuronal genes in neurons. These results dovetail with the ability of Myt1l (Myt1-like) to drive neuronal transdifferentiation in vitro in vertebrate systems. Together, we identified an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to specify neuronal cell fate by repressing non-neuronal genes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46703.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human body contains many cell types that each have different job and can look very different from each other. However, each of the cells in an individual’s body contains almost exactly the same genes, because all of them share the same DNA inherited from the individual’s parents. Cells therefore become different from one another by controlling the activity of sets of genes. They do this by using proteins called transcription factors, which find specific genes and turn them either on or off.</p><p>Nerve cells or neurons form and develop in a process called neurogenesis. During neurogenesis, some genes including those specific to neurons need to be switched on while other non-neuronal genes need to be switched off. The “off-switch” is particularly important when neurons are generated by conversion from skin cells, which sometimes happens in animals. Before these cells can become mature nerve cells, they require transcription factors to ensure that skin-specific genes are off.</p><p>The transcription factors turning on nerve cell-specific genes are well-understood, but far less is known about those that turn off other genes. Lee et al. therefore set out to search for transcription factors that might switch off non-neuronal genes during neurogenesis and focused on one transcription factor that is known to be important for the development of nerve cells in a variety of animal species.</p><p>Experiments using the worm <italic>C. elegans</italic> revealed that this transcription factor – called ZTF-11 in worms – was present in all cells destined to be nerve cells, but not in cells that would assume other roles. These experiments are possible with <italic>C. elegans</italic> because the final role, or ‘fate’, of each cell in the body are already known, all the way from the fertilized egg to the adult.</p><p>Further work, using genetically engineered worms revealed that ZTF-11 worked by turning off genes that are related to the development of non-nerve cells. Deleting the gene for ZTF-11 in immature nerve cells allowed these cells to turn on different sets of genes and resulted in adult worms with fewer mature nerve cells than normal worms. On the other hand, forcing other cell types (which would not normally become part of the nervous system) to produce ZTF-11 was sufficient to convert them into nerve cells.</p><p>These results are an important step forward in understanding how nerve cells are built in the developing body, especially how nerve cells can be made from other cell types. In the future, this knowledge could be used to help people with diseases of the nervous system, such as Parkinson’s disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ZTF-11</kwd><kwd>Myt1</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>MuvB complex</kwd><kwd>transcriptional repression</kwd><kwd>neuronal differentiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007276</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Joo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Joo</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Caitlin A</given-names></name><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Kang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 NS048392</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Joo</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Caitlin A</given-names></name><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Kang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>First comprehensive genetic analysis of a Myt1 family protein reveals that neurogenesis requires direct repression of non-neuronal identities by the Myt1 family protein through MuvB co-repressor complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcriptional repressors such as RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) and Hairy/Enhancer of Split (Hes) repress neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chong et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ishibashi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ohsako et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schoenherr and Anderson, 1995</xref>). However, it is unknown whether transcriptional repressors of non-neuronal genes are required in neuronal precursors to specify neuronal fate during development. The Myt1 family of C2HC-type zinc finger transcription factors contributes to fibroblast to neuron reprogramming in vitro by repressing Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellefroid et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mall et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vasconcelos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vierbuchen et al., 2010</xref>). The Myt1 family factors were first shown to regulate neurogenesis in <italic>Xenopus</italic> gastrula embryos, where X-MyT1 is expressed in neuronal precursors along with classical proneural genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellefroid et al., 1996</xref>). Mammalian Myt1 family proteins, Myt1, Myt1l, and St18, are also highly expressed in developing nervous systems and are required for proper migration of neuronal precursors into the subventricular zone and cortical plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mall et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vasconcelos et al., 2016</xref>). Myt1 transcriptionally represses Notch signaling, primarily by repressing the transcription factor Hes1, which inhibits neuronal cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mall et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vasconcelos et al., 2016</xref>). The ability of Notch intracellular domain to repress neurogenesis is neutralized by overexpression of Myt1 family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellefroid et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mall et al., 2017</xref>). Based on these results, it has been proposed that Myt1 family proteins counteract lateral inhibition and subsequently commit neuronal progenitors to terminal differentiation.</p><p>Recent in vitro studies showed that Myt1l, together with the proneural gene Ascl1 and the neuronal transcription factor Brn2, are sufficient to induce transdifferentiation (TD) into neurons from various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Masserdotti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vierbuchen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, a number of non-neuronal mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) signature genes were also found to be repressed by Myt1l during neuronal transdifferentiation. Furthermore, co-expression of Myt1l reduced efficiency of MyoD-induced myocyte differentiation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mall et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with a role for Mytl1 in transcriptional repression during neuronal transdifferentiation, Myt1l was found to be associated with transcriptional corepressor complexes, including the Sin3 histone deacetylase complex (Sin3-HDAC), to mediate repression of non-neuronal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Romm et al., 2005</xref>). Redundancy between Myt1 family proteins has prevented mouse models from providing insight into the developmental functions of Myt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). As a result, the in vivo functions of Myt1 family proteins during development remain poorly understood.</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, ZTF-11 is the sole Myt1 family homolog containing the characteristic C2HC zinc finger domains. The DNA-binding zinc finger domains of ZTF-11 exhibit a high degree of conservation in amino acid sequence compared to other Myt1 family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both ZTF-11 and vertebrate Myt1 family proteins recognize the same consensus sequence (AAGTT) in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mall et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Narasimhan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vasconcelos et al., 2016</xref>). Apart from the zinc finger domains, ZTF-11 and other Myt1 family proteins are poorly conserved in sequence, including regions that interact with the Sin-3-HDAC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mall et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Romm et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that a Myt1 family protein is required for in vivo developmental neurogenesis of specific lineages as well as transdifferentiation by characterizing the in vivo functions of <italic>ztf-11</italic>. We found that ZTF-11 is expressed exclusively in neuronal precursors at single-cell resolution during embryonic and postembryonic neurogenesis. Remarkably, ZTF-11 is required for epithelial-to-neuronal transdifferentiation during <italic>C. elegans</italic> development, suggesting that in vivo transdifferentiation utilizes genetic programs similar to those required for neuronal reprogramming in vitro. We also found that ZTF-11 is necessary and sufficient for postembryonic neurogenesis from a non-neuronal precursor. In these lineages, we show that <italic>ztf-11</italic> represses expression of non-neuronal genes to allow establishment of neuronal identity. Unexpectedly, <italic>ztf-11</italic> does not function as a repressor of the Hes1 ortholog <italic>lin-22</italic> in this context. Instead, our genetic data support the model that ZTF-11 acts downstream of Hes1 to promote neuronal differentiation. We further show that ZTF-11 mediates transcriptional repression through directly binding to MuvB co-repressor complex, but not the Sin3-HDAC complex. Taken together, our results indicate that neurogenesis requires repression of non-neuronal programs by Myt1 family proteins in addition to activation of neuronal programs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Myt1 family homolog ZTF-11 is expressed in neural precursors</title><p>To investigate the role of <italic>ztf-11</italic> in development, we first examined the expression pattern of ZTF-11 by endogenously tagging <italic>ztf-11</italic> with a C-terminal GFP via CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing.

We propose that ZTF-11 binds to MuvB complex to similarly repress many non-neuronal genes during neuronal development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although Myt1 family factors were discovered more than two decades ago, the neurogenic role of Myt1 family factors is only starting to be unraveled on a molecular level. In particular, advances in in vitro transdifferentiation have provided crucial insights in recognizing Myt1 family factors as key drivers of neurogenesis. Here we studied the physiological and developmental functions of ZTF-11 in neurogenesis in vivo. Comparing our results to the in vitro transdifferentiation literature, there are interesting similarities and differences. First, in both systems, ZTF-11 and Myt1l are critical drivers of neural cell fate. Examining neurogenesis in different classes of neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we found that ZTF-11 is particularly important for the generation of postembryonic neurons, which are derived from epidermal cells. Most interestingly, a developmentally occurring epithelial-to-neuronal transdifferentiation event requires ZTF-11 to reprogram epithelial identity, further bridging the in vivo and in vitro neurogenic functions of Myt1 factors. In contrast, embryonic neurons generated by rapid cell division from precursor cells are less dependent on ZTF-11. It is conceivable that ZTF-11 is required to ‘turn off’ the established epidermal/epithelial cell fate before neurons can be generated. This could explain the particular requirement of Myt1l in transdifferentiation. Second, both ZTF-11 and Myt1l function as transcriptional repressors. This was evident from RNA-seq experiments from both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and transdifferentiating mammalian neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mall et al., 2017</xref>), where non-neuronal genes are suppressed by this family of proteins. Third, the neuronal expression of ZTF-11 in developing neurons is activated by proneural bHLH genes, which is likely dependent on the conserved E-boxes in the promoter elements of <italic>ztf-11</italic> and Myt1l. Together, these similarities build a strong case that the Myt1 family transcription factors play conserved functions in neuronal specification by repressing the expression of non-neuronal genes. These results also suggest that repression of non-neuronal genes is an important aspect of neurogenesis across species.</p><p>We also identified two key differences between ZTF-11 and Myt1. First, our genetic analysis shows that ZTF-11 does not repress the Hes1 homolog <italic>lin-22</italic>. How can this result be reconciled with previous results that Myt1 family factors repress lateral inhibition? One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that ZTF-11 may have lost its ability to repress Notch signaling. However, it is also possible that vertebrate Myt1 family factors gained the ability to repress Hes1. Second, our data also suggest that the MuvB complex, but not the Sin3-HDAC complex, plays an important role in neurogenesis as a co-repressor complex that functions with ZTF-11. This result is interesting but unsurprising considering the sequence divergence of Myt1 family proteins outside the conserved DNA-binding zinc-fingers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Myt1 family proteins may have diverged through evolution to function with different co-repressor complexes. It is also noteworthy that ZTF-11 retained weak binding with SIN-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10G</xref>), suggesting this interaction is conserved through evolution in other developmental contexts. Examination of Myt1 family factors in other invertebrate model systems is likely to shed light on these intriguing questions.</p><p>During evolution, ancestral neurons likely arose from non-neuronal cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, cnidarian neurons are generated from endodermal interstitial stem cells or epithelial precursors, rather than dedicated neural precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rentzsch et al., 2017</xref>). As with proneural genes, Myt1 family factors are conserved throughout metazoan evolution with the exception of porifera (sponges) and ctenophora (comb jellies), which either lack a nervous system or are thought to have independently evolved a nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moroz et al., 2014</xref>). MuvB complex genes are conserved in all animals regardless of presence of the nervous system, suggesting that Myt1 family proteins evolved later and recruited MuvB as their co-repressor. It is now tempting to speculate that Myt1 family factors, alongside MuvB co-repressor complex, may comprise an ancestral core module for generating neurons from non-neuronal cells.</p></sec><sec

In brief, for insertion of GFP or mCherry into endogenous genetic loci, GFP or mCherry was PCR amplified with primers containing homology arms for insertion sites as donor DNA for homologous recombination. Donor DNA was co-injected with gRNA (IDT), crRNA (IDT), and Cas9 enzyme (IDT) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paix et al., 2017</xref>). F1 generation animals were visually screened for presence of GFP or mCherry signals using Axioplan2 Fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). GFP or mCherry-positive animals were then homozygosed in F2 generation and verified by Sanger sequencing. For insertion of loxP sites into <italic>ztf-11</italic> locus, a co-conversion strategy was used as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arribere et al., 2014</xref>). Synthesized loxP sequence ssDNA with 60 bp homology arms flanking insertion sites (IDT) was used as donor DNA for homologous recombination. Donor DNA was co-injected with Cas9 expressing plasmid (pJW1259, kindly provided by Dr. Jordan Ward), sgRNA expressing vectors, dpy-10 targeting-gRNA, and dpy-10 donor DNA.

Embryos were imaged on a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 inverted microscope frame with Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk and an Olympus UPLSAPO 60xs silicone oil immersion objective. GFP and mCherry channels were acquired simultaneously on a pair of aligned EMCCD cameras (C9100-13). Image acquisition was performed using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Embryos were imaged every 75 s, with 30 z slices at 1 μm apart.

Z stacks and maximum-intensity projections were generated using ImageJ (NIH). The imaging was not done by an experimenter blind to the experimental condition. Fluorescence intensity measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) were quantified using ImageJ (NIH). Quantification for cell identity markers were performed using Axioplan2 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss) with a Plan-Apochromat 40x/1.3 NA objective.

The genotype of each assayed animals were determined after each counting to circumvent potential bias.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RNA-seq sample preparation</title><p>Samples for RNA-seq was prepared by feeding RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Timmons et al., 2001</xref>). In brief, animals were harvested from NGM plates and eggs were collected by bleaching. Eggs were hatched overnight in M9 media to get synchronized L1 larval culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Porta-de-la-Riva et al., 2012</xref>). Synchronized L1 cultures were inoculated on plates expressing feeding RNAi clones for <italic>ztf-11</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kamath and Ahringer, 2003</xref>) (Dr. Julie Ahringer) or a control vector (L4440). After 64 hr, adult worms bearing eggs were harvested and eggs were collected by careful bleaching. Eggs were incubated in M9 for 3 hr to allow them to develop into gastrula stages. Egg shell was disturbed with chymotrypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) and chitinase (Sigma-Aldrich) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edgar and Goldstein, 2012</xref>) and lysed by centrifuging through QiaShredder columns (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was isolated from the eggs using RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Resulting RNA samples were quality controlled by Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and only the RNA samples with RIN of 9 or higher were submitted for library preparation. mRNA libraries were prepared by Stanford Genome Sequencing Center using TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina). Four biological replicates representing independent cultures of <italic>C. elegans</italic> on independently prepared feeding RNAi were performed for each sample in this study.</p><p>RNA-seq and computational analysis mRNA libraries were pooled and paired-end sequenced for 100 bp, resulting in 40 million raw reads per sample.

In brief, <italic>C. elegans</italic> grown on twenty 15 cm dishes were collected and washed, then dropped in liquid nitrogen to form ‘worm pearls.’ Worm pearls (50 mg wet weight) were thawed in 250 ul lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.7, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 250 mM Sucrose, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, with protease inhibitors). After brief sonication on ice (3’ pulse with 30’ pause, six cycles) to break the cuticle, 100 mM NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 were added into solution and samples were rotated at 4°C for 1 hr. After centrifugation at 16,000 g for 15 min, supernatants were transferred to new tubes and measured by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for total protein concentration. Worm lysates from different samples were adjusted to 7 mg/ml concentration by lysis buffer and used for SiMPull. Briefly, normalized lysates were incubated on quartz slides pre-coated with or without biotinylated anti-GFP antibodies (Rockland immunochemicals) to pull down ZTF-11::GFP, after washing away unbound sample, mCherry signals were recorded to visualize captured ZTF-11 binding partners. mCherry tagged proteins immobilized on the slides were visualized by a TIRF microscope equipped with excitation laser 561 nm, and DV2 dichroic 565dcxr dual-view emission filters (520/30 nm and 630/50 nm). Mean spot counts per image and standard deviation were calculated from images taken from 5 to 17 different regions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, NIH R37 NS048392, and NIH T32 GM007276.</p><p>Some strains were provided by the CGC, which is funded by NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (P40 OD010440), and the MITANI Lab through the National Bio-Resource Project of the MEXT, Japan.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing Editor, eLife</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Supervision, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Supervision, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46703.040</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Embryonic cell lineages expressing ZTF-11, up to 350-cell stage and their postmitotic identities.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46703-supp1-v1.jpg"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46703.041</object-id><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Differentially expressed genes in <italic>ztf-11</italic> knockdown embryos.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-46703-supp2-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46703.042</object-id><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Strains used for this study.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-46703-supp3-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46703.043</object-id><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>DNA constructs and oligos used for this study.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-46703-supp4-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46703.044</object-id><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-46703-transrepform-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Sequencing data have been deposited in GEO under accession code GSE125694.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: John Murray (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper reports that a member of the Myt1 family of zinc finger transcription factors functions in <italic>C. elegans</italic> drives neurogenic fate while simultaneously blocking epidermal traits. This finding is exciting because Myt1 is routinely used to induce trans-differentiation of mammalian skin cells into neuroblasts. Remarkably, this work shows that ZTF-11, the sole Myt1 homolog in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, is also sufficient to transform epidermal precursors into neurons. Moreover, Lee et al. show that ZTF-11 drives an epidermal to neuronal trans-differentiation event that occurs during normal <italic>C. elegans</italic> development. These findings indicate that ZTF-11/Myt1 function is likely evolutionarily conserved and thus investigations that exploit the experimental tractability of <italic>C. elegans</italic> can effectively advance our understanding of the mechanism Myt1 function in mammals. The work deploys powerful experimental tools including a clever strategy for a conditional knockout of the ZTF-11/Myt1 locus that monitors an intrinsic GFP signal to detect cell-specific knockdown. In a first for any metazoan, the cell specific and temporal expression of ZTF-11 throughout embryonic development is defined by time-lapse imaging. Genetic methods also place <italic>ztf-11</italic> in a transcriptional cascade involving the proneural transcription factor genes <italic>lin-22</italic>/Hairy and <italic>lin-32</italic>/Achaete-Scute and demonstrate physical interaction with the conserved MuvB co-repressor complex.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Generally, the authors need to be commended for this very rigorous analysis. However, a number of loose ends were identified that the authors should tie up:</p><p>1) The ability of <italic>ztf-11</italic> to induce neuronal fates in V1-4 (in a <italic>lin-32</italic>-dependent manner) is a little unexpected given that <italic>ztf-11</italic> is a target of <italic>lin-32</italic> in V5. The authors need to test whether <italic>ztf-11</italic> and <italic>lin-32</italic> cross-regulate, i.e. (a) is the ability of <italic>ztf-11</italic> to induce neuronal fates in V1-4 accompanied by turning on <italic>lin-32</italic> expression and (b) in the V5 lineage, does <italic>lin-32</italic> also depend on <italic>ztf-11</italic> (feedback loop; in Figure 4A<italic>ztf-11</italic> expression appears to commence before <italic>lin-32</italic>, so the regulation of <italic>ztf-11</italic> by <italic>lin-32</italic> is perhaps the feedback). This is trivial thing to test and given the genetic <italic>lin-32</italic>-dependence such feedback almost has to exist.</p><p>2) An alternative explanation should be considered for results reported in Figure 6, in which pan neuronal marker gene is fully expressed in embryos homozygous for a <italic>ztf-11</italic> null allele. The authors conclude from this result that <italic>ztf-11</italic> is not necessary for differentiation of embryonic neurons. The problem with this interpretation is that it overlooks the more likely explanation of a maternal effect. The <italic>ztf-11</italic>(0) allele used for this experiment is lethal at the first larval stage and therefore must be maintained with a balancer chromosome. Thus, embryos that are homozygous for the <italic>ztf-11</italic> null allele will have maternal <italic>ztf-11</italic> mRNA that could be sufficient to sustain neuronal fate in the embryo but not for later stages that depend on zygotic expression. The authors should (a) use global <italic>ztf-11</italic> RNAi (see Figure 8) to knockdown maternal <italic>ztf-11</italic> mRNA in the balanced <italic>ztf-11</italic> strain; or alternatively, (b) in which the rescue the <italic>ztf-11</italic> null phenotype with a non-complex <italic>ztf-11</italic> array (e.g. fosmid), mark the array with a marker that labels P1 descendant (say <italic>myo-3</italic>), find animals with dorsal/ventral bwm loss (= P2 loss = loss in germline), then score their non-transgenic offspring (larvally arrested animals).</p><p>3) While the analysis of several postembryonic neuronal fates is very elegantly and well done, it is quite restricted. Plus, the analysis of neuronal identity in the embryo is not quite up to par to the quality of the analysis of postembryonic fates. The authors’ work hints at an extremely intriguing possibility that is mentioned by the authors but not very well carved out and broadly enough probed: is <italic>ztf-11</italic> function in neurogenesis restricted to those cases where the ectoblast from which the neuron is derived already is a somewhat differentiated cell? That's indeed obvious in the Y to PDA transdifferentiation event. But it's also the case of the V cells – which are also polarized differentiated skin cells which essentially &quot;transdifferentiate&quot; to generate things like the postdeirid. In such cases a gene like <italic>ztf-11</italic> is apparently required to &quot;wipe out&quot; the non-neuronal state. But is this really true for all postembryonically generated neurons that come from such a differentiated epidermal state?

However, a number of loose ends were identified that the authors should tie up:</p><p>1) The ability of ztf-11 to induce neuronal fates in V1-4 (in a lin-32-dependent manner) is a little unexpected given that ztf-11 is a target of lin-32 in V5. The authors need to test whether ztf-11 and lin-32 cross-regulate, i.e. (a) is the ability of ztf-11 to induce neuronal fates in V1-4 accompanied by turning on lin-32 expression and (b) in the V5 lineage, does lin-32 also depend on ztf-11 (feedback loop; in Figure 4A ztf-11 expression appears to commence before lin-32, so the regulation of ztf-11 by lin-32 is perhaps the feedback). This is trivial thing to test and given the genetic lin-32-dependence such feedback almost has to exist.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the possibility of feedback loop between LIN-32 and ZTF-11, we have now investigated LIN-32 expression in ectopic neurons induced by ZTF-11 misexpression in V1-4. We found that misexpression of ZTF-11 can indeed turn on LIN-32 in those ectopic neurons (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Since ectopic expression of <italic>ztf-11</italic> in V1-4 only induced ectopic neurons at a penetrance, we also examined the ZTF-11::GFP positive cells that do not show neuronal morphology and found that they did not turn on LIN-32 (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Based on these results, we conclude that ZTF-11 can, in some contexts, induce expression of LIN-32 which leads generation of the ectopic neurons. As for the second point, we have already provided data suggesting that LIN-32 expression is independent on ZTF-11 where we show that the intensity of LIN-32 transcriptional reporter in V5 lineage is unchanged in ZTF-11 conditional knock-out (Figure 8F-G). In summary, these data suggest that the endogenous LIN-32 expression is likely independent of ZTF-11. However, ectopic expression of ZTF-11 might induce LIN-32 in specific context to induce neurogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) An alternative explanation should be considered for results reported in Figure 6, in which pan neuronal marker gene is fully expressed in embryos homozygous for a ztf-11 null allele. The authors conclude from this result that ztf-11 is not necessary for differentiation of embryonic neurons. The problem with this interpretation is that it overlooks the more likely explanation of a maternal effect. The ztf-11(0) allele used for this experiment is lethal at the first larval stage and therefore must be maintained with a balancer chromosome. Thus, embryos that are homozygous for the ztf-11 null allele will have maternal ztf-11 mRNA that could be sufficient to sustain neuronal fate in the embryo but not for later stages that depend on zygotic expression. The authors should (a) use global ztf-11 RNAi (see Figure 8) to knockdown maternal ztf-11 mRNA in the balanced ztf-11 strain; or alternatively, (b) in which the rescue the ztf-11 null phenotype with a non-complex ztf-11 array (e.g. fosmid), mark the array with a marker that labels P1 descendant (say myo-3), find animals with dorsal/ventral bwm loss (= P2 loss = loss in germline), then score their non-transgenic offspring (larvally arrested animals).</p></disp-quote><p>To address the potential maternal contribution of ZTF-11 from the balanced mothers, we have further globally knocked-down <italic>ztf-11</italic> in the balanced mothers and scored their <italic>ztf-11</italic> null offspring. We used identical feeding RNAi clone that we have previously used to knock down ZTF-11::GFP during our RNA-seq experiments (~75% knockdown was observed with ZTF-11::GFP). We then counted the number of embryonic ventral cord motor neurons and found no significant changes compared to the <italic>ztf-11</italic> null mutants (from heterozygous mother) without feeding RNAi (Figure 7B). We have attempted the alternative approach suggested by the reviewer as well but could not generate a stable <italic>ztf-11</italic> rescue transgenic lines in the allocated time for revision experiments. Even so, we have noticed rare balancer-negative transgenic F1 animals which gave rise to arrested L1 offspring. These L1 worms still showed <italic>rab-3</italic>::GFP in many head neurons (no data shown). Based on these results, our data suggests that the lack of embryonic <italic>ztf-11</italic> phenotype is unlikely to be due to maternal contributions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While the analysis of several postembryonic neuronal fates is very elegantly and well done, it is quite restricted. Plus, the analysis of neuronal identity in the embryo is not quite up to par to the quality of the analysis of postembryonic fates. The authors’ work hints at an extremely intriguing possibility that is mentioned by the authors but not very well carved out and broadly enough probed: is ztf-11 function in neurogenesis restricted to those cases where the ectoblast from which the neuron is derived already is a somewhat differentiated cell? That's indeed obvious in the Y to PDA transdifferentiation event. But it's also the case of the V cells – which are also polarized differentiated skin cells which essentially &quot;transdifferentiate&quot; to generate things like the postdeirid. In such cases a gene like ztf-11 is apparently required to &quot;wipe out&quot; the non-neuronal state. But is this really true for all postembryonically generated neurons that come from such a differentiated epidermal state? In contrast, in the embryo, neural precursors don't go through such a differentiated state – and indeed ztf-11 does not appear to have much of a role in embryonic neurogenesis. The authors do of course recognize this, but could word this issue more crisply. For example, they say: &quot;these results indicate that ztf-11 is particularly important for neurons that are generated from an established epidermal lineage&quot;. &quot;established&quot; is not very clear – they should say that these are cells that have fully differentiated by a number of different criteria.</p><p>Anyway, that's potentially the most exciting point of the manuscript but the authors need to take a closer look at this potential dichotomy with a few more markers for embryonic and postembryonic neurons.

We crossed the <italic>ztf-11</italic> mutant into multiple markers, which label the postembryonic neuroectoblast lineages including Q, K, and G1. Animals were synchronized to early L1 by bleaching and then fed for 20 hours to allow development into late L1 stages. We then scored the expression of respective cell fate markers and found that postembryonic neurons born during L1, AVM/PVM, DVB, and RMH were indeed lost (Figure 6A-F) in <italic>ztf-11</italic> null. We did note that the number of UNC-86 expressing cells were reduced in the lumbar ganglion, potentially due to loss of T cell descendants (no data shown). Unfortunately, we found it challenging to reliably identify UNC-86-expressing postembryonic neurons (AQR/PQR, and T cell descendants) due to presence of nearby neurons and potential migration defects. In addition, we have looked into Pn lineage descendants which give rise to many ventral cord motor neurons (VMNs). We generated the <italic>ztf-11</italic> conditional KO (<italic>ztf-11</italic> cKO) mutant by crossing <italic>dpy-7</italic> epidermal Cre into floxed <italic>ztf-11</italic> allele. Interestingly, we found that the serotonergic VC4-5 neurons to be strongly affected by <italic>ztf-11</italic> cKO (<italic>cat-1</italic> staining lost in ~90% of animals). In cholinergic or GABAergic neurons, the phenotype was much weaker (<italic>unc-17/unc-47</italic> staining lost in ~20% and ~5% of animals respectively) (Figure 6G-H).</p><p>We have also systemically examined embryonic head neurons in <italic>ztf-11</italic> null mutants. We attempted to use an ImageJ plugin to automatically count confocal Z-stack images of a Pan neuronal marker in L1 animals. However, this method produced numbers that are dramatically fewer than expected in the wild type L1s, likely due to small size of early L1 animals. In the light of this technical difficulty, we performed manual counting of head neurons of 4 major neurotransmitter systems in wild type and <italic>ztf-11</italic> null animals. We could not find differences between wildtype and <italic>ztf-11</italic> null animals, which strengthened our previous conclusion that ZTF-11 was dispensable for embryonic neurogenesis (Figure 7C-F). Taken together, we have provided evidence that ZTF-11 is distinctively required for neurogenesis from multiple neuroectoblast lineages (we examined 6 out of 9 neuroectoblast lineages in worms) rather than embryonic neurogenesis. We have also worded this conclusion more visible in the manuscript as well.</p></body></sub-article></article>
