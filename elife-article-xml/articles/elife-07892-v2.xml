Analysis of visibly ataxic <italic>Purkinje cell degeneration</italic> (<italic>pcd</italic>) mice reveals that while differences in the forward motion of individual paws are fully accounted for by changes in walking speed and body size, more complex 3D trajectories and, especially, inter-limb and whole-body coordination are specifically impaired. Moreover, the coordination deficits in <italic>pcd</italic> are consistent with a failure to predict and compensate for the consequences of movement across the body. These results isolate specific impairments in whole-body coordination in mice and provide a quantitative framework for understanding cerebellar contributions to coordinated locomotion.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07892.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07892.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07892.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Though it seems simple, walking is a complex activity. The arms, legs, body, and head all need to work together. A part of the brain called the cerebellum helps to coordinate the movements of different body parts allowing both simple and complex tasks to be carried out smoothly. But it is not known exactly how the cerebellum coordinates body movements.</p><p>Studies of mice have helped shed some light on the coordination of movement. Several mutations that naturally occur in mice can cause them to walk abnormally. These mutations often cause changes in the cerebellum. Neuroscientists studying these mutant mice often use balance beams or other challenging tasks to compare their coordination with typical mice. But studies attempting to measure specific changes in walking movements under natural conditions have yielded conflicting results.</p><p>Now, Machado, Darmohray et al. have demonstrated that an automated movement-tracking system can capture specific aspects of coordination in freely walking mice. The system, called ‘LocoMouse’, uses high-speed cameras and computers to document and analyze the paw, nose, and tail movements of mice walking through a glass hallway. In the experiments, the system was used to compare typical mice with mice that have a mutation affecting the cerebellum that causes them to walk abnormally.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Machado, Darmohray et al. found that forward steps of the mutant mice are comparable to the steps of the typical mice, if you account for the fact that the mutant mice are smaller and slower. Instead, however, the mutants were found to have specific difficulties coordinating movement across the body. The movements of the mutant mice's front and hind paws, for example, did not follow the same coordinated pattern as the typical mice. The mutant mice also swung their head and tail in an exaggerated way. Machado, Darmohray et al.'s analysis revealed that these movements likely resulted from a failure of the cerebellum of the mutant mice to predict and compensate for the motion of the rest of the body. Other scientists will now likely use the LocoMouse system to study mouse movements and how the brain controls them.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07892.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07892.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>ataxia</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>Purkinje cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Starting Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carey</surname><given-names>Megan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Early Career Scientist</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carey</surname><given-names>Megan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darmohray</surname><given-names>Dana M</given-names></name><name><surname>Machado</surname><given-names>Ana S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of 3D paw kinematics and whole-body coordination in freely walking mice isolates specific features of gait ataxia and supports the hypothesis that the cerebellum provides an internal forward model for motor control.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Our ability to engage in even the simplest motor tasks requires us to coordinate our movements in space and time across the body. For example, during walking, leg, arm, trunk, and head movements need to be coordinated to achieve a stable, smooth, and efficient gait. The cerebellum is critical for coordinated locomotion; cerebellar damage leads to characteristic gait ataxia across species. Exactly how the cerebellum contributes to motor coordination, however, remains controversial.</p><p>Mice present several advantages for understanding the role of the cerebellum in locomotor coordination. In addition to their amenability to genetic circuit dissection, their small size makes it possible to analyze even unrestrained, relatively complex whole-body actions within a laboratory setting. Moreover, several spontaneous mutants have been identified based on visible gait ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mullen et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Walter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lalonde and Strazielle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cendelin, 2014</xref>). These mutants exhibit abnormal cell patterning within the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lalonde and Strazielle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brooks and Dunnett, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sheets et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cendelin, 2014</xref>). While traditional gait analyses in ataxic mutants have reported a variety of impairments in individual limb movements and interlimb coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fortier et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vinueza Veloz et al., 2014</xref>), many of these findings are not specific to ataxia and could represent secondary consequences of changes in walking speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batka et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore it has not been clear to what extent exisiting analyses of mouse locomotion capture the essence of the coordination deficits of ataxic mice that are so visible to the human eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cendelin et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Here we describe LocoMouse, a novel system for automated, markerless, 3D tracking of locomotor kinematics in freely walking mice. We used LocoMouse to establish a quantitative framework for locomotor coordination in mice and analyze the deficits of visibly ataxic <italic>Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd)</italic> mutants. Surprisingly, we find that the forward motion of individual paws is normal in <italic>pcd</italic>—apparent differences in basic stride parameters and forward trajectories disappeared once changes in body size and walking speed were taken into account. In contrast, 3D paw trajectories, interlimb and whole-body coordination were specifically impaired. Moreover, the prominent nose and tail oscillations observed in <italic>pcd</italic> were successfully modeled as passive consequences of the forward motion of the hind limbs, suggesting the absence of a mechanism that normally predicts and compensates for movements of other parts of the body. Taken together, these results suggest a specific failure to predict the consequences of movement across joints, limbs, and body, and are consistent with the hypothesis that the cerebellum provides a forward model for motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ebner and Pasalar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LocoMouse: a system for quantifying locomotor coordination</title><p>The noninvasive, markerless LocoMouse system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) uses high-speed cameras and machine learning algorithms to automatically detect and track the position of paws, nose, and tail in 3D with high (2.5 ms) temporal resolution.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07892.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>LocoMouse system for analyzing mouse locomotor coordination.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) LocoMouse apparatus.

Each parameter measured, including stride length, cadence, swing velocity, and stance duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>), varied consistently with the walking speed of the mouse. Cadence and stride length increased with walking speed, indicating that faster walking in mice is associated with longer, more frequent strides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clarke and Still, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lalonde and Strazielle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batka et al., 2014</xref>).

Then we generated a multilevel linear mixed-effects model that included potential predictor variables speed, weight, body length, age, and gender either alone or in combination and asked to what extent they accurately predicted the measured parameter. This analysis revealed that the value of each stride parameter was readily predicted based solely on walking speed and body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). While basic stride parameters also varied with gender and age, these effects were related to differences in body size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>); adding neither age nor gender improved the predictions once body size was taken into account.

A similar model for the nose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) was also consistent with a time-delayed (96 ms) side-to-side nose movement in <italic>pcd</italic>. Importantly, these oscillations cannot be accounted for by differences in hind limbs between control and <italic>pcd</italic>, because: (1) hindpaw alternation is unaltered in <italic>pcd</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>); (2) hindlimb double support is unaltered in pcd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>); and (3) though the base of support is wider in <italic>pcd</italic>, the model predicts that this difference alone would result in smaller, not larger tail oscillations in <italic>pcd</italic>.

Mice walk freely and naturally across the corridor and throughput is maximized via fully automated data collection and analysis. The high spatiotemporal resolution provides detailed 3D paw kinematics. LocoMouse also tracks nose and tail movements during locomotion, which have not been previously reported in freely walking mice. While the automated tracking algorithm does not measure joint angles, these can be incorporated either through hand-labeling or potentially with the use of additional markers.</p><p>We exploited the large, multidimensional dataset generated by LocoMouse to establish a quantitative framework for analyzing locomotor coordination in freely walking mice. There were two key features of our approach that allowed us to isolate specific deficits of ataxia. The first was quantitatively accounting for variability across strides and mice. Although individual strides at first appeared quite variable across our diverse set of wildtype mice, we found that wildtype paw kinematics were readily and quantitatively predictable based on walking speed and body size, even down to the level of 3D trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, we placed particular emphasis on quantifying coordination across the body.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A quantitative framework for locomotor coordination reveals fundamental features of mouse gait ataxia</title><p>The statistical models we developed based on a library of data from wildtype mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) accurately predicted the forward paw motion of ataxic <italic>pcd</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This indicates that observed differences in basic stride parameters were a secondary consequence of differences in body size and walking speed. Further, the forward motion of individual paws was indistinguishable from that of size- and speed-matched controls, down to the level of detailed paw trajectories. This important result highlights that failure to account for differences in walking speed and body size when comparing data across mice and strides can lead to nonspecific effects being misinterpreted as symptoms of ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koopmans et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cendelin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wuehr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batka et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, it is likely that by focusing primarily on the forward movement of individual paws, many existing analyses fail to capture the fundamental features of ataxia.</p><p>While differences in forward paw motion could be fully accounted for by differences in walking speed and body size, in contrast, off-axis paw trajectories, interlimb, and whole-body coordination revealed specific patterns of impairment in <italic>pcd</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5 fig6">Figures 4–6</xref>). Differences in off-axis movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggest that <italic>pcd</italic> mice, like human cerebellar patients, are unable to coordinate movements across joints within the limb to perform normal strides in 3D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Earhart and Bastian, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al., 1996</xref>). Further, <italic>pcd</italic> mice exhibited impaired spatial and temporal coordination of movements across the four limbs, nose, and tail. Interestingly, while front-hind paw coupling was dramatically altered in <italic>pcd</italic>, left-right alternation was preserved entirely, consistent with the idea that such alternation is generated within the spinal cord itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kiehn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dougherty et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, the large, oscillatory nose and tail movements observed in <italic>pcd</italic> were not just random, but were successfully modeled as a failure to predict and compensate for the passive consequences of forward motion of the hind limbs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cerebellar contributions to coordinated movement</title><p>The major neuroanatomical finding in <italic>pcd</italic> is the complete postnatal degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells and subsequent loss of granule cells and related structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mullen et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lalonde and Strazielle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morton and Bastian, 2007</xref>). In light of these extensive anatomical defects and the existing body of literature on mouse ataxia, the remarkable preservation of forward paw motion in <italic>pcd</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) was surprising. Moreover, previous studies have associated Purkinje cell modulation with the step cycle of individual limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong and Edgley, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edgley and Lidierth, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Udo et al., 2004</xref>) and movement kinematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pasalar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heiney et al., 2014</xref>). The most likely interpretation of the surprisingly intact forward paw motion in <italic>pcd</italic> is that it reflects the presence of inevitable compensatory mechanisms resulting from the chronic loss of Purkinje cells. Given this capacity for compensation, the specific and persistent impairments in multi-joint, interlimb, and whole-body coordination in <italic>pcd</italic> are particularly striking.</p><p>While many lines of evidence suggest that the cerebellum provides internal models for motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wolpert et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ito, 2008</xref>), there has been disagreement about the nature of these models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ebner and Pasalar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Medina, 2011</xref>). Studies from some systems, including eye movements, have suggested that the cerebellum acts as an inverse model that computes a command to achieve desired movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shidara et al., 1993</xref>). Other work, particularly on reaching movements, the cerebellar-like nuclei of electric fish, and locomotor adaptation, has suggested that the cerebellum provides a forward model that predicts the consequences of movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pasalar et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morton and Bastian, 2006</xref>). These predictions can then be used to optimize joint angle combinations within a limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al., 1996</xref>), synchronize interlimb coordination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), or to cancel out the unintended passive consequences of movements of other parts of the body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We found that while on-axis paw kinematics are preserved in the absence of cerebellar cortical output, the ability to predict and actively cancel the passive consequences of movements of other parts of the body appears to be beyond the limits of compensatory mechanisms available to <italic>pcd</italic> mice. Therefore our results raise the intriguing possibility that the absence of forward models, rather than a failure to execute appropriate movement kinematics per se, could form the basis for impaired coordination associated with gait ataxia in mice.</p><p>Although cerebellar involvement is a shared feature across ataxic mouse mutants, the details of the motor phenotypes are different for different mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lalonde and Strazielle, 2007</xref>). Similarly, patients with cerebellar damage exhibit varying degrees and features of ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morton and Bastian, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). Given the diversity of cerebellar phenotypes, it is likely that the specific features of gait ataxia will vary across mouse models. The novel quantitative framework for mouse locomotion presented here highlights the importance of considering 3D, interlimb and whole-body coordination and dissociating them from the control of individual paw kinematics, particularly when analyzing cerebellar contributions to locomotion. Together with the sophisticated genetic tools available for manipulating neural circuits in mice, the current approach makes mouse locomotion a powerful system for investigating the neural control of coordinated movement and establishing relationships between neural circuit activity and behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures were reviewed and performed in accordance with the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown Ethics Committee guidelines, and approved by the Portuguese Direcção Geral de Veterinária (Ref.

Infrared sensors positioned along the runway automatically triggered the camera and acquisition software once the mouse entered the corridor and stopped the acquisition once the mouse reached the other end of the corridor or after 25 s.</p><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Data collection</title><p>Mice were handled by the experimenter and allowed to acclimate in the LocoMouse setup for several minutes on multiple occasions before data collection. Animals were weighed before each session. Mice walked freely between two dark boxes on either end of the glass corridor. The automatic triggering system was critical for allowing mice to self-initiate trials, which reduced animal stress without compromising the quantity of data collected. No food or water restriction or reward was used.</p><p>10-15 corridor passages (trials) were collected in each of five daily sessions. A total of 36,369 strides were collected from wildtype controls, which corresponds to 1069 ± 266 strides per mouse and 267 ± 66 strides per paw. For <italic>pcd</italic> and littermates we collected an average of 4252 ± 778 strides per <italic>pcd</italic> mouse (1063 ± 32 strides per animal per paw) and 1310 ± 934 strides per littermate mouse (328 ± 11 strides per animal per paw). Animals were not required to walk continuously throughout a trial; if the animal stopped mid-trial, the data before and after the halt were still analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Data acquisition</title><p>Movies were collected at 400 frames per second with a spatial resolution of 1440x250 pixels. Acquisition software was written in Labview and uses 2 National Instruments boards (PCIe 1433 and BNC 2120) to record and save the movies, in real time. The tracking algorithm and data analysis software were written in Matlab (Mathworks) and performed offline.

The algorithm's output was the set of 3D coordinates of the features of interest, which were: the center of each of the four paws, the snout, and the tail divided into 15 points, for each frame of the movies. The output of the tracking system was visually inspected for each trial. Fewer than 10% of the trials were excluded due to tracking failure (typically due to exploration or grooming behavior that resulted in erroneous swing and stance point detection). Further validation of the automated tracking performance is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>We used hand labeled data to train linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers for each feature and each view (side and bottom) independently. Positive examples were hand labeled on a set of 81 images from a single training video while 10 negative examples for each feature were randomly picked from the same images. Training the 6 SVM classifiers took approximately 1 hr on a machine with an Intel Core i7-3770 CPU and 16 GB or RAM. All experiments were performed with these SVM classifiers with no need to retrain on additional data. For each trial, the candidate locations for each feature were obtained by filtering the input images with the trained detectors. For the paws and snout, the resulting image regions were clustered into a small number of point locations using a standard non-maxima suppression algorithm. Once the candidate features were identified by the SVM, we considered the temporal trajectories and selected the candidate tracks that maximized per image detection scores while minimizing frame-by-frame displacement with a method based on existing multi-target tracking frameworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Russell et al., 2011</xref>) that formulate tracking as the maximum a posteriori probability estimation over a Bayesian network of candidate locations on each image. Best bottom view tracks (x and y) were computed first and then the best side view track (z, accounting for image distortion from the optics) that matched the bottom view track was selected. For the tail, the interest regions were matched across views and the largest resulting 3D region was picked as the final detection. The tail was detected independently for every image. Following computation of feature tracks, pixel values were converted to millimeters for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Detailed description</title><p>The LocoMouse Tracker code developed and used in this paper has been deposited at GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/careylab/LocoMouse">https://github.com/careylab/LocoMouse</ext-link>) and updated versions are available through our website.

Some auxiliary packages can be found at the Matlab Central File Exchange (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/">http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/</ext-link>).

To remove the background we subtracted this image from every frame recorded by the system. To correct for image distortion we recorded a video of a white spherical object moving along the full volume of the glass corridor. The two projections of the object were detected by thresholding the (grayscale) image at 80% (after removing the background). The horizontal line splitting the image into the bottom and side views was defined manually at this point. The corrective image transformation makes the bottom and side projections of the object match along the vertical line and was computed via least squares. The corrective transformation depends on the position of the camera relative to the setup and was performed once for every configuration. Unless stated otherwise, all steps of the algorithm are performed on corrected images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2-2"><title>Computing bounding box around mouse</title><p>We further isolated the mouse by computing a tight bounding box around it. We started by thresholding every input image at 10% and using a median filter to remove noise. For every image, the edges of the box are defined as the first and last rows and columns to have white pixels. To account for occlusions and noise, the final size of the bounding box was defined as the smaller of the mean size plus three standard deviations, and the maximum observed size. The final trajectory of the bounding box over the video was determined by filtering the box position calculated for each image with a moving average filter of width 5. All further steps in detecting the interest features were performed within the bounding box.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2-3"><title>Training the detectors</title><p>Feature detectors for the paws, snout and tail were trained using the LIBSVM library. Positive examples were manually annotated on a set of 81 training images from a single movie. The size of the detectors was chosen manually such that the feature lied within the detector box. Each view was treated independently, unless otherwise stated. The sizes of the different feature detectors can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07892.020</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Image feature size</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07892.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07892.020</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Bottom view size (in pixels)</th><th>Side view size (in pixels)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Paw</td><td>30 x 30</td><td>20 x 30</td></tr><tr><td>Snout</td><td>40 x 40</td><td>20 x 40</td></tr><tr><td>Tail segments</td><td>30 x 30</td><td>25 x 30</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>The system assumes mice move from left to right.

These filters provided a score representing the likelihood of a pixel being part of each feature (paw or snout). These per-pixel scores were reduced into a small number of candidate locations with a standard Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vision.ucsd.edu/%7Epdollar/toolbox/doc/">http://vision.ucsd.edu/∼pdollar/toolbox/doc/</ext-link>) which clusters positively classified pixels into local maxima. Since on the side view there is considerable overlap between the features, we used a more conservative version of the NMS algorithm, which results in more candidate locations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2-5"><title>Combining bottom and side view candidates</title><p>The 2D candidate locations from each view were combined into 3D candidates by matching their coordinates on the shared axis (horizontal axis). As exact matches do not occur, we used a tolerance of 30% of the feature's detector size along the horizontal axis for matching.</p><p>We allowed each bottom view candidate to be matched to many side view candidates, but each side view candidate was only (generally) matched to a single bottom view candidate. In ambiguous configurations, additional information about the velocity of the candidates was used to find the best match. Candidates were classified as moving/not moving according to the pixel count within the feature box size after subtracting the previous input image to the current image. When candidates could not be disambiguated, both options were allowed to remain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2-6"><title>Computing feature tracks</title><p>We used location priors to distinguish between instances of the same class (e.g., to identify which paw was which). Based on the configuration of the corridor, the priors were defined as the inverse of the distance to the closest corner (i.e.on the bottom view, the front right paw is closer to the bottom right corner while the hind left paw is closer to the top left corner). The prior was defined on a normalized box which allows it to be fit to a bounding box of any size. Locations on the normalized box with a distance greater than 0.6 had their prior score set to zero.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2-7"><title>Multi-target tracking</title><p>After processing the candidate locations at each image, tracking on the bottom view was performed using the multi-target tracking algorithm of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Russell et al., 2011</xref>).

Your full submission has been evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All the reviewers find that the study is very interesting and that the method presented for monitoring locomotion in relation to the cerebellar motor function and other motor functions is potentially strong. There are, however, concerns whether the automation procedure is making correct assessments of the locomotor parameters, that gaits are not taken into accounts in the description, that there is a lack of statistical evaluation of intra-limb coordination, and that the differences in full body movements may not account completely for the phenotype. To meet these concerns would require substantial reanalysis of the data and reconsidering the main conclusions of the study. Even with a new analysis there is a feeling that the results presented will mainly be a technical advance rather than a conceptual advance for cerebellar motor function or the locomotor field at large. The reasons for this are that there already are cerebellar specific mutants that have been analyzed in similar ways and that the locomotor data in wild-type are confirmative and lacking gait parameters. For these reasons the manuscript as presently configured is not suitable as a regular paper in <italic>eLife</italic>. The details of the concerns and suggestions for improvements are detailed in the attached review reports.</p><p><italic>eLife</italic> has &quot;Tools and Resources&quot; that present methods papers. If you feel that you will be able to reanalyze the data as outlined and make a case that this method is better and more usable than other methods already published it might be an option for you to consider submitting your work in this form to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>The paper of Machado et al. introduces a camera-based motion capture system for the analysis of walking movements in the mouse. The heart of the system is machine learning operating on resampled images of high speed cameras for mice walking in a glass corridor. To illustrate its applicability, the paper compares the walking movements of wildtype and Purkinje cell degeneration (<italic>pcd</italic>) mice.</p><p>In general, for a paper introducing a novel analysis tool, I think it must be assessed whether the method provides measurements of highly useful parameters, with high explanatory value, that goes well beyond what has been attainable before. For instance, there was a very recent paper by Hoogland et al. (2015, Curr Biol.) introducing a method that is closely related to the present one (camera-based, measuring the paw positions as well as the whole body angle) and other measurement systems applied to locomotion exist in abundance, typically published alongside main scientific findings (for example, Kiehn 2013). To be clear, I think the authors have made a very careful and high-quality job, but I am doubtful that the advances provided here represent a major leap rather than a minor incremental change to the state-of-the art.</p><p>The paper promises to demonstrate a tool that can be used to monitor whole body coordination and 3D limb kinematics. But I find that the analysis of the whole body coordination boils down to computing the angle of the mid-body axis by utilizing the recorded position of the nose and tail, which is not particularly useful from a neuroscience perspective, as the angle is determined by the interplay of a very large number of muscles that could potentially change in different ways in a large number of deficits. In addition, data on the whole body movement is already provided in the solution of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoogland et al. (2015)</xref>. I also find that the stated monitoring of the 3D limb kinematics boils down to a monitoring of the 3D spatial position of the paw. But each position could theoretically be accomplished by many different configurations in the muscles of the limb, and the latter is the type of information that one would need to obtain a useful tool. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> seem at first glance to indicate that there is indeed some information on the limb joints – however, when I read the paper and the Methods, there are no indications that the joints are actually measured. Hence, I assume that the joint angles are computed out of the 3D paw data, which is problematic. First, if these angles are not measured but computed, the authors must explain where the data in their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> comes from. For the paper as a whole, this is a major problem since the main applicability of this setup would be if the user could actually track joint angles. Relying on computational models to deduce the 3D limb kinematics is very different from actually measuring it, and reduces the value of this method.</p><p>There are also some statements made about the analysis of pcd mice, claiming that this analysis supports that the cerebellum provides an internal model. But there is no evidence here that the cerebellum provides an internal model of any kind. What is seen here is only that block of the normal information processing pathway of various motor systems perturbs the capability of the central nervous system to rely on internal models. On the other hand, all biological motor control is feed-forward in nature, as it needs to deal with long delays, and feed-forward control can be solved only by using internal models. So the only thing learned from this study is that the normal function of the central nervous system in locomotion is dependent on a normally operating cerebellum. The internal models could be generated elsewhere, with the perturbed Purkinje cells destroying the capacity of the system as a whole by removing an otherwise permissive signal to any other system hypothetically responsible for generating/providing the internal model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>The authors developed a very nice method to quantify motor performance during free locomotion in mice. They show that in cerebellar ataxia coordination rather than individual movements are affected. This is an elegant and thorough study, but a number of points require attention:</p><p>1) The authors used Purkinje cell degeneration (<italic>pcd</italic>) mice to test for cerebellar ataxia. <italic>Pcd</italic> mice start to lose their Purkinje cells during early adulthood – however, later on, other defects appear e.g. the loss of thalamic neurons after P50 and subsequently more widespread neurodegeneration (see Fernandez-Gonzalez, Science 2002 and references cited therein). The use of <italic>pcd</italic> mice at ages varying between p41 and p154, therefore, is expected to result in heterogeneous stages of neurodegeneration. This is not addressed experimentally. Therefore, the authors have to present their data separately for different age groups – especially for mice younger than p50 (no extra-cerebellar neurodegeneration expected) and older (including thalamic and maybe even more neurodegeneration).</p><p>2) Dependence of gait parameters of individual limbs on weight and speed.</p><p>The authors provide an elegant analysis of the correlations between weight, speed and specific parameters of single-limb movements. As expected, many (if not all) parameters depend on speed. The effect of weight, however, is more prominent in some parameters than in others (e.g. compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C and 2E</xref>). The authors conclude that, given body weight and speed, they can make reasonably accurate predictions for single-limb movement parameters. However, the authors do not directly disentangle the impact of body weight vs. speed for each parameter. In other words, how much of the variation is explained by either one? Were there also gender- and/or age-related differences, or were these fully explained by variations in body weight (see Figure 2–figure supplement 2)?</p><p>3) Impact of speed for analyzing individual limb gait parameters in <italic>pcd</italic> mice.</p><p>The authors show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> that <italic>pcd</italic> mice make smaller, slower steps than wildtype littermates. They argue that, despite the actual values being different from controls, individual limb parameters are largely in line with those from control mice at similar speed and with similar weight. This is an important finding, but it would be informative to show the impact of body weight alone. In other words: it seems that the (on-axis) trajectory of single limbs is not really different between <italic>pcd</italic> and control mice, but what about the timing?</p><p>In addition, the off-axis movements do seem to be affected, but it is not fully clear to me to what extent corrections for body size and speed have been applied here. In the Discussion, I feel that a better balance between the preserved on-axis parameters and the affected off-axis parameters in the discussion would be warranted.</p><p>4) I feel that the remark &quot;the failure of existing systems to quantitatively capture gait ataxia&quot; (in the subsection “Interlimb and whole-body coordination are specifically impaired in <italic>pcd</italic>”) is a bit too strong and does not acknowledge the merits of previous quantifications (e.g. Erasmus Ladder and transparent disk treadmill, which both can also quantify interlimb coordination). Although the authors show that the trajectory of individual limbs is not grossly affected in <italic>pcd</italic> mice, the speed is (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). And the speed is in turn related to the velocity of single limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus, without neglecting the importance of the current study, stating that previous studies were not able to quantitate features of gait ataxia or interlimb coordination is in my opinion too strong. For possibilities of transparent disk treadmill to study interlimb coordination, please refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoogland et al., 2015</xref>, Current Biol). Here, the level of ataxia in tottering is not only quantified (including interlimb coordination), but also related to the level of complex spike synchrony. Please discuss this neurobiological mechanism upfront as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the technical possibilities of this disk treadmill system with respect to the current locomouse technology.</p><p>5) The authors show (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) that tail lateral movements of control mice have a sinusoidal appearance, related to the stride phase. This movement is largely exaggerated in <italic>pcd</italic> mice. Whereas the lateral movements in control mice are coupled to the stride phase, in the <italic>pcd</italic> mice there seems to be more of a coupling to the time. The tail movements could be either a compensatory mechanism to counteract imbalance due to improper limb control or they could be affected themselves, contributing to further imbalance. Currently, the variations in tail movements are not really taken into account. Could the authors provide a more solid analysis showing whether tail movements are compensatory or affected by themselves?</p><p>6) In the Discussion, the authors mention that previous studies lack the fine-grained detail used in this work and therefore focused on &quot;markers for global motor dysfunction [but] they lack specificity&quot; (subsection “A quantitative framework for locomotor coordination”). Now that the authors have developed such a beautiful system: what is the effect of cerebellar ataxia? How does this separate from other motor dysfunctions (e.g. muscular dystrophy)?</p><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the authors showed the step-cycle for four limb movements by indicating the stance onset for each paw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and the support pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, I find it still difficult to understand the phase relationship between limbs with regard to swing and stance phase. For example, to what extent does the onset of the swing phase of the forelimb occur during the swing or stance phase of the ipsilateral hindlimb? In order to have a better interpretation of inter-limb coordination, it might be worthwhile to add an additional figure with swing and stance phase indicated for each individual limb.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors of this study have developed an automated kinematic analysis of locomotion in mice. They use it for locomotor analysis in freely moving wild-type mice. A detailed description of locomotor parameters allowed them to create a mathematical model to predict most of the parameters knowing just the walking speed and the body size of the animal. They extend this analysis to a mouse model for Purkinje cell degeneration (<italic>pcd</italic>). They conclude that the traditional locomotor parameters (stride length, cadence, intra-limb coordination) and forward trajectories are not different in wild-type mice and <italic>pcd</italic> mice. In contrast they conclude that the whole-body coordination is specifically impaired in <italic>pcd</italic> mice. Furthermore, a specific description of nose and tail oscillations in <italic>pcd</italic> mice were modeled as passive consequences of the forward motion of the hindlimbs. The main conclusions from the study are: a) only by studying whole-body coordination will it be possible to reveal the ataxic locomotor phenotype, and b) the observed locomotor changes are consistent with the hypothesis that the cerebellum provides a forward model for motor control. Although I find the study of great interest there are a number of issues that are problematic for the interpretation of the data. The authors will have to address these issues to avoid making incorrect statements about the findings and the method used.</p><p>1) The authors make a big deal out of using machine learning as an 'objective' way of measuring locomotor parameters. But there seems to be a lot of noise in the detection. This is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. Where is the level set for step onset and offset? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> is an even stronger case. At very low speed (&lt;0.4) the stride length varies with a factor of 10 from 1 cm to 10 cm. 10 cm long stride lengths are not common at these speeds in mice. It must be a detection mistake. Also there are many values with very low stride lengths spread over all speeds. One would like to know how much irrelevant noise that the automated procedure introduces for example by showing traces from the low speed locomotion with 1 cm and 10 cm stride lengths. Everything in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is known from many previous studies of rodent locomotion – so there is nothing new about it except that the authors have analyzed a large amount of steps.</p><p>2) The authors make a point out of not seeing any intralimb differences between wild-type and <italic>pcd</italic> mice. Looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> this referee is not convinced, and it seems that this statement that is likely to be wrong. There seems to be clear differences in almost all parameters. Statistical tests will be needed to support the claims.</p><p>3) A main conclusion is that the interlimb coordination changes from wild-type to <italic>pcd</italic> mice. More specifically from a trot to a walk pattern. Walking and trotting patterns have been described for tetrapods to be distinct gaits by many different studies. They are visible at different speeds of locomotion. In your experiments wild-type mice exhibited trot as unique gait used at all speeds, even at the lowest ones when the speed is below 0.2 m/s and the support limbs are three or four (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>). In contrast the <italic>pcd</italic> mutant mice exhibit only walk, reaching a maximum speed of 0.25 m/s. What is odd about this difference is that walk is clearly found in wild-type mice by all others than these investigators. I believe that it is present even in the present study but that it has been missed (how can you have trot with 3 or 4 limb on the ground?). Since the <italic>pcd</italic> mice locomote slower than the wild-type mice the change in coordination could simply be caused by a change in gait patterns that is speed dependent. It is known for many animal models (mouse as well) that the inter-limb and whole body coordination change when the animal uses different gaits. At the mechanical level different models have been used to explain the different body coordination of walking and trotting gaits (Mechanical work in terrestrial locomotion: two basic mechanisms for minimizing energy expenditure, Cavagna et al., 1977, American Journal of Physiology). Thus, most of the differences you describe between wild-type and mutant mice could be due just to the comparison of mice using two different gaits that clearly rely on different inter-limb and whole body coordination (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6">Figure 4A, 4C, 6A and 6B</xref>). Indeed you have clear indications that walk is also expressed in wild-type mice at low speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and 4C</xref>). The data should be reanalyzed to address this issue. I am convinced that if the data are reanalysed, walk will show up in wild-type mice as well. This will dramatically change the conclusion of the story.</p><p>4) The discussion about the superiority of the present method to others needs to be toned down. The general statement that the automated analysis described in the study provides a robust way for locomotor analysis avoiding &quot;false positive findings that permeate the mouse locomotor literature&quot; is not true and likely to offend the locomotor field at large. I strongly recommend that the authors consider gaits (walk, trot, gallop and bound) in their analysis. Since you have done an incredible work using size-matched controls, it will be helpful if the difference between wild-type and <italic>pcd</italic> mutant mice account just for the degeneration of the Purkinje cells and not for errors due to a comparison between mice using two different gaits.</p><p>5) To my knowledge <italic>pcd</italic> mice showed not only a degeneration of the Purkinje cells but also the slower degeneration of the photoreceptor cells of the retina and mitral cells of the olfactory bulb. Since you have used animals between 41 and 154 days old, could it be that a shorter range of speed is the result of a disorganization of the visual system and not only due to an impairment of the neural control of the locomotion? They walk slower because they are half blind?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;A quantitative framework for whole-body coordination reveals specific deficits in freely walking ataxic mice&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>.

I found this to be overly-simplistic, at least based on the results presented here. As I understand it, the main consistency is in the x-axis forward paw motion, while there are changes in vertical and mediolateral paw motion and in joint angles. Changes in vertical paw trajectory and joint angles are hardly 'non-traditional', 'complex', or even '3D' and all measures are definitely 'individual-limb'. This point is made several times in the text (see points below) and seems unwarranted. I'm not saying the results aren't interesting, nor do I think that these conclusions are necessary for the impact of the paper – I just don't think that this conclusion as stated is supported.</p><p>2) On a similar point, it's not clear to me that any of their measures are really looking at within-limb coordination, at least as this is usually considered. Most of the measures relate to paw movement, whereas traditionally issues of coordination (e.g. in studies examining the role of the cerebellum, as cited in the paper) consider interactions between joints. Yet these analyses really aren't done here. They show that joint angles are apparently different in the animals, but these are for single joints as opposed to joint angle relationships (and what those angles are is unclear, see below). I don't think that the results shown here rule out a possible deficit in traditional, within-limb coordination. I think this is mainly an issue of presentation, however, rather than one of substance. As stated above, I don't think the impact of the paper relies on this conclusion and it could be made more precise without loss of significance.</p><p>3) I potentially like the analysis of nose and tail passive movements very much, but I did have a few issues with it. First, although the results are consistent with a role of the cerebellum in predictive control based on forward models, they're not really a direct demonstration thereof. A more direct demonstration might involve examining adaptations to perturbations, e.g. adding a weight to the tail and seeing that initially control animals look like mutants but then learn to predict and compensate for this, whereas mutants never do so. Also, could the results simply be interpreted as one of a limited capacity for motor control? e.g. mutants have limited capacity for producing locomotion and expend most of it on x-axis movement of the paw since it's critical for task performance, whereas other aspects of behavior are allowed to vary? I appreciate the authors are careful on this point to say that the results are 'consistent' with this idea, but alternative explanations might be considered more directly.</p><p>4) For the nose/tail passive analysis, I originally thought that this was an actual physical model, rather than the geometric model used here. It seems clear that a physical model is the better way to do this. Why wasn't it done? The geometric model, with its assumptions of lags taken from data which is actually observed, seems more indirect and therefore less compelling. Finally, as I understand it (and I might have missed it), this analysis was only done for the mutants. It would be very good to have done the same analysis for the control animals and show that the tail/nose movements are inconsistent with passive movement, e.g. it could have been that the movement of the pelvic girdle was different in controls, leading to less tail movement (even though the hindlimbs are in alternation for both controls and mutants).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The paper by Machado et al. examines gait patterns in wildtype and Purkinje cell degeneration (<italic>pcd</italic>) mice using a novel system for tracking locomotor kinematics in freely walking mice. The authors conclude that the individual limb kinematics of <italic>pcd</italic> mice are normal when the weight and the walking speed of the mice are taken into account. In contrast, <italic>pcd</italic> mice have impaired coordination of movements across joints, limbs and body. These results are interpreted as evidence that the cerebellum provides a forward model. This is a strong paper. I commend the authors for wrestling with a complex dataset and extracting from it a number of thought-provoking findings. I personally found many of the results exciting, but I must admit that I'm not an expert in the field of locomotion or ataxia. It was not always clear if a particular result in the paper was a major advance or just confirmation of something we already knew. For this reason, I think that it's important for the authors to clarify and emphasize the significance of their results throughout the text. I've given two examples below:</p><p>1) It is remarkable that in wildtype mice, one can account for upwards of 80% of the variance in kinematic parameters like stride length, swing velocity and cadence, simply by taking into account the walking speed and the weight of the mouse. Is this a new approach? In their rebuttal, the authors mention that the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cendelin et al. (2010)</xref> paper found that all the gait differences between lurcher and control mice disappeared when they corrected for walking speed. Did Cendelin et al. make the correction using a similar modeling approach?</p><p>2) One of the main findings is that individual limb movements of <italic>pcd</italic> mice are relatively spared (when weight and walking speed are taken into account), whereas interlimb coordination is impaired. It is not clear how much of this we already knew. For example, in the subsection “Front-hind Interlimb coordination is specifically impaired in <italic>pcd</italic>”, the authors mention that previous studies in ataxic mice have failed to detect any impairments in the kinematic parameters of individual limbs. Did those studies not examine interlimb coordination as well? If the authors are the first to show that mice with cerebellar deficits have a specific impairment in locomotor coordination but not in movement of individual limbs, this is a big deal.</p><p>Additional recommendations to help make an already strong paper even stronger:</p><p>3) Drop the emphasis on forward models. The authors argue that the deficits they've uncovered point to a lack of a forward model in <italic>pcd</italic> mice. Although I found some of the evidence presented intriguing (for example the analysis of tail movements), it is far from conclusive. Furthermore, it is difficult to reconcile the normal individual limb kinematics with a faulty forward model – individual limbs are controlled by multiple agonist/antagonist muscles whose coordination requires well-calibrated forward models. I think the authors can still interpret their results in the context of forward/inverse models, but I strongly recommend that they save this interpretation for the Discussion, tone it down a bit and address the limitations. The paper would be stronger if the second paragraph of the Introduction is rewritten to highlight the main questions to be addressed in the paper, instead of offering to resolve controversies about forward vs inverse cerebellar models.</p><p>4) Analysis of variability: All the analyses are based on average data. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B-E</xref> shows that there is no difference in the individual limb kinematics of <italic>pcd</italic> mice and sized-matched controls. But this is done only for the average kinematic values. Is it not possible that <italic>pcd</italic> mice might show increased trial-to-trial variability in their movements relative to sized-matched controls? How would such a finding change the authors' conclusions?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors developed a machine learning algorithm to track the individual limbs as well as the nose and tail of mice in 3D during natural, voluntary locomotion. They provide a very detailed analysis of locomotion parameters in control and ataxic Purkinje cell degeneration (<italic>pcd</italic>) mice, revealing that individual limb kinematics in <italic>pcd</italic> mice are not different from control mice when accounting for the mouse's weight and speed, but that <italic>pcd</italic> mice present multi-joint and inter-limb-coordination deficits. The study has been carefully conducted and provides new and useful tools for measuring and analyzing specific features of locomotion and ataxia with unprecedented accuracy.</p><p>1) The construction of the &quot;passive model&quot; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is unclear. For example, does this model take into account the mass of the tail? Please describe in more detail how the passive prediction is calculated.</p><p>2) The authors contrast the forward model with an inverse kinematic model in the Introduction. What do they think the inverse kinematic model would predict and how does this contrast with their findings?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A quantitative framework for whole-body coordination reveals specific deficits in freely walking ataxic mice&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The manuscript has been greatly improved and the revision was met with enthusiasm. There are only a few remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>In particular, the manual joint-angle analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> seems limited by the single animal in each condition, and discussion among reviewers and editors led to the consensus that it could simply be dropped without major impact on the manuscript. We therefore recommend cutting this one measurement and illustration. Alternatively, if there is some reason why a single animal in each category is of value, please justify the experiment clearly. This point is explained further below.</p><p>In the subsection “Individual limb parameters”, the description makes it seem like one <italic>pcd</italic> animal and one control were used for this analysis. If so, this seems very questionable and underpowered. I'd be willing to bet that, with enough n, it would be possible to find a significant difference between two different weight matched controls. I'm not sure how the stats behave in this situation, but it's not clear to me how mixed models would be able to partition variance due to random effects (individual subjects) from the fixed effects (mutation) if there were only one animal in each group. It seems that for other comparisons with weight matched controls much larger N's are used, whereas this analysis is limited because of the need to hand mark frames. It might be easiest to simply drop this joint angle analysis – I don't think its omission would change the impact of the paper. Also, shouldn't it be ‘knee, heel, toe’? And here it's stated that the angle of the foot and arm relative to the ground are quantified – I might have missed it, but I wasn't sure where that was reported in the Results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07892.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>We are confident that we have addressed the reviewers’ concerns, without further experiments or substantial re-analysis of the data.

The heart of the system is machine learning operating on resampled images of high speed cameras for mice walking in a glass corridor. To illustrate its applicability, the paper compares the walking movements of wildtype and Purkinje cell degeneration (</italic>pcd<italic>) mice</italic>.</p><p><italic>In general, for a paper introducing a novel analysis tool, I think it must be assessed whether the method provides measurements of highly useful parameters, with high explanatory value, that goes well beyond what has been attainable before. For instance, there was a very recent paper by Hoogland et al. (2015, Curr Biol.) introducing a method that is closely related to the present one (camera-based, measuring the paw positions as well as the whole body angle) and other measurement systems applied to locomotion exist in abundance, typically published alongside main scientific findings (for example,</italic> <italic>Kiehn 2013</italic><italic>). To be clear, I think the authors have made a very careful and high-quality job, but I am doubtful that the advances provided here represent a major leap rather than a minor incremental change to the state-of-the art</italic>.</p><p>We point out that this paragraph makes the implicit assumption that the tracking system we introduce is meant to be the main advance in the paper. For us the tracking system was a tool that we needed (and that did not and does not to our knowledge exist) to establish a quantitative framework for whole-body coordination <italic>in freely walking mice</italic>. We provide the full details of our system because we want it to be of use to other labs interested in the neural control of coordinated movement. But to be very clear, we think the major advance here is a new conceptual framework for mouse locomotor coordination. It was made possible by the increased resolution and throughput of the new tracking system that we describe, but more importantly, the isolation of specific features of ataxia in freely walking mice provides novel insights into mouse locomotor coordination that challenge the existing state-of-the art.</p><p>At the same time, we admit that we had previously failed to express that we recognize the value of existing systems for measuring locomotion and we know that these have been used successfully to analyze contributions of the spinal cord, in particular, to the generation of locomotor patterns. We have edited the text of the manuscript to reflect this appreciation more explicitly (in the subsection “LocoMouse”). However, critically, these approaches have not been nearly as successful in providing insights into cerebellar contributions to locomotion. The point we are trying to make here is that these failures have been for three main reasons: 1) a failure to distinguish between specific features of ataxia vs. secondary consequences of slower walking speeds and smaller body sizes, 2) a lack of detailed, 3D kinematic data, and 3) a lack of emphasis on coordination across joints, limbs, and body, which are so particularly sensitive to cerebellar damage and which are not the main focus of most off-the-shelf locomotor assays. We hope that our revisions make our position more clear on these points.</p><p><italic>The paper promises to demonstrate a tool that can be used to monitor whole body coordination and 3D limb kinematics. But I find that the analysis of the whole body coordination boils down to computing the angle of the mid-body axis by utilizing the recorded position of the nose and tail, which is not particularly useful from a neuroscience perspective, as the angle is determined by the interplay of a very large number of muscles that could potentially change in different ways in a large number of deficits</italic>.</p><p>First, we use whole-body coordination here not just to mean measuring nose and tail movements, but also <italic>the spatiotemporal relationships across various body elements</italic>, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Here, whole-body coordination is demonstrated by the ribbon plots and correlation matrices in a way that is meant to highlight that the spatiotemporal relationships of movements across the body are impaired in <italic>pcd</italic> (in contrast to the forward paw motion, which is intact, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We have changed the headings in the Results to be more consistent with our true meaning.</p><p>Second, we are confused by the reviewer’s claim that our “analysis of whole-body coordination boils down to computing the angle of the mid-body axis”, as this is not something we report. Perhaps they have confused our analysis with that of Hoogland et al., to which this comment more readily applies? Or perhaps they were misled by looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> (now 5C)? To clarify, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref><italic>(C) does not show how we measured the tail, but rather, shows how we derived the equations predicting what passive oscillations of the tail would look like if they resulted solely from the orthogonal coupling between the forward motion of the hindlimbs and side-to-side tail movement</italic>. Our measurements of tail movements were, as described in the methods and figure legend, 3D position values for 15 individual tail segments. We completely agree that the movements of the tail could potentially change in different ways in a large number of deficits, <italic>which is precisely why the demonstration that the tail oscillates as a passive consequence of hind limb motion in</italic> pcd <italic>is so important</italic>. This wasn’t at all trivial and together with the off-axis/multijoint impairments of individual limbs, points to a specific lack of ability to predict the consequences of movements of other parts of the body.</p><p>Finally, we respectfully disagree with the reviewers’ apparent position that quantitative analysis of kinematics is not useful for neuroscience. While ultimately, of course, movements are effected by muscles, kinematic analysis has been fundamental to the understanding of the neural control of movement, and <italic>kinematic representations have been found in many motor areas, in particular in Purkinje cells</italic>, where they have been dissociated from muscle activity/dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pasalar et al. 2006</xref>). Moreover, our analyses of 3D paw trajectories and joint angles actually highlight the fact that yes, absolutely, there are different ways to achieve the same movement, and our finding that <italic>pcd</italic> mice achieve the same forward movements of the paws with different off-axis movements and different joint angles, we would argue, is in itself an argument for the importance of the kind of detailed kinematic analysis that we provide.</p><p><italic>In addition, data on the whole body movement is already provided in the solution of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoogland et al. (2015)</xref>.</italic></p><p>We now cite the now-published Hoogland et al. paper from the De Zeeuw group in our manuscript. However we point out a very meaningful difference between our study and theirs, which is that ours is in <italic>freely walking mice</italic>. There are likely to be critical differences in whole-body coordination in these different setups. Moreover, again, we do not see the only advance in our paper as being the measurement of movement per se, but rather emphasize the quantitative and conceptual framework we use to analyze it.</p><p><italic>I also find that the stated monitoring of the 3D limb kinematics boils down to a monitoring of the 3D spatial position of the paw. But each position could theoretically be accomplished by many different configurations in the muscles of the limb, and the latter is the type of information that one would need to obtain a useful tool</italic>.</p><p>We take the reviewer’s point to be more clear in the text about when we are referring to limb vs. paw kinematics, and have changed several sentences accordingly. However, we also reiterate our belief, stated above, that kinematic analysis has been generally useful for motor control and that the specificity of the tail and 3D paw findings in <italic>pcd</italic> are themselves strong arguments that detailed kinematic analysis can provide important insights.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3H</italic></xref> <italic>seem at first glance to indicate that there is indeed some information on the limb joints – however, when I read the paper and the Methods, there are no indications that the joints are actually measured. Hence, I assume that the joint angles are computed out of the 3D paw data, which is problematic. First, if these angles are not measured but computed, the authors must explain where the data in their</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3H</italic></xref> <italic>comes from. For the paper as a whole, this is a major problem since the main applicability of this setup would be if the user could actually track joint angles. Relying on computational models to deduce the 3D limb kinematics is very different from actually measuring it, and reduces the value of this method</italic>.</p><p>We apologize that we were not clear about this. The <italic>joint angles were absolutely measured, not computed</italic>. We agree that this would have been problematic. We have added the joint angles to the list of measurements in the Methods and have rewritten the relevant paragraph in the subsection “Single-limb deficits in <italic>pcd</italic> are restricted to off-axis paw trajectories and joint angles”. The joint angles were computed manually by clicking on movie frames.</p><p>While more labor intensive than our other analyses, the only way we could have made the joint tracking automatic would have been to use markers, and we think the advantages of a markerless system outweigh any potential concerns about reduced throughput – and in fact the throughput here is similar to other non-automated systems (eg Motorater, Zorner et al.).</p><p><italic>There are also some statements made about the analysis of</italic> pcd <italic>mice, claiming that this analysis supports that the cerebellum provides an internal model. But there is no evidence here that the cerebellum provides an internal model of any kind. What is seen here is only that block of the normal information processing pathway of various motor systems perturbs the capability of the central nervous system to rely on internal models. On the other hand, all biological motor control is feed-forward in nature, as it needs to deal with long delays, and feed-forward control can be solved only by using internal models. So the only thing learned from this study is that the normal function of the central nervous system in locomotion is dependent on a normally operating cerebellum. The internal models could be generated elsewhere, with the perturbed Purkinje cells destroying the capacity of the system as a whole by removing an otherwise permissive signal to any other system hypothetically responsible for generating/providing the internal model</italic>.</p><p>a) We respectfully disagree that all biological motor control is feedforward – feedback is often used to adjust ongoing movements, albeit with a delay.</p><p>b) Although we personally agree with the reviewer about the importance of internal models for motor control<italic>, there is significant controversy on this point within the cerebellar field, in terms of whether the cerebellum provides inverse or forward models, or both, or neither</italic>. See, for example, the second paragraph of our Introduction, and the references within it.</p><p>c) Our data point <italic>specifically</italic> to a lack of a <italic>forward</italic> (but not inverse) model in ataxic <italic>pcd</italic> mice. Why? Because i) Forward paw kinematics are normal, which would not be the case if there was a failure in an inverse model. ii) Previous studies have argued that a lack of a forward model leads to deficits in multijoint coordination in ataxic patients (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al. 1996</xref>), very like what we see here in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) The passive oscillation of the tail in <italic>pcd</italic> reveals the lack of a mechanism that normally predicts and actively cancels this oscillation in wildtype mice. We have edited this portion of the discussion to be more specific on these points.</p><p>d) While it is true that cerebellar output could be permissive for the function of a forward model rather than generating/providing that model per se, the hypothesis that it actually generates it has been influential in the field. We had tried to be careful with our wording to avoid going beyond our data on this point (e.g. from the subsection “Cerebellar contributions to coordinated movement”: “The changes in multijoint and interlimb coordination, and the apparent passive oscillations of the nose and tail in <italic>pcd</italic> can be interpreted as a failure to predict the consequences of movements of other parts of the body, an idea that is consistent with forward model theories of cerebellar function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ebner and Pasalar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ito, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wolpert et al., 1998</xref>).” We have edited several other statements to avoid words like “generating” as the reviewer suggests. Still we emphasize that the fact that all of the deficits we observe can be interpreted as the failure of a forward model points to this being an important aspect of cerebellar function, permissive or not.</p><p>e) We think the statement, “the only thing learned from this study is that the normal function of the central nervous system in locomotion is dependent on a normally operating cerebellum” is unfair. The point of this paper is to overturn that notion and show that actually, <italic>locomotion is affected in very specific ways in</italic> pcd. The preservation of forward paw kinematics was completely unexpected based on the existing literature and it changes the way we think about ataxia. It also reveals that while Purkinje cell activity often correlates with movement kinematics, this may not be its essential function – at the very least, other parts of the brain can compensate. However other parts of the brain do not appear to compensate for the loss of a forward model.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>The authors developed a very nice method to quantify motor performance during free locomotion in mice. They show that in cerebellar ataxia coordination rather than individual movements are affected. This is an elegant and thorough study, but a number of points require attention</italic>:</p><p>Thank you and we address all of these points below.</p><p><italic>1) The authors used Purkinje cell degeneration (</italic>pcd<italic>) mice to test for cerebellar ataxia.</italic> Pcd <italic>mice start to lose their Purkinje cells during early adulthood – however, later on, other defects appear e.g. the loss of thalamic neurons after P50 and subsequently more widespread neurodegeneration (see Fernandez-Gonzalez, Science 2002 and references cited therein). The use of</italic> pcd <italic>mice at ages varying between p41 and p154, therefore, is expected to result in heterogeneous stages of neurodegeneration. This is not addressed experimentally. Therefore, the authors have to present their data separately for different age groups – especially for mice younger than p50 (no extra-cerebellar neurodegeneration expected) and older (including thalamic and maybe even more neurodegeneration)</italic>.</p><p>Yes, we agree that it is an important consideration and we have done this. We have added some graphs as a figure supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>) that show that the main conclusions of our study hold in the youngest <italic>pcd</italic> mice (&lt;p50).</p><p>2) Dependence of gait parameters of individual limbs on weight and speed.</p><p><italic>The authors provide an elegant analysis of the correlations between weight, speed and specific parameters of single-limb movements. As expected, many (if not all) parameters depend on speed. The effect of weight, however, is more prominent in some parameters than in others (e.g. compare</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figures 2C and 2E</italic></xref><italic>). The authors conclude that, given body weight and speed, they can make reasonably accurate predictions for single-limb movement parameters. However, the authors do not directly disentangle the impact of body weight vs. speed for each parameter. In other words, how much of the variation is explained by either one? Were there also gender- and/or age-related differences, or were these fully explained by variations in body weight (see Figure 2–figure supplement 2)</italic>?</p><p>We apologize that we were not more clear on this point, because we did in fact directly quantify the relative contributions of body weight, speed, age and gender. These were reported in Figure 2–figure supplement 2, but clearly we should have been more explicit. To address this, we have edited the treatment of this issue in the subsection “Gait parameters for individual limbs vary consistently with walking speed and body size” and rewritten the Legend for the figure supplement to explain in less technical terms what we had done. We have also added specific demonstrations of the failure of the additional factors of gender or age to improve the predictions above and beyond body weight and walking speed alone, both to the tables in the supplement and in the text.</p><p><italic>3) Impact of speed for analyzing individual limb gait parameters in</italic> pcd <italic>mice</italic>.</p><p><italic>The authors show in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>that</italic> pcd <italic>mice make smaller, slower steps than wildtype littermates. They argue that, despite the actual values being different from controls, individual limb parameters are largely in line with those from control mice at similar speed and with similar weight. This is an important finding, but it would be informative to show the impact of body weight alone. In other words: it seems that the (on-axis) trajectory of single limbs is not really different between</italic> pcd <italic>and control mice, but what about the timing</italic>?</p><p>First, thank you for pointing out the importance of this finding, which we agree is a major contribution of the paper. In terms of showing the impact of body weight alone, we point out that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B-D</xref>, the differences in the model predictions (thick lines) for the two sets of mice are due entirely to body weight differences, since speed and weight were the only two factors included in the predictions, and the data are plotted as a function of speed. We don’t understand the last sentence, however, about the timing – if you mean interlimb timing, we address that point in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (and below in response to Reviewer 3). Or do you mean the temporal profile of the trajectories themselves? Those are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, for <italic>pcd</italic> and size- matched controls.</p><p>To emphasize the role of body weight alone, and to further illustrate the fact that changes in body weight and walking speed together can fully account for the changes in forward limb movement in <italic>pcd</italic>, we have added a Figure Supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> that compares the gait parameters of <italic>pcd</italic>, littermates, and size-matched controls.</p><p><italic>In addition, the off-axis movements do seem to be affected; but it is not fully clear to me to what extent corrections for body size and speed have been applied here.</italic></p><p>This is an important point, but please note that the last line of the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> states, “For E-H controls are size-matched control […] see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>”, and that at the end of the subsection “Changes in gait parameters for individual limbs are predicted by changes in walking speed and body size” we state: “<italic>pcd</italic> animals are compared with size-matched controls from here on.” Similarly, speed is indicated by the line thicknesses on each trajectory plot and the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> states “line thickness represents increasing speed”. To be sure to avoid any misunderstanding on this important point, however, we changed the color-coding in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to distinguish between littermates and size-matched controls and we have added the words “size-matched” before “controls” at many places in the text and legends. We also now specify that the line thickness legend in the panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> refers also to 3F and 3G.</p><p><italic>In the Discussion, I feel that a better balance between the preserved on-axis parameters and the affected off-axis parameters in the discussion would be warranted.</italic></p><p>Yes, we agree, and we have revised this part of the Discussion, based on the feedback from this reviewer and Reviewer #3. We also added a new, separate heading to the Results.</p><p><italic>4) I feel that the remark &quot;the failure of existing systems to quantitatively capture gait ataxia&quot; (in the subsection “Interlimb and whole-body coordination are specifically impaired in</italic> pcd<italic>”) is a bit too strong and does not acknowledge the merits of previous quantifications (e.g. Erasmus Ladder and transparent disk treadmill, which both can also quantify interlimb coordination). Although the authors show that the trajectory of individual limbs is not grossly affected in</italic> pcd <italic>mice, the speed is (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3A</italic></xref><italic>). And the speed is in turn related to the velocity of single limbs (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2E</italic></xref><italic>). Thus, without neglecting the importance of the current study, stating that previous studies were not able to quantitate features of gait ataxia or interlimb coordination is in my opinion too strong</italic>.</p><p>We have toned this down in several ways. First, we are more explicit about the contributions of the other methods, such as the ones mentioned by the reviewer. Second, we are more explicit about when we are referring specifically to gait patterns of <italic>freely walking</italic> mice, which neither the Erasmus ladder nor the transparent disk treadmill address. Third, and most importantly, we clarify several places in the text to make it more clear that out that our point is not that other studies have not <italic>measured</italic> changes associated with gait ataxia, but rather that: a) those changes do not necessarily relate to ataxia per se, beyond reflecting changes in walking speed alone, which are not specific and b) that here, we not only measure changes associated with ataxia that have not previously been reported (3D trajectories, specific front-hind interlimb coordination deficits, and tail movements), but we also isolate them from the non-specific effects of altered walking speed. Finally, we point out that the specific sentence mentioned by the reviewer, was meant to refer specifically to the reference within it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cendelin et al., 2010</xref>), which attempted to quantify ataxia in freely walking lurcher mice with the CatWalk system, and found that all the differences between lurcher and control mice that they observed disappeared when they corrected for walking speed. But we didn’t say this explicitly and we realize that not everyone who reads our paper will be familiar with that work – hence the changes to the text that we have made in response to the reviewers.</p><p><italic>For possibilities of transparent disk treadmill to study interlimb coordination, please refer to</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28"><italic>Hoogland et al., 2015</italic></xref><italic>, Current Biol). Here, the level of ataxia in tottering is not only quantified (including interlimb ccordination), but also related to the level of complex spike synchrony. Please discuss this neurobiological mechanism upfront as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the technical possibilities of this disk treadmill system with respect to the current locomouse technology</italic>.</p><p>We have added the now-published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoogland et al. (2015)</xref> to our revision.</p><p><italic>5) The authors show (in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>) that tail lateral movements of control mice have a sinusoidal appearance, related to the stride phase. This movement is largely exaggerated in</italic> pcd <italic>mice. Whereas the lateral movements in control mice are coupled to the stride phase, in the</italic> pcd <italic>mice there seems to be more of a coupling to the time. The tail movements could be either a compensatory mechanism to counteract imbalance due to improper limb control or they could be affected themselves, contributing to further imbalance. Currently, the variations in tail movements are not really taken into account. Could the authors provide a more solid analysis showing whether tail movements are compensatory or affected by themselves</italic>?</p><p>We have edited the text of the results to make it more clear that our geometrical model addresses the reviewer’s point quite nicely. The model, shown by the grey dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref> and the thick lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, calculates <italic>predictions of what passive oscillations of the tail would look like if they resulted solely from the orthogonal coupling between the forward motion of the hindlimbs and side-to-side tail movement</italic>. The fact that the grey dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref> and the thick lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> match the <italic>pcd</italic> data, reveals that the side-to-side tail oscillation in <italic>pcd</italic> is exactly what is predicted as a passive consequence of forward hindlimb motion. Criticallly, we emphasize <italic>that hindlimb alternation is unaltered in</italic> pcd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), and so these changes in tail movement cannot result from changes in hindlimb oscillation. (On a side note, however, the increased oscillations certainly contribute to imbalance, and in fact we think this may be a major reason for the characteristic increased base of support in ataxia that we observe in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.)</p><p>We recognize that we did not adequately explain/emphasize the importance of the passive tail model with our previous submission. To emphasize this important finding, we have reordered the panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, rewritten the description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in the main text to go more slowly through it, and added a movie of the model, to show just how well passive deflections of the tail and nose based solely on perpendicular coupling to forward motion of hindlimbs captures the gestalt of the ataxia in <italic>pcd</italic>.</p><p><italic>6) In the Discussion, the authors mention that previous studies lack the fine-grained detail used in this work and therefore focused on &quot;markers for global motor dysfunction [but] they lack specificity&quot; (subsection “A quantitative framework for locomotor coordination”). Now that the authors have developed such a beautiful system: what is the effect of cerebellar ataxia? How does this separate from other motor dysfunctions (e.g. muscular dystrophy)</italic>?</p><p>This is an important point that highlights the potential impact of our approach. Clearly we have isolated specific deficits in coordination across joints, limbs, and body in <italic>pcd</italic>. We very much hope that the current paper will help many groups interested in mouse models of various diseases to identify and isolate specific features of motor function that are affected in their systems. We would speculate, for example, that the sparing of forward paw trajectories in <italic>pcd</italic> would not be expected in the muscular dystrophy example, but interlimb coordination could be spared. We are currently analyzing several other mouse mutants with extra-cerebellar phenotypes and while those studies are in preliminary stages and outside of the scope of the current paper, the results are quite different from those we report here. We further note that <italic>it is not just the tracking system itself that allows for this specificity, it comes especially from the quantitative framework we use to analyze the data</italic>.</p><p><italic>7) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>, the authors showed the step-cycle for four limb movements by indicating the stance onset for each paw (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4A</italic></xref><italic>) and the support pattern (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref><italic>). However, I find it still difficult to understand the phase relationship between limbs with regard to swing and stance phase. For example, to what extent does the onset of the swing phase of the forelimb occur during the swing or stance phase of the ipsilateral hindlimb? In order to have a better interpretation of inter-limb coordination, it might be worthwhile to add an additional figure with swing and stance phase indicated for each individual limb</italic>.</p><p>Yes, we agree that this is complicated and we had focused on stance phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) together with the support patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) out of space concerns. There are also changes in stance-swing phasing in <italic>pcd</italic>, which are what cause the changes in support patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07892.023</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Stance to swing phases for size-matched controls and all <italic>pcd</italic>.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07892.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07892.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07892-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>We recognize that this is still complicated.

They use it for locomotor analysis in freely moving wild-type mice. A detailed description of locomotor parameters allowed them to create a mathematical model to predict most of the parameters knowing just the walking speed and the body size of the animal. They extend this analysis to a mouse model for Purkinje cell degeneration (</italic>pcd<italic>). They conclude that the traditional locomotor parameters (stride length, cadence, intra-limb coordination) and forward trajectories are not different in wild-type mice and</italic> pcd <italic>mice</italic>.</p><p>This last sentence is not quite accurate and we need to clarify here that we do find that these parameters <italic>are different</italic> in <italic>pcd</italic> mice, but that these <italic>differences disappear when we take changes in walking speed and body size into account</italic>. This is an incredibly important point that changes the entire message of the paper.</p><p><italic>In contrast they conclude that the whole-body coordination is specifically impaired in</italic> pcd <italic>mice. Furthermore, a specific description of nose and tail oscillations in pcd mice were modeled as passive consequences of the forward motion of the hindlimbs. The main conclusions from the study are: a) only by studying whole-body coordination will it be possible to reveal the ataxic locomotor phenotype, and b) the observed locomotor changes are consistent with the hypothesis that the cerebellum provides a forward model for motor control. Although I find the study of great interest there are a number of issues that are problematic for the interpretation of the data. The authors will have to address these issues to avoid making incorrect statements about the findings and the method used</italic>.</p><p>Thank you and we address all of these issues, below.</p><p><italic>1) The authors make a big deal out of using machine learning as an 'objective' way of measuring locomotor parameters. But there seems to be a lot of noise in the detection. This is seen in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1E</italic></xref><italic>. Where is the level set for step onset and offset</italic>?</p><p>The swing and stance onsets are calculated from the bottom view, not the side view data and so were plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. We point out that the noise in the detection was quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> where we compared manual clicking on each paw on each frame with the automated detection for 11 movies. Here you can see a few important points. Importantly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, which the reviewer singles out as “noisy” represents vertical (z) axis tracking, which is typically not measured at all in other papers. In the figure supplement you can see that the “z” tracking is noisier than x and y tracking, for several reasons. First, <italic>because of the very small vertical movements of the paws, the movements are only a few pixels high</italic> – the apparent “noise” in the detection in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> is generally less than 1mm, which corresponds to <italic>2.5 pixels</italic> even on our high resolution movies. Second, because of the relatively large size of the paws compared to the vertical displacement, <italic>most of the apparent discrepancies between manual and automated tracking are within the size of a paw</italic> (all black data points in the supplement). Thus this “noise” is actually largely biological – the paw position is defined as the center of the paw, and as you can see in the movies, the center of the paws moves vertically even during the “stance” phase. Thus it is difficult/moot to say whether the discrepancies between detection and manual clicking in these cases are from automated errors or human ones. Finally, we refer the reviewer to the movies where you can evaluate the automated tracking performance (again, focusing on the bottom view, which forms the basis for all stride analyses, because of these considerations) first hand.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref> <italic>is an even stronger case. At very low speed (&lt;0.4) the stride length varies with a factor of 10 from 1 cm to 10 cm. 10 cm long stride lengths are not common at these speeds in mice. It must be a detection mistake. Also there are many values with very low stride lengths spread over all speeds. One would like to know how much irrelevant noise that the automated procedure introduces for example by showing traces from the low speed locomotion with 1 cm and 10 cm stride lengths</italic>.</p><p>Exactly, these values are not common at these speeds in mice. Please keep in mind that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>nearly 10,000 strides are plotted</italic>. We shared our raw data exactly to emphasize the point of how noisy this unconstrained, virtually unfiltered dataset was, and how important it was to account for this variability. As the reviewer points out, there are some outliers. However, <italic>the assumption that this “noise” must result from tracking mistakes is incorrect</italic>.</p><p>The specific examples the reviewer requests, of short and long stride lengths at slow walking speeds, are almost always accounted for by the fact that <italic>we calculated walking speed stride-wise, from stance onset to stance onset</italic>. Because we did not filter our data for continuous walking (because stopping and starting may be an important feature of some motor phenotypes, e.g. basal ganglia), there were sometimes long stance periods when the animal paused just before re-initiating locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1C</xref>, on the right). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1C</xref> shows examples (as requested) of very short (left) and very long (right) stride lengths at slow walking speeds, that show that these “outliers” are not, as the reviewer assumes, due to detection mistakes, but rather to sudden changes in walking speed.</p><p>On the other hand, we do not claim that our tracking or swing/stance point detection are perfect (see e.g. green points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). However we point out that the total number of outliers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> – including not just tracking failures but also the kinds of biological variability shown in the figures above – is 130 out of 9,602 total strides. Thus <italic>tracking or swing/stance detection errors are affecting at most ∼1% of strides</italic>. Given our multi-level modeling approach to analyzing the data, these points do not pose a significant contamination threat. Further, we think that the major benefits that come from using automation and avoiding data selection and filtering more than compensate for any occasional imperfections.</p><p><italic>Everything in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is known from many previous studies of rodent locomotion – so there is nothing new about it except that the authors have analyzed a large amount of steps.</italic></p><p>This is not true. Please keep in mind <italic>that the thick lines in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>are the outputs of equations that predict gait parameters as a function of walking speed and body size</italic>, which is entirely new. In the words of Reviewer 2, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> “The authors provide an elegant analysis of the correlations between weight, speed and specific parameters of single-limb movement […] The authors conclude that, given body weight and speed, they can make reasonably accurate predictions for single-limb movement parameters.” This is very important – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and its supplements show the derivation of equations that predict movement parameters of individual limbs for a mouse of a given size walking at a given speed – and the littermate data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> validates these predictions for a new cohort of animals. Without this analysis, which is new, we would not have been able to isolate specific deficits in ataxia.</p><p>Moreover, the <italic>3D paw, nose, and tail trajectories during locomotion at a range of speeds in freely walking mice</italic> that we present are, to our knowledge, entirely new. To emphasize this, we have pulled this data out of the supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and included the forepaw kinematics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and hindpaw kinematics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The authors make a point out of not seeing any intralimb differences between wild-type and</italic> pcd <italic>mice. Looking at</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>this referee is not convinced, and it seems that this statement that is likely to be wrong. There seems to be clear differences in almost all parameters. Statistical tests will be needed to support the claims</italic>.</p><p>Unfortunately it seems that the reviewer’s misunderstanding of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> has permeated into this interpretation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. To clarify, as we state in multiple places in the text (for example, in the subsection “Changes in gait parameters for individual limbs are predicted by changes in walking speed and body size”), “the gait parameters of individual limbs of <italic>pcd</italic> mice were, overall, quite different” and “although they were different from control mice, individual limb parameters for <italic>pcd</italic> were comparable to the values for control mice of similar body size walking at similar speeds”. Also in the subsection “A quantitative framework for locomotor coordination reveals fundamental features of mouse gait ataxia” we emphasize that “observed differences in traditional gait parameters were a secondary consequence of differences in body size and walking speed”; there are real differences in individual limb movements in <italic>pcd</italic>. However, the thick lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B-D</xref> are model predictions, not fits to the data and so the differences in those graphs the reviewer points out, while real, actually do not reflect ataxia. To make this point more clear we have added a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> which directly compares <italic>pcd</italic> and size-matched controls and the statistics are provided in panel E (none are significant).</p><p>The only panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> where we claim that <italic>pcd</italic> and controls are the same is the forward paw trajectories shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>. There are differences between control and <italic>pcd</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F-H</xref> – these are <italic>the off-axis movements and joint angles and we fully agree that these reflect ataxia</italic>, which is why we refer specifically to “forward” or “on-axis” trajectories vs. “3D” or “off-axis” trajectories throughout the Results and Discussion. To make this point more clear and separate the results from the forward paw motion results, we have added an additional heading “Single-limb deficits in <italic>pcd</italic> are restricted to off-axis paw trajectories and joint angles” to the relevant section of the Results.</p><p><italic>3) A main conclusion is that the interlimb coordination changes from wild-type to</italic> pcd <italic>mice. More specifically from a trot to a walk pattern. Walking and trotting patterns have been described for tetrapods to be distinct gaits by many different studies. They are visible at different speeds of locomotion. In your experiments wild-type mice exhibited trot as unique gait used at all speeds, even at the lowest ones when the speed is below 0.2 m/s and the support limbs are three or four (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C and 4D</italic></xref><italic>). In contrast the pcd mutant mice exhibit only walk, reaching a maximum speed of 0.25 m/s. What is odd about this difference is that walk is clearly found in wild-type mice by all others than these investigators. I believe that it is present even in the present study but that it has been missed (how can you have trot with 3 or 4 limb on the ground?)</italic>.</p><p>We recognize that it is traditional to conceptualize interlimb coordination in terms of gait categories, and we have changed our treatment of this topic in the text to be more clear and to emphasize what we are, and what we are not, trying to claim. However, our perspective differs meaningfully from the reviewer’s on this point. We actually spent quite a long time wrestling with this data and trying to analyze it in terms of categorical gait patterns such as trot and walk (not to mention cruciate vs. alternate patterns a la Cheng et al. 1997 in the rat), but it didn’t work, and we think these plots of stance phase density as a function of walking speed give a sense of why (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>On the left, the stance phases of all of the strides of size-matched controls are shown in a density plot – values around 0 on the y-axis would be a trot, while values above the x-axis would be a walk. Stride count density is color-coded. The first thing that pops out from this analysis is that <italic>there is no category boundary between a walk and a trot in mice</italic> – the data vary continuously along the x and y axes. We realize that this is different from the case in many tetrapods, and even in flies (Mendes et al, <italic>eLife</italic> 2013) – but this is the data. We agree with the reviewer that mice are more likely to “walk” at lower speeds, but <italic>without a category boundary between walking and trotting, we find that analyzing phase values is the only appropriate quantitative way to deal with this data</italic> – how far from zero would the phase value need to be for us to call it a walk? How close to zero to call it a trot?</p><p>We have reworded our language in the paper about wildtype mice to de-emphasize the trot and instead focus on diagonal alternation patterns. We have also included the density plots above (as well as similar L-R phase analysis).</p><p>So with this as the background (and we have altered the text and include this figure in the paper), we clarify: we are not trying to overturn existing data or claim categorically that wildtype mice don’t walk – <italic>but what is clear is that</italic> pcd <italic>mice don’t trot</italic>, even when they do locomote at higher speeds.</p><p>Further, to answer the question of “how you can have a trot with more than 2 paws on the ground?”, as the reviewer surely knows, and according to the terminology of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hildebrand (1989)</xref>, this depends on the duty cycle and the stance to swing transitions (see Hildebrand plot and stance-to-swing phasing above in response to Reviewer 2). Diagonal pairs can still enter stance simultaneously with either a running trot or a walking trot, and in both cases, the primary support pattern will be 2-paw diagonal. What will change will be whether there is some 0-1 or some 3-4 paw support at the transition points. Our new supplemental figure addresses this directly.</p><p><italic>Since the</italic> pcd <italic>mice locomote slower than the wild-type mice the change in coordination could simply be caused by a change in gait patterns that is speed dependent</italic>.</p><p>Actually, no, it can’t. This is very important – <italic>all of the analyses comparing coordination in pcd vs. control were both size- and speed-matched</italic>. And, as we pointed out above, the tail oscillation in <italic>pcd</italic> is successfully modeled as a passive consequence <italic>of the forward motion of the hind limbs only, which does not change in</italic> pcd. Also, we show in the interlimb coordination figure that hind limb double support ratios do not change in <italic>pcd</italic>. We have clarified this in the subsection “Whole-body coordination deficits in <italic>pcd</italic>”.</p><p><italic>It is known for many animal models (mouse as well) that the inter-limb and whole body coordination change when the animal uses different gaits. At the mechanical level different models have been used to explain the different body coordination of walking and trotting gaits (Mechanical work in terrestrial locomotion: two basic mechanisms for minimizing energy expenditure,</italic> <italic>Cavagna et al., 1977</italic><italic>, American Journal of Physiology). Thus, most of the differences you describe between wild-type and mutant mice could be due just to the comparison of mice using two different gaits that clearly rely on different inter-limb and whole body coordination (e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6"><italic>Figure 4A, 4C, 6A and 6B</italic></xref><italic>). Indeed you have clear indications that walk is also expressed in wild-type mice at low speed (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4A and 4C</italic></xref><italic>). The data should be reanalyzed to address this issue. I am convinced that if the data are reanalysed, walk will show up in wild-type mice as well. This will dramatically change the conclusion of the story</italic>.</p><p>The fact that walk does show up in wildtype mice (explained above, and as the reviewer points out you could already see this from our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) absolutely does not change the conclusions of our paper. All coordination analyses were size- and speed-matched. Moreover, although there are no categorical gait transitions, the coordination results hold across speeds, regardless of whether wild-type gait patterns are more walk-like or more trot-like.</p><p><italic>4) The discussion about the superiority of the present method to others needs to be toned down. The general statement that the automated analysis described in the study provides a robust way for locomotor analysis avoiding &quot;false positive findings that permeate the mouse locomotor literature&quot; is not true and likely to offend the locomotor field at large</italic>.</p><p>We sincerely apologize for any offense (which was certainly not intended) and have completely changed our language on this point (see also response to point #4 of Reviewer 2, above). However we also hope that our clarifications about the content of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2 and 3</xref> have helped the reviewer understand what we meant by “false positives” – <italic>the gait parameters are different in</italic> pcd<italic>, but these differences are accounted for by walking speed and body size and therefore do not reflect ataxia per se</italic>.</p><p><italic>I strongly recommend that the authors consider gaits (walk, trot, gallop and bound) in their analysis. Since you have done an incredible work using size-matched controls, it will be helpful if the difference between wild-type and pcd mutant mice account just for the degeneration of the Purkinje cells and not for errors due to a comparison between mice using two different gaits</italic>.</p><p>We wrote our response to Major Comment #3, above, before the recent paper by Bellardita and Kiehn (in press), came out. We now also refer directly to the new paper in our Results section (in the subsection “Front-hind Interlimb coordination is specifically impaired in <italic>pcd</italic>”):</p><p>“In our experiments, wildtype mice walked in a symmetrical trot pattern across speeds – each diagonal pair of limbs moved together and alternated with the other pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, left). […] This increased instability indicates that <italic>pcd</italic> mice are not simply switching to a more stable gait pattern, but rather, are unable to properly time their front-hind limb movements to generate a stable, efficient gait.”</p><p><italic>5) To my knowledge</italic> pcd <italic>mice showed not only a degeneration of the Purkinje cells but also the slower degeneration of the photoreceptor cells of the retina and mitral cells of the olfactory bulb. Since you have used animals between 41 and 154 days old, could it be that a shorter range of speed is the result of a disorganization of the visual system and not only due to an impairment of the neural control of the locomotion? They walk slower because they are half blind</italic>?</p><p>Please see our response (including the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>) to a similar point raised in point #1 of Reviewer 2, above. The new figure shows that results hold in <italic>pcd</italic> mice less than 50 days old, before extracerebellar degeneration. Also, separately, we have measured locomotion in blind mice and we do not see the alterations reported here, and we note that even if they did walk more slowly for this reason, our analyses were all speed matched so this alone could not account for our findings.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</italic></p><p><italic>The reviewers all appreciated the fact that the novel LocoMouse tool permits automated analysis with high resolution of locomotion of freely walking mice, and they judged that this method has the potential to be of value to the field.

We address each of these six points and our corresponding revisions in detail below, in response to the specific concerns raised by the reviewers.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) The authors emphasize in several places that 'traditional' measures of kinematics are unimpaired in mutants. I found this to be overly-simplistic, at least based on the results presented here. As I understand it, the main consistency is in the x-axis forward paw motion, while there are changes in vertical and mediolateral paw motion and in joint angles. Changes in vertical paw trajectory and joint angles are hardly 'non-traditional', 'complex', or even '3D' and all measures are definitely 'individual-limb'. This point is made several times in the text (see points below) and seems unwarranted. I'm not saying the results aren't interesting, nor do I think that these conclusions are necessary for the impact of the paper – I just don't think that this conclusion as stated is supported</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for not being more clear. We do not intend to claim that individual limb movements are intact in <italic>pcd</italic> mutants (they clearly are not). The reviewer is correct that we were trying to emphasize the preservation of forward motion of the paws. Our use of the subjective term “traditional” was misleading and we have removed it. We were using “traditional” to refer to stance-based analyses from paw print analyses and popular commercial systems for mouse locomotion such as CatWalk. However, clearly joint measurements and vertical trajectories (both affected in <italic>pcd</italic>) are traditional measures for ataxia in other species. We have clarified our terminology throughout the text to reflect more accurately our intended meaning, which is that the parameters that are usually reported as evidence for gait ataxia in mice were only different in <italic>pcd</italic> in ways that had nothing to do with ataxia (because they were associated with changes in body size and walking speed). Specifically, we now refer to the parameters depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> as “basic stride parameters” rather than “traditional gait parameters”, because not only was the use of “traditional” problematic, but there is a critical distinction between the effects of ataxia on strides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures. 2 and 3</xref>) and gait (which also includes the interlimb and whole-body coordination shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5 fig6">Figures 4-7</xref>, for example). When we refer to both the stride parameters from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and the forward trajectories of the paws shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> (such as in the Abstract) we have replaced “traditional, individual-limb parameters” with “forward motion of individual paws.”</p><p><italic>2) On a similar point, it's not clear to me that any of their measures are really looking at within-limb coordination, at least as this is usually considered. Most of the measures relate to paw movement, whereas traditionally issues of coordination (e.g. in studies examining the role of the cerebellum, as cited in the paper) consider interactions between joints. Yet these analyses really aren't done here. They show that joint angles are apparently different in the animals, but these are for single joints as opposed to joint angle relationships (and what those angles are is unclear, see below). I don't think that the results shown here rule out a possible deficit in traditional, within-limb coordination. I think this is mainly an issue of presentation, however, rather than one of substance. As stated above, I don't think the impact of the paper relies on this conclusion and it could be made more precise without loss of significance</italic>.</p><p>Indeed, this was also an issue of clarity on our part – we do not intend to rule out intralimb coordination deficits in <italic>pcd</italic>. In fact we think the altered y and z trajectories and restricted joint angles do represent deficits in within-limb coordination. The changes in language described in response to point 1, above, should help clarify this.</p><p><italic>3) I potentially like the analysis of nose and tail passive movements very much, but I did have a few issues with it. First, although the results are consistent with a role of the cerebellum in predictive control based on forward models, they're not really a direct demonstration thereof. A more direct demonstration might involve examining adaptations to perturbations, e.g. adding a weight to the tail and seeing that initially control animals look like mutants but then learn to predict and compensate for this, whereas mutants never do so. Also, could the results simply be interpreted as one of a limited capacity for motor control? e.g. mutants have limited capacity for producing locomotion and expend most of it on x-axis movement of the paw since it's critical for task performance, whereas other aspects of behavior are allowed to vary? I appreciate the authors are careful on this point to say that the results are 'consistent' with this idea, but alternative explanations might be considered more directly</italic>.</p><p>We have toned down and revised the forward model interpretation in response to this and other comments from the reviewers. To address the reviewer’s point directly, we don’t think the alternative of a limited capacity for motor control in <italic>pcd</italic> can fully explain our data. First, there is generally not an increase in variability in <italic>pcd</italic>. Second, although it could explain why the tail/nose movements are larger in <italic>pcd</italic>, we don’t see how it could explain the systematic shift from phase locking/leading in control animals to phase lags (that are consistent with time-delayed movements) in <italic>pcd,</italic> a phenomenon that we observed not just in the nose/tail movements but also in the patterns of interlimb coordination.</p><p><italic>4) For the nose/tail passive analysis, I originally thought that this was an actual physical model, rather than the geometric model used here. It seems clear that a physical model is the better way to do this. Why wasn't it done? The geometric model, with its assumptions of lags taken from data which is actually observed, seems more indirect and therefore less compelling</italic>.</p><p>Our intuition was initially the same as the reviewer’s and we actually began by constructing a physical model. However, the physical modeling required us to make multiple assumptions about the biomechanics of the tail, and we wanted to avoid simply tweaking parameters to achieve a model that would fit the data. We therefore decided to ask whether a very simple geometric model with as few assumptions as possible might do just as well. The passive geometrical model had just two assumptions. First, that passive nose and tail movements would result directly from orthogonal coupling to the forward oscillations of the hind paws – this was the key insight. Second, that these movements would occur time-delayed relative to the hind paw oscillation (and that the time delays would be longest for the mouse’s rump and become progressively smaller for each more distal segment, due to decreasing mass). It is readily apparent from the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1H</xref>) that the assumption of time-delayed movements only holds true for <italic>pcd</italic> mice, and not controls. However the correspondence between the passive model predictions and the nose and tail movements of <italic>pcd</italic> mice was also striking at the level of the waveforms themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5, A, B</xref>). We were surprised at how well this simple model fit the <italic>pcd</italic> data and found the simplicity of this approach to be quite powerful. However given that biomechanics can be counterintuitive we have also implemented a simplified, 3-segment physical model of the tail as a proof of principle. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 3</xref> we show the results of this physical model, which are in general agreement with those of the geometrical model.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07892.025</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Physical model.</title><p>The physical model of the tail consists of three masses 1, 2 and 3 (the later being the most distal) connected via an angualar spring-damper system.

It would be very good to have done the same analysis for the control animals and show that the tail/nose movements are inconsistent with passive movement. E.g. it could have been that the movement of the pelvic girdle was different in controls, leading to less tail movement (even though the hindlimbs are in alternation for both controls and mutants)</italic>.</p><p>This is an important point and we were not as clear about it as we should have been. We have revised the Materials and methods section and now provide more detail about the geometric model. The stride parameters were taken from the statistical stride models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, for a small mouse (15g). Because these stride parameters were indistinguishable between <italic>pcd</italic> and small controls, the key point here is that the passive geometric model is not a model for either the mutants or the controls. The model traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B, F</xref> are based on stride data that did not vary by genotype, plus the fixed time delays. The model fits the <italic>pcd</italic> data better than control data because only the <italic>pcd</italic> tail/nose moved time-delayed and directly orthogonally-coupled to the hind paws. Also note that in terms of differences in pelvic girdle between the two mice, the only factor that could influence the amplitude of tail movement in our model would be the wider base of support in <italic>pcd</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) – which would actually predict that <italic>pcd</italic> mice would exhibit smaller amplitude tail oscillations than controls (because of smaller angular excursion of the hind paw axis). Further, this would not account for any differences in phasing between the two groups of mice.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>The paper by Machado et al. examines gait patterns in wildtype and Purkinje cell degeneration (</italic>pcd<italic>) mice using a novel system for tracking locomotor kinematics in freely walking mice. The authors conclude that the individual limb kinematics of</italic> pcd <italic>mice are normal when the weight and the walking speed of the mice are taken into account. In contrast,</italic> pcd <italic>mice have impaired coordination of movements across joints, limbs and body. These results are interpreted as evidence that the cerebellum provides a forward model. This is a strong paper. I commend the authors for wrestling with a complex dataset and extracting from it a number of thought-provoking findings. I personally found many of the results exciting, but I must admit that I'm not an expert in the field of locomotion or ataxia. It was not always clear if a particular result in the paper was a major advance or just confirmation of something we already knew. For this reason, I think that it's important for the authors to clarify and emphasize the significance of their results throughout the text. I've given two examples below</italic>:</p><p>Thank you. We have rewritten several sections to be more explicit about the specific findings of previous studies and to provide context for our results (see specific instances below).</p><p><italic>1) It is remarkable that in wildtype mice, one can account for upwards of 80% of the variance in kinematic parameters like stride length, swing velocity and cadence, simply by taking into account the walking speed and the weight of the mouse. Is this a new approach? In their rebuttal, the authors mention that the</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11"><italic>Cendelin et al. (2010)</italic></xref> <italic>paper found that all the gait differences between lurcher and control mice disappeared when they corrected for walking speed. Did Cendelin et al. make the correction using a similar modeling approach</italic>?</p><p>No, they did not. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cendelin et al. (2010)</xref> used the CatWalk system to measure stride parameters in visibly ataxic lurcher mice and found while they were different in lurchers and controls overall, the values for the fastest lurcher trials and the slowest control trials were comparable. They did not deal with body weight and they used speed grouping rather than statistical modeling to identify speed effects. They hypothesized that CatWalk analysis was not able to detect gait ataxia because it resulted from “titubations, pro-, retro- and latero-pulsions” not captured by CatWalk, while “the coordination of limb movements is affected minimally” in ataxia. Our finding that the differences in stride parameters in <italic>pcd</italic> can be accounted for by changes in walking speed and body size is consistent with their results. We extend this finding by providing quantitative predictions for these stride parameters across mice and trials, incorporating body weight, and analyzing swing kinematics, interlimb coordination, and head and tail movements to identify which of these features truly represent ataxia vs. changes in walking speed and body size. In the end we reach conclusions that differ from their predictions regarding the nature of ataxia, but their study and their statement, “The fact that almost all differences in gait parameters are markedly dependent on walking speed seems surprising because the difference between a walking Lurcher mutant and a wild type mouse is clearly visible with the naked eye”, provided a major motivation for our study – to see if we could quantitatively capture the fundamental features of ataxia in freely walking mice.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batka et al.

Also to our knowledge no one has presented predictive models for stride parameters as we do here and we think this, together with the large dataset we provide, is a useful resource for future mouse locomotion studies.</p><p>We have revised several sections of the manuscript (notably the rewritten Introduction) to put our findings more explicitly within the context of these two important previous studies.</p><p><italic>2) One of the main findings is that individual limb movements of</italic> pcd <italic>mice are relatively spared (when weight and walking speed are taken into account), whereas interlimb coordination is impaired. It is not clear how much of this we already knew. For example, in the subsection “Front-hind Interlimb coordination is specifically impaired in</italic> pcd<italic>”, the authors mention that previous studies in ataxic mice have failed to detect any impairments in the kinematic parameters of individual limbs. Did those studies not examine interlimb coordination as well? If the authors are the first to show that mice with cerebellar deficits have a specific impairment in locomotor coordination but not in movement of individual limbs, this is a big deal</italic>.</p><p>Nearly all papers using overground locomotion to assess ataxia in mice have reported differences in paw stride parameters (which are real, but are artifacts of walking speed and body size) at face value. The reference was to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cendelin et al. (2010)</xref> paper just described, which is unusual in its consideration of walking speed. Other papers have shown deficits in both stride parameters of individual limbs and interlimb coordination in ataxic mutants (e.g. Vinueza-Veloz 2014). To our knowledge we are the first to isolate impairments in coordination (across joints, limbs, and body) from the non-specific changes in stride parameters and forward motion of the paws.</p><p><italic>Additional recommendations to help make an already strong paper even stronger:</italic></p><p><italic>3) Drop the emphasis on forward models. The authors argue that the deficits they've uncovered point to a lack of a forward model in pcd mice. Although I found some of the evidence presented intriguing (for example the analysis of tail movements), it is far from conclusive. Furthermore, it is difficult to reconcile the normal individual limb kinematics with a faulty forward model – individual limbs are controlled by multiple agonist/antagonist muscles whose coordination requires well-calibrated forward models. I think the authors can still interpret their results in the context of forward/inverse models, but I strongly recommend that they save this interpretation for the Discussion, tone it down a bit and address the limitations. The paper would be stronger if the second paragraph of the Introduction is rewritten to highlight the main questions to be addressed in the paper, instead of offering to resolve controversies about forward vs inverse cerebellar models</italic>.</p><p>We have moved the treatment of internal models to the Discussion, edited it (both toning down and shortening), and rewritten the second paragraph of the Introduction as requested.</p><p><italic>4) Analysis of variability: All the analyses are based on average data. For example,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3B-E</italic></xref> <italic>shows that there is no difference in the individual limb kinematics of</italic> pcd <italic>mice and sized-matched controls. But this is done only for the average kinematic values. Is it not possible that</italic> pcd <italic>mice might show increased trial-to-trial variability in their movements relative to sized-matched controls? How would such a finding change the authors' conclusions</italic>?</p><p>We, like the reviewer, fully expected to observe increased variability in <italic>pcd</italic>. However, aside from the increased variability in hind paw placement that we reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, we actually found that the movements of <italic>pcd</italic> mice were either equally, or in several cases, even less variable than controls. To be honest we didn’t know what to make of this finding, and didn’t want to make strong claims about a surprising lack of variability. However leaving it out was probably not the best choice either, and so we have now included the other variability analyses (including those corresponding to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B-E</xref>) in the text of the paper. (Also note that the density plots, now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>, do show the full range of data for limb phasing.)</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>The authors developed a machine learning algorithm to track the individual limbs as well as the nose and tail of mice in 3D during natural, voluntary locomotion. They provide a very detailed analysis of locomotion parameters in control and ataxic Purkinje cell degeneration (</italic>pcd<italic>) mice, revealing that individual limb kinematics in</italic> pcd <italic>mice are not different from control mice when accounting for the mouse's weight and speed, but that</italic> pcd <italic>mice present multi-joint and inter-limb-coordination deficits. The study has been carefully conducted and provides new and useful tools for measuring and analyzing specific features of locomotion and ataxia with unprecedented accuracy</italic>.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p><italic>1) The construction of the &quot;passive model&quot; (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>) is unclear. For example, does this model take into account the mass of the tail? Please describe in more detail how the passive prediction is calculated</italic>.</p><p>We rewrote the Materials and methods paragraph describing the model.

What do they think the inverse kinematic model would predict and how does this contrast with their findings</italic>?</p><p>We expected that a failure of an inverse kinematic model would cause changes in forward paw trajectories, which were surprisingly intact in <italic>pcd</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

We therefore recommend cutting this one measurement and illustration. Alternatively, if there is some reason why a single animal in each category is of value, please justify the experiment clearly. This point is explained further below</italic>.</p><p>We have removed the joint angle analysis from the paper.</p><p><italic>In the subsection “Individual limb parameters”: This description makes it seem like one</italic> pcd <italic>animal and one control were used for this analysis. If so, this seems very questionable and underpowered. I'd be willing to bet that, with enough n, it would be possible to find a significant difference between two different weight matched controls. I'm not sure how the stats behave in this situation, but it's not clear to me how mixed models would be able to partition variance due to random effects (individual subjects) from the fixed effects (mutation) if there were only one animal in each group. It seems that for other comparisons with weight matched controls much larger N's are used, whereas this analysis is limited because of the need to hand mark frames. It might be easiest to simply drop this joint angle analysis – I don't think its omission would change the impact of the paper. Also, shouldn't it be 'knee, heel, toe’? And here it's stated that the angle of the foot and arm relative to the ground are quantified – I might have missed it, but I wasn't sure where that was reported in the Results</italic>.</p><p>We have removed the joint angle analysis from the paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
