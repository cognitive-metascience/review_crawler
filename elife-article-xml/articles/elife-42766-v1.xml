the function of HCN channels at the subcellular level in axons remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the action potential conduction velocity in both myelinated and unmyelinated central axons can be bidirectionally modulated by a HCN channel blocker, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and neuromodulators. Recordings from mouse cerebellar mossy fiber boutons show that HCN channels ensure reliable high-frequency firing and are strongly modulated by cAMP (EC<sub>50</sub> 40 µM; estimated endogenous cAMP concentration 13 µM). In addition, immunogold-electron microscopy revealed HCN2 as the dominating subunit in cerebellar mossy fibers. Computational modeling indicated that HCN2 channels control conduction velocity primarily by altering the resting membrane potential and are associated with significant metabolic costs. These results suggest that the cAMP-HCN pathway provides neuromodulators with an opportunity to finely tune energy consumption and temporal delays across axons in the brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axon</kwd><kwd>HCN</kwd><kwd>conduction velocity</kwd><kwd>neuromodulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HA 6386/4-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hallermann</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cAMP-HCN pathway can control action potential conduction velocity providing neuromodulators with the ability to tune energy consumption and temporal delays across axons in the brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>HCN channels are expressed in the heart and nervous system and comprise four members (HCN1–HCN4), which differ in their kinetics, voltage-dependence and degree of sensitivity to cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Robinson and Siegelbaum, 2003</xref>). Membrane hyperpolarization activates HCN channels and causes a depolarizing mixed sodium/potassium (Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>) current. In the heart, the current through HCN channels (<italic>I</italic><sub>f</sub>) mediates the acceleratory effect of adrenaline on heart rate by direct binding of cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">DiFrancesco, 2006</xref>). In neurons, the current through HCN channels (<italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub>) controls a wide array of functions, such as rhythmic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pape and McCormick, 1989</xref>) and excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tang and Trussell, 2015</xref>). In addition to the somatic impact, HCN channels are expressed throughout various subcellular compartments of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nusser, 2012</xref>). For example, patch-clamp recordings from dendrites in pyramidal neurons have revealed particularly high densities of HCN channels that act to control the local resting potential and leak conductance, thereby playing important roles in regulating synaptic integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">George et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Harnett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kole et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Magee, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Williams and Stuart, 2000</xref>).</p><p>On the contrary, the expression and role of <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> in the axon is less studied. <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> seems to control the strength of synaptic transmission in the crayfish and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beaumont and Zucker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cheung et al., 2006</xref>). However, presynaptic recordings from the vertebrate calyx of Held in the auditory brainstem found <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> to only have a marginal effect on neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cuttle et al., 2001</xref>), but to exert a strong influence on the resting membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cuttle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kim and von Gersdorff, 2012</xref>) and on vesicular neurotransmitter uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Huang and Trussell, 2014</xref>). At the synaptic terminals of pyramidal neurons in the cortex of mice, HCN channels inhibit glutamate release by suppressing the activity of T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Huang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Besides a potential impact on neurotransmitter release, axonal <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> could play a role in the propagation of action potentials. Indeed, in axons of the stomatogastric nervous system of lobsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Marder and Bucher, 2001</xref>), the action potential conduction was affected by dopamine acting via axonal HCN channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ballo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ballo et al., 2012</xref>). In vertebrates, studies on action potential propagation by Waxman and coworkers indicated that <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> counteracts the hyperpolarization of the membrane potential during periods of high-frequency firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Birch et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Waxman et al., 1995</xref>), and that it participates in ionic homeostasis at the node of Ranvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Waxman and Ritchie, 1993</xref>). More recent investigations found <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> to be crucial for the emergence of persistent action potential firing in axons of parvalbumin-positive interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Elgueta et al., 2015</xref>), but <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> seems to have an opposing effect on the excitability at the axon initial segment, where its activation reduces the probability of action potential initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ko et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, there is evidence from extracellular recordings that blocking <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> decreases the action potential conduction velocity in unmyelinated central axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baginskas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Soleng et al., 2003</xref>) and peripheral axons of vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Grafe et al., 1997</xref>). However, the neuromodulation of conduction velocity and the underlying cellular membrane mechanisms are not known in vertebrate axons.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate a decrease or increase in conduction velocity in central axons as a result of the application of HCN blockers or neuromodulators. To gain mechanistic insights into the modulation of conduction velocity by HCN channels, we performed recordings from <italic>en passant</italic> cerebellar mossy fiber boutons (cMFB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ritzau-Jost et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Delvendahl et al., 2015</xref>). We found that HCN channels in cMFBs mainly consist of the HCN2 subunit, are ~7% activated at resting membrane potential, ensure high-frequency firing, and control the passive membrane properties. Whole-cell and perforated patch clamp recordings from cMFBs demonstrated a strong dependence of HCN channels on intracellular cAMP concentration with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 40 µM and a high endogenous cAMP concentration of 13 µM. Computational modeling indicated that the resting membrane potential controls conduction velocity and that the activity of the HCN channel is metabolically expensive. These data reveal the existence of a mechanism to modulate conduction velocity bidirectionally in the central nervous system, which is shared among different types of axons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bidirectional modulation of conduction velocity</title><p>To investigate whether HCNs affect conduction velocity, we recorded compound action potentials in three different types of axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Application of the specific HCN channel blocker ZD7288 (30 µM) decreased the conduction velocity by 8.0 ± 2.8% in myelinated cerebellar mossy fibers (n = 14), by 9.2 ± 0.9% in unmyelinated cerebellar parallel fibers (n = 15), and by 4.0 ± 0.8% in optic nerves (n = 4; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and its legend for statistical testing). As some studies implied that ZD7288 might have unspecific side effects, such as blocking voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wu et al., 2012</xref>), we recorded Na<sup>+</sup> currents from 53 cMFBs and found no change in the amplitude or kinetics of voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> currents after ZD7288 application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>),suggesting that under our conditions and at a concentration of 30 µM, ZD7288 did not affect the Na<sup>+</sup> currents. Because of the modulation of HCN channels by intracellular cAMP, we measured conduction velocity during the application of 8-bromoadenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP; 500 µM), a membrane-permeable cAMP-analog. The conduction velocity increased by 5.9 ± 2.8% in cerebellar mossy fibers (n = 17), by 3.7 ± 1.4% in parallel fibers (n = 10), and by 4.6 ± 0.6% in optic nerves (n = 5; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and its legend for statistical testing).

Furthermore, HCN channels increase the maximal failure-free firing frequency by a factor of two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Although the changes in baseline conduction velocity are relatively small, considering the long distances that axons traverse in the brain, HCN channels can be expected to change the arrival time of the action potential by, for example, 0.5 ms in the case of unmyelinated cerebellar parallel fibers (assuming 3 mm length and 0.3 m/s velocity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Swadlow and Waxman, 2012</xref>). Such temporal delays will influence information processing in the central nervous system, because spike-timing dependent plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Caporale and Dan, 2008</xref>), coincidence detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Softky, 1994</xref>), and the neuronal rhythms of cell ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Buzsáki et al., 2013</xref>) precisely tune the arrival times of action potentials. There are several examples of the specific tuning of conduction velocity in the sub-millisecond domain: the diameter and the degree of myelination of cerebellar climbing fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sugihara et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lang and Rosenbluth, 2003</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker and Edgley, 2006</xref>), the degree of myelination of thalamocortical axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Salami et al., 2003</xref>), and the internode distance of auditory axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ford et al., 2015</xref>) are all tuned exactly to offset the different arrival times of action potentials with a temporal precision of ~100 µs.</p><p>The cerebellum is involved in the accurate control of muscle contraction with a temporal precision of 1–100 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hore et al., 1991</xref>).

Furthermore, submillisecond precision of the mossy or parallel fiber input are critical for information processing in the cerebellar circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Braitenberg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Heck et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Isope et al., 2002</xref>). Together, the here-described changes in action potential conduction velocity in mossy and parallel fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) may thus play an important role in cerebellar computation. Furthermore, HCN channels facilitate high-frequency firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which occurs in many parts of the mammalian CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Delvendahl and Hallermann, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our findings that the cAMP-HCN pathway and neuromodulators can finely tune conduction velocity in the vertebrate central nervous system adds to the emerging idea that axons directly contribute to computation in neuronal circuits. Indeed, the view of the axon as a cable-like compartment in which conduction velocity is static has substantially changed over recent years in favor of a model that allows flexibility and complex forms of axonal computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Debanne et al., 2011</xref>). Recent findings showed that axon diameters change during long-term potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chéreau et al., 2017</xref>), and changes in myelination in the motor cortex were resolved during the learning of complex motor skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">McKenzie et al., 2014</xref>; for environmental effects on myelination see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Forbes and Gallo, 2017</xref>). One caveat of our study is the rather high concentration of the used neuromodulators and the lack of in vivo evidence for the neuromodulation of conduction velocity. However, our data demonstrate that, under certain conditions, an active control of conduction velocity could occur in the vertebrate CNS via the cAMP-HCN pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mechanism and metabolic costs of HCN-channel-mediated control of action potential propagation</title><p>Our analysis revealed that the control of conduction velocity is solely mediated by changes in resting membrane potential. Isolated changes in membrane conductance and thus in the membrane time and length constant had no effect on conduction velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). The increased conduction velocity upon depolarization is consistent with a previously observed correlation between conduction velocity and the depolarization from the resting potential required to reach the firing threshold in motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Carp et al., 2003</xref>). On the other hand, Na<sup>+</sup> channels have a steep steady-state inactivation and are partially inactivated at the resting membrane potential in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Battefeld et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Engel and Jonas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rama et al., 2015</xref>). Depolarization could thus be expected to further inactivate Na<sup>+</sup> channels and to decrease conduction velocity. However, our modeling results showed that increasing the membrane potential from –90 to –60 mV increased the conduction velocity despite significantly decreasing Na<sup>+</sup> channel availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, these findings are in agreement with the nonlinear cable theory predicting that the difference between the resting membrane potential and the firing threshold is a critical parameter for action potential conduction velocity (see, for example, Figure 12.25 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Jack et al. (1983)</xref> which shows increasing velocity with increasing safety factor, that is, decreasing excitation threshold ‘<italic>V</italic><sub>B</sub>’). Intuitively, the HCN-channel-mediated acceleration of conduction velocity can be understood as follows: Na<sub>V-</sub>mediated current influx in one axonal location will depolarize neighboring locations faster above the threshold in a depolarized axon compared with a resting axon. In our model, this effect outweighs the disadvantage of the increased steady-state inactivation of Na<sup>+</sup> channels up to a membrane potential of about –65 mV and a Na<sub>V</sub> availability of 50%. But the exact values above which Na<sub>V</sub> availability limits conduction velocity critically depend on the assumptions of the model, such as the voltage-dependence of inactivation and the density of the Na<sub>V</sub> channel. Interestingly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering through axonal voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brenowitz and Regehr, 2007</xref>) could interact with the cAMP pathway by activating or inhibiting different subtypes of adenylyl cyclase and phosphodiesterase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bruce et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>We observed a marked decrease in the maximal failure-free firing frequency from ~800 to ~400 Hz in cerebellar mossy fiber axons upon blockade of HCN channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Although we cannot differentiate between initiation failure and conduction failure, the alterations in the half duration and amplitude of action potentials during high-frequency firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) argue for impaired action potential conduction in the absence of HCN channels. This is consistent with findings in cerebellar parallel fibers and hippocampal Schaffer collaterals, where HCN channels ensure reliable conduction, particularly at branch points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baginskas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Soleng et al., 2003</xref>). The extent to which conduction failures occur under physiological conditions is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Debanne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rama et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Radivojevic et al., 2017</xref>), but our data indicate that HCN channels are required to ensure the reliable initiation and conduction of action potentials at high frequencies. This is consistent with <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> counteracting the hyperpolarization during high-frequency firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Waxman et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Our modeling results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) indicate that the evolutionary design of HCN channels as a continuously open shunt for Na<sup>+</sup> influx incurs significant metabolic costs. These high costs might appear surprising, because a metabolically cheaper way to depolarize the membrane would be the expression of fewer Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPases, resulting in a depolarized K<sup>+</sup> reversal potential (cf. <italic>V<sub>m</sub>-model</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). However, such a design might complicate high-frequency firing. Furthermore, as discussed in the following paragraph, our finding that conduction velocity can be rapidly regulated via the cAMP-HCN pathway might provide an additional justification for the metabolic costs of axonal HCN channels.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Modulation of conduction velocity via intracellular cAMP concentration</title><p>Using direct whole-cell recordings and immunogold EM from <italic>en passant</italic> boutons in cerebellar axons, we identified near exclusive expression of HCN2 isoforms and a half-maximal shift of the activation of HCN2 channels at a cAMP concentration of 40 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Furthermore, our perforated patch-recordings from axonal compartments provide, to our knowledge, the first direct estimate of endogenous cAMP concentration in vertebrate central axons of 13 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This is higher than previous estimates of 50 nM in Aplysia sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacskai et al., 1993</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Greenberg et al., 1987</xref>) and 1 µM in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Börner et al., 2011</xref>). But a recently reported low cAMP-sensitivity of protein kinase A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Koschinski and Zaccolo, 2017</xref>), a prototypical cAMP-regulated protein, also argues for high intracellular cAMP concentrations. On the other hand, our data do not rule out that such high cAMP concentrations are limited to spatially restricted domains. The possibility of local cAMP signaling-compartments was recently observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Maiellaro et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A high endogenous cAMP concentration and expression of the HCN2 isoform facilitates the ability of neuromodulators to control conduction velocity bidirectionally and dynamically. Only norepinephrine increased the conduction velocity in cerebellar parallel fibers whereas the other neuromodulators reduced the velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), consistent with the expression of both G<sub>i</sub>- and G<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors, respectively. Indeed, G<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors for serotonin, dopamine, and adenosine are expressed in the molecular layer of the cerebellum (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Geurts et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Schweighofer et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, adenosine, which decreased the conduction velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), has been shown to be an endogenous sleep factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basheer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Porkka-Heiskanen et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine play important regulatory functions during sleep in, for example, the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Canto et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the cAMP-HCN pathway allows not only an increase in the conduction velocity during arousal but also a decrease in the velocity that saves metabolic costs during periods of rest or sleep. The cAMP-HCN pathway in axons could thus contribute to the reduced energy consumption of the brain during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boyle et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Townsend et al., 1973</xref>). It should be noted that the observed modulation of conduction velocity by neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) is consistent with a modulation via the cAMP-HCN pathway. Nevertheless, other mechanisms, such as direct influences on voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yin et al., 2017</xref>), K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yang et al., 2013</xref>), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Burke et al., 2018</xref>), could contribute to the modulation of conduction velocity.

For the extracellular recording of compound action potentials, two pipettes were filled with a 1M NaCl solution (tip resistance of 1–3 MΩ) and placed within the respective fiber bundle and the voltage was measured in current clamp mode with an EPC10 amplifier (CC gain 10x). Compound action potentials were evoked at 0.5 and 1 Hz in parallel and mossy fibers, respectively. All recordings were performed in the presence of 10 µM NBQX to block synaptic potentials. The conduction velocity of parallel fibers was measured at 35°C. Owing to the higher conduction velocity in myelinated mossy fibers, the action potentials evoked by white matter stimulation had to be recorded at room temperature to allow the separation of the compound action potential from the stimulation artifact. To calculate the conduction velocity, we determined the delays of the peaks of the compound action potential component recorded with the proximal and distal electrode. Compound action potentials from mossy fibers were analyzed offline using the smoothing spline interpolation operation of Igor Pro to increase the signal to noise ratio.

Action potentials were treated as failures if the peak did not exceed –40 mV.</p><p>Recordings were performed with an EPC10/2 patch-clamp amplifier, operated by the corresponding software PatchMaster (HEKA Elektronik) running on a personal computer. Recording electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (inner diameter 1.16 mm, outer diameter 2 mm) by a microelectrode puller (DMZ-Universal Puller, Zeitz Instruments, Augsburg). Pipettes used for patch-clamp recordings had open-tip resistances of 5–12 MΩ. The intracellular presynaptic patch pipette contained (in mM): K-gluconate 150, MgATP 3, NaGTP 0.3, NaCl 10, HEPES 10 and EGTA 0.05. The apparent input resistance of cMFBs was estimated by linear regression of the steady-state voltage in response to 300 ms hyperpolarizing current pulses of increasing amplitude (–five to –20 pA), whereas the apparent membrane time constant was determined by fitting the voltage response to a −10 pA hyperpolarizing pulse with a mono-exponential function.</p><p><italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> activation curves determined from the analysis of normalized tail current were fitted with a Boltzmann function:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where V is the holding potential, <italic>V<sub>½</sub></italic> is the voltage of half-maximal activation and <italic>k</italic> the slope factor.

Immediately before the experiments, the nystatin-stock was added to the intracellular solution at a final concentration of 50 µg/ml. In order to monitor the integrity of the perforated membrane patch, the green-fluorescent dye Atto 488 was added at a concentration of 50 µM. As nystatin is known to impair the formation of the GΩ seal, the initial ~500 μm of the pipette tip was filled with a perforating agent-free internal solution (tip-filling) before back-filling the pipette shaft with the perforating agent-containing solution. After establishing a GΩ seal, the holding potential was set to –70 mV and the access resistance (R<sub>a</sub>) was continuously monitored by applying 10 ms long depolarizing pulses to –60 mV at 1 Hz. Recording the voltage-dependent activation of <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> was begun after R<sub>a</sub> dropped below 150 MΩ. Because the perforated membrane patch ruptured spontaneously at R<sub>a</sub> &lt;50 MΩ, the access resistance was not comparable to standard whole-cell recordings. To exclude the possibility that the right-shift of the <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> activation curve in the perforated configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) was caused by the comparatively higher R<sub>a</sub>, the voltage-dependent activation of <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> was measured under normal whole-cell patch-clamp conditions, using pipettes with small openings that resulted in high access resistances (R<sub>a</sub> = 119 ± 12 MΩ). However, in these recordings, the midpoint of <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> activation (–105.5 ± 1.4 mV; n = 8) had a tendency to be left-shifted when compared with regular whole-cell recordings with standard patch pipettes (R<sub>a</sub> ≈ 30–60 MΩ; V<sub>½</sub> = –103.3 ± 0.8 mV; n = 36; P<sub>T-Test</sub> = 0.13). The left-shift of the <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> activation curve measured with high access resistances indicates that the right-shift measured with perforated patch recordings might be underestimated because of the higher R<sub>a</sub>, which would result in an even higher estimate of the endogenous cAMP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of the ZD sensitivity of Na<sup>+</sup> currents</title><p>Sodium currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) were isolated using a modified ACSF containing (in mM): NaCl 105, KCl 2.5, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.25, glucose 20, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, TEA 20, 4-AP 5 and CdCl<sub>2</sub> 0.2. To avoid underestimation of the true size of the presynaptic Na<sup>+</sup> currents because of the voltage-drop through the access resistance, we blocked a portion of the Na<sup>+</sup> current with 30 nM TTX. Na<sup>+</sup> currents were elicited from a holding potential of –80 mV by a 3-ms-long depolarization to 0 mV. Peak amplitudes and half-durations of Na<sup>+</sup> currents were measured from leak-subtracted traces.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunoelectron microscopy</title><p>Preembedding immunogold labeling was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Notomi and Shigemoto, 2004</xref>).

Parasagittal sections through the cerebellum were cut at 50 µm, cryoprotected with 30% sucrose, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and rapidly thawed. Sections were blocked in 10% normal goat serum and 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 2 hr at room temperature, incubated in TBS containing 2% BSA and either guinea pig anti-HCN1 or anti-HCN2 antibody (1 µg/ml, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Notomi and Shigemoto, 2004</xref>) for 48 hr at 4°C, and finally reacted with nanogold-conjugated secondary antibody (Nanoprobes, 1:100) for 24 hr at 4°C. Nanogold particles were amplified with the HQ Silver Enhancement kit (Nanoprobes) for 8 min. Sections were treated in 0.5% osmium tetroxide in PB for 40 min and then 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 30 min at room temperature, dehydrated, and flat embedded in Durcopan resin (Sigma-Aldrich). Ultrathin sections were cut at 70 nm and observed by a transmission electron microscope (Tecnai 12, FEI, Oregon). Sequential images were recorded from the granule cell layer within a few microns of the surface of ultrathin sections at X26,500 using a CCD camera (VELETA, Olympus). For the reconstruction of a half mossy fiber bouton, 36 serial ultrathin sections were used. Sequential images were aligned and stacked using the TrakEM2 program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cardona et al., 2012</xref>). For the measurement of density of immunogold particles for HCN2 on this reconstructed profile, 1260 immunogold particles were counted on the mossy fiber bouton membrane area (73.7 µm<sup>2</sup>), giving a density of 17.1 particles/µm<sup>2</sup>. Immunogold particles within 30 nm of the bouton membranes were included in the analysis on the basis of the possible distance of the immunogold particle from the epitope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Matsubara et al., 1996</xref>). The density of non-specific labeling was estimated using the nuclear membrane of a granule cell located adjacent to the reconstructed mossy fiber bouton. We found 40 immunogold particles on the nuclear membrane area of 60.5 µm<sup>2</sup> giving a density of 0.66 particles/µm<sup>2</sup>, which was 3.9% of the HCN2 labeling density on the mossy fiber bouton.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Hodgkin-Huxley model of axonal HCN channels</title><p>Because we did not intend to simulate the cAMP dependence of HCN channel gating explicitly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hummert et al., 2018</xref>), we created two separate models for 0 and 1 mM intracellular cAMP, which were based on a previously described Hodgkin-Huxley model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kole et al., 2006</xref>) with one activation gate and no inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref>).

In addition, at one side of this chain, a long cylinder was added presenting the axon in the white matter (length 150 µm and diameter 1.2 µm). The specific membrane resistance was 0.9 µF/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gentet et al., 2000</xref>) and the cytoplasmatic resistivity was 120 Ω cm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hallermann et al., 2003</xref>). The specific membrane resistance and capacitance of the axonal compartments were both reduced by a factor of 10, representing myelination.</p><p>The ionic membrane conductances were similar to those published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ritzau-Jost et al. (2014)</xref> and were adjusted to reproduce the action potential duration and the maximal firing frequency as well as the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–D</xref>. Namely, an axonal Na<sup>+</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schmidt-Hieber and Bischofberger, 2010</xref>) and K<sup>+</sup> channel NMODL model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hallermann et al., 2012</xref>) was added with a density of 2000 and 1000 pS/µm<sup>2</sup> in the boutons and 0 and 0 pS/µm<sup>2</sup> in the axonal compartments, respectively. The Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> reversal potentials were 55 and –97 mV, respectively. To enable the analysis of the ATP consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hallermann et al., 2012</xref>), the leak conductance was implemented as separate Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> leak channel models with a conductance of 0.0138 and 0.18 pS/µm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, in the bouton compartments. In the axonal compartments, both conductances were reduced by a factor of 10. The above-described Hodgkin-Huxley model of axonal HCN channels (for 0 mM intracellular cAMP) was added with a density of g<sub>HCN</sub> = 0.3 and 0.03 pS/µm<sup>2</sup> for the bouton and axonal compartments, respectively. For the analysis of the ATP consumption, the g<sub>HCN</sub> conductance was separated in a Na<sup>+</sup> and a K<sup>+</sup> conductance according to g<sub>HCN(Na)</sub> = (1 – ratio<sub>K/Na</sub>) g<sub>HCN</sub> and g<sub>HCN(K)</sub> = ratio<sub>K/Na</sub> g<sub>HCN</sub>, where ratio<sub>K/Na</sub> = (e<sub>Na</sub> + e<sub>HCN</sub>)/(e<sub>Na</sub> – e<sub>K</sub>), where e<sub>Na</sub> and e<sub>K</sub> are the Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> reversal potential as described above and e<sub>HCN</sub> is the reversal potential of <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> measured as –23.3 mV (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Assuming a single channel conductance of 1.7 pS for HCN2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Thon et al., 2013</xref>), this conductance corresponds to a density of 0.18 HCN channels/µm<sup>2</sup>, which is much lower than the estimate from preembedding immunogold labeling (22 particles/µm<sup>2</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, the optimal density of the model critically depends on the geometry of the structure, which was not obtained from the recorded boutons. To obtain the required structural information, including the fenestration of the cMFB (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and the level of myelination, electron microscopic reconstructions of large volumes of the recorded cMFB and the entire axon would be needed. When we used a g<sub>HCN</sub>, as determined with preembedding immunogold labeling in our model, the model also predicted that <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> critically effects conduction velocity and that the depolarization is the main reason for the velocity to change. In general, these two conclusions of the model were very insensitive to the specific parameters of the model and were, for example, also obtained with additional interleaved cylindrical compartments with high Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channel densities representing nodes of Ranvier, or with a long cylindrical compartment with homogenous channel densities representing an unmyelinated axon. This further supports our finding that HCN channels accelerate conduction velocity independently of the exact parameters of the axon and the degree of myelination (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Starting from the model that reproduced the control data, the following four additional models were generated.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Nace Golding (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study examines the contribution of HCN channels to setting conduction velocity in mammalian axons. The work demonstrates that modulation of HCN channels by neuromodulators has the capacity to increase and decrease the rate of action potential propagation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>I am glad to say that both reviewers found that the manuscript was interesting and the experiments were largely convincing, although both identified some areas in need of clarification or improvement through additional experimentation. The key issues were as follows:</p><p>1) Demonstrating or assessing the biological existence and/or significance of the phenomenon of HCN modulation changing conduction velocity. Reviewer 1 noted that the concentrations of transmitters applied were relatively high and the question was raised about whether endogenous transmitter was likely to generate significant modulation. Reviewer 2 noted the complementary point, namely that it is difficult to assess the functional significance of the tiny (though significant) changes given the filtering properties of granule cells. Because of these combined comments, additional experiments, analysis, and writing are necessary to provide evidence for the biological relevance of the phenomenon. The idea of optogenetic stimulation was brought up but, in the consultation, it was acknowledged that such an experiment might be beyond the scope of practicality. An alternative of measuring conduction velocity with amphetamine-induced release of endogenous monoamines was suggested. So was the idea of measuring activity dependent modulation of Ih with high-frequency trains of stimuli. Those experiments, or equivalent approaches to illustrate that this phenomenon might occur measurably in the brain and influence cerebellar signal processing, would strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>2) Clarification of the influence of Ih-dependent depolarization on other ion channels and electrophysiological parameters. Both reviewers pointed out that the HCN-mediated depolarization could influence Na channels, which could in turn influence conduction; the interaction with other channels should be addressed through experiment and/or modeling.</p><p>3) Confirmation that the changes reported can be unambiguously ascribed to HCN channels. As you know, in the initial consultation among editors, concerns were raised about lack of occlusion experiments, the imperfect selectivity of ZD, and the absence of antibody controls. This issue should either be addressed experimentally or the conclusions should be appropriately curtailed and discussion of alternatives should be included.</p><p>The major points as expressed by the reviewers, with annotations relating to the essential revisions are included below to aid you in your revision.</p><p>General assessments:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This work by Byczkowicz and colleagues explores the role of HCN channels in axons, focusing on two axonal populations in cerebellum as well as optic nerve preparations. Using a complement of field recording, whole cell recording from boutons, EM, and modeling, they demonstrate that HCN channels bidirectionally control AP propagation speed across the range of preparations. While HCN expression and function has been studied in axons in the past, relatively little is known about how modulation of HCN in axonal areas beyond the initial segment affects excitability. Work here provides strong evidence that such modulation can have an impact on propagation speed and provides detailed mechanistic insight-through empirical and theoretical approaches-into how such modulation occurs. Experiments are well controlled and illustrated beautifully.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This study demonstrates a role for hyperpolarization and cyclic nucleotide gated (HCN) cation channels in providing a substrate for modulating the conduction velocity of several types of axons, with a more specific mechanistic focus on the mossy fibers of the cerebellum. The authors identify cAMP as a critical mechanism for the action of at least some neuromodulators, acting through HCN2 subunits. While the action of cAMP on HCN channels is well known, the focus on conduction velocity is new, and the quality of the data is high. The data set also includes a number of impressive, technically challenging experiments, such as perforated patch-clamp recordings from mossy fiber terminals and estimations of cAMP concentration in the terminal. The addition of modeling adds mechanistic clarity to the study. Experiments with three different axon types shows that the effects of cAMP and Ih on conduction velocity may be widespread in CNS axons. I do have some suggestions for improvements, detailed below.</p><p>Major comments (combined, with indications as to which essential revision is being spelled out in more detail):</p><p>1) Related to Essential Revision 1: While the data are unequivocal that such modulation can occur, I'm left wondering if this is indeed a mechanism employed to regulation information transfer in the cerebellum or other structures. The main concern involves Figure 2. Here, application of various neuromodulations demonstrate the capacity for modulation by endogenous systems, but they do little to show which of these systems are involved in such regulation. The concentrations used are so high that off target effects are a strong possibility (e.g., norepinephrine can engage dopamine receptors at high concentrations, Sanchez-Soto et al., 2016). It is critical to demonstrate that these effects are blocked by specific antagonists to establish that all of these systems are indeed in play. Furthermore, replicating these results using endogenous sources is a critical step to determine whether such modulation occurs in vivo. This would ideally be done with optogenetic activation of monoaminergic sources. (Ed's note: Note that optogenetic expts are not required for the revision, but this sentence is included since it was in the original review.) Less ideal, but still towards the point, would be to apply amphetamine to reverse monoamine transport. Either approach should be paired with appropriate antagonist controls.</p><p>2) Related to Essential Revision 1: The functional significance for the effects of Ih modulation on conduction velocity is somewhat vague as it is presented. The differences in conduction velocity are small, and on a sub-millisecond time scale. While the authors cite several papers supporting the importance of timing on this scale, the discussion lumps systems with very different circuit structures and computational demands. What is the evidence for the significance of submillisecond timing in the cerebellum? The mossy fiber input is ultimately low-pass filtered by granule cells with very slow membrane time constants so this requires some comment.</p><p>3) Related to Essential Revision 2: A second question relates to the modeling: The modeling explores two competing hypotheses that could account for the observed effects of HCN modulation, relating to changes in membrane potential and leak, and show that membrane potential and its relation to spike threshold is sufficient to explain the observed effects. This can be explained well by the cell being closer to threshold. A counter-argument would be that depolarization decreases NaV availability, but the authors mention that this is not a confound. The authors would be well served to explore this aspect in more detail to see how robust this result is across a range of conditions. First, it would be report relative NaV availability in each model. Second, it would be great to see if the relative changes in conduction velocity hold if the model starts at other membrane potentials (particularly more depolarized).</p><p>4) Related to Essential Revisions 1 and 2, as stated by the other reviewer: The modulation of Ih is presented as a way to dynamically control conduction velocities according to changes in neuromodulatory state. Given the presence of voltage-gated calcium channels in some axons and nodes of Ranvier, is it possible that the cAMP-mediated modulation of Ih could also serve a homeostatic role, bringing Vrest closer to threshold and offsetting the inactivation of Na channels under conditions of high action potential firing rates? This would be straightforward to test with high frequency trains of axonal stimuli in experiments and perhaps with the model.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;HCN channel-mediated neuromodulation can control action potential velocity and fidelity in central axons&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Ronald Calabrese (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been substantially improved but there are a few remaining issues that we would like you to address before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers agree that the manuscript has been improved by the new experiments. Because of some remaining questions regarding neuromodulation and possible consequences of action potential failure, both reviewers also agree that additional specific discussion of these issues is warranted. We are including the specific language of both reviewers below, because they have expressed the points clearly and can guide you in those textual revisions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors have done a good job addressing reviewer concerns, and I am very supportive of publication with a few additional text/formatting updates. Of note, the new recordings described in Figure 5 are impressive and highlight an interesting aspect of HCN function in axons, contributing to reliability during high frequency trains. I was a bit disappointed that neuromodulatory antagonist experiments were not performed. Instead, experiments were done with ZD and agonist application. This isn't as clean, given the issues related to ZD specificity, but nevertheless support the notion that HCN channels are the ultimate effector of the neuromodulatory systems engaged. In light of this, I'd request that the discussion relating to how neuromodulators could regulate axonal conduction be expanded to include any details known on neuromodulatory mechanisms previously reported in these axons, and a bit more on the possibility of off-target interactions with these concentrations. Also, the data in Figure 5 deserve a bit of discussion. AP failures at high frequency may be more consequential than these small changes in timing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study explores the role of HCN channels in regulating action potential conduction velocity in mossy fibers of the cerebellum and other axons as well. In the revision, the authors have provided a significant number of new experiments that add value to the manuscript. The terminal recordings combined with the modeling together convincingly demonstrate a significant impact of HCN channel activity not only on AP propagation velocity, but also on presynaptic spike frequency and reliability. The modeling better explores the impact of HCN channels on Na channel availability. The magnitude of HCN channel modulation on conduction velocity in vivo remains to be determined, but with the addition of the new experiments and modeling, this study provides a sophisticated examination of the interplay between HCN channels and voltage-gated Na channels in presynaptic axons. As before, the quality of the data is excellent. My only remaining concern revolves around the added occlusion experiments in Figure 3, as they relate to the neuromodulation experiments in Figure 2. In the presence of ZD7288 (30 µM), there are changes in conduction velocity of ~3-4%. This range is comparable to the neuromodulator-induced changes in velocity seen in the absence of ZD in Figure 2, with the exception of adenosine. In this regard, it would seem that these experiments are only partially successful in demonstrating specificity of neuromodulatory action on HCN channels. I think this issue needs to be reflected in the writing.

The key issues were as follows:</p><p>1) Demonstrating or assessing the biological existence and/or significance of the phenomenon of HCN modulation changing conduction velocity. Reviewer 1 noted that the concentrations of transmitters applied were relatively high and the question was raised about whether endogenous transmitter was likely to generate significant modulation. Reviewer 2 noted the complementary point, namely that it is difficult to assess the functional significance of the tiny (though significant) changes given the filtering properties of granule cells. Because of these combined comments, additional experiments, analysis, and writing are necessary to provide evidence for the biological relevance of the phenomenon. The idea of optogenetic stimulation was brought up but, in the consultation, it was acknowledged that such an experiment might be beyond the scope of practicality. An alternative of measuring conduction velocity with amphetamine-induced release of endogenous monoamines was suggested. So was the idea of measuring activity dependent modulation of Ih with high-frequency trains of stimuli. Those experiments, or equivalent approaches to illustrate that this phenomenon might occur measurably in the brain and influence cerebellar signal processing, would strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that, to unequivocally demonstrate the biological existence of neuromodulation of action potential propagation velocity, in vivo experiments are best-suited. However, we also feel that this is beyond the scope of this manuscript. To address this concern, we have now revised the manuscript by curtailing the conclusion from HCN channels <italic>do</italic> modulate conduction velocity to HCN channels <italic>can</italic> modulate conduction velocity (e.g., by changing the title to “HCN channel-mediated neuromodulation can control action potential velocity and fidelity in central axons”, in the Abstract “is modulated” to “can be modulated”, and in the Discussion: “However, our data demonstrate that under certain conditions an active control of conduction velocity could occur in the vertebrate CNS via the cAMP-HCN pathway”).</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we followed the suggestion of the reviewing editor and the reviewers by investigating high-frequency trains of action potentials. To this end, we performed a set of new experiments. We made additional whole-cell recordings from cerebellar mossy fiber boutons, loaded the bouton and the adjacent axon with a fluorescent dye, positioned a second extracellular stimulation pipette (filled with another dye) through two-photon fluorescent-guided microscopy close to the remote part of the axon, elicited high-frequency trains of action potentials with the stimulation pipette, and recorded the arriving action potentials in whole-cell current-clamp at the mossy fiber bouton (see new Figure 5 and Materials and methods, subsection “Recordings from cMFBs”). These experiments allowed unequivocal determination of the maximal failure-free frequency of individual axons as well as changes of conduction velocity during high-frequency trains of action potentials. The results revealed a strong reduction of the failure-free frequency from about ~800 to ~400 Hz upon blocking of HCN channels with ZD7288 (n = 20 and 10, respectively; P<sub>T-Test</sub> = 0.0002). Furthermore, the conduction velocity during the train of action potentials decreased by 20% in the presence of ZD7288 but increased by 5% in control recordings. Thus, in addition to the ~5% change in baseline conduction velocity reported in the initial version of the manuscript, the lack of HCN channels further decelerates action potential propagation during high-frequency trains of action potentials up to ~25% and decreases the maximal failure-free frequency by a factor of two. Our additional experiments therefore further support the idea that HCN channels have an important role in controlling axonal action potential propagation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Clarification of the influence of Ih-dependent depolarization on other ion channels and electrophysiological parameters. Both reviewers pointed out that the HCN-mediated depolarization could influence Na channels, which could in turn influence conduction; the interaction with other channels should be addressed through experiment and/or modeling.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the contribution of the inactivation of voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>V</sub>) channels upon depolarization, we have now systematically varied the resting membrane potential of our model by changing the potassium reversal potential (Figure 10—figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript). Increasing the resting membrane potential from –90 to –45 mV (by increasing the potassium reversal potential from –120 to –50 mV) increased the proportion of inactivated Na<sub>V</sub> channels from 10 to 80%. Despite increasing inactivation of Na<sub>V</sub> channels the conduction velocity continued to increase. These results are described in subsection “Mechanism of conduction velocity-control and metabolic costs of HCN channels” and discussed as follows: “However, our modelling results showed that increasing the membrane potential from –90 to –60 mV increased the conduction velocity despite significantly decreasing Na<sup>+</sup> channels availability (Figure 10—figure supplement 1). Interestingly, these findings are in agreement with the nonlinear cable theory predicting that the difference between the resting membrane potential and the firing threshold is a critical parameter for action potential conduction velocity (see, e.g., Figure 12.25 in Jack et al., 1983, for increasing velocity with increasing safety factor, i.e. decreasing excitation threshold <italic>V</italic><sub>B</sub>). Intuitively, the HCN channel mediated acceleration of conduction velocity can be understood as follows; in a more depolarized axon, Na<sub>V</sub> mediated current influx in one axonal location will depolarize neighboring locations faster above the threshold. In our model, this effect outweighs the disadvantage of the increased steady-state inactivation of Na<sup>+</sup> channels up to a membrane potential of about –65 mV and a Na<sub>V</sub> availability of 50%. The exact values, above which Na<sub>V</sub> availability limits conduction velocity, critically depend on assumptions of the model, such as the voltage-dependence of inactivation and the density of Na<sub>V</sub> channel.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Confirmation that the changes reported can be unambiguously ascribed to HCN channels. As you know, in the initial consultation among editors, concerns were raised about lack of occlusion experiments, the imperfect selectivity of ZD, and the absence of antibody controls. This issue should either be addressed experimentally or the conclusions should be appropriately curtailed and discussion of alternatives should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing this point to our attention. In the revised manuscript, we have performed new experiments, in which we applied neuromodulators in the presence of ZD 7288. The neuromodulators (cAMP, adenosine, and norepinephrine) had no impact on conduction velocity in the presence of ZD 7288. The results from these occlusion experiments further support our conclusion that HCN channels mediate the effect of neuromodulators on conduction velocity. See new Figure 3 and subsection “Neuromodulation of conduction velocity is mediated by HCN channels”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The major points as expressed by the reviewers, with annotations relating to the essential revisions are included below to aid you in your revision.</p><p>Major comments (combined, with indications as to which essential revision is being spelled out in more detail):</p><p>1) Related to Essential Revision 1: While the data are unequivocal that such modulation can occur, I'm left wondering if this is indeed a mechanism employed to regulation information transfer in the cerebellum or other structures. The main concern involves Figure 2. Here, application of various neuromodulations demonstrate the capacity for modulation by endogenous systems, but they do little to show which of these systems are involved in such regulation. The concentrations used are so high that off target effects are a strong possibility (e.g., norepinephrine can engage dopamine receptors at high concentrations, Sanchez-Soto et al., 2016). It is critical to demonstrate that these effects are blocked by specific antagonists to establish that all of these systems are indeed in play. Furthermore, replicating these results using endogenous sources is a critical step to determine whether such modulation occurs in vivo. This would ideally be done with optogenetic activation of monoaminergic sources. (Ed's note: Note that optogenetic expts are not required for the revision, but this sentence is included since it was in the original review.) Less ideal, but still towards the point, would be to apply amphetamine to reverse monoamine transport. Either approach should be paired with appropriate antagonist controls.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see detailed response to point 1 above. In the revised manuscript, we also mentioned potential off-target effects: “Although we used rather high concentrations of the agonists and off-target effects cannot be excluded (e.g., NE activating dopamine receptors; Sánchez-Soto et al., 2016), these data nevertheless indicate that…” Furthermore, our new experiments (Figure 3) show that the effect of the neuromodulators is mediated by HCN channels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to Essential Revision 1: The functional significance for the effects of Ih modulation on conduction velocity is somewhat vague as it is presented. The differences in conduction velocity are small, and on a sub-millisecond time scale. While the authors cite several papers supporting the importance of timing on this scale, the discussion lumps systems with very different circuit structures and computational demands. What is the evidence for the significance of submillisecond timing in the cerebellum? The mossy fiber input is ultimately low-pass filtered by granule cells with very slow membrane time constants so this requires some comment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now more carefully discussed the significance of submillisecond timing in the cerebellum and added the paragraph: “The cerebellum is involved in the accurate control of muscle contraction with a temporal precision of 1-100 ms (Hore et al., 1991). Submillisecond correlations in spike timing occuring between neighboring Purkinje cells have been noted previously (reviewed in Isope et al., 2002; Person and Raman, 2012). Furthermore, submillisecond precision of the mossy/parallel fiber input are critical for processing in the cerebellar circuits (Braitenberg et al., 1997; Heck et al., 2001). Together, the here-described changes in action potential conduction velocity in mossy and parallel fibers (Figures 1-3) may thus play an important role in cerebellar computation. Furthermore, the observed impairment in high-frequency firing without HCN channels (Figure 5) is expected to negatively impact such functions (Delvendahl and Hallermann, 2016).”</p><p>Regarding the membrane time constant of granule cells, we agree that filtering at the granule cell soma (and the Purkinje cell dendrites) will occur but we would like to point out that the membrane time constants of granule cells strongly changes during development (Cathala et al., 2003, J Neurosci 23:6074-85) and that the spiking delay and precision critically depend on other parameters such as the distance to firing threshold.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to Essential Revision 2: A second question relates to the modeling: The modeling explores two competing hypotheses that could account for the observed effects of HCN modulation, relating to changes in membrane potential and leak, and show that membrane potential and its relation to spike threshold is sufficient to explain the observed effects. This can be explained well by the cell being closer to threshold. A counter-argument would be that depolarization decreases NaV availability, but the authors mention that this is not a confound. The authors would be well served to explore this aspect in more detail to see how robust this result is across a range of conditions. First, it would be report relative NaV availability in each model. Second, it would be great to see if the relative changes in conduction velocity hold if the model starts at other membrane potentials (particularly more depolarized).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Our systematic analysis of the interplay between resting membrane potential and Na<sub>V</sub> channel availability is explained above (general point 2). As suggested, we now provide the Na<sub>V</sub> availability in each model: “For the control model, the Na<sub>V</sub> inactivation was 12%. For the model reproducing the experiments with ZD7288 and 1 mM intracellular cAMP, the Na<sub>V</sub> inactivation was 6 and 17%, respectively. Because the steady-state Na<sub>V</sub> availability depends mostly on the resting membrane potential, the relation between resting membrane potential and Na<sub>V</sub> availability was identical for all three models (data not shown).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Related to Essential Revisions 1 and 2, as stated by the other reviewer: The modulation of Ih is presented as a way to dynamically control conduction velocities according to changes in neuromodulatory state. Given the presence of voltage-gated calcium channels in some axons and nodes of Ranvier, is it possible that the cAMP-mediated modulation of Ih could also serve a homeostatic role, bringing Vrest closer to threshold and offsetting the inactivation of Na channels under conditions of high action potential firing rates? This would be straightforward to test with high frequency trains of axonal stimuli in experiments and perhaps with the model.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. As explained in more detail above (general point 1) we have performed new experiments to analyze the conduction velocity during high-frequency trains of action potentials (see new Figure 5D-G). We are thankful for providing the exciting idea of calcium controlling the cAMP/HCN pathway. A mechanistic analysis of the interplay between Ca<sup>2+</sup>and the cAMP/HCN pathway is beyond the scope of this manuscript, but we have added the following sentences: “Interestingly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering through axonal voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Bender et al., 2010) could interact with the cAMP pathway by activating or inhibiting different subtypes of adenylyl cyclase and phosphodiesterase (Bruce et al., 2003). Thereby, HCN could also serve a homeostatic role, by bringing the resting membrane potential closer to threshold and offsetting the inactivation of Na<sub>V</sub> channels under conditions of high-frequency action potential firing.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers agree that the manuscript has been improved by the new experiments. Because of some remaining questions regarding neuromodulation and possible consequences of action potential failure, both reviewers also agree that additional specific discussion of these issues is warranted. We are including the specific language of both reviewers below, because they have expressed the points clearly and can guide you in those textual revisions.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have done a good job addressing reviewer concerns, and I am very supportive of publication with a few additional text/formatting updates. Of note, the new recordings described in Figure 5 are impressive and highlight an interesting aspect of HCN function in axons, contributing to reliability during high frequency trains. I was a bit disappointed that neuromodulatory antagonist experiments were not performed. Instead, experiments were done with ZD and agonist application. This isn't as clean, given the issues related to ZD specificity, but nevertheless support the notion that HCN channels are the ultimate effector of the neuromodulatory systems engaged. In light of this, I'd request that the discussion relating to how neuromodulators could regulate axonal conduction be expanded to include any details known on neuromodulatory mechanisms previously reported in these axons, and a bit more on the possibility of off-target interactions with these concentrations. Also, the data in Figure 5 deserve a bit of discussion. AP failures at high frequency may be more consequential than these small changes in timing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive evaluation of our manuscript. We have extended the discussion and added a paragraph (subsection “Mechanism and metabolic costs of HCN channel mediated control of action propagation” paragraph two) explaining the results of Figure 4 of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This study explores the role of HCN channels in regulating action potential conduction velocity in mossy fibers of the cerebellum and other axons as well. In the revision, the authors have provided a significant number of new experiments that add value to the manuscript. The terminal recordings combined with the modeling together convincingly demonstrate a significant impact of HCN channel activity not only on AP propagation velocity, but also on presynaptic spike frequency and reliability. The modeling better explores the impact of HCN channels on Na channel availability. The magnitude of HCN channel modulation on conduction velocity in vivo remains to be determined, but with the addition of the new experiments and modeling, this study provides a sophisticated examination of the interplay between HCN channels and voltage-gated Na channels in presynaptic axons. As before, the quality of the data is excellent. My only remaining concern revolves around the added occlusion experiments in Figure 3, as they relate to the neuromodulation experiments in Figure 2.

I think this issue needs to be reflected in the writing. What is explanation for the remaining ZD-insensitive neuromodulation?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for these positive comments. We believe that the remaining concern is based on a misunderstanding. The reviewer argues that the occlusion experiments are only partially successful in demonstrating specificity of neuromodulatory action on HCN channels because the conduction velocity changed in the presence of 30 µM ZD7288 by ~3-4% (Figure 3; now Figure 2F and G in the revised manuscript), which is similar to the neuromodulator-induced changes in velocity in the absence of ZD (Figure 2; now Figure 2C-D). However, a direct comparison of the change in conduction velocity between Figure 2 and 3 of the previous manuscript is not informative. To better explain these results, we used horizontal lines to illustrate the time of application of the substances in Figure 2C and F and added the following sentences in the Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript:</p><p>“To investigate the contribution of HCN channels on the neuromodulation of the conduction velocity (Figure 2F-G), cerebellar slices were pre-incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 30 µM ZD7288 and then transferred to the recording chamber (35 °C) with continued application of 30 µM ZD7288. 5 min after the beginning of the recordings (t = 0 min), the neuromodulators were applied. Note that the control data without application of neuromodulators (“only ZD7288” in Figure 2F and G) show a larger decrease in conduction velocity during the 20-min recording period compared with the control data in Figure 2C-E. The difference in the control data is most likely due to the slow action of ZD7288 (cf. Figure 1), which further decreases the conduction velocity during the recordings in addition to the run-down observed in control recordings without ZD7288. Therefore, the change in conduction velocity induced by the neuromodulators with and without pre-incubation of ZD7288 (Figure 2F-G and 2C-E, respectively) cannot be compared directly but have to be compared with the corresponding controls.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
