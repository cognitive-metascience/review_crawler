in tissues with high energy demand such as the heart, and mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with cardiovascular disease. Expression of mitochondrial proteins is tightly regulated in response to internal and external stimuli. Here we identify a novel mechanism regulating mitochondrial content and function, through BUD23-dependent ribosome generation. BUD23 was required for ribosome maturation, normal 18S/28S stoichiometry and modulated the translation of mitochondrial transcripts in human A549 cells. Deletion of <italic>Bud23</italic> in murine cardiomyocytes reduced mitochondrial content and function, leading to severe cardiomyopathy and death. We discovered that BUD23 selectively promotes ribosomal interaction with low GC-content 5’UTRs. Taken together we identify a critical role for BUD23 in bioenergetics gene expression, by promoting efficient translation of mRNA transcripts with low 5’UTR GC content. BUD23 emerges as essential to mouse development, and to postnatal cardiac function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells need to make proteins to survive, so they have protein-making machines called ribosomes.

People with certain diseases, such as Williams-Beuren syndrome, do not make enough BUD23; but it was unknown what specific effects resulted from a loss of BUD23.</p><p>To answer this question, Baxter et al. first genetically removed BUD23 from human cells, and then checked what happened to protein production. They found that ribosomes in human cells with no BUD23 were different than in normal cells, and that cells without BUD23 produced different proteins, which did not always perform their roles correctly. Proteins in the mitochondria are one of the main groups affected by the absence of BUD23. To determine what effects these modified mitochondrial proteins would have in an animal, Baxter et al. genetically modified mice so that they no longer produced BUD23. These mice developed heart problems caused by their mitochondria not working correctly and being unable to provide the energy the heart cells needed, eventually leading to heart failure. Heart problems are common in people with Williams-Beuren syndrome.</p><p>Many diseases arise when a person’s mitochondria do not work properly, but it is often unclear why. These experiments suggest that low levels of BUD23 or faulty ribosomes may be causing mitochondria to work poorly in some of these diseases, which could lead to the development of new therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>protein translation</kwd><kwd>cardiac</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/L010240/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ray</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>BUD23 links ribosome function with mitochondrial protein expression and efficient oxidative phosphorylation by promoting selective mRNA translation and is therefore critical to mouse development and postnatal cardiac function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regulation of protein abundance within a cell is of fundamental importance to homeostasis, cell identity and responsiveness to changes in external environment. Many layers of regulatory control have evolved to fine-tune gene expression to meet cellular needs, including transcriptional regulation, cis-acting genomic elements, epigenetic structures, and translational efficiency. Selective control of mRNA translation at the level of the ribosome is emerging as important for protein dynamics within the cell; however, the regulatory mechanisms remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</xref>). Protein synthesis is the most energetically-demanding process for a cell to perform and, therefore, mRNA translation is closely coupled to mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morita et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondria are fundamental cellular components of eukaryotes, generating the majority of cellular ATP. The human mitochondrial genome contains only 37 genes, of which 13 are subunits of respiratory complexes, 22 encode mitochondrial tRNAs, and a further two encode rRNA. Whilst the mitochondrion translates the 13 protein-coding genes of its own genome using a bespoke mitochondrial apparatus, the majority of the genes required for a functional mitochondrion are encoded in the cell nuclear genome and are, therefore, dependent on the cytosolic translational apparatus. This relationship implies a fundamental role for the eukaryotic 80S ribosome in control of mitochondrial abundance and function. Indeed, mitochondrial content and function varies between tissues and cell-types, as well as within a tissue, in response to external and internal stimuli including energy demand, oxidative stress and cellular signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Palmer et al., 2011</xref>). For example, red blood cells contain no mitochondria whereas in cardiomyocytes mitochondria occupy 30% of cell volume to meet the exceptionally high ATP demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Piquereau et al., 2013</xref>). Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to a wide range of cardiac disorders, often due to the aberrant production of ROS, and attendant cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kanaan and Harper, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ott et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>BUD23 (previously known as WBSCR22) was initially identified as a putative methyltransferase implicated in tumour metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakazawa et al., 2011</xref>). Its expression is responsive to diverse inflammatory and cancer pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jangani et al., 2014</xref>), and reduction of BUD23 expression can affect cellular response to glucocorticoid and alter histone methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jangani et al., 2014</xref>). However, BUD23 actions were diverse, and a unifying mechanism of action was elusive. More recent studies identified ribosomal RNA as the preferred substrate of BUD23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haag et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">White et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zorbas et al., 2015</xref>). There is little understanding of the physiological role of BUD23 in a mammalian context although it is one of the genes deleted in Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS). WBS patients have a complex phenotype with prominent neurological and morphological features. In addition metabolic pathologies exist including diabetes and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morris, 1993</xref>). The contribution of individual genes within the 22-gene interval to the human phenotype has not been determined, but the neurological and metabolic features suggest a bioenergetic contribution.</p><p>BUD23 is a ribosomal RNA methyltransferase which imparts a methyl mark on a key guanosine residue (forming N7-methylguanosine) located between the E and P site of the small ribosomal subunit that has been mapped to residue G1575 of yeast 18S rRNA and G1639 of human 18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haag et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Õunap et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">White et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zorbas et al., 2015</xref>). BUD23 protein is found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Õunap et al., 2015</xref>), and its depletion leads to a nuclear accumulation of 18SE-pre-RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haag et al., 2015</xref>). In both yeast and human cells the methyltransferase catalytic activity of BUD23 is not required for the processing of 18S pre-RNA, or the synthesis of 40S subunits, indicating that BUD23 has an additional role, distinct from its methyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haag et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zorbas et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In human cell lines it has been suggested that some 18S rRNA lacks the m7-G1639 mark, which may indicate a selective role in ribosome function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haag et al., 2015</xref>). BUD23 stability requires interaction with TRMT112 (TRM112 in yeast), an obligate binding partner, which is known to stabilise four client methyltransferase enzymes, all involved in the generation of the translational apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bourgeois et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Létoquart et al., 2014</xref>). The binding of TRMT112 with these four methyltransferases is competitive, which results in tight regulation of BUD23 protein concentration and enzymatic function at the level of protein stability.</p><p>Here we identify a novel mechanism linking the energy-demanding process of protein translation to mitochondrial dynamics through BUD23. We examine the role of BUD23 in ribosome function and discover that BUD23 preferentially promotes the selection of mRNA species with low GC-content 5’UTRs. We also identify a role for BUD23 in mitochondrial transcript translation which impacts mitochondrial function in vitro. We go on to examine the role of BUD23 in a murine in vivo system and discover that the production of mitochondrial proteins is dependent on BUD23. Finally, we examine the role of BUD23 in the mitochondrially-rich and energetically-demanding cardiac tissue and discover a cardiomyopathy phenotype leading to premature death. These discoveries identify BUD23 as essential for mammalian mitochondrial function, with implications for human mitochondrial disease and cardiomyopathy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BUD23 plays a major role in translational homeostasis</title><p>We previously identified pleiotropic actions of BUD23 in airway epithelial cells, and attributed these to an epigenetic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jangani et al., 2014</xref>).

There was, however, little change in the profile of the polysome fractions at this early time-point following transient <italic>BUD23</italic> knockdown, allowing us to investigate the changes in mRNA substrate selection in the intact polysomes. To test the global efficiency of the translational apparatus in cells lacking BUD23, we used 35-S-methionine incorporation for 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This demonstrated little overall impact on global protein translation rate, confirming that the identified polysomes were essentially competent at this time-point, despite the impact on 40S maturation. In order to determine if BUD23-loss differentially impacted the translation of a specific subset of mRNAs, we profiled the translational efficiency (TE) of individual mRNA species within the polysome profiles.</p><p>To do this, the polysome fractions were divided into ‘heavy’ (more than three ribosomes) or ‘light’ (less than three ribosomes) and pooled, prior to RNA extraction and sequencing. This defined a total of 14,527 transcripts, from which the relative proportion of each individual transcript in the heavy compared to the light fraction was calculated to give a translation efficiency (TE) score. Average TE scores across the three replicates for each condition (+ /- BUD23) were then plotted against each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This revealed that the most efficiently translated transcripts in the control samples (more heavily loaded with ribosomes), were most significantly reduced in the <italic>BUD23</italic> knockdown condition. To examine the identity of the most highly affected transcripts, a threshold of &gt;1 or &lt;-1 difference in the relative TE was set (i.e. TE doubled or halved), and applied to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, shown as trend lines.

Given the known influence of 5’UTR features on translation efficiency, we reasoned that specific features of the 5’UTR may be particularly important for BUD23 action. A number of well-characterised 5’UTR features impact mRNA translation, including length, secondary structure, GC content, and specific motifs including the TOP sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gandin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Meijer and Thomas, 2002</xref>).

In addition, we identified the presence of numerous spherical electron dense inclusion bodies within the mitochondria of BUD23 deficient cardiac cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, yellow arrows). Similar electron dense structures have been previously reported in myocardial mitochondria, which may accumulate in response to increased cellular bioenergetic demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jacob et al., 1994</xref>). The observation of these structures here may be consistent with attempted mitochondrial adaptation to energetic-demand challenge.</p><p>A frequent cellular adaptation to impaired oxidative phosphorylation is a switch to glycolytic ATP generation, and so we measured rate-limiting glycolytic gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). We identified a significant induction of glucokinase (GCK), and a trend to induction of phosphofructokinase (PKM) and hexokinase (HK2) supporting such an adaptive switch to glycolysis.

It is one of the genes deleted in Williams-Beuren Syndrome, a complex multi-gene deletion syndrome with neurological, and energy homeostatic features, although themediating role of individual genes to the phenotype has not been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morris, 1993</xref>). We now identify BUD23 as playing a major role in regulating the translational efficiency of specific transcripts through its role in ribosome maturation. Indeed, translation of low 5’UTR GC-content mRNA species were particularly dependent on BUD23 expression, in contrast to the picture seen with simple ribosome deficiency in which transcripts with short/unstructured 5’UTRs were seen to be most affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Khajuria et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, we identified a surprising role for BUD23 in maintaining mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity. As protein translation is tightly coupled to ATP demand this raised the possibility that BUD23-dependent ribosomal maturation is critical to link the two processes in living cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morita et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, BUD23 loss greatly impaired mitochondrial ATP generation, both in vitro and in vivo. In mice, cardiomyocyte loss of BUD23 greatly impaired mitochondrial ATP generation leading to dilated cardiomyopathy and premature death, and global loss of BUD23 resulted in embryo-lethality.</p><p>BUD23 is thought to perform two functions in the generation of the translational apparatus: firstly, in the processing of pre-18S RNA into its mature form, and secondly imparting a m7-G methyl mark on a key residue. As the catalytic activity of BUD23 is not required for efficient pre-18S RNA processing, these two functions appear to be independent of each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haag et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zorbas et al., 2015</xref>). It is notable that both the BUD23 imparted m7-G methyl mark and structurally complex 5’UTRs are characteristic features of translation specific to Eukaryotes. We speculate the co-evolution of this regulatory 18S methyl mark with the need for more complex regulation of differential translation. Further work should focus on delineating the effect of BUD23-dependent 18S maturation, from the role of the methylation mark.</p><p>We used proteomics to examine the relative changes in protein abundance which result from targeted loss of BUD23 in cardiomyocytes. This revealed a selective loss of mitochondrial proteins, explaining the observed reduction in mitochondrial capacity. As BUD23 appears to have no direct role within mitochondria we propose that the mitochondrial phenotype results from impaired translation of nuclear-encoded genes with a role in mitochondrial homeostasis. Indeed, we found that the translational efficiency of a number of mitochondria-targeted as well as mitochondrial regulating proteins were BUD23-dependent. There are many potential candidates linking the change of translational efficiency to the mitochondrial phenotype. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), for example, is known to regulate mitochondrial activity and biogenesis by regulation of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morita et al., 2013</xref>) and, interestingly, BUD23 loss resulted in impaired translation of mTOR itself. We also observed a marked decrease in the translational efficiency of mitochondrially-encoded transcripts.</p><p>We initially generated and characterised a frame shift-generating null allele mouse. The homozygote null animals were all lost prior to embryonic day e10.5 and we were unable to identify a cause but considered that a major defect in a mitochondrially–dependent organ such as heart may be a plausible mechanism. We moved, therefore, to a conditional allele mouse, using which we confirmed the developmental lethality of the null allele by crossing with a global deleter-cre strain (Hprt-cre). Using the conditional allele mice with a muscle Cre driver we were able to profile the impact of BUD23 in a physiological role. Loss of BUD23 in heart and skeletal muscle resulted in early death from cardiac failure. This striking phenotype was accompanied by morphological changes including cardiac dilatation, ventricular wall thinning, and impaired ventricular contractility. There was evidence for an attempted switch to glycolytic ATP generation in the hearts, with induction of rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme genes; and also adaptation to conditions of oxidative stress with induction of NRF2. Mitochondrial dysfunction frequently imposes a burden of oxidative stress on affected cells, which can result in apoptosis, thereby explaining the loss of cardiac muscle seen. Detailed ultrastructure analysis of cardiac mitochondria revealed no major loss of mitochondrial volume, but there was a striking additional feature seen within the mitochondria: electron-dense, spheroid inclusions. These were not observed in control hearts, and are not typically seen in mitochondria from individuals with mitochondrial myopathies, but have been reported before under conditions of extreme ATP demand, and to result from bilayer budding from the inner cristae, to generate additional ATP generating surface area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jacob et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Somlyo et al., 1974</xref>). Therefore, we propose this may be a further adaptation to the impaired oxidative phosphorylation function within the mitochondria.</p><p>There is a growing recognition that transcriptional control mechanisms are insufficient to explain differentiated cell function. Recent advances have identified differential translation of mRNA species dependent on 5’UTR features as an important control mechanism, potentially coupling global changes in protein translation with appropriate upregulation of mitochondrial ATP generation to meet demand <sup>2</sup>. BUD23, a highly conserved ribosomal RNA methyltransferase which lies within a multigene interval, deleted as a cause of Williams-Beuren syndrome, plays a specific role in highly ATP-hungry cells, promoting translation of mitochondrial proteins, and impacting on oxidative phosphorylation. This function likely contributes to aspects of the human phenotype, in particular neurological dysfunction, glucose intolerance and obesity. Complete global loss of <italic>Bud23</italic> is embryonic lethal, and early post-natal death follows deletion of <italic>Bud23</italic> in the heart. The cardiac phenotype is severe, with marked mitochondrial dysfunction, and evidence of compensatory changes towards glycolytic ATP generation, and adaptation to oxidative stress. Therefore, BUD23 plays a critical role in coupling protein translation to mitochondrial function, with implications for mitochondrial diseases, and cardiomyopathies.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Match between runs was selected with a retention time of 1 min, using default parameters for all other settings. MS1 search tolerance was set at 20ppm, and MS2 at 4.5ppm. Modifications were set as Carbamidomethyl (C) for fixed, and Oxidation (M) and Acetyl (Protein N-term) variable. A minimum of 1 spectra was required for identification, while a minimum of 2 spectra were required for quantification. Resulting data was processed using Perseus version 1.6.0.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tyanova et al., 2016</xref>) and R statistical software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wickham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">R Development Core Team, 2017</xref>). All proteins identified by site only, as a potential contaminant, or in the decoy reverse database were excluded. Data was then filtered to exclude proteins with more than 3 ‘zero-values’ across all groups. All proteins assigned to the GO term ‘blood microparticle’ were removed as well. LFQ values were log(2) transformed and missing values imputated in Perseus using a normal distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lazar et al., 2016</xref>). The width of the new distribution was 0.3 standard deviations of the data, and was shifted downwards by 1.8 standard deviations of the data. A total of 6.68% of values were imputated. Significance was determined using a T-test with a permutation based FDR (FDR &lt; 0.05, s0 = 0.1). s0 represents the relative importance of the difference between the means, with non-zero s0 values taking fold change, and not only p-value, into account. Estimations of copy numbers were performed using the proteomic ruler plug-in version 0.1.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wiśniewski et al., 2014</xref>).

Mice were lightly anesthetized with 1–1.5% isoflurane via facemask, maintaining the heart rate at approximately 450 beats/min. Views were taken in planes that approximated the parasternal short-axis view and the apical long-axis view. M-mode tracings were used to determine left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVDD) and end-systolic diameter (LVSD), posterior wall thickness in diastole (LVPWD) and systole (LVPWS), and interventricular septum thickness in diastole (IVSD) and systole (IVSS) over three cardiac cycles. The analysis was performed blinded to animal details. LV fractional shortening (FS) was calculated using the formula FS = [(LVDD - LVSD)/(LVDD)] x 100. Relative wall thickness (RWT) was calculated using the equation RWT = (IVDD + LVPWD)/LVDD.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Electrocardiogram (ECG)</title><p>Mice were lightly anesthetized with 1–1.5% isoflurane via facemask. The body temperature was maintained around 37°C using a heat pad. The lead II ECG was recorded using Power Lab/4SP system (Adinstruments) from needle electrodes inserted subcutaneously into the left and right forelimbs and the right hindlimb. The signal was acquired for about 5 min using Chart 7 software (Adinstruments). During offline analysis, the 5 min recording was examined for unusually shaped P, QRS, or ‘T’ waves and for time-varying phenomenon (e.g. irregularities in interval durations). Ectopic or abnormal beats are noted. A representative 10–15 s segment of the recording was averaged to obtain the signal averaged ECG to calculate Heart rate, RR interval, P wave duration, PR interval, QRS, JT and QT durations. QT duration was corrected (QTc) using the Bazett's formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bazett, 1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Polysome profiling</title><p>Polysome profiles were prepared according to the protocols previously published in: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gandin et al., 2014</xref>). Two conditions were profiled, <italic>BUD23</italic> siRNA and Control siRNA, with an n of 3 samples per condition. Fractions were collected from each sample and RNA was purified using the Trizol extraction method. RNA from fractions containing three or less ribosomes were pooled (‘Low translational efficiency) and RNA from fractions containing more than three ribosomes (‘high efficiency’) were pooled. Sub-polysomal fractions were similarly pooled. RNA sequencing was used to quantify the expression of RNA species in each of the pooled samples. Translational efficiency (TE) was defined as the relative abundance of a transcript in the high and low efficiency pooled fractions. A TE score for each transcript was calculated by averaging the ratio derived from each of the three replicates in each condition. TE was plotted for the two conditions using R software.</p><p>Translational efficiency (TE) was then compared to both the length and GC content of the 5' UTR region. 5' UTRs were defined using the TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene (Bioconductor Core Team and Bioconductor Package Maintainer, 2016) and org.Hs.eg.db (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlson, 2018</xref>) R packages.

Experiments were performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Assessment of mitochondrial function using oroboros</title><p>Of the three distinct experimental preparations available (isolated mitochondria, permeabilized fibers, and tissue homogenates), we utilized cardiac homogenates for mitochondrial assessment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goo et al., 2013</xref> for advantages of this method). Ventricular tissue (~20 mg) was weighed and transferred to 1.5 ml of ice-cold MiRO5 medium (in mM: EGTA 0.5, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1.4, taurine 20, KH<sub>2</sub>P0<sub>4</sub> 10, HEPES 20, BSA 1%, K-MES 60 mM, sucrose 110 mM, pH 7.1, adjusted with 5 N KOH). Tissue was homogenized for 3 s in 1 s bursts with a tissue homogenizer and loaded immediately (40 µg/ml) into an Oroboros Oxygraph 2 k high resolution respirometry system (Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria) for measurement of mitochondrial respiration combined with the Fluorescence-Sensor Green of the O2k-Fluo LED2-Module for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> measurement (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Makrecka-Kuka et al., 2015</xref> for full details).</p><p>Two identical respiration chambers (chamber A and chamber B) held at the same temperature were run in parallel for each experimental run. All measurements of respiration rates were carried out at 37°C. Oxygen electrodes were calibrated daily with air-saturated respiration solution Zero calibrations were achieved by injecting yeast into the experimental chambers. Oxygen solubility in the assay medium was calculated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lienig and Forstner, 1984</xref>). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> flux was measured simultaneously with respiration in the O2k-Fluorometer using the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive probe Amplex UltraRed (10 μM) with 1 U/mL horse radish peroxidase (HRP) and 5 U/mL superoxide dismutase (SOD). AmR in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is catalysed by HRP to the fluorescent product resorufin. Calibrations were performed with two sequential injections of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at 0.1 μM steps.</p><p>Three parameters are commonly used to assess mitochondrial function (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brand and Nicholls, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pesta and Gnaiger, 2012</xref>). Firstly, the capacity for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is the respiratory capacity of mitochondria in the ADP-activated state of oxidative phosphorylation (saturating concentrations of ADP, inorganic phosphate, oxygen, and defined substrates). Secondly, LEAK respiration rate represents mitochondrial respiration that occurs in the absence of ATP generation, mainly to compensate for proton leak across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Lastly, the respiratory electron transfer-pathway capacity (ETC) is mitochondrial respiration in the noncoupled state in the presence an uncoupler; this induces maximum oxygen flux through the electron transport chain. The Respiratory Control Ratio (RCR, calculated here as OXPHOS/LEAK) provides a measure of the degree of coupling between oxidation and phosphorylation, or in other words, the efficiency of mitochondrial ATP production.</p><p>OXPHOS, LEAK and ETS were measured in the presence of Complex I substrates pyruvate and malate (electron transfer through Complexes I-IV) or Complex I+II substrates (addition of succinate). Additionally, respiratory flux with electron transfer through Complex IV alone was measured via the addition of the electron donor tetramethyl-phenylene-diamine (TMPD). The protocol used to measure these parameters was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pesta and Gnaiger (2012)</xref>. Briefly, pyruvate (5 mmol l <sup>−1</sup>), malate (0.25 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) and glutamate (10 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) are added as carbon substrates and to spark the citric acid cycle. Under these conditions, mitochondria are in LEAK respiration with CI substrates in the absence of adenylates. OXPHOS with CI substrates was achieved through addition of saturating levels of ADP (2 mM l<sup>−1</sup>). Following steady-state conditions, succinate (10 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) was added to achieve OXPHOS with CI+CII substrates. To uncouple respiration and achieve ETS with CI+CII substrates, carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) was carefully titrated to a maximum concentration of 0.25 μmol l<sup>−1</sup>. Rotenone was then added to achieve ETS with CII substrates and antimycin A (5 μmol l<sup>−1</sup>) was given to block Complex III and measure background non-mitochondrial residual oxygen consumption (ROX). OXPHOS through Complex IV alone was assessed by adding the electron donor TMPD (0.5 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>). To avoid oxidation of TMPD, ascorbate (2 mMol l<sup>−</sup>1) was added prior to TMPD injection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Citrate synthase assay</title><p>The citrate synthase activity of cardiac homogenates were measured in frozen homogenates. Briefly, maximal activity (Vmax) was determined with a spectrophotometer at 37°C with a Synergy HTX spectrophotometer (BioTek, UK) in assay buffer; 50 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 8.0. Citrate synthase activity was monitored in the presence or absence of oxaloacetate by the appearance of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid as a result of the reaction of free acetyl-CoA with 5,5’-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) at 412 nm over a 10 min incubation period (assay buffer with 0.5 oxaloacetate, 0.3 mM acetyl-CoA, 0.15 mM 5,5-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid).

Samples were washed 3 times for 10 min in double distilled water after each staining step. Staining was followed by dehydration in ethanol ascending series (50%, 70%, 90%, 100%) and infiltration with TAAB 812 hard resin mixed with propylene oxide. After embedding, resin blocks were cured at 70° C for 40 hr.

mitochondrial-destined proteins encoded by mRNAs that are translated at cytosolic ribosomes is a topic of general interest. The authors describe a previously unknown physiological function of the ribosome biogenesis factor, BUD23, in the expression of mitochondrial proteins at the level of translation. Comprehensive transcriptomic and proteomic analysis in cellular and mouse models delineates BUD23 potential role in human disease connected with cardiomyopathy. The author's work initiates further fundamental research on other factors associated with ribosome biogenesis that can influence the selective production of mitochondrial proteins in the cytosol.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cardiac mitochondrial function depends on BUD23 mediated ribosome programming&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Baxter et al. seek to elucidate how BUD23, an rRNA methyltransferase involved in ribosome maturation, can affect mitochondrial content and function. Regulation of mitochondrial gene expression is highly complex and the identification of nuclear-encoded genes that exert levels of control represents an important contribution to our understanding. The authors provide a broad analysis of changes in mRNA and protein levels upon BUD23 deficiency in mammalian cells and mouse models. The authors conclude that BUD23 is critical for the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and general mitochondrial function, possibly by its role in selectively promoting translation mRNAs with low 5' UTR GC content. They also found that BUD23 double knockout in mice is embryonic lethal, and haploinsufficiency affects fitness during development. Specifically, they found that disrupting BUD23 expression in cardiomyocytes caused gross heart defect, which leads to lethality in juvenile mice.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is interesting and comprehensive and will add more weight to the growing complexity of post-transcriptional regulation at the level of translation. However, the reviewers' general concern is to what extent the observed decrease in translation efficiency of selected targets is specific to BUD23 depletion or part of a more general mechanism. To address this issue we have the following suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It remains unclear whether the decreased translation efficiency of mRNA of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins is specific to the loss of BUD23 or part of a general mechanism resulting from 40S/60S imbalance. Ideally, to address this question another important ribosome biogenesis factor should be tested performing carefully selected experiments. However, as a minimum, the authors should perform an experiment to check if 18SE pre-rRNA is still incorporated in mature 40S and even translating polysomes. This could help reinforce author’s claim of BUD23 role in mitochondrial related gene expression through ribosome assembly. Gel pictures that are used to generate Figure 1C ought to be shown, ideally also with northern against pre-RNA for 18S to show for processing defect, especially given that in Haag et al., 2014, there are differences on 18SE pre-rRNA processing in different cell types upon BUD23 knockdown. Further, the authors should consider mitigating their assumption that BUD23 is solely responsible for the observed effect on translation efficiency and should discuss the possibility of the contribution of a more general mechanism resulting from 40S/60S imbalance.</p><p>2) To analyse levels of transcripts the authors split the polysome fractions in two or more than two ribosomes bound to mRNAs. The number of ribosomes present on an mRNA depends among other causes, on its length and hence, one can expect that short mRNAs (such as those encoding for many ribosomal proteins) will be bound to fewer ribosomes than longer ones. Hence, upon a global decrease in functional 80S due to BUD23 inactivation, mRNAs of short to intermediate lengths are more likely to shift from the heavy to the light fraction due to the loss of 1 or 2 ribosomes. The authors need to clarify whether the observed decrease in translation efficiency is indeed specific to a subset of mRNAs or if it is a general phenomenon. For instance, this could be addressed by comparing the quantity of some well-chosen mRNAs (i.e. whose translation efficiency is either proposed to be decreased according to the author's analysis or not affected) in each fraction of the polysome profiles by qPCR for cells treated with control or BUD23 siRNAs.</p><p>Furthermore, is there any agreement between the transcripts/proteins identified as having lower translation efficiency? Linking proteomics with polysome sequencing might shed more light on possible differential protein stability.</p><p>3) The finding that the 5'UTR GC content can define translation efficiency depending on BUD23 is interesting and mechanistically important. However, there is very little follow up on the statement that low translation efficiency correlates with low 5’UTR GC content. Especially there is no link between 5’UTR GC content and translation efficiency of mitochondrial related transcripts. Some questions to consider by the authors; Is translation efficiency reduction for low 5'UTR GC content in BUD23 siRNA treated cells mainly due to mitochondrial-encoded and other mitochondrial genes or is it a more general set of genes that so happen to be enriched for mitochondrial related genes? How about other cytosolic proteins that are downregulated in the proteomics analysis? Do they have low 5'UTR% GC content too? Trying to see if a high significance of low translation efficiency in Figure 1J mostly comes from mitochondrial related genes or low% GC content at 5'UTR.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50705.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It remains unclear whether the decreased translation efficiency of mRNA of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins is specific to the loss of BUD23 or part of a general mechanism resulting from 40S/60S imbalance.

In order to address this, we have taken the reviewers suggestion of testing other important ribosome biogenesis factors (LTV1 and RIOK2) as well as the ribosomal small subunit protein RPS27A, which is also reported to result in ribosomal subunit imbalance. Transient siRNA-mediated knockdown of ribosome small subunit biogenesis factors LTV1, RIOK2 and RPS27A all resulted in significant decrease in 18S/28S ratio relative to control siRNA, indicating a similar 40S/60S imbalance as is seen with BUD23 knockdown (Figure 2G, H, I). Knockdown of BUD23 resulted in a significant decrease in mitochondrial transcript expression, as was observed in the original manuscript. LTV1 knockdown also resulted in a similar decrease in mitochondrial transcript expression. However RPS27A and RIOK2 knockdown did not.</p><p>When mitochondrial copy number was measured a small decrease was found in the BUD23 knockdown group, no effect in the RPS27A knockdown group, and small increase in the LTV1 and RIOK2 groups. It is particularly notable that the effects on mitochondrial content and transcript expression do not correlate with the reduction in 18S/28S ratio. When taken together, we interpret these data to indicate that disruption of 40S biogenesis is not by itself sufficient to result in mitochondrial dysfunction. The observation that LTV1 knockdown results in similar decreases to levels of mitochondrial transcript abundance as BUD23 knockdown is interesting, and indicates that there is a biogenesis factor specific impact on the ribosome, and its capacity to provide proteins for efficient mitochondrial function. It may be of interest in the future to undertake further in-depth studies of various ribosomal biogenesis factors and their impact on the function of the final ribosome, and the resulting impact on mitochondrial function. These new data have been included into the revised manuscript in Figure 2, and we discuss in the paper the BUD23 specific impact on ribosome regulation of mitochondrial function.</p><p>Example gel pictures used to quantify 18S/28S ratio have also been added to the manuscript in Figure 2—figure supplement 2D.</p><p>Lastly, we have mitigated our manuscript Discussion point that BUD23 is solely responsible for the observed effect on translation. As shown in the new data (Figure 2G, H, I), 40S/60S imbalance does not always lead to mitochondrial disruption, however we do observe that ribosome biogenesis factors other than BUD23 (e.g. LTV1) may result in similar phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To analyse levels of transcripts the authors split the polysome fractions in two or more than two ribosomes bound to mRNAs.

There is in fact a weak correlation in the opposite direction. These additional observations are now referenced in the revised manuscript text.</p><p>We conclude that the observed decrease in the translational efficiency is indeed specific to a subset of transcripts: first of all, not all transcripts showed a decrease in TE. The majority of transcripts showed little or no change in TE, and some transcripts showed an increase in TE (Figure 1F). Secondly, we analysed global translational rates using 35S-methionine incorporation assay which showed no detectable change in overall protein production in this model (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). The strongest predictor of a change in translational efficiency remained the 5’UTR GC content.</p><p>To measure the association between the change in mRNA TE and encoded protein abundance, we performed a correlation analysis between the polysome profiling data and the mouse heart proteomics (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Although there is a general trend of correlation between change in TE and change in protein abundance with BUD23 deficiency, the correlation is extremely weak. We believe this observation to be unsurprising for a number of reasons, especially the fact that the analyses were completed in two completely different models (TE was measured in a human cell line after transient BUD23 knockdown, whereas the proteomics dataset is in 26-day old mouse heart tissue). Furthermore, the two methods (polysome profiling versus proteomics) have fundamental differences in data generation which may make correlation incompatible – for example whilst we were able to detect transcripts from over 14000 different genes in the polysome profiling, we were only able to confidently detect around 3000 proteins by proteomics. Furthermore, TE is a relative score derived from ratios of transcripts in heavy and light polysome fractions, rather than an absolute quantification of abundance, such as is achieved by proteomics. We have included this extra correlation analysis in the updated manuscript, however we are reluctant to read too deeply into correlations between TE and proteomics, as further biological mechanisms are at play here, not the least of which is protein stability. We believe it is of note, however, that the mitochondrial phenotype was conserved between an in vitrohuman cell model, and an in vivo murine heart model, and we believe this conservation between models increases the confidence that our observations are reflective of an important biological control circuit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The finding that the 5'UTR GC content can define translation efficiency depending on BUD23 is interesting and mechanistically important.

In order to address this we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis on the transcripts with the strongest down-regulation of translation efficiency (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). There were many GO terms which were significantly over-represented in this analysis – notably a number of terms linked to “metabolic processes” as well as “organelle organization” and “protein transport”. These genes could contribute to the observed mitochondrial phenotype. However there were also groups of genes in the analysis that are not obviously linked to mitochondria. In a further analysis we have examined the 5’UTR GC content of all the detected mitochondrial transcripts compared to all the transcripts in the analysis (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B). This new analysis shows that there is no significant difference between distribution of 5’UTR GC content in mitochondrial related transcripts relative to all transcripts. This indicates that the correlation between low 5’UTR GC content and decreased mRNA TE is a general phenomenon, applying to all transcripts, rather than an artefact of over-represented mitochondrial transcripts. We therefore conclude that the subsequent mitochondrial phenotypes are likely due to reduced translation of a subset of mitochondrial and mitochondria-regulating transcripts, including such genes as mTOR. This extra analysis is now discussed in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
