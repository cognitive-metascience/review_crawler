fundamental to sustain function, requiring protein turnover to repair damaged tissue. However, connective tissue proteome dynamics remain largely undefined, as do differences in turnover rates of individual proteins in the collagen and glycoprotein phases of connective tissue extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we investigate proteome dynamics in the collagen and glycoprotein phases of connective tissues by exploiting the spatially distinct fascicular (collagen-rich) and interfascicular (glycoprotein-rich) ECM phases of tendon. Using isotope labelling, mass spectrometry and bioinformatics, we calculate turnover rates of individual proteins within rat Achilles tendon and its ECM phases. Our results demonstrate complex proteome dynamics in tendon, with ~1000 fold differences in protein turnover rates, and overall faster protein turnover within the glycoprotein-rich interfascicular matrix compared to the collagen-rich fascicular matrix. These data provide insights into the complexity of proteome dynamics in tendon, likely required to maintain tissue homeostasis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Muscles are anchored to bones through specialized tissues called tendons. Made of bundles of fibers (or fascicles) linked together by an ‘interfascicular’ matrix, healthy tendons are required for organisms to move properly. Yet, these structures are constantly exposed to damage: the interfascicular matrix, in particular, is highly susceptible to injury as it allows the fascicles to slide on each other.</p><p>One way to avoid damage could be for the body to continually replace proteins in tendons before they become too impaired. However, the way proteins are renewed in these structures is currently not well understood – indeed, it has long been assumed that almost no protein turnover occurs in tendons. In particular, it is unknown whether proteins in the interfascicular matrix have a higher turn over than those in the fascicles.</p><p>To investigate, Choi, Simpson et al. fed rats on water carrying a molecular label that becomes integrated into new proteins. Analysis of individual proteins from the rats’ tendons showed great variation in protein turnover, with some replaced every few days and others only over several years. This suggests that protein turnover is actually an important part of tendon health. In particular, the results show that turnover is higher in the interfascicular matrix, where damage is expected to be more likely.</p><p>Protein turnover also plays a part in conditions such as cancer, heart disease and kidney disease. Using approaches like the one developed by Choi, Simpson et al. could help to understand how individual proteins are renewed in a range of diseases, and how to design new treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Tendon</kwd><kwd>proteome dynamics</kwd><kwd>deuterium</kwd><kwd>interfascicular matrix</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000341</institution-id><institution>Arthritis Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thorpe</surname><given-names>Chavaunne T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 HL135772</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Howard</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Ding</given-names></name><name><surname>Ping</surname><given-names>Peipei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL146739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Howard</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Ding</given-names></name><name><surname>Ping</surname><given-names>Peipei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 HL139450</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Howard</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Ding</given-names></name><name><surname>Ping</surname><given-names>Peipei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Metabolic labelling reveals complex proteome dynamics in tendon, with faster turnover of proteins in the glycoprotein-rich interfascicular matrix compared to the collagen-rich fascicular matrix.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Maintaining the structural and mechanical integrity of tissues in the musculoskeletal system, and other connective tissues, is fundamental to sustain tissue homeostasis and healthy function, requiring protein synthesis and degradation to repair and/or replace damaged tissue before damage accumulates and leads to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Humphrey et al., 2014</xref>). However, while the composition and structure of connective tissues is well defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scott, 1983</xref>), relatively little is known regarding proteome dynamics in connective tissues, particularly at the level of the individual constituent proteins.</p><p>Connective tissues consist of fibrous proteins (predominantly collagen) embedded in a glycoprotein-rich matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scott, 1983</xref>), and variation in the organisation of both phases give rise to tissues with distinct structural and mechanical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Culav et al., 1999</xref>). Research in a variety of tissues including skin, tendon and cartilage indicates a relatively long half-life of collagens, with more rapid turnover of glycoproteins and other non-collagenous proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thorpe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maroudas et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sivan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sivan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Verzijl et al., 2000</xref>). Indeed, several studies have reported negligible turnover of collagen, the major component of tendon and other connective tissues, within an individual’s lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thorpe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heinemeier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heinemeier et al., 2016</xref>). However other studies have measured relatively rapid collagen synthesis in tendon, both at basal levels and in response to exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miller et al., 2005</xref>), and also identified soluble collagen with a much shorter half-life compared to the majority of collagen in human articular cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hsueh et al., 2019</xref>); the location(s) of these more labile proteins remain to be identified. When taken together, these contradictory findings indicate that proteome dynamics in connective tissues is complex, and that the glycoprotein-rich phase may be replenished more rapidly than the collagen-rich phase. However, the turnover rate of individual proteins within the different phases of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and the potential contribution of differential regulation of protein turnover to maintenance of tissue homeostasis remain undefined.</p><p>Tendon provides an ideal model in which to separately interrogate protein turnover in these ECM phases, as it consists of highly aligned, collagen-rich fascicular matrix (FM), interspersed by a less dense glycoprotein-rich phase, termed the interfascicular matrix (IFM, also referred to as the endotenon) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kastelic et al., 1978</xref>). While the FM is predominantly composed of type I collagen, glycoproteins are also present in this region at low abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thorpe et al., 2016b</xref>). Similarly, the IFM contains small amounts of a variety of collagens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Södersten et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thorpe et al., 2016b</xref>). Due to the highly aligned structure of tendon tissue, it is possible to separate FM and IFM for individual analysis using laser capture microdissection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thorpe et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zamboulis et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, these, and other studies, have shown greater expression of markers of ECM degradation, as well as increased neo-peptide levels, a proxy measure of protein turnover, within the IFM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spiesz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thorpe et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thorpe et al., 2016b</xref>), suggesting this region is more prone to microdamage, likely due to the high shear environment that occurs due to interfascicular sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thorpe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thorpe et al., 2015b</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that there is greater turnover of ECM proteins localised to the IFM than within the FM to repair local microdamage and maintain tendon homeostasis.</p><p>Due to a lack of available methodology, it has not been possible until recently to study differential rate of turnover at the individual protein level. However, novel bioinformatics software developments, in combination with in vivo isotope labelling, and mass spectrometry technologies, now provide the capacity to determine the turnover rates of individual proteins within a sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lau et al., 2016</xref>). The aim of this study is therefore to apply this technique to tendon, firstly to establish the proteome-wide turnover rate of tendon, and secondly to combine this approach with laser capture microdissection to test the hypothesis that the proteome of the IFM is more dynamic than in the FM, with faster turnover of individual proteins. More rapid remodelling of the IFM would provide a mechanism by which shear-induced microdamage to this region could be repaired, preventing damage accumulation and subsequent injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><sup>2</sup>H enrichment in serum water</title><p>In rats labelled with deuterium over a period of 127 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), <sup>2</sup>H enrichment of serum occurred rapidly and in a similar manner to that reported previously in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2012</xref>), reaching a plateau of 5.6% by day 4, and remained constant throughout the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).

Protein turnover rate in tendon varied almost 1000-fold, with half-lives ranging from 1.5 days to over 1000 days. The results also support our hypothesis, demonstrating significantly faster turnover of proteins in the glycoprotein-rich IFM compared to the collagen-rich FM, both overall and when directly comparing individual proteins.</p><p>In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thorpe et al., 2016b</xref>), the IFM had a more complex proteome than the FM, with a greater number of proteins identified in this region. Indeed, more proteins were identified within the IFM than in whole tendon samples; this is likely due to the predominance of collagen in whole tendon samples which precludes detection of proteins present at lower abundance in these samples. As many of the proteins present in the IFM were identified in less than four samples, it was not possible to perform curve fitting to calculate the turnover rate for these proteins. Due to the small size of the rat Achilles tendon, it was not possible to laser-capture a larger volume of IFM, and pooling samples from each time point for LC-MS/MS analysis did not result in a greater number of protein hits than when each sample was analysed separately. In addition, it was necessary to calculate turnover rates of some proteins manually as automated identification of isotopomer peaks was unsuccessful, particularly in IFM samples. While turnover rates calculated manually cannot be compared directly to those calculated automatically by ProTurn, due to differences in curve fitting, it is possible to compare turnover rates of IFM and FM proteins, where both are calculated manually. Additionally, only tendons from female rats were used, such that any differences in turnover rate between sexes could not assessed. While no previous studies have directly compared tendon turnover rates in males and females, it has been demonstrated that there are very small differences in the transcriptome and proteome of Achilles tendons from male and female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sarver et al., 2017</xref>). Despite these limitations, results reveal a diverse rate of protein turnover in both the FM and IFM, with values for individual proteins similar to those observed when the tendon matrix was analysed as a whole.</p><p>Collagenous proteins had the slowest turnover of all tendon matrix proteins identified, in the whole tendon, and in the FM and IFM, with a half-life from approximately 1.5 years in the IFM to 3 years in the FM for type I collagen. Collagen type III appeared to have a somewhat faster turnover rate than type I in both the FM and IFM, with no significant difference between phases. The IFM is known to be enriched in collagen type III, whereas the majority of collagen type I localises to the FM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Södersten et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thorpe et al., 2016b</xref>). While the collagen turnover rates measured are relatively slow, they contrast with previous studies which have reported that collagen is essentially inert in the adult rat patellar tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bechshøft et al., 2017</xref>) and in tendons from larger animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heinemeier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thorpe et al., 2010</xref>), as well as in cartilage and intervertebral disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heinemeier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sivan et al., 2008</xref>). However, these previous studies have either analysed tissues as a whole, or separated the tissue into collagenous and non-collagenous fractions, rather than calculating turnover of individual proteins, such that they lack the specificity achieved by using deuterium labelling combined with mass spectrometry analysis. Other studies that have measured collagen synthesis in human tendon using stable isotope labelling and performing tendon biopsies, report contradictory findings, calculating a FSR of 0.04–0.06% hour<sup>−1</sup>, which equates to a half-life ranging from 48 to 64 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babraj et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smeets et al., 2019</xref>). However, these were very short term studies, and it is unlikely that all newly synthesised protein would be incorporated into the matrix, such that FSR is over-estimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heinemeier et al., 2013</xref>). The results we present here help to explain these apparent contradictory findings, suggesting that the pool of more labile collagen identified previously in human tendon and cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hsueh et al., 2019</xref>) may be located in the glycoprotein-rich ECM phase rather than with the bulk of the fascicular collagen.</p><p>Another factor that is likely to influence tendon remodelling is the regulation of post-translational modifications. ECM proteins, particularly collagens, undergo a wide range of post-translational modifications during synthesis and assembly which occur both intra- and extra-cellularly, either through regulated pathways or spontaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamauchi and Sricholpech, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avery and Bailey, 2005</xref>). Post-translational modifications are essential for determining protein structure and function, and are also likely to influence susceptibility to degradation by limiting enzyme access to cleavage sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jaisson et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, a previous study has shown that, with ageing, partially degraded collagen accumulates within the equine superficial digital flexor tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thorpe et al., 2010</xref>). This is accompanied by increased advanced glycation end products which may render the ECM more resistant to degradation and subsequent remodelling, reducing the ability to repair damage within the tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thorpe et al., 2010</xref>). However, the effects of alterations in post-translations modifications on rates of protein turnover remain to be determined.</p><p>In addition, it is likely that overall protein turnover rate is more rapid in small compared to large animals. While few studies have directly compared protein turnover kinetics between species, a recent study of protein turnover in dermal fibroblasts from different rodent species demonstrated a negative correlation between median <italic>k</italic> values and lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Swovick et al., 2018</xref>). In support of this, the half-life of serum albumin is approximately 10 fold greater in the human compared to the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chaudhury et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jeffay, 1960</xref>). Taken together, it can be presumed that turnover of tendon ECM proteins is also likely slower in larger animals than those we report here for the rat, but the relative differences observed between individual proteins and ECM phases are likely to persist in humans and other large animals.</p><p>It is also important to recognise that specific proteins that are not core components of the tendon ECM will not be metabolised within the tendon, but instead will be synthesised elsewhere and transported to the tendon via the circulation. Specifically, serum albumin and serotransferrin are predominantly synthesised and secreted by the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tavill, 1972</xref>), whereas haemoglobin is synthesised in the bone marrow and its turnover provides a measure of erythrocyte lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koury, 2016</xref>). In addition, anionic trypsin-1, which had a particularly long half-life of nearly 2000 days in the FM, is synthesised in the pancreas. The long half-life measured for this protein is rather surprising, as generally enzymes have a much shorter half-life than ECM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lake-Bakaar et al., 1980</xref>) Proteases have a role in tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shah and Mital, 2018</xref>); it is possible that there is a pool of trypsin within tendon that remains inactive until required for repair, which would explain the long half-life measured.</p><p>The measured rate constants of protein turnover will also be dependent on the protein extraction methods used. We chose GuHCl extraction for whole tendon as this has previously been shown to result in best proteome coverage for tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashraf Kharaz et al., 2017</xref>). It was not possible to use the same extraction method for laser-captured samples due to the small amount of starting material, therefore we used a method previously optimised for this sample type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thorpe et al., 2016b</xref>). Despite differences in extraction techniques used, protein half-lives were similar in the whole tendon and the fascicular matrix, suggesting minimal effects from using different extraction techniques. Indeed, previous studies, in which the rat Achilles was acid-solubilised post deuterium labelling and FSR measured by GC-MS, reported a FSR of 0.66 % day<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katsma et al., 2017</xref>) which equates to a half-life of 105 days, supporting the results we present here, in which average protein half-life in whole tendon is 131 days.</p><p>As well as providing the first data on individual protein turnover rates in tendon, this work builds on our understanding of the role of the IFM in tendon function. Previous work has shown that the IFM has specialised composition and function, facilitating sliding between tendon fascicles to provide extensibility to the tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thorpe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thorpe et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thorpe et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thorpe et al., 2016c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thorpe et al., 2016a</xref>). Cyclic sliding and recoil increases the risk of microdamage to this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spiesz et al., 2015</xref>), and therefore greater turnover of IFM proteins may be a protective mechanism to repair this damage. We have previously demonstrated that elastin and lubricin are localised to the IFM and likely contribute to its mechanical function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Godinho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thorpe et al., 2016a</xref>). However, these proteins are difficult to identify using LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thorpe et al., 2016b</xref>) so we were unable to assess their rate of turnover.</p><p>We extend previous observations in tendon and other musculoskeletal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thorpe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sivan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maroudas et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hsueh et al., 2019</xref>), measuring considerably faster turnover of proteoglycans compared to collagens in tendons, FM and IFM. Interestingly, there were variations in rates of small leucine-rich proteoglycan turnover between tendon phases. Significantly faster turnover of decorin was observed in the IFM compared to the FM, whereas the results suggest that faster fibromodulin turnover may occur within the FM. Indeed, previous studies have shown differential abundance of specific proteoglycans in the IFM and FM, with enrichment of fibromodulin in the FM, but no significant differences in amounts of decorin, biglycan or lumican between tendon phases, as determined by proteomic analysis and immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thorpe et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thorpe et al., 2016a</xref>). While use of mouse knock out models have established the roles of a variety of proteins during tendon development, with collagen type V, decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, lumican and thrombospondins all serving roles in modulating collagen fibrillogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Connizzo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delgado Caceres et al., 2018</xref>), the contributions of these proteins to the function of mature tendon are less well characterised. Recent work using decorin and biglycan inducible knock-out mice demonstrated alterations in collagen fibril diameter and decreased tendon mechanical properties in the adult, indicating an important role for these proteoglycans in FM and subsequently, tendon homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Robinson et al., 2017</xref>). It is likely that proteoglycans also contribute to homeostasis within the IFM, but the roles of specific proteins in the IFM during development and in the adult remain to be defined.</p><p>Our results show that proteome dynamics in tendon is highly complex, with differences in protein-selective turnover rates observed in distinct IFM and FM ECM phases. Regulation of protein turnover is multifactorial, involving pathways controlling protein synthesis, folding, transport, assembly, disassembly, and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Powers et al., 2009</xref>). Recent studies have identified the important role of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in regulating ECM remodelling in tendon and other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gumucio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rys et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, it has been shown that TGF-β localises to the IFM in developing and adult tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Russo et al., 2015</xref>), which is consistent with the notion that increased TGF-β signalling could have a role in this faster protein turnover identified in the IFM.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first study to determine the turnover rate of individual proteins in different connective tissue phases, demonstrating complex proteome dynamics in tendon, with an overall faster turnover of proteins in the glycoprotein-rich IFM phase. Greater capacity for turnover of this phase of the tendon matrix may be indicative of a mechanism that reduces the accumulation of damage caused by the high shear environment within this region, although this remains to be directly determined. The techniques used here provide a powerful approach to interrogate alterations in connective tissue protein turnover with ageing and/or disease which are likely to influence injury

The mass spectrometer operated in positive ion electron ionisation mode, the source temperature was 180°C and the range scanned was m/z 40–600 (scan time: 0.9 s). Mass spectral intensities for m/z values 58 and 59 were produced by combining the mass spectra in the acetone peak to create an averaged spectrum (Waters MassLynx). Serum <sup>2</sup>H enrichment was calculated by comparison to a standard curve, and first order curve fitting (GraphPad Prism 8) used to calculate the rate constant (<italic>k<sub>p</sub></italic>) and plateau (<italic>p</italic><sub>ss</sub>) of deuterium enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Protein extraction from whole tendon</title><p>Left Achilles tendons were thawed, and their surface scraped with a scalpel, followed by PBS washes, to remove the epitenon and any residual non-tendinous tissue. Tendons were finely chopped, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and pulverised in a dismembrator (Sartorius, mikro-dismembrator U, 1800rpm, 2 mins.). Proteins were extracted using previously optimised methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashraf Kharaz et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, following deglycosylation in chondroitinase ABC, proteins were extracted in guanidine hydrocholoride (GuHCl) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kharaz et al., 2016</xref>). Protein content was determined using a Pierce protein assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were stored at −80°C prior to preparation for LC-MS/MS by centrifugal filtration. Filter units (Vivacon 500; 10 000 MWCO) were rinsed with 1%(v/v) formic acid and a balance volume of buffer (4M GuHCl/50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ambic)) was added. A volume equivalent to 50 µg protein was added to each filter and the samples vortexed gently. Filters were centrifuged (15 min, 12500 rpm, 20°C), washed with GuHCl buffer and centrifuged again. Proteins were reduced by DTT incubation (100 µl of 8 mM in 4M GuHCl, 15 min, 56°C) and then centrifuged (10 min, 12500 rpm). DTT was removed by washing twice with buffer as described above. Proteins were alkylated with 100 μl 50 mM iodoacetamide in 4M GuHCl solution, vortexed and incubated in the dark (20 min., room temperature). Iodoacetamide was removed by washing twice with GuHCl buffer as described above. Buffer was exchanged to ambic by 3 washes with 50 mM ambic, centrifuging after each wash. 1 µg trypsin in 50 mM ambic (40 µl) was added and proteins digested overnight at 37°C with mixing. Flow through was collected after centrifugation and addition of 40 µl 50 mM ambic. The flow though was combined and acidified using trifluoroacetic acid (10%(v/v)), and diluted 20-fold in 0.1%(v/v) TFA/3%(v/v) acetonitrile for LC-MS/MS analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Isolation and extraction of fascicular and interfascicular matrix proteins</title><p> Longitudinal cryosections (15 µm) from the right Achilles tendons (five time points, n = 2–3/time point) were adhered to membrane slides (PEN, Leica) and stored at −80°C. Sections were prepared for laser capture as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thorpe et al., 2016b</xref>) and approximately 1 mm<sup>2</sup> of FM and IFM from each sample were collected into 50 µl molecular biology grade H<sub>2</sub>O (Leica LMD7000; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Samples were immediately frozen and stored at −80°C. Prior to digestion, samples were centrifuged immediately after removal from −80°C storage. Volume was adjusted to 80 µl by adding 50 mM ambic, and Rapigest SF (1%(v/v) in 25 mM ambic, Waters, UK) was added to a final volume of 0.1%(v/v). Samples were mixed (room temperature, 30 min) then incubated at 60°C (1 hr, 450 rpm). Samples were centrifuged (17200 g, 10 min), vortexed, then incubated at 80°C (10 min). Proteins were reduced by incubating with DTT (5 μL, 60 mM in 25 mM ambic, 10 min, 60°C) then alkylated by adding 5 μl 178 mM iodoacetamide in 25 mM ambic (30 min. incubation, room temperature, in dark). Trypsin (Promega Gold sequencing grade) was diluted in 25 mM ambic and added at an enzyme to protein ratio of 1:50 (based on estimated protein amount from tissue volume collected). Digests were incubated overnight at 37°C with an enzyme top-up after 3.5 hr. Rapigest was hydrolysed with TFA (0.5 μl, 37°C, 45 min.). Digests were centrifuged (17200 g, 30 min.), aspirated into low-bind tubes and de-salted on stage-tips as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thorpe et al., 2016b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>LC-MS/MS analyses</title><p>Data-dependent LC-MS/MS analyses were conducted on a QExactive quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Williamson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Michalski et al., 2011</xref>) coupled to a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano-liquid chromatograph (Thermo Fisher, UK). Digest was loaded onto a trapping column (Acclaim PepMap 100 C18, 75 µm x 2 cm, 3 µm packing material, 100 Å) using a loading buffer of 0.1%(v/v) TFA, 2%(v/v) acetonitrile in water for 7 min (flow rate: 9 µl/min). The trapping column was set in-line with an analytical column (EASY-Spray PepMap RSLC C18, 75 µm x 50 cm, 2 µm packing material, 100 Å) and peptides eluted using a linear gradient of 96.2% A (0.1%(v/v) formic acid):3.8% B (0.1%(v/v) formic acid in water:acetonitrile [80:20](v/v)) to 50% A:50% B over 30 min (flow rate: 300 nl/min), followed by 1% A:99% B for 5 min and re-equilibration of the column to starting conditions. The column was maintained at 40°C, and the effluent introduced directly into the integrated nano-electrospray ionisation source operating in positive ion mode.

Fixed modifications of carbamidomethyl cysteine and ≤3 variable modifications of oxidation of methionine and proline were allowed. Tryptic, semi-tryptic, and non-tryptic peptides within a 15-ppm mass window surrounding the candidate precursor mass were searched. Protein identification was performed using DTASelect (v.2.1.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cociorva et al., 2006</xref>), with ≤1% global peptide FDR and ≥2 unique peptides per protein.

Non-steady state curve fitting was used to account for the initial delay in uptake of <sup>2</sup>H, using a first-order kinetic curve to approximate the equilibration of <sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O in body water. Values of <italic>k<sub>p</sub></italic> and <italic>p</italic><sub>ss</sub> were inputted from the resultant curve fitting of <sup>2</sup>H enrichment in serum samples. To control against false positive identifications, only peptides that were explicitly identified in ≥4 data points were accepted for the calculation of protein turnover. The ‘Allow Peptide Modification’ option was selected to include any identified post-translationally modified peptides in kinetic curve-fitting, and peptide isotopomer time series were included if R<sup>2</sup> ≥0.8 or standard error of estimate (S.E)≤0.05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2014</xref>). Protein-level turnover rate is reported as the median and median absolute deviation of the turnover rate constants of each accepted unique constituent peptide, from which protein half-life can be calculated assuming a first order reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lau et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>For some proteins of interest, particularly in the IFM, automated calculation of turnover rates was unsuccessful, due to unsuccessful automated identification of isotopomer peaks.

We were planning to immunolabel some tendon sections for key ECM proteins (collagen types 1 and 3, decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin) but unfortunately have not been able to do so due to lab closures as a result of COVID-19. However, distribution of these proteins within tendon is well described in the literature, and we have discussed our findings in light of these (Discussion, third and ninth paragraphs).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, regarding the equal representation of sex in the experiments, justification for using only female rats should be offered.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. We used female rats to maintain consistency with a related study, for which female rats were chosen to reduce the possibility of having to singly house animals after surgery due to animals fighting (which is common in males). We have added use of a single sex as a limitation of the study (Discussion, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Discussion should address whether turnover of protein post translational modifications (e.g., glycosylation) is an important feature of tendinous remodeling.

It has also increased the number of collagen type I peptides identified, increasing the significance of our results (see Figure 7).</p></body></sub-article></article>
