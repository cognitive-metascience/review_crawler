Plant guard cells, that form stomatal pores for gas exchange, provide a powerful system for in depth investigation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling specificity in plants. In intact guard cells, abscisic acid (ABA) enhances (primes) the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of downstream signaling events that result in activation of S-type anion channels during stomatal closure, providing a specificity mechanism in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling. However, the underlying genetic and biochemical mechanisms remain unknown. Here we show impairment of ABA signal transduction in stomata of calcium-dependent protein kinase quadruple mutant plants. Interestingly, protein phosphatase 2Cs prevent non-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling. Moreover, we demonstrate an unexpected interdependence of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent ABA-signaling branches and the <italic>in planta</italic> requirement of simultaneous phosphorylation at two key phosphorylation sites in SLAC1. We identify novel mechanisms ensuring specificity and robustness within stomatal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling on a cellular, genetic, and biochemical level.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03599.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03599.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03599.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plant leaves have tiny openings or pores called stomata, which allow carbon dioxide, water vapor and other gases to diffuse in and out of the plant. Two cells called guard cells surround each stoma and control the opening and closing of the pore. If a plant is losing excessive amounts of water, for example during a drought, the plant produces a hormone called abscisic acid that promotes the closure of its stomata.</p><p>When abscisic acid is present, the guard cells are sensitive to changes in their internal concentration of calcium ions so that calcium ions can activate a protein called SLAC1. This leads to responses in the guard cells that close the stoma. The calcium ions activate SLAC1 by stimulating enzymes called calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs). However, abscisic acid can also trigger other enzymes that can activate SLAC1 independently of the calcium ions.</p><p>Calcium ions are also reported to be involved in the opening of stomata, when abscisic acid is not present. Therefore, it is not clear how abscisic acid works to specifically ‘prime’ guard cells to close the stomata in response to increases in calcium ions during drought. Brandt, Munemasa et al. studied stomata in a plant called <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. The experiments show that, in the presence of abscisic acid, mutant plants that lack four different CPK enzymes are impaired in the activation of SLAC1 and the closing of stomata in response to increases in calcium ions.</p><p>Further experiments found that other enzymes called the PP2Cs—which are switched off by abscisic acid—are responsible for regulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of guard cells. Switching off PP2Cs enables closing of the stomata in response to calcium ions. It has been suggested previously that the CPKs and the calcium-independent enzymes are involved in two separate pathways that promote the closure of stomata. However, Brandt, Munemasa et al. found that the calcium-independent enzymes are required for calcium ions to activate SLAC1 in guard cells, revealing that these two pathways are linked.</p><p>Brandt, Munemasa et al.'s findings reveal how abscisic acid is able to specifically prime guard cells to close stomata in response to calcium ions. The next challenge is to understand how the CPKs and calcium-independent enzymes work together during the closure of stomata.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03599.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03599.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>calcium specificity</kwd><kwd>SLAC1</kwd><kwd>calcium-dependent protein kinase</kwd><kwd>protein phosphatase 2C</kwd><kwd>abscisic acid</kwd><kwd>SnRK</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM060396-ES010337</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schroeder</surname><given-names>Julian I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB1414339</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schroeder</surname><given-names>Julian I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001655</institution-id><institution>German Academic Exchange Service</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brandt</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Munemasa</surname><given-names>Shintaro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-FG02-03ER15449</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schroeder</surname><given-names>Julian I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The calcium-dependent signaling pathway during ABA-dependent stomatal closure requires the calcium-independent pathway, and calcium signaling specificity is mediated by PP2C protein phosphatases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytosolic calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>) functions as key cellular second messenger in a plethora of crucial processes in plants and other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hetherington and Woodward, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clapham, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McAinsh and Pittman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berridge, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Charpentier and Oldroyd, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Webb, 2013</xref>).

However, characterization of the combined cellular, biochemical, and genetic mechanisms underlying Ca<sup>2+</sup> specificity in a single cell type has not been achieved to our knowledge.</p><p>The genome of the plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> encodes over 200 EF-hand Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Day et al., 2002</xref>), with many of these genes co-expressed in the same cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harmon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McCormack et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schmid et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Winter et al., 2007</xref>), illustrating the need for Ca<sup>2+</sup> specificity signaling mechanisms in plants. Two guard cells form a stomatal pore representing the gateway for CO<sub>2</sub> influx, which is inevitably accompanied by plant water loss. The aperture of stomatal pores is consequently tightly regulated by the guard cells. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> represents a key second messenger in stomatal closing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McAinsh et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">MacRobbie, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hetherington, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hetherington and Woodward, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hubbard et al., 2012</xref>), but intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> also functions in stomatal opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Irving et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shimazaki et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Curvetto et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shimazaki et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cousson and Vavasseur, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Young et al., 2006</xref>), raising the question how cytosolic free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>) elevations trigger a specific cellular response. The underlying mechanisms mediating specificity in guard cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling are not well understood. The development of genetic, electrophysiological, and cell signaling tools for the dissection of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling within this model cell type renders guard cells a powerful system for the investigation of specificity mechanisms within Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal transduction. Recent studies including analyses in intact <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Young et al., 2006</xref>) and <italic>Vicia faba</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) guard cells, have shown that stomatal closing stimuli including abscisic acid (ABA) and CO<sub>2</sub> enhance the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> sensitivity of downstream signaling mechanisms, switching them from an inactivated state to an enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsive ‘primed’ state, thus tightly controlling specificity in Ca<sup>2+</sup> responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Young et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Munemasa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Siegel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Xue et al., 2011</xref>). A rise of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> from resting to elevated levels alone does not trigger the full ion channel regulation and stomatal response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Young et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Munemasa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Siegel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Xue et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, a recent study of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) signaling suggests that prior PAMP signaling enhances the sensitivity to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> during signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kadota et al., 2014</xref>), indicating that this principle for Ca<sup>2+</sup> specificity priming may be more widely used in plants. The biological closing stimulus has to be present for the guard cell to react to physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation. However, the biochemical and genetic mechanisms mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity priming remain unknown.</p><p>SLAC1 represents the major anion channel mediating S-type anion currents in guard cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Negi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vahisalu et al., 2008</xref>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of S-type anion currents is an early and crucial step in stomatal closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schroeder and Hagiwara, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McAinsh et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Siegel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2010</xref>).

Presently, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>–independent branches are considered to function independently (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim and et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Roelfsema et al., 2012</xref>).

Reconstitution of ABA activation of SLAC1 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes has been shown by co-expression of the ABA-receptor PYR1 together with SLAC1, PP2Cs, and either Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent OST1 or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent CPK6 protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brandt et al., 2012</xref>). However, whether the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and–independent branches in ABA signal transduction are functionally linked and depend on one-another <italic>in planta</italic> remains to be investigated using higher order genetic mutants. Here we present biochemical, genetic and cellular signaling findings that describe mechanisms underlying specificity and robustness in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling within a single cell type and demonstrate an unexpected strong dependence of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signal transduction branch on the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent pathway in guard cells. Moreover our results suggest that in contrast to OST1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Umezawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vlad et al., 2009</xref>), calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are not directly deactivated by PP2Cs, but these PP2Cs rapidly deactivate both of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>–independent branches by directly dephosphorylating the protein kinase target SLAC1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CPK requirement for ABA activation of anion channels</title><p>Previous studies have shown that <italic>A. thaliana</italic> single or double mutants in CPKs cause partial ABA-insensitivities in guard cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hubbard et al., 2012</xref>).

Pre-incubation with either ABI1 or PP2CA did not inhibit CPK6 trans-phosphorylation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lanes 2–3 and 5–6). In contrast, control OST1-derived substrate phosphorylation band intensities strongly decreased when ABI1 or PP2CA proteins were present during the pre-incubation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, lanes 2–3 and 5–6). These results indicate that OST1, but not CPK6 activity, is directly down-regulated by ABI1 and PP2CA. CPKs have been previously reported to interact with ABI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Geiger et al., 2010</xref>). An electro-mobility shift can be observed for OST1 as well as for CPK6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). These shifts could be due to dephosphorylation of CPK6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>) and OST1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Umezawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vlad et al., 2009</xref>) by PP2Cs. However, dephosphorylation by PP2Cs did not inhibit CPK6 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). An additional independent biochemical assay measuring ATP consumption also did not show down-regulation of CPK6 activity in the presence of ABI1 and PP2CA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>), further underlining no direct down-regulation of CPK6 activity by these three PP2Cs, in contrast to OST1 controls.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>PP2Cs interact with and rapidly dephosphorylate SLAC1</title><p>Our results suggest that PP2Cs neither down-regulate CPK6 activity directly in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>) nor that CPK activities are strongly ABA-regulated independent of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] changes in native plant protein extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). We next investigated the kinetics and specificity of PP2C down-regulation of SLAC1 activation by CPKs through dephosphorylation of the SLAC1 channel, a mechanism reported for CPK-dependent transcription factor regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lynch et al., 2012</xref>) and consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brandt et al., 2012</xref>). First, we determined whether SLAC1 interacts with the PP2C ABI1 <italic>in planta</italic> using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). We observed clear BiFC signals for full length SLAC1 co-expressed with CPK6 and ABI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>) while signal intensities of SLAC1 co-expressed with a control protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit 5 (PP2AC5) were very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Protein–protein interaction of SLAC1 with PP2CA in BiFC experiments was reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>, the ABI1-mediated dephosphorylation of the N-terminus of SLAC1 (SLAC1-NT) previously phosphorylated by CPK6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brandt et al., 2012</xref>) occurs very rapidly. Already 1 min after the addition of ABI1 a strong decrease of the phosphorylation signal was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, lane 4). This de-phosphorylation was also found when the PP2C phosphatase PP2CA was added instead of ABI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,E</xref>, lane 4). To test whether this is a general phenomenon, we phosphorylated the SLAC1-NT with the SLAC1-activating and -phosphorylating kinases CPK21, CPK23, and OST1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Geiger et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2009</xref>) and analyzed whether ABI1 and PP2CA are able to remove phospho-groups added by these kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The amino acid residue serine 120 of SLAC1 has been shown to be required for OST1, but not for CPK23 activation of SLAC1 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Geiger et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2010</xref>).

Thus we investigated whether several CPKs can activate the SLAC1 S120A mutant in oocytes and whether the SLAC1 S59A mutant is activated by OST1 and other CPKs in oocytes. CPK5, CPK6, and CPK23 activation of SLAC1 S120A was similar to WT SLAC1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

These results suggest that S59 is required for strong activation by protein kinases of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent CPK branch, while S120 represents a crucial amino acid for strong activation by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent branch of the ABA signaling core. To avoid spurious phosphorylation by high protein kinase concentrations in oocytes, effects of co-expression of CPK6 and OST1 at low levels that do not fully activate SLAC1 were investigated. These experiments show a clear enhanced SLAC1 activation in oocytes when both kinases are co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>).

Interestingly however, <italic>cpk</italic> mutants show impairment in ABA activation of I<sub>Ca</sub> channels in guard cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mori et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The present study suggests that the integration of signals via differential phosphorylation of SLAC1 by the kinases of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent branches could contribute to the interdependence of both signaling branches. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, SLAC1 S59 is required for the activation by CPKs while SLAC1 S120 is required for the activation by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent kinase OST1 in oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, SLAC1 activation is enhanced by co-expression of (non-split YFP moieties) non-saturating OST1 and CPK6 activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, <italic>in planta</italic> analyses of <italic>slac1-1</italic> plants expressing single SLAC1 S59A or SLAC1 S120A mutants under the control of the <italic>SLAC1</italic> promoter unexpectedly display intact ABA-responses indicating that the phosphorylation of either amino acid residue, together with phosphorylation of other amino acids, is sufficient for ABA-induced stomatal closing in intact stomata and ABA activation of S-type anion channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, simultaneous mutation of both residues in SLAC1 (S59A and S120A) caused a strong impairment in ABA activation of S-type anion channels and stomatal closing <italic>in planta</italic>, illustrating the combined key functions of these residues in the intact guard cell system.</p><p>It should be noted that although SLAC1 S120, but not S59, is crucial for the activation by OST1 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Geiger et al., 2009</xref>), phosphorylation of SLAC1 S59 by OST1 is also found in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vahisalu et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, although the S120A mutation does not affect CPK6 activation of SLAC1 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>), our LC-MS/MS analyses reveal that the S120 can be also phosphorylated by CPK6 in vitro (data not shown). Combined with these in vitro data, our present <italic>in planta</italic> findings suggest that the SnRK2 and CPK protein kinases may have distinct affinities for the S59 and S120 phospho-sites of SLAC1, which could contribute to the interdependence of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and -independent branches of the ABA signaling network. In addition, crosstalk regulation mechanisms of these protein kinase responses may exist <italic>in planta</italic> and will require further investigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Note that, similar to the <italic>slac1-1</italic> mutation, mutation of SLAC1 S120 to phenylalanine (<italic>slac1-7</italic>) can impair ozone-induced stomatal closing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vahisalu et al., 2010</xref>). It is plausible that a phenylalanine residue at this position causes more significant structural changes that impair SLAC1 function compared to alanine. When both S59 and S120 are mutated to alanine simultaneously however, ABA-triggered S-type anion current activation and stomatal closure were abrogated, highlighting the importance of these two residues for ABA-signaling <italic>in planta</italic>. The results gained <italic>in planta</italic> also highlight that data gained in oocytes, though helpful, are simplified and, not surprisingly, do not necessarily represent the situation in the complex plant system. Over-expression of the components, including activating protein kinases, to a high abundance in oocytes is well-suited to test several possible mechanisms in ion channel regulation, and can guide follow up investigation in the native environment in plant cells.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the present study reveals a first genetic mechanism that mediates Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity priming. Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity is demonstrated here to be constitutively primed in <italic>pp2c</italic> quadruple mutant guard cells, showing that PP2Cs ensure Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling specificity. Interestingly, PP2Cs do not directly down-regulate CPK activity, in contrast to direct PP2C down-regulation of the SnRK2 protein kinases. Rather PP2Cs very rapidly down-regulate signaling targets downstream of CPKs, which could enable the same CPKs to function in more than one pathway. We have further identified a <italic>cpk</italic> quadruple mutant here that for the first time strongly abrogates ABA activation of S-type anion channels. This abrogation occurs despite an intact Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent SnRK2 signaling branch. Furthermore, disruption of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent signaling branch in <italic>snrk2</italic> protein kinase triple mutant plants abrogates Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.

Your full submission has been evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor) and three peer reviewers, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. We regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication.</p><p>The comments below are a synopsis of the major comments of the reviewers.</p><p>The overall concern is that this paper only incrementally changes the existing model for ABA dependent regulation of Slac1. A 2012 PNAS paper from many of the same authors concluded with a very similar model for ABA dependent regulation of Slac1, and other papers that are cited, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31 bib32">Geiger et al. 2009 and 2010</xref>, also support key aspects of the current model.</p><p>The main new finding is that PP2C phosphatases inhibit SLAC1 activation by directly dephosphorylating two different sites in the N terminus of SLAC1: S120, which is phosphorylated by non-Ca dependent SnRK kinases including Ost1, and S59, which is phosphorylated by Ca dependent kinases, CPKs. This adds to an earlier model where PP2C action reversed CPK dependent phosphorylation of SLAC1 and also dephosphorylated OST1, directly inactivating the kinase. The essential new idea then is that the N terminus of Slac1 serves as a coincidence detector, which is a nice addition to the current knowledge, but the reviewers considered this a ‘refinement’ of the current model rather than a significant conceptual advancement. Furthermore, the coincidence detection idea is not tested directly, for example with SLAC1 S59A, S120A single and double mutants introduced into the background of a SLAC1 loss-of-function mutant. The model predicts that such mutants would not be activated by ABA, and would not show constitutive activation in the PP2C quadruple mutant. Similarly, phospho-mimic single and double mutants in oocyte expression and in planta experiments would further enhance the understanding of ABA-signaling in guard cells.</p><p>Together with the limits of the artificial patch clamp experiments, the oocyte data do not entirely support the presented model. You concluded that both S120 and S59 have to be phosphorylated by OST1 and CPK6 synergistically to render SLAC1 active. Consequently disruption of one of the phospho-sites should result in an infunctional SLAC1 channel. However, this was not what was observed.</p><p>Due to the above mentioned limitations and the lack of certain controls and of in planta confirmation, the reviewers agreed that the manuscript is more suitable for a specialized journal. Specific comments from the three reviewers follow.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>1) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> deal with calcium-dependent kinases <italic>cpk5/6/11/23</italic> in the ABA responsive regulation of calcium channels in guard cells. The focus of the text is on the role of CPK5 yet all of the studies are performed with a quadruple T-DNA insertion mutant that ablates all of these enzymes. Would it be possible to conduct a parallel analysis in mutant plant cells that lack single CPK enzymes, in particular CPK5?</p><p>2) The experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> nicely complement data in the opening figure, but suffer from the same lack of specificity. Is it possible to measure the impact on calcium ion conductance in plant cells that lack individual ABL, HAB1 or PP2CA genes?</p><p>3) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A and 3B</xref> are interesting, but as presented are less than convincing. The statement in the Results section “Several calcium activated bands disappeared… consistent with CPK activities associated with these molecular weights” is important to the overall hypothesis tested in this article. However, the quality of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A and 3B</xref> is not sufficient to convince this reviewer of the validity of this statement.</p><p>4) The BiFC data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are interesting and well controlled. These findings suggest that SLAC1 and PP2CA directly interact, or do so in a proximity that permits formation of the fluorescent adduct. Given that the authors acknowledge that this protein-protein interaction has previously been reported there would be some merit in further emphasizing the new aspects of the binding event that are demonstrated in this new data. This pertains to the phosphorylation dependent regulation of the binding event. Can the phosphorylation sites be identified? Do phosphor-site mutants prevent protein association?</p><p>5) The data in the final figure are more mechanistic and deal with some of the concepts that I have raised above. My reading of this section suggests that most of the electrophysiological measurements were performed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Can any of these studies be conducted in mutant plants? Performing this work in a more physiologically relevant cell type would be an important addendum to this interesting study.</p><p>6) The Abstract and opening sections of the Introduction are not well articulated. Major editing would be necessary to improve the clarity of these important sections.</p><p>7) The details of the drug regimen presented in panel 4D are convoluted and hard to follow.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>A minor concern is that no negative control is shown for the BiFC experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>Interpretations concerning the ABA primed Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of SLAC1 phosphorylation are based on guard cell protoplast data. The consensus in the field is that protoplasts are impaired in many normal cellular functions. The cytosol of cells is strongly diluted and evidence for degradation of major guard cell functions has been published. The experiments here are carried out following a preincubation of protoplasts with ABA. The authors can therefore not exclude that the ABA-signaling complex is established and solidified by ABA incubation and therefore the dilution prior to patch clamp measurements is weaker than in the absence of ABA. This scenario would lead to similar results, but would have nothing to do with ABA-priming.</p><p>Wang et al., (2013, Plant Physiol.) showed that the ABA-insensitive ABA receptor quadruple mutant (<italic>pyr1/pyl1/pyl2/pyl4</italic>) displayed wild type like s-type anion current responses upon elevation of cytosolic calcium levels, contradicting the authors' hypothesis of ABA priming. Thus, calcium is sufficient for anion channel activation (without ABA priming). Moreover, reports from Chen et al., (2010, Plant J), Marten et al., (2007, Plant Physiol.), Stange et al., (2010, Plant J) and Levchenko et al., (2005, PNAS) illustrated that the ABA-signaling pathway is bifurcated: On one branch, ABA activates S-type anion channels without the need of cytosolic calcium elevations and on the other, ABA activates anion channels in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent manner. These findings contradict the interdependence of both pathways and the priming of the guard cell calcium sensitivity by ABA as reported by the authors here. Even more importantly, the experiments by Marten et al., (2007, Plant Physiol.), Stange et al., (2010, Plant J) and Levchenko et al., (2005, PNAS) were conducted with intact plants and a minimal invasive guard cell impalement technique, simultaneously recording the rise in cytosolic calcium and S-type anion currents. Thus in intact plants the situation seems to be different from the protoplast system.</p><p>Physiological tests, such as gas-exchange or stomatal aperture measurements are lacking completely.</p><p>The authors used CPK or PP2C quadruple mutants as well as a <italic>snrk</italic> triple mutant in their patch clamp and biochemical studies to show their impact in ABA-dependent stomatal closure (SLAC1 activation). Since all of these ABA signaling components not only regulate the activity of SLAC1 but also are involved in other aspects of gene regulation, it would be important to show that the equilibrium/stoichiometry between phosphatases and kinases are not disturbed in the mutants. This could be circumvented with the SLAC1 phospho-site mutants S59, S120 and a double mutant thereof, introduced into SLAC1 loss-of-function mutants.</p><p>Why did the authors include CPK11 in their studies?</p><p>In vitro kinase assays were performed to show that ABI1 and PP2CA do not inhibit CPK6 activity (although autophosphorylation was decreased). The authors should consider the activity of the recombinant proteins under the respective conditions. Why did the authors not see a reduction of CPK autophosphorylation when using the whole seedling proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, wild type vs. PP2C quadruple KO)?</p><p>The authors used whole seedling protein preparations for comparisons between wild type and multiple mutants to show that PP2Cs control the activity of OST1 but not of CPKs and the interdependence of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent and independent pathway. The major quantity of whole seedling protoplasts consists of mesophyll cells that act differently than guard cells when exposed to ABA. Moreover, SLAC1 and OST1 represent guard cell specific proteins and are underrepresented in whole seedling preparation. This is also true for other tissue- and stimulus-specific ABA-signaling components. Thus, the authors should be very careful in drawing conclusions from experiments with samples guard cells represent the minority.</p><p>Heterologous expression in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes was performed to finally show that OST1 and CPKs synergistically activate SLAC1 by phosphorylation. The authors claim that the phospho-site S120 is addressed by OST1 but not by CPK6/5/23 (already shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Geiger et al. 2009</xref>) and that S59 is specific for CPKs (shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brandt et al. 2012</xref>) but is not a site for OST1.</p><p>For the reader it is difficult to understand how the author can conclude that both residues have to be phosphorylated by OST1 and CPK6 synergistically to render SLAC1 active when after disruption of one of the sites SLAC1 can still be activated. It would appear that phosphorylation of one site is sufficient (perhaps in combination with other phosphorylation sites) to render SLAC1 active (S59 for CPKs and S120 for OST1). Moreover, the fact that CPK6 alone and OST1 alone, coexpressed as BiFC constructs, are able to activate wild type SLAC1 also would seem to contradict the authors' conclusion that SLAC1 phosphorylation by OST1 primes SLAC1 and that additional phosphorylation of SLAC1 by CPK6 (upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase) activates the anion channel.</p><p>When coexpressing wild type SLAC1 with both kinases the authors used very small quantities of CPK6 cRNA but 15x more OST1 cRNA. Only when suboptimal CPK6 concentrations were used, OST1 could enhance SLAC1 activation. This does not seem to prove kinase synergistic activation of SLAC1.</p><p>Why did the authors use 400 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>, while for all other studies they used micromolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> containing buffers?</p><p>BIFC experiments are lacking proper controls (there is no negative control, e.g. CPK6/OST1 coexpression should result in a negative BiFC).</p><p>Y2H experiments were performed to show that OST1 and CPK6 do not interact with each other. This negative result should be confirmed by alternative approaches.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “Calcium Specificity Signaling Mechanisms in Abscisic Acid Signal Transduction in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Guard Cells” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

A 2012 PNAS paper from many of the same authors concluded with a very similar model for ABA dependent regulation of Slac1, and other papers that are cited, such as</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31 bib32"><italic>Geiger et al. 2009 and 2010</italic></xref><italic>, also support key aspects of the current model</italic>.</p><p>We list here in brief form some of the major new findings in our manuscript. Please note that the 2009, 2010, and 2012 papers referenced above focus mainly on analyzing reconstituted signaling proteins in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and in vitro<italic>,</italic> but our present study reveals several new and relevant findings in planta by analyzing higher order <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants. The above reconstitution studies do not answer the question of how Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent ABA signaling pathways are coordinated in guard cells and how Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling specificity is achieved in guard cell ABA-signaling.</p><p>The major findings in our manuscript are, in brief:</p><p>a) We have found a strong disruption in ABA-triggered guard cell S-type anion channel activation in <italic>cpk</italic> quadruple mutants and now also demonstrate that higher order knock out <italic>CPK</italic> mutants are strongly impaired in in vivo stomatal responses to 5 µM ABA underlining our findings as suggested by reviewers. We further provide evidence for redundancy in the pathway at high ABA concentrations.</p><p>b) We have found the quadruple knock out of PP2C protein phosphatases leads to constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling and ion channel regulation in planta, a major finding that provides a first mutant that removes the requirement for ABA-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity priming.</p><p>c) Using <italic>slac1</italic> complementation lines (<italic>slac1</italic> mutants expressing WT SLAC1, SLAC1 S59A, S120A, or S59A/S120A under the native <italic>SLAC1</italic> promoter), now we provide interesting and unexpected <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that both of the phospho-sites are required for guard cell ABA responses in planta. These findings will be of great interest to plant scientists.</p><p>d) Present models assume that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent ABA signal transduction branches are independent from one another. Using higher order Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent (<italic>snrk2</italic>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent (<italic>cpk</italic>) protein kinase mutants we demonstrate genetically and in cell signaling analyses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> guard cells that these two pathways are interdependent, a question that has not been addressed directly in planta to our knowledge. We found that disruption of three Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent SnRK2 protein kinase genes unexpectedly disrupts guard cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, providing genetic evidence for interdependence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent ABA signaling pathways. This in vivo evidence will have major impact on the field, where presently mainly two independent pathways are considered.</p><p><italic>The main new finding is that PP2C phosphatases inhibit SLAC1 activation by directly dephosphorylating two different sites in the N terminus of SLAC1: S120, which is phosphorylated by non-Ca dependent SnRK kinases including Ost1, and S59, which is phosphorylated by Ca dependent kinases, CPKs. This adds to an earlier model where PP2C action reversed CPK dependent phosphorylation of SLAC1 and also dephosphorylated OST1, directly inactivating the kinase. The essential new idea then is that the N terminus of Slac1 serves as a coincidence detector, which is a nice addition to the current knowledge, but the reviewers considered this a ‘refinement’ of the current model rather than a significant conceptual advancement. Furthermore, the coincidence detection idea is not tested directly, for example with SLAC1 S59A, S120A single and double mutants introduced into the background of a SLAC1 loss-of-function mutant. The model predicts that such mutants would not be activated by ABA, and would not show constitutive activation in the PP2C quadruple mutant. Similarly, phospho-mimic single and double mutants in oocyte expression and in planta experiments would further enhance the understanding of ABA-signaling in guard cells</italic>.</p><p>To address this comment, we have generated and investigated SLAC1 mutants using the phospho-mimic approach and found that substituting S59 and/or S120 with Aspartate did not lead to constitutive active SLAC1 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brandt et al., 2012</xref> and unpublished results). To address the role of phosphorylated sites more directly in planta, we generated and analyzed <italic>slac1</italic> complementation lines (<italic>slac1</italic> mutants expressing WT SLAC1, SLAC1 S59A, S120A, or S59A/S120A under the native <italic>SLAC1</italic> promoter). In the revised manuscript we provide evidence that both of the phospho-sites are required for the full ABA response in vivo. These new findings also point to limitations of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte system (every system has its limits) and the relevance of our new in planta findings.</p><p><italic>Together with the limits of the artificial patch clamp experiments, the oocyte data do not entirely support the presented model. You concluded that both S120 and S59 have to be phosphorylated by OST1 and CPK6 synergistically to render SLAC1 active. Consequently disruption of one of the phospho-sites should result in an infunctional SLAC1 channel. However, this was not what was observed</italic>.</p><p>Using <italic>slac1</italic> complementation lines (<italic>slac1</italic> mutants expressing WT SLAC1, SLAC1 S59A, S120A, or S59A/S120A under the native promoter), now we provide unexpected and exciting in planta evidence that both phospho-sites are required for the full ABA response in vivo. Independent patch clamp and stomatal movement experiments show consistent results in the revised manuscript. These new findings also point to limitations of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte system (rather than the in planta data) and point to the relevance of our new in planta findings.</p><p>We also address the reviewers’ comment regarding patch clamp techniques further below.</p><p>In brief, patch clamping has led to the development of many aspects of present guard cell-signaling models that have been verified using many independent approaches and patch clamp techniques are not known to generate “artificial” models (not-with-standing that every technique has some limitation), in contrast to one of the reviewer comments.

The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (A to D in the revised manuscript) focus on ABA and Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation of S-type anion channels in guard cells. As requested by the reviewer, we have analyzed ABA-regulation of S-type anion channels in <italic>cpk5-1</italic> mutant guard cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1C-D</xref>). The single <italic>cpk5-1</italic> mutation does not disrupt ABA activation of S-type anion channels, supporting the functional redundancy model of CPKs.

These ion channels were not studied in our initial submission. These are described in more detail further below, and they further narrow the possible models for the ABA signaling cascade and thus add new relevant information that will be of interest to the reviewers. We note that we have done these Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel regulation experiments in two laboratories and both show the same results.</p><p><italic>2) The experiments in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>nicely complement data in the opening figure, but suffer from the same lack of specificity. Is it possible to measure the impact on calcium ion conductance in plant cells that lack individual ABL, HAB1 or PP2CA genes</italic>?</p><p>Previous research has shown that the dominant active <italic>pp2c</italic> point mutations in <italic>abi1-1</italic> and <italic>abi2-1</italic> disrupt ABA regulation of ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pei et al., 1997</xref>; Murata et al., 2001). However, since then no phenotypes in ion channel regulation have been reported for recessive single <italic>pp2c</italic> insertion mutants, likely due to redundancy in these <italic>PP2Cs</italic>. In addition, except for the dominant active <italic>abi1-1</italic>, <italic>abi2-1</italic>, and <italic>hab1G246D</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pei et al., 1997</xref>; Allen et al., 1999; Merlot et al., 2001; Murata et al., 2001; Yoshida et al., 2006), no strong stomatal phenotypes of single recessive <italic>pp2c</italic> knock out plants have been reported. These results further support the hypothesis that PP2Cs have overlapping functions in guard cells. Furthermore, reports showing that SLAC1 activation by OST1 and CPKs in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes is inhibited by the ABI1, ABI2, and PP2CA PP2C protein phosphatases support functional overlapping roles of these <italic>PP2Cs</italic> in ion channel regulation in guard cells.</p><p>Our study reveals that quadruple knockout of the 4 major PP2Cs in guard cell ABA signaling results in constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of S-type anion channels in guard cells. This finding shows that PP2Cs are an important mechanism that controls Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity priming in guard cells and identifies a first mutant that causes constitutively primed Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity in guard cells. These results also correlate with in planta stomatal responses and whole plant phenotypes of higher order <italic>pp2c</italic> mutants that show constitutive stomatal closing. We note that whether there are specific roles of PP2Cs in particular sub-branches within guard cell ABA-signaling remains to be determined and should be the subject of future research, given previous studies showing no strong phenotypes of single recessive mutations in these PP2Cs.</p><p><italic>3) The data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figures 3A and 3B</italic></xref> <italic>are interesting, but as presented are less than convincing. The statement in the Results section “Several calcium activated bands disappeared… consistent with CPK activities associated with these molecular weights” is important to the overall hypothesis tested in this article. However, the quality of the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figures 3A and 3B</italic></xref> <italic>is not sufficient to convince this reviewer of the validity of this statement</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that, given that there are 34 <italic>CPK</italic> genes in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome and these CPKs are widely expressed, visibility of these activities has limitations. To improve the visibility of these in-gel kinase activities from plant extracts, we now present a new figure showing a close up view of the bands corresponding to CPKs (MW 50-90 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). Reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated protein kinase activities are visible. Additionally, we edited and added text in the manuscript to describe these findings more cautiously. To test stimulus-triggered activation of SnRK2 and CPK kinases, in-gel kinase assays from plant tissues are commonly employed. To test the ABA-activation of CPKs we pursued a similar approach as done for the ABA-activation of SnRK2 protein kinase activity as described in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mustilli et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fujii et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yoshida et al., 2002</xref>). Another line of evidence, that the bands observed in the in-gel kinase assays are indeed CPK derived, is the activation of protein kinases in in-gel kinase assays by elevating the free Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration in the reaction buffer which was performed in a comparable manner in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boudoscq et al., 2010</xref> when analyzing pathogen responses of CPKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boudoscq et al., 2010</xref> Nature).</p><p><italic>4) The BiFC data presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>are interesting and well controlled. These findings suggest that SLAC1 and PP2CA directly interact, or do so in a proximity that permits formation of the fluorescent adduct. Given that the authors acknowledge that this protein-protein interaction has previously been reported there would be some merit in further emphasizing the new aspects of the binding event that are demonstrated in this new data. This pertains to the phosphorylation dependent regulation of the binding event. Can the phosphorylation sites be identified? Do phosphor-site mutants prevent protein association</italic>?</p><p>The experiments suggested by the reviewer are interesting. We show in our manuscript that the PP2C ABI1 physically interacts with SLAC1 in plant cells (not previously reported), similar to PP2CA-SLAC1 BiFC interaction (which was previously reported by Lee et al.). ABI1 and PP2CA rapidly de-phosphorylate the N-terminus of SLAC1 when previously phosphorylated by SLAC1-activating kinases (which also requires a physical interaction). We note that these PP2Cs dephosphorylate multiple residues in the SLAC1 protein and we feel that the reviewer’s hypothesis that the PP2C-SLAC1 interaction may depend on the phosphorylation status of these two key sites (see reviewer comments further below), goes beyond the scope and findings of our manuscript. In the revised manuscript we have repeated BiFC experiments and now show negative and positive controls as requested in other reviewer comments. Furthermore, we have conducted initial analyses using BiFC with site-directed mutations at these sites, as proposed and hypothesized by the reviewer, and have not found a complete disruption of the interaction. As mentioned above, we feel that the proposed model of the reviewer goes beyond the scope of our study and it would be preferable to investigate such a hypothesis using several independent techniques in the future and by investigating additional phosphorylation sites and additional PP2Cs. If deemed important, we could add the new experimental results to the supplemental data.</p><p>Furthermore, we have now generated in planta complementation analysis lines and completed in vivo patch clamp and stomatal response analyses. Interestingly, these data show that only when both serine 59 and serine 120 are simultaneously substituted with a non-phosphorylatable alanine (SLAC1 S59A S120A), no ABA-activation of S-type anion currents and ABA-dependent stomatal closure can be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G-H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6–figure supplement 3</xref>). This indicates that these 2 amino acids together are essential for the activation in planta. These new and relevant data are also discussed below in response to comment (5).</p><p><italic>5) The data in the final figure are more mechanistic and deal with some of the concepts that I have raised above. My reading of this section suggests that most of the electrophysiological measurements were performed in</italic> Xenopus <italic>oocytes. Can any of these studies be conducted in mutant plants? Performing this work in a more physiologically relevant cell type would be an important addendum to this interesting study</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting these interesting experiments. As requested, we have now completed generation of SLAC1 phosphorylation site mutant lines in the <italic>slac1</italic> background in planta and conducted patch clamp and stomatal movement analyses using <italic>slac1-1</italic> complementation lines expressing SLAC1 WT, S59A, S120A or S59AS120A under the native promoter (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6G-H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6–figure supplement 3</xref>). These experiments have taken time to complete, but the results are unexpected and of major importance for understanding in planta functions. The data unexpectedly demonstrate that phosphorylation of either S59 or S120 (together with other phosphorylated amino acids) is sufficient for ABA activation of S-type anion channels and stomatal closing in planta. However, if both S59 and S120 are non-phosphorylatable, no ABA-activation of S-type anion currents can be observed. Furthermore, we have conducted stomatal response analyses and have obtained results that also independently show these interesting findings. Together these data provide in planta evidence that Serine 59 and Serine 120 together are key amino acids during ABA-dependent S-type anion current activation and stomatal closing in planta. We have revised the manuscript to report these interesting findings. Moreover, as discussed later these findings show that models derived mainly from <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes are simplified compared to the in planta signaling network.</p><p><italic>6) The Abstract and opening sections of the Introduction are not well articulated. Major editing would be necessary to improve the clarity of these important sections</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment.

As we report the interaction of the phosphatase ABI1 with SLAC1, we chose a PP2AC5 protein phosphatase catalytic subunit as negative control. We also include a positive control verifying that the PP2AC5 is expressed and shows a strong interaction with its regulatory PP2AA subunit binding partner.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>Interpretations concerning the ABA primed Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>sensitivity of SLAC1 phosphorylation are based on guard cell protoplast data. The consensus in the field is that protoplasts are impaired in many normal cellular functions. The cytosol of cells is strongly diluted and evidence for degradation of major guard cell functions has been published. The experiments here are carried out following a preincubation of protoplasts with ABA. The authors can therefore not exclude that the ABA-signaling complex is established and solidified by ABA incubation and therefore the dilution prior to patch clamp measurements is weaker than in the absence of ABA. This scenario would lead to similar results, but would have nothing to do with ABA-priming</italic>.</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity priming of S-type anion channel activation has also been found in native guard cells as was cited in our manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Please also note that the original observations that led to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity priming hypothesis that stomatal closing stimuli enhance (prime) the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of downstream stomatal closing mechanisms were obtained in intact plant leaf epidermes from time-resolved Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging studies and stomatal response analyses with parallel intact leaf gas exchange analyses, a study in which no protoplast experiments were included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Young et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). Thus experiments in intact plants led to the original hypothesis and strongly support stimulus-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity priming guard cells.</p><p>Patch clamp studies using protoplasts might affect some guard cell functions (as for all techniques), but this approach has led to the present models of guard cell ion channel signaling and stomatal regulation without major inaccuracies, which have been supported and confirmed through interdisciplinary studies using several independent approaches. Thus we respectfully disagree with this comment regarding the “consensus in the field”, and have not been able to find such a “consensus” in the literature. Patch clamp studies in the present study allow us to evaluate in planta channel regulation under more well-controlled and well-defined conditions than reconstitution in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Moreover, all patch clamp experiments directly compare mutant responses (<italic>cpk, snrk2</italic> and <italic>pp2c</italic> mutants) with wild type responses and show strong and clear differences to the wildtype response that correlate with genotype-blinded stomatal movement analyses that do not use protoplasts here. Combined with biochemical and genetic evidence, our electrophysiological data provide strong evidence for newly recognized molecular mechanisms and a first genetic mutant that causes constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity priming in a plant cell.</p><p><italic>Wang et al., (2013, Plant Physiol.) showed that the ABA-insensitive ABA receptor quadruple mutant (</italic>pyr1/pyl1/pyl2/pyl4<italic>) displayed wild type like s-type anion current responses upon elevation of cytosolic calcium levels, contradicting the authors' hypothesis of ABA priming. Thus, calcium is sufficient for anion channel activation (without ABA priming). Moreover, reports from Chen et al., (2010, Plant J), Marten et al., (2007, Plant Physiol.), Stange et al., (2010, Plant J) and Levchenko et al., (2005, PNAS) illustrated that the ABA-signaling pathway is bifurcated: On one branch, ABA activates S-type anion channels without the need of cytosolic calcium elevations and on the other, ABA activates anion channels in a Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>dependent manner. These findings contradict the interdependence of both pathways and the priming of the guard cell calcium sensitivity by ABA as reported by the authors here. Even more importantly, the experiments by Marten et al., (2007, Plant Physiol.), Stange et al., (2010, Plant J) and Levchenko et al., (2005, PNAS) were conducted with intact plants and a minimal invasive guard cell impalement technique, simultaneously recording the rise in cytosolic calcium and S-type anion currents. Thus in intact plants the situation seems to be different from the protoplast system</italic>.</p><p>First <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al. (2013)</xref> do not contradict our hypothesis. External Ca<sup>2+</sup> shock evokes S-type anion channel activation and stomatal closure via a different mechanism from that of ABA as has been clearly reported in a number of studies. For example, a thylakoid membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing protein, CAS (Nomura et al., 2008 Plant J; Weinl et al., 2008 New Phytol; Han et al., 2003 Nature) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated vacuolar cation channel TPC1 (Peiter et al., 2005 Nature) are involved in external Ca<sup>2+</sup> shock-induced stomatal closure, but not ABA-induced stomatal closure. Ca<sup>2+</sup> has long been reported to be able to by-pass ABA signaling. The other publications described above by the review (Marten et al., 2007; Stange et al., 2010; Levchenko et al., 2005) were not conducted on defined genetic mutants but rather wild-type guard cells in <italic>Vicia faba</italic> and tobacco and thus did not genetically dissect the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent pathways. The reviewer also points out a bifurcated ABA signaling model. By isolation and analyses of higher order mutants in both of these pathways, we now demonstrate here for the first time that these two previously considered independent pathways are intimately dependent on one another and cannot be explained by the present simple bifurcated model. This is one of several major advances reported in our manuscript. Thus we respectfully and strongly disagree with the above comments of the reviewer.</p><p><italic>Physiological tests, such as gas-exchange or stomatal aperture measurements are lacking completely</italic>.</p><p>To address this comment and a comment of reviewer 1, we have completed stomatal movement analyses and added figure panels showing ABA-dependent stomatal aperture measurements using the <italic>cpk</italic> quadruple mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>) and impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced stomatal closing in <italic>snrk2.2/snrk2.3/ost1</italic> triple mutant epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The obtained results from genotype-blinded experiments provide in vivo evidence of the importance of CPKs in ABA signaling in intact guard cells. Furthermore, we have also completed stomatal movement response analyses with <italic>slac1</italic> complementation lines expressing SLAC1 phosphorylation site mutants. These studies reveal that both the S59 and S120 phosphorylation sites need to be mutated to disrupt ABA signaling in planta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6–figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p><italic>The authors used CPK or PP2C quadruple mutants as well as a</italic> snrk <italic>triple mutant in their patch clamp and biochemical studies to show their impact in ABA-dependent stomatal closure (SLAC1 activation). Since all of these ABA signaling components not only regulate the activity of SLAC1 but also are involved in other aspects of gene regulation, it would be important to show that the equilibrium/stoichiometry between phosphatases and kinases are not disturbed in the mutants. This could be circumvented with the SLAC1 phospho-site mutants S59, S120 and a double mutant thereof, introduced into SLAC1 loss-of-function mutants</italic>.</p><p>As described in response to Reviewer 1 (see above), we have performed patch clamp analyses and stomatal movement analyses using <italic>slac1</italic> loss-of-function mutants expressing SLAC1 phospho-site mutants. The new in vivo evidence expands our findings and shows that both phosphorylation sites (S59 and S120) need to be mutated in order to disrupt ABA signaling in planta. These interesting findings will influence and revise the present model derived in large part from oocyte studies.</p><p><italic>Why did the authors include CPK11 in their studies?</italic></p><p>We included CPK11 due to the high transcript abundance in guard cells and a reported ABA phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhu et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Geiger et al. 2010</xref>).</p><p><italic>In vitro kinase assays were performed to show that ABI1 and PP2CA do not inhibit CPK6 activity (although autophosphorylation was decreased). The authors should consider the activity of the recombinant proteins under the respective conditions. Why did the authors not see a reduction of CPK autophosphorylation when using the whole seedling proteins (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>, wild type vs. PP2C quadruple KO)</italic>?</p><p>Here, we would like to further explain the experiments performed to avoid possible misinterpretation of the results. To test whether CPK activity is regulated, four independent experimental approaches were conducted and are reported in the manuscript:</p><p>1) In order to test whether CPK auto-phosphorylation can be removed by PP2Cs, an in vitro kinase assays were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3–figure supplement 4</xref>). Here, the kinase was incubated in the presence of radioactive ATP to allow for auto-phosphorylation and subsequently the kinase was inhibited using an effective protein kinase inhibitor followed by the addition of the phosphatase. After that the proteins were separated by size and the radioactivity was monitored clearly showing that the phosphatases were able to remove CPK auto-phosphorylations in vitro.</p><p>2) The above experiment does not allow concluding whether removal of the auto-phosphorylated sites in the CPK regulates the protein kinase activity. To address this question we used a second approach: An in-gel protein kinase assay with recombinant proteins. Here, kinases were either incubated with or without recombinant PP2Cs (+/- <italic>non</italic>-radioactive ATP). After stopping the reactions the proteins were separated by size, re-natured and subsequently incubated in a reaction buffer containing radioactive ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 C-D</xref>). At this point, when the reaction takes place, the phosphatases and the kinases are immobilized, separated by size and cannot directly interact anymore which makes a direct de-phosphorylation impossible. The same applies to experiment 3.</p><p>3) Here, whole plant extracts were first separated by size and afterwards the reactions were carried out. Hence, the phosphatases were not able to directly interact with the kinases and not able to de-phosphorylate the kinases anymore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 A-B</xref>). We show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref> that in-gel CPK6 phosphorylation signals strongly decreased in a gel without the substrate Histone-III compared to gel in which the substrate is present can be seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>). Similar results were obtained in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boudosq et al., 2010</xref> studying the role of CPKs in pathogen responses. Therefore the in-gel kinase assays shown in this manuscript represent mainly CPK trans-phosphorylation activities and not auto-phosphorylation activities. That ABA-application to seedlings did not lead to electro-mobility shifts of CPK-derived bands indicates that in planta, the ABA-regulated phosphatases do not de-phosphorylate the CPKs in an ABA-dependent manner. To further determine whether indeed the de-phosphorylation of CPK auto-phosphorylations seen in experiment 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3–figure supplement 4</xref>) are not inhibiting CPK kinase activities we performed experiment 4.</p><p>4) Here, the ATP-consumption as measurement of kinase activity was measured, with the result that CPK6 ATP-consumption is not inhibited in the presence of PP2Cs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3–figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>We hope that the above mentioned explanations help to clarify our design of the experiments. Our biochemical findings reported in the manuscript are important for models of ABA signaling. Presently the simplest model that PP2Cs can directly down-regulate CPK activities is considered in the field, similar to SnRK2 regulation. However, this simple model had not yet been investigated directly until the above experiments. Here we show using multiple independent biochemical approaches that this simple model is not supported as the mechanism mediating ABA signaling. Moreover, our positive controls with the OST1 protein kinase show that the methods used are reliable. In the Discussion we also discuss why the more elaborate model that we uncover here may be very important for plant Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</p><p><italic>The authors used whole seedling protein preparations for comparisons between wild type and multiple mutants to show that PP2Cs control the activity of OST1 but not of CPKs and the interdependence of the Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>dependent and independent pathway. The major quantity of whole seedling protoplasts consists of mesophyll cells that act differently than guard cells when exposed to ABA. Moreover, SLAC1 and OST1 represent guard cell specific proteins and are underrepresented in whole seedling preparation. This is also true for other tissue- and stimulus-specific ABA-signaling components. Thus, the authors should be very careful in drawing conclusions from experiments with samples guard cells represent the minority</italic>.</p><p>Except for SLAC1 the ABA signal transduction module PYR/PP2C/SnRK2s as well as CPKs are not only found in guard cells (<italic>Arabidopsis</italic> eFP Browser, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi">http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi</ext-link>). There is ample literature that PYR/PYL, PP2Cs, OST1 and CPKs are involved several ABA-dependent plant responses outside of the guard cell such as seed germination and root growth. The seedling in gel kinase assays were designed and aimed to determine whether ABA-dependent PP2C regulation of CPKs is a general regulatory mechanism as it is shown for OST1.</p><p><italic>Heterologous expression in</italic> Xenopus <italic>oocytes was performed to finally show that OST1 and CPKs synergistically activate SLAC1 by phosphorylation. The authors claim that the phospho-site S120 is addressed by OST1 but not by CPK6/5/23 (already shown by</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31"><italic>Geiger et al. 2009</italic></xref><italic>) and that S59 is specific for CPKs (shown by</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12"><italic>Brandt et al. 2012</italic></xref><italic>) but is not a site for OST1</italic>.</p><p><italic>For the reader it is difficult to understand how the author can conclude that both residues have to be phosphorylated by OST1 and CPK6 synergistically to render SLAC1 active when after disruption of one of the sites SLAC1 can still be activated. It would appear that phosphorylation of one site is sufficient (perhaps in combination with other phosphorylation sites) to render SLAC1 active (S59 for CPKs and S120 for OST1). Moreover, the fact that CPK6 alone and OST1 alone, coexpressed as BiFC constructs, are able to activate wild type SLAC1 also would seem to contradict the authors' conclusion that SLAC1 phosphorylation by OST1 primes SLAC1 and that additional phosphorylation of SLAC1 by CPK6 (upon Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>increase) activates the anion channel</italic>.</p><p>We agree with points in this comment. As described earlier we have now generated and characterized in planta point-mutated SLAC1 complementation lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G-H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6–figure supplement 3</xref>) by performing patch clamp experiments and stomatal movement experiments. We have found that both S59A and S120A mutations together are required to disrupt ABA activation of S-type anion channels and stomatal closing in guard cells. These data also show the value of such experiments in guard cells compared to <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. We revised the text of the manuscript. In addition to these guard cell and stomatal movement data, we have pursued further <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte data that show that the additive effect is dependent on protein kinase activity of intact OST1 (non-split-YFP tagged) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2E</xref>). Our new in planta data also show some limitations of interpreting only oocyte data, even though oocytes allow important testing of models, as done in previous studies. We suspect that expressing high concentrations of protein kinases in oocytes may play a role (rather than too low protein kinase activities in oocytes as proposed by the reviewer). Meaning that expression of a high concentration of a protein kinase may well be able to activate the heterologous target protein via mechanisms that are not active in planta. This may not be surprising to some readers, but this limitation of oocyte experiments has not previously been demonstrated for the ABA signaling pathway and will add additional helpful information for the community. Thus in the present manuscript almost all electrophysiological studies are performed in guard cells and with direct comparisons of WT and higher order <italic>cpk</italic> , <italic>snrk2</italic> and <italic>pp2c</italic> mutants and parallel stomatal movement response analyses. In response to the reviewer comment and based on our new data we have re-worded the interpretation of the results in the manuscript and avoid over-interpreting data from oocyte experiments.</p><p><italic>When coexpressing wild type SLAC1 with both kinases the authors used very small quantities of CPK6 cRNA but 15x more OST1 cRNA. Only when suboptimal CPK6 concentrations were used, OST1 could enhance SLAC1 activation. This does not seem to prove kinase synergistic activation of SLAC1</italic>.</p><p>We carefully reworded the manuscript and took the latest results into consideration and have removed the term “synergistic” in this context to address this comment. We believe that expressing high concentrations of active protein kinases in oocytes may be more subject to possible problems rather than the low kinase concentrations used in these experiments. Note also that recombinant CPK6 protein kinase activity is known to be approximately 100-fold higher than recombinant OST1 protein kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brandt et al., 2012</xref>) and therefore higher OST1 mRNA levels than CPK6 levels were used). In either case, oocytes are a simplification of the <italic>in vivo</italic> system, as our manuscript demonstrates. Our manuscript investigates only specific linked aspects in oocytes, with all other electrophysiological experiments focusing on guard cells. Including such experiments has value for readers, given the relevance of oocyte studies to date. Our new experiments in guard cells also provide genetic evidence that oocyte-derived models, though powerful, have limits.</p><p><italic>Why did the authors use 400 nM Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>in the experiments shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1"><italic>Figure 3–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>, while for all other studies they used micromolar Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>containing buffers</italic>?</p><p>We used this intermediate free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>), in addition to 0.15 and 3 uM free Ca<sup>2+</sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), as it has been reported that 400 nM of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is enough to activate the CPKs in in vitro kinase reactions (Boudsocq et al., 2012; Laanemets et al., 2013). We thus report in-gel protein kinase data from plant extracts at three free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations.</p><p><italic>BIFC experiments are lacking proper controls (there is no negative control, e.g. CPK6/OST1 coexpression should result in a negative BiFC)</italic>.</p><p>We repeated the BiFC experiments and included a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As we show here the interaction of the phosphatase ABI1 with SLAC1 we chose a PP2A protein phosphatase catalytic subunit as negative control. We have also added a positive control for PP2A subunit interactions.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>Both reviewers agreed that you have addressed their major concerns, except for identification of the phosphorylation sites (see original point 4 of this reviewer below).

However, to our knowledge, significance of the other SLAC1 phosphorylation sites has not been analyzed in vivo. In this manuscript we demonstrate that in planta both Serine 59 and Serine 120 of SLAC1 are simultaneously required for intact ABA-dependent stomatal responses.
