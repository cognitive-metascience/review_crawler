In pluripotent stem cells, rapidly evolving KRAB-ZNF genes target TEs for silencing by H3K9me3. To investigate the evolution of TE silencing, we performed H3K9me3 ChIP-seq experiments in induced pluripotent stem cells from 10 human and 7 chimpanzee individuals. We identified four million orthologous TEs and found the SVA and ERV families to be marked most frequently by H3K9me3. We found little evidence of inter-species differences in TE silencing, with as many as 82% of putatively silenced TEs marked at similar levels in humans and chimpanzees. TEs that are preferentially silenced in one species are a similar age to those silenced in both species and are not more likely to be associated with expression divergence of nearby orthologous genes. Our data suggest limited species-specificity of TE silencing across 6 million years of primate evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Chimpanzee</kwd><kwd>Transposable elements</kwd><kwd>Gene regulation</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM077959</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilad</surname><given-names>Yoav</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EMBO Long-Term Fellowship/European Commission Marie Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 751-2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ward</surname><given-names>Michelle C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human and chimpanzee-induced pluripotent stem cells show limited species-specificity in transposable element silencing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over half of primate genomes are annotated as transposable elements (TEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jurka, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Koning et al., 2011</xref>). Primate TE sequences reflect their evolutionary history; some TEs are conserved over multiple phylogenetic clades and orders, whereas others are restricted to particular lineages. Considering the degree of sequence similarity between the human and chimpanzee genomes, it is not surprising that many of the same TEs are present in both species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ramsay et al., 2017</xref>). In general, TE activity, especially from endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), has declined in the hominid lineage relative to other mammalian lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lander et al., 2001</xref>). However, a fraction of evolutionarily recent TEs are active in the human genome, including HERV-K ERVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tönjes et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Medstrand and Mager, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fuchs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Klawitter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wildschutte et al., 2016</xref>), members of the Alu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batzer and Deininger, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batzer et al., 1991</xref>), L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kazazian et al., 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brouha et al., 2003</xref>), and SVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ostertag et al., 2003</xref>) families. Most studies on mammalian TEs have focused on humans and mice, with a handful that describe the ERV and L1 TE families in chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yohn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Marchetto et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Because of their transposition competence, TEs are considered a potential source of regulatory innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kazazian, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cordaux and Batzer, 2009</xref>). Indeed, TEs can serve as primate-specific regulatory sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jacques et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Trizzino et al., 2017</xref>), act as enhancer elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lynch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chuong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Xie et al., 2013</xref>), carry transcription factor binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourque et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kunarso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>), and contribute themselves to the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Faulkner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kelley and Rinn, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kapusta et al., 2013</xref>). The influence of TEs on transcriptional programs has been studied in many broad contexts from the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chuong et al., 2016</xref>) to pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lynch et al., 2015</xref>), to pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Macfarlan et al., 2012</xref>). Yet, ultimately, the regulatory impact of TEs has not been extensively studied at a genome-wide scale in a comparative framework.</p><p>Earlier work using a Down syndrome mouse model carrying a copy of human chromosome 21 showed that in general, genes on human chromosome 21 are similarly regulated regardless of whether the chromosome is in a human or a mouse cellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wilson et al., 2008</xref>). However, human-specific TEs become aberrantly activated (marked by H3K4me3) on human chromosome 21 in the mouse cellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Ward et al., 2013</xref>). It was therefore speculated that host repressive factors needed to properly silence these human TEs may be absent in the mouse nuclear environment, which is ~60 million years diverged from human. This suggested a relatively rapid evolution of TE silencing mechanisms, in line with the evolutionary arms race hypothesis.</p><p>Indeed, due to the potential deleterious effects of new TE insertions, especially in the context of developmental regulatory programs, TE activity is thought to be tightly controlled by host repressive machinery. In particular, it has been shown that in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), KRAB-containing Zinc Finger genes (KRAB-ZNFs) can recognize TEs in a sequence-specific manner, recruit the co-factor TRIM28 (also known as KAP1), and histone methyltransferase SETDB1 (also known as ESET), to effect silencing through the deposition of the repressive histone three lysine nine trimethylation (H3K9me3) modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Matsui et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rowe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Najafabadi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Turelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Friedli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wolf and Goff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schultz et al., 2002</xref>). After the establishment of TE silencing by H3K9me3, TEs are subjected to de novo DNA methylation, which persists in somatic and germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rowe and Trono, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Quenneville et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rowe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Smith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Karimi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Walter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bourc'his and Bestor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barau et al., 2016</xref>). Some TEs can evade detection by host KRAB-ZNFs by acquiring mutations. It was thus hypothesized that the host repressor mechanisms need to evolve rapidly in order to maintain genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kapopoulou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huntley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Thomas and Schneider, 2011</xref>).</p><p>TEs are silenced by KRAB-ZNFs particularly in early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chuong et al., 2017</xref>), their most likely niche for retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Richardson et al., 2017</xref>); however, it is difficult to obtain biological material from humans and other primates to determine how this process evolves. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a model of the cells of the embryonic inner cell mass to sidestep this challenge. This cell type is of further interest as we know of examples of primate-specific TEs that are not silenced, but actively transcribed and functionally relevant in this cell type in human (notably HERVH elements) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Klawitter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Santoni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fort et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wissing et al., 2012</xref>). This might imply specificity of TE regulatory mechanisms, and hints at the fact that evolutionarily recent TE sequence could play a role in differentiating gene regulatory networks between species.</p><p>The establishment of a panel of non-retroviral reprogrammed iPSCs from multiple humans and chimpanzees has allowed us to comprehensively characterize the extent of TE silencing in both species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gallego Romero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banovich et al., 20162018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burrows et al., 2016</xref>). In order to gain insight into how TE regulation, specifically TE silencing, evolves between humans and chimpanzees, we globally profiled the predominant output of KRAB-ZNF-targeted silencing mechanisms in pluripotent cells: the histone modification H3K9me3. Our goals were to identify inter-species differences in TE silencing patterns, characterize gene regulatory divergence that can potentially be explained by differences in TE silencing between species, and develop hypotheses regarding the mechanisms that underlie such inter-species differences in TE regulation. Our observations led us to conclude that, at least in our comparative iPSC system, differences in TE silencing do not drive substantial gene regulatory divergence between these two closely related species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To perform a comparative study of TE silencing, we characterized genome-wide distributions of the repressive histone modification H3K9me3 in iPSCs from 7 chimpanzees and 10 humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, Table 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

A read sub-sampling analysis indicates that we sequenced our samples to a depth that allows us to detect most enriched regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). In order to compare H3K9me3 enrichment across species, we focused exclusively on reciprocally best match orthologous regions in human and chimpanzee (see Materials and methods). We excluded from our data peaks that mapped outside those orthologous genomic regions (approximately 10% of the ChIP-seq data were excluded; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref> and Table 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We further filtered the data based on overall genome mappability, to exclude regions in which sequencing reads can be mapped to one species at a substantially higher probability than the other (using a cutoff of 0.8 in both species; see Materials and methods). We defined orthologous H3K9me3 ChIP-seq regions as those where a ChIP-seq peak, contained within orthologous human-chimpanzee genomic regions, was identified in at least one individual, regardless of species (see Materials and methods). We refer to this combined set as 160,113 orthologous ChIP-seq regions (rather than ChIP-seq peaks), because these regions are defined across all individuals, while the ChIP-seq peak may have been identified in only a subset of individuals.</p><p>The definition of ChIP-seq regions allows a quantitative comparison of H3K9me3 enrichment across species. We therefore calculated the number of sequencing reads that were mapped to each orthologous ChIP-seq region in each individual. By using this approach, we sidestep the difficult challenge of accounting for incomplete power to detect ‘significant’ ChIP-seq peaks in each individual or species independently. To avoid considering regions where we clearly have insufficient power to compare read counts across species, we included only the 150,390 regions with at least one read count in more than half of the individuals, regardless of species.</p><p>We considered overall properties of the read count data in the ChIP-seq orthologous regions. As expected, data from different individuals cluster by species (with the exception of one human individual, which therefore was removed from subsequent analysis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplements 9</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">10</xref>), and inter-species variation in read counts is somewhat greater than intra-species variation (Spearman’s correlation in human vs. human = 0.90, chimpanzee vs. chimpanzee = 0.89, and human vs. chimpanzee = 0.80, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplement 11</xref>). We then used the framework of a linear model with a fixed effect for species to identify orthologous ChIP-seq regions with differences in H3K9me3 enrichment between humans and chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, and Materials and methods).

We considered the ChIP-seq data in the context of the orthologous TEs, and observed that 12% of orthologous TEs (436,049 instances) overlap an orthologous H3K9me3 region with at least 50% of their length (denoted ‘overlapping’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>; we note that our subsequent conclusions are robust with respect to the specific cutoff used to classify a TE as overlapping with H3K9me3 regions).

We further categorized non-orthologous TEs into those that are only annotated in that species (defined as ‘species-specific TEs’; for example, SVA-E and SVA-F, which are only annotated in human; Table 6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Generally, we found that the same TE classes that most frequently overlap with H3K9me3 regions in the orthologous TE set, also most frequently overlap with H3K9me3 in the non-orthologous TE set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, within each species, the SVA and LINE TE classes show a reduction in the proportion of TEs overlapping H3K9me3 regions in the non-orthologous, and species-specific categories (p (SVA) &lt;0.001; p (LINE) &lt;0.001); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The magnitude of the effect differs between these two TE classes: For example, 85% of orthologous SVA elements overlap H3K9me3, but only 41% of non-orthologous SVA elements overlap the regions marked by H3K9me3. In contrast, 17% and 14% orthologous and non-orthologous LINE elements overlap H3K9me3 regions, respectively. In this case, the difference in effect size could reflect heterogeneity in silencing amongst the diverse elements within the large LINE class. We also found a reduction of TE and H3K9me3 overlap in human LTRs (p&lt;0.001), but an increase in H3K9me3 overlap with LTRs that are chimpanzee-specific (p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

As mentioned previously, our comparative analysis is not dependent on the identification of ‘significant’ ChIP-seq peaks in both species. Instead, we tested for evidence of differences in H3K9me3 read counts between humans and chimpanzees in all ChIP-seq regions. When we could not reject the null hypothesis (at FDR &lt; 0.01) that similar numbers of H3K9me3 ChIP-seq reads are mapped to orthologous TEs, we referred to the silencing status of these TEs as ‘shared’. We thus classified TEs into the following categories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) : (i) TEs that do not overlap with an orthologous H3K9me3 region (non-overlapping); (ii) TEs that are associated with similar enrichment of H3K9me3 in both species (shared); (iii) TEs that are associated with significantly higher enrichment of H3K9me3 in humans or (iv) in chimpanzees.</p><p>We observed that the proportion of TEs that overlap with H3K9me3 regions differs substantially across different TE classes (for example, 60% of SVA elements overlap H3K9me3 regions compared to only 10% of DNA transposons).

Indeed, while ultimately most TEs (88%) do not overlap H3K9me3 regions, when TEs do overlap H3K9me3 regions, they are generally (82% of TEs) silenced to the same extent in the two species. Our analysis includes hundreds of thousands of TEs that overlap H3K9me3 regions; thus even just 18% of TEs that overlap H3K9me3 and are silenced differently across species still comprise of tens of thousands of instances (53,201 TEs enriched for H3K9me3 in human, and 28,110 TEs in chimpanzee).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33084.021</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Majority of orthologous TEs may be similarly silenced in humans and chimpanzees.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The proportion of orthologous TEs in each class that do not overlap an orthologous H3K9me3 region (magenta), show similar H3K9me3 enrichment in both species (grey: Shared), are enriched in human (blue), or are enriched in chimpanzee (brown) are shown.

Yet, it is challenging to draw conclusions based on the inability to reject a null hypothesis of no differences between the species. We therefore used an alternative approach, based on an assumption of a unimodal distribution of effects (ashr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Stephens, 2017</xref>) to obtain a more sensitive estimate of the proportion of inter-species differences at different effect sizes. This unimodal assumption in an Empirical Bayes framework produces smaller (more conservative) estimates of the proportion of tests under the null through adaptive shrinkage. This test is therefore more sensitive to smaller differences in effect size across species. Using this approach, we again find a high degree of conservation in TE silencing, with practically all inter-species differences in silencing associated with small effect sizes (smaller than two fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s14">Figure 1—figure supplement 14</xref>).</p><p>Given the diversity of TEs within a class, we proceeded by considering a higher resolution classification of TEs to the 11 most predominant TE families representing each of the 5 TE classes, and then to TE types within specific families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). There is some degree of heterogeneity in inter-species silencing differences (‘effect size’) between different TE families (75–84% depending on the family; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We particularly focused on the LTR and LINE classes, given the previously reported association of these TEs with TRIM28-mediated silencing mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Turelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Castro-Diaz et al., 2014</xref>). Human LTRs are comprised of HERV elements which can be alternatively classified into Class I (HERV-F,H,I,E,R,W families), Class II (HERV-K), and Class III (HERV-L), based on the original retrovirus that integrated into the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">van der Kuyl, 2012</xref>). Using a subset of these HERV types curated by Turelli <italic>et al.</italic>, where the annotation is likely to be correct, we observed considerable heterogeneity in the frequency with which different HERV types overlap H3K9me3 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Notably, less than 20% of 2,079 orthologous HERVH elements, which are generally known to be expressed in pluripotent cells, overlap with H3K9me3 regions (compared to 80% of 3,484 THE1B elements, which are not known to be expressed in pluripotent cells, for example). This heterogeneity is also reflected in the proportion of TEs that are similarly silenced in the two species (55–95% sharing, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). However, the total number of elements within the more divergent TE types is small (fewer than 100 TE instances per category with less than 75% sharing). In contrast, when turning our attention to a subset of mammalian-specific L1 LINE elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Castro-Diaz et al., 2014</xref>), we found less variability in overlap with H3K9me3 across types (5–25% are overlapping; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). However, of those L1 elements that overlap H3K9me3, the majority (82% of 21,710 elements) are similarly silenced in both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). These results suggest that there is some degree of sequence specificity in the silencing mechanisms across TE types.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Silenced TEs tend to have similar functional properties across species</title><p>We next sought to identify properties that might distinguish TEs based on our silencing classifications (shared, species-specific, or not silenced). We first considered the length of a TE, which may relate to its transposition competency and hence need for silencing. On average, TEs silenced in at least one species are longer than those that do not overlap orthologous H3K9me3 regions (Wilcoxon-rank sum test; p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To confirm that longer TEs do not overlap H3K9me3 more often by chance alone, we artificially increased the length of the non-overlapping TEs to match the median length of TEs marked by H3K9me3 in both species. The artificially longer TEs do not overlap with H3K9me3 regions more often, suggesting that TE elements are silenced in a non-random manner, which cannot be simply explained by length in itself. We found the same pattern when we analyzed TEs by class, which in itself is associated with different lengths (p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, across TE families there is a strong correlation between the proportion of TEs that overlap H3K9me3 regions and the median length of the TEs in the family (Pearson’s correlation = 0.93; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). However, within families the median length of TEs that do not overlap H3K9me3 is highly similar to that of TEs that do (Pearson correlation for median TE lengths across families = 0.99; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), again suggesting that this is not a feature of length itself. When we stratified TEs by the magnitude of inter-species silencing divergence (absolute effect size), we found that shorter TEs are associated with higher silencing divergence (p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Put together, these observations suggest that longer TEs may be silenced more often because they are more likely to have unwanted regulatory potential, and are therefore more likely to contain sequences that recruit silencing machinery. This is consistent with the finding that more KRAB-ZNF proteins (sequence-specific mediators of TE silencing) bind longer TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Imbeault et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33084.025</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Majority of silenced orthologous TEs have similar properties in humans and chimpanzees.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The length of all orthologous TE instances occurring within Shared, Human-enriched and Chimpanzee-enriched H3K9me3 silencing categories.

This pattern is observed within the LTR, LINE, SINE and DNA TE classes (p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>), but this pattern does not hold within all TE families, as might be expected considering the diversity of TE types and families within a class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Across all TEs, we did not find a difference in sequence divergence between TEs that are silenced in just one or both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) but stratification of TEs by the magnitude of the inter-species silencing effect reveals that when inter-species differences in silencing are larger, the sequences of the TEs are more diverged from the consensus sequence (p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>We next considered proximity of TEs to genes by determining the distance between each TE and the closest orthologous annotated Transcription Start Site (TSS).

The majority of TEs, regardless of silencing status, are associated with chromatin regions annotated as ‘heterochromatin and low signal’. We found that TEs that are preferentially silenced in human overlap annotated regulatory regions less frequently compared with TEs that are preferentially silenced in chimpanzee (p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). We also considered published ChIP-seq and DNase I hypersensitivity (DHS) data in H1 hESCs. We found that a relatively small fraction of TEs overlap regions of open chromatin or ChIP-seq peaks: Less than 20% of TEs overlap active histone marks and less than 1% of TEs overlap DHS. We found that TEs that are preferentially silenced in human overlap regions of active gene regulation less often than TEs preferentially silenced in chimpanzee. The active chromatin annotations we considered include marking by H3K27ac, DHS, enhancer elements (marked by H3K4me1, p300) and regions marked by RNA polymerase II occupancy (for all comparisons p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>).

This observation is consistent with the general reported role of the H3K9me3 histone modification in gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bilodeau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mozzetta et al., 2015</xref>). The effect of TE silencing on gene expression is recapitulated when extending the window size to 20 kb, while TEs silenced within 1 kb upstream of the TSS have a stronger effect on gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We then asked whether inter-species differences in TE silencing are associated with expression divergence of nearby genes.</p><p>To obtain a quantitative measure of overall TE silencing in each species, we summed H3K9me3 ChIP-seq read counts from orthologous H3K9me3 regions overlapping TEs within 10 kb of annotated genes. We used the same linear model framework described above to estimate inter-species difference in H3K9me3 counts, within a 10 kb window upstream of the TSS. Of the windows that contain at least one orthologous H3K9me3 region overlapping a TE, 79% have similar levels of H3K9me3 enrichment in human and chimpanzee (3,523), with 11% of regions enriched in human (499), and 10% of regions enriched in chimpanzee (463), at FDR of 1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We then considered inter-species differences in expression levels for genes associated with similar or species-specific H3K9me3 enrichment at TEs.</p><p>We found no significant difference in the expression divergence effect size between genes associated with species-specific or shared TE silencing, using 10, 20 or 40 kb windows upstream of the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). We did find a weak, negative association between gene expression and silencing divergence when we considered silenced TEs that are located within 1 kb upstream of the TSS (only 165 genes in that set; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">4</xref>; Table 7 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). It is tempting to conclude that TEs (or silenced TEs) near the TSS can have a marked contribution to expression divergence; however, H3K9me3 enrichment in regions that overlap a 1 kb region around the TSS is similarly associated with expression divergence, irrespective of the presence of a TE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Our observations are robust with respect to a wide range of FDR cutoffs used to classify inter-species differences in silencing, suggesting that incomplete power is not a likely explanation for the overall lack of association between expression divergence and TE silencing (Table 8 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate the overall lack of association between silencing and gene expression divergence, we performed an analogous analysis, this time using gene expression divergence as the anchor. We found no association between silencing and inter-species expression divergence: genes that are classified as differentially expressed between humans and chimpanzees are not more likely to be associated with inter-species differences in H3K9me3 at TEs in their putative regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Again, we could only find a relationship between silencing and expression divergence when considering H3K9me3 overlapping TEs within 1 kb upstream of the TSS. The observation of no association of inter-species expression divergence and TE silencing is robust with respect to a wide range of statistical cutoffs used to classify either differential expression or differential silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5B</xref> and Table 9 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Indeed, when we considered the entire distribution, the correlation between inter-species effect sizes for gene expression divergence and H3K9me3 enrichment is weak (Pearson’s correlation = −0.0005 in a 10 kb window; the correlation in divergence increases somewhat to −0.14 when considering a 1 kb window upstream of the TSS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Moreover, we observed nearly as many genes whose expression divergence is consistent with the observed patterns of TE silencing divergence (namely, TE silencing associated with lower expression level) as those that show the opposite, inconsistent pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>We looked at the relationship between expression divergence and TE silencing more closely by considering orthologous TEs that are most likely to regulate neighboring gene expression. Specifically, we focused on the 532 genes closest to TEs that overlap either enhancer (marked by H3K4me1) or promoter (marked by H3K4me3) regions in human, and yet are silenced in chimpanzee (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). The results are consistent with our observations for the entire set. We found a relationship between expression divergence and silencing of TEs that overlap the promoter-associated mark but not of TEs that overlap enhancers (typically further from the TSS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>We next reasoned that perhaps TEs that are actively expressed in this cell type, in at least one species, are more likely to affect gene expression divergence. Indeed, TEs can be transcribed and contribute to lncRNA and neighboring gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ramsay et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Karimi et al., 2011</xref>). Using our RNA-seq data, we identified 11 poly-adenylated TE types that are expressed in chimpanzee, and 7 that are expressed in human (Materials and methods; Table 10A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; note that this approach does not allow us to capture non-polyadenylated transcripts such as eRNAs). In both species, we identified the expression of HERVH elements, which are known to be expressed in human pluripotent cells. Of the nine TE types that are annotated in both species and expressed in at least one species, 1,025 instances are contained within our orthologous TE set (Table 10B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and 123 instances overlap an H3K9me3 region. Only 14 of these TE instances are enriched for H3K9me3 in human, and 22 in chimpanzee (FDR &lt; 0.01). These TEs are proximal (within 10 kb) of only 19 orthologous genes. Thus, due to the small numbers we are unable to properly test the association between TE silencing/expression and gene expression divergence. In any case, even if there is such an association in these cases, the small number of instances suggests that gene regulation by an actively expressed poly-adenylated TE in one species is not a major mechanism of gene expression divergence.</p><p>Further attempting to find a relationship between TE silencing and expression divergence, we hypothesized that perhaps imperfect annotation of orthologous TEs may affect our observations. A clear association between silencing of non-orthologous TEs and gene expression divergence would provide some measure of support for this possible explanation. We thus performed a similar analysis focused only on the non-orthologous TEs. In this analysis, we considered non-orthologous TEs that are located 10 kb upstream of annotated orthologous genes. We classified the non-orthologous TEs as ‘silenced’ or ‘not silenced’ based on all H3K9me3 regions identified in that species (we did not require H3K9me3 regions to be orthologous in this analysis). We found, once again, that there is no association between TE silencing and expression divergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6—figure supplement 7</xref>). A significant effect is only consistently observed when considering a 1 kb window immediately upstream of the TSS (a set that includes 289 genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6—figure supplement 7</xref>). In other words, TE silencing by H3K9me3, regardless of orthology, has a modest effect on gene expression divergence in human and chimpanzee iPSC lines.</p><p>We next focused our attention on known mediators of TE silencing, the KRAB-ZNF genes, in an attempt to identify species-specific regulatory effects of TE silencing. KRAB-ZNF genes, in addition to directing the repression of TEs, are themselves marked by H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">O'Geen et al., 2007</xref>). We intersected a curated list of 256 KRAB-ZNF genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kapopoulou et al., 2016</xref>), filtered for orthology, with our list of orthologous H3K9me3 regions. We found that 104 (41%) of these genes overlap with orthologous H3K9me3 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s8">Figure 6—figure supplement 8A</xref>). The proportion of KRAB-ZNFs with similar H3K9me3 enrichment in both species (78% of overlapping genes or 81 instances) is comparable to that observed for TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s8">Figure 6—figure supplement 8B</xref>). 17 KRAB-ZNFs are enriched for H3K9me3 in human and 6 are enriched for H3K9me3 in chimpanzee. We found that the 256 KRAB-ZNF genes are no more likely to be differentially expressed between human and chimpanzee than all 17,354 genes (52% of KRAB-ZNFs are classified as differentially expressed and 49% of all genes; FDR of 1%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s9">Figure 6—figure supplement 9A</xref> and Table 11 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). There are 14 KRAB-ZNF genes whose TSS overlaps an H3K9me3 region that is enriched in human (eight) or chimpanzee (six). The association between silencing and gene expression divergence is consistent with the pattern we observed for all genes whose TSS overlaps an H3K9me3 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>) but due to the small numbers in each category, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s9">Figure 6—figure supplement 9B</xref>).</p><p>Finally, as H3K9me3 is not the only repressive histone modification in the genome, it is possible that we do not observe a strong association between silencing and expression divergence because there is redundancy in histone-based TE silencing mechanisms. To address this possibility, we considered genome-wide data from the Polycomb-repressed associated histone modification H3K27me3 in human H1 hESCs. We found that TEs preferentially silenced by H3K9me3 in chimpanzee are not associated more often with increased levels of H3K27me3 compared to TEs preferentially silenced by H3K9me3 in human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s10">Figure 6—figure supplement 10</xref>). This suggests that H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 are not redundant in silencing TEs across species.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The potential for TEs to participate in the regulation of gene expression has received increasing attention as genomic technologies to study these elements advance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davidson and Britten, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jordan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feschotte, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Göke and Ng, 2016</xref>). However, the role of TEs can be paradoxical. They can serve as regulatory sequence when they are bound by transcription factors, or localize in regions of open chromatin. Conversely, TEs can be actively silenced to prevent unwanted activity in a cell-type dependent manner. One cell type where TE activity can be particularly deleterious to genome integrity is embryonic stem cells. Indeed, it was found that TE activity is generally restricted through repressive histone modifications in mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schlesinger and Goff, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Robbez-Masson and Rowe, 2015</xref>). TE activity and regulation has been studied in many contexts, but there are no published comparative studies of TE silencing in primates.</p><p>In order to gain insight into how TE silencing mediated by the TRIM28/SETDB1 pathway evolves in pluripotent cells from the hominid lineage, we profiled the distribution of the repressive histone modification H3K9me3 in human and chimpanzee iPSCs. The rationale behind our approach is the expectation that TEs that are marked by H3K9me3 are silent and are therefore not mobile, nor able to act as regulatory elements in this cell type. In contrast, TEs that are unmarked and not silenced, could be expressed, or capable of transposition, or participation in gene regulation. Alternatively, these elements may have acquired sufficient mutations to lose the ability to transpose, or influence gene regulatory programs, and are therefore not silenced because they do not ‘threaten’ genome integrity. We were particularly interested in finding differences in silencing of the same TEs between species, as this could imply that these TEs act as regulatory elements in only one species, and could contribute to phenotypic differences between species.</p><p>We found that there are differences in the TE families that are preferentially silenced in both species. This suggests specificity of silencing and targeting mechanisms, which are shared in humans and chimpanzees. In our study, up to 60% of SVA, 50% of ERV, and 15% of L1 families overlap with H3K9me3 in both species. It is likely that TE silencing in our human and chimpanzee iPSC lines is mediated by the TRIM28 co-repressor as it is known to be involved in silencing ERVs in mouse ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rowe et al., 2010</xref>), and SVAs, HERVs and L1 elements in human ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Turelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Castro-Diaz et al., 2014</xref>). This specificity is likely achieved through sequence-specific KRAB-ZNFs that recruit TRIM28. Indeed, specific KRAB-ZNFs recognize specific TE families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jacobs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Imbeault et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schmitges et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While TEs silenced by H3K9me3 in both species tend to be less diverged from the corresponding TE consensus sequence than those that are not silenced, TEs that have large inter-species differences in silencing (more than twofold) tend to resemble TEs that are not silenced. This could imply that TEs whose silencing differs across species are less likely to require silencing, or that they are more likely to have enhancer function in just one species. Indeed, amongst TE-derived enhancers defined by CAGE in human, there is a depletion of younger, primate-specific TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Simonti et al., 2017</xref>). Assuming an evolutionary arms race model, one expects that TEs and their KRAB-ZNF repressors would co-evolve; indeed there is a correlation between the age of KRAB-ZNF genes and their target TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Najafabadi et al., 2015</xref>), and related KRAB-ZNFs bind related TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schmitges et al., 2016</xref>). However, the recent observation that many KRAB-ZNF gene – TE pairs arose at the same time during evolutionary history, and that this relationship is maintained to this day despite the fact that these TEs are no longer able to transpose, challenges the idea of a broad evolutionary arms race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Imbeault et al., 2017</xref>). In our study, we found silencing by H3K9me3 in TEs that are no longer transposition competent. It could be that these TEs are not silenced to prevent their mobility, but rather to prevent their potential regulatory activity.</p><p>TEs that are silenced in both species are located further away from the TSS than TEs that are silenced preferentially in one species. This difference between the ‘shared’ and ‘species-specific’ silenced TEs indicates that we do not have an overwhelming proportion of false negatively classified TEs in the ‘shared’ group. This observation also raises the possibility that TEs that are silenced only in one species are more likely to contribute to gene expression differences between species. However, we did not find this to be the case. Within species, genes with silenced TEs that overlap promoters have lower expression levels, on average, than genes with proximal TEs that are not silenced. Across species, inter-species differences in TE silencing are only associated with divergence in gene expression when the TEs are located in promoter regions, within 1 kb of the TSS. Further from genes, we focused on TEs that overlap enhancer regions, as Imbeault <italic>et al.</italic>, have shown that KRAB-ZNF gene-bound TEs only affect neighboring gene expression if the TE overlaps marks of enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Imbeault et al., 2017</xref>). In our data, however, we did not find such an effect.</p><p>Our observation of overall lack of association between TE silencing and expression divergence should be considered in the following context: First, while it is intuitive to relate a promoter to a gene, it is more challenging to relate a distant enhancer to the gene it regulates. Second, it has recently been shown that while many TEs contribute to primate-specific <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (CREs), many of these TEs act as transcriptional repressors and hence silencing of these elements may in fact lead to increased expression of neighboring genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Trizzino et al., 2017</xref>). Third, we did not investigate the functional consequences of sequence changes to orthologous TEs, so our results do not account for the fact that mutations in the sequence of TEs in one species may inactivate them, eliminating the need for histone-based silencing. Fourth, we have restricted our analysis to orthologous genes; it is possible that regulatory novelty co-occurs with gene novelty, though admittedly this is rare when the species considered are human and chimpanzee. Fifth, we were unable to interrogate silencing of recently active TEs, due to our stringent H3K9me3 ChIP-seq read mapping strategy, which excludes reads that do not map uniquely.</p><p>Overall, we identified tens of thousands of inter-species differences in silencing at individual TE instances; however, considering that there are roughly four million human-chimpanzee orthologous TE sequences in the genome, these differences account for a minority of elements (2%). Of the TEs that are silenced, the observed level of conservation of TE silencing in human and chimpanzee is in line with what is observed for all H3K9me3 regions in the genome irrespective of the presence of a TE. Conservation of active regulatory regions, determined by H3K27ac, in human and chimpanzee is also thought to be similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Prescott et al., 2015</xref>). It may be that even divergence at a small fraction of regulatory elements between human and chimpanzee – reflecting tens of thousands of instances – is sufficient to explain much of the observed divergence in gene expression levels. Yet, although we performed multiple analyses to uncover such a relationship, we concluded that, at most, inter-species differences in TE silencing have a modest effect on gene expression divergence in iPSCs.</p><p>We acknowledge that proving the absence of a species-specific effect is challenging. In general, it is difficult to draw strong conclusions based on the inability to reject a null hypothesis. Nevertheless, our observations are robust with respect to a wide range of statistical thresholds used to identify TE silencing or gene expression differences. Our observations should also be interpreted in the context of our initial assumption about what can be learned from characterizing TE silencing by H3K9me3 in iPSCs. First, while H3K9me3-mediated TE silencing is a well-established repressive mechanism in pluripotent cells, additional mechanisms of TE silencing exist; including RNA interference, CpG methylation and other repressive histone modifications such as H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Slotkin and Martienssen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Day et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Leeb et al., 2010</xref>), and thus our findings may not extend to these other silencing pathways. For example, Marchetto <italic>et al</italic>., showed that there is differential regulation of L1 elements by piRNA-associated PIWIL2 and APOBEC3B in human and chimpanzee iPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Marchetto et al., 2013</xref>). Pluripotent stem cells can be considered to be an usual cell type in many respects, including TE regulation. In these cells, TE activity is known to be regulated by a histone-based silencing mechanism following the global resetting of DNA methylation. While there are examples of this TE repression pathway in differentiated cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ecco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brattås et al., 2017</xref>), it is largely believed that DNA methylation replaces histone-mediated repression following the DNA de-methylation phase in embryogenesis. Therefore, alternative TE silencing mechanisms predominant in other cell types, such as DNA methylation, may be more dynamic across species. Similarly, one should also consider that the ability of TEs to act as enhancer elements has been shown to be cell-type specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Xie et al., 2013</xref>). Our results may therefore not extend to other somatic cell types, which are not under the same level of regulatory constraint as iPSCs.</p><p>Our results complement several previous studies, which explored the role of transposable elements in primate gene regulation. The primate-specific HERVH LTR element is a human pluripotency marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) and has been shown to have similar levels of expression in chimpanzee iPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ramsay et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, we find HERVH to be expressed in human and chimpanzee iPSCs, and to be depleted for H3K9me3, suggesting that this element is essential for the pluripotency network in both humans and chimpanzees. Many open chromatin regions in human are derived from primate-specific TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jacques et al., 2013</xref>), and newly evolved CREs are enriched in young SVA and LTR elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Trizzino et al., 2017</xref>). Trizzino <italic>et al.</italic> found that 2% of all LTRs are active (marked by H3K27ac) in liver but a quarter of genes with an LTR insertion affect gene expression divergence between multiple primate species, and that less than 1% of CREs are differentially active between human and chimpanzee. This suggests that while many TEs, specifically young TEs, are important for influencing inter-species differences in expression, the majority of TEs in the genome do not act as regulatory sequences.</p><p>When considering the broader context for the contribution of mammalian TEs to mediating inter-species differences in gene regulation, previous elegant work has dissected the role of specific TEs in inter-species differences between mice and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chuong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sundaram et al., 2017</xref>). TE activity is substantial in the rodent lineage compared to hominids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lander et al., 2001</xref>), which suggests that TEs can more quickly rewire regulatory networks in these species. Consistent with the reduction in TE activity in primates compared to other mammals, ChIP-seq assays for the highly conserved transcriptional insulator CTCF, have shown reduced TE-mediated propagation of CTCF binding sites in primates compared to other mammalian lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schwalie et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In summary, to date, there have been few genome-wide studies demonstrating the contribution of TEs to gene regulation in primates. TEs have been shown to comprise most primate-specific regulatory sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jacques et al., 2013</xref>), to contribute to primate-conserved non-coding transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ramsay et al., 2017</xref>), and lineage-specific gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Trizzino et al., 2017</xref>). More broadly, while gene expression differences between primates have been shown to often be associated with inter-species differences in histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cain et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), the chromatin landscape is generally highly conserved in primates. For example, as many as 84% of genomic regions enriched for the active histone modification, H3K27ac, are similar between humans and chimpanzees in iPSC-derived neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Prescott et al., 2015</xref>). Our results provide further support for the notion that chromatin state is generally highly conserved between closely related primate species. We have not found evidence that TEs, whether orthologous or not, have substantially rewired pluripotent stem cell gene regulatory networks between humans and chimpanzees.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Counts were quantile normalized across all samples, standardized, and log-transformed to generate gene expression levels expressed as normalized log<sub>2</sub>cpm.</p><p>To identify genes differentially expressed between the two species, counts were transformed by voom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Law et al., 2014</xref>) prior to differential expression analysis using limma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Smyth, 2004</xref>). We controlled significance at FDR &lt; 0.01.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Association between H3K9me3-mediated orthologous TE silencing and neighboring gene expression</title><p>We selected the annotated TSSs described above that correspond to orthologous genes for which we have gene expression data. We used the genomic coordinates of these annotations to define 1, 10, 20 and 40 kb windows upstream of the TSS. We then identified all TEs contained within each window, retaining the previous annotation of whether the TE overlaps an H3K9me3 region or not. Those TEs overlapping an orthologous H3K9me3 region had additional information in the form of H3K9me3 counts in each individual of each species. H3K9me3 counts in each orthologous H3K9me3 region overlapping a TE were summed within a window to yield a final H3K9me3 TE silencing count per gene per species. If multiple TEs fell within the same orthologous H3K9me3 region, this region was only counted once. H3K9me3 count values overlapping all TEs within a window was used as input for DESeq2 to determine inter-species differences in TE silencing per gene as previously described.</p><p>To determine gene expression divergence of genes overlapping H3K9me3 regions at the TSS, regardless of the presence of a TE, a 1 kb region around the TSS was created. All 141,642 H3K9me3 orthologous regions (irrespective of the whether the regions overlaps a TE or not) were overlapped with the defined TSS corresponding to orthologous genes. Genes where at least 50% of the length of the 1 kb TSS region overlap with an H3K9me3 region are considered to be overlapping the TSS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Effect of TEs within human H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 regions on inter-species gene expression divergence</title><p>To identify TEs with potential to act as regulatory regions important in mediating inter-species gene expression differences, a subset of orthologous TEs that also overlap a human H3K4me1/H3K4me3 region in the H1 hESC line were used. These TEs were assigned their closest gene based on the location of the TSS, and only unique orthologous genes were retained. Inter-species gene expression divergence was determined for these genes and compared to the divergence of unique orthologous genes closest to all H3K4me1/H3K4me3 regions in H1 hESCs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>TE expression</title><p>The expression of TE types was determined as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Karimi et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, multi-mapping, paired-end RNA-seq reads were retained for both humans and chimpanzees. RepeatMasker coordinates for all annotated instances of each TE type were obtained in each species. RPKM values for each TE type, in each species, were calculated by normalizing agglomerated read coverage of all annotated genomic copies of that TE type in the reference genome, to the agglomerated length of the TE type, as well as the total number of exonic reads. TE types were considered to be expressed if they had RPKM values &gt; 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Association between H3K9me3-mediated non-orthologous TE silencing and neighboring gene expression</title><p>In each species independently, we used all previously determined non-orthologous TEs annotated as overlapping or not overlapping any H3K9me3 region identified in that species. Non-orthologous TEs were overlapped with the 1, 10 and 20 kb windows identified upstream of each orthologous gene’s TSS as described above. To identify TSS positions in the chimpanzee genome, the 1 bp TSS annotations of orthologous genes determined in human were lifted over to the chimpanzee genome as previously described in the generation of orthologous TEs. Similarly, a 1 kb region around each human TSS was lifted over to the chimpanzee genome, and only orthologous single bp TSSs where the broader 1 kb region lifts over to the chimpanzee genome were retained.</p><p>Each gene was categorized as ‘silent’ if all non-orthologous TEs in the window upstream of the TSS overlap H3K9me3, or ‘non-silent’ if at least one non-orthologous TE in the upstream window did not overlap with a H3K9me3 region. Results are consistent if we further stratify categories of genes where upstream TEs are fully silenced (all TEs overlap H3K9me3), or non-silenced (no TEs overlap H3K9me3).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>KRAB-ZNF gene expression and overlap with H3K9me3 regions</title><p>To identify those KRAB-ZNF genes marked by H3K9me3, a curated list of 346 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kapopoulou et al., 2016</xref>) was filtered to include only those contained within our set of orthologous genes. These 256 genes were overlapped with orthologous H3K9me3 regions. KRAB-ZNF genes where 50% of their length overlaps with H3K9me3 are considered to be overlapping.</p><p>KRAB-ZNF genes where 50% of the length of a 1 kb region around the TSS overlaps with an orthologous H3K9me3 region were considered to be overlapping H3K9me3 at the TSS, and used in downstream gene expression divergence analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Data access</title><p>All data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>) under accession number GSE96712. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=sloxgksifvinnwr&amp;acc=GSE96710">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=sloxgksifvinnwr&amp;acc=GSE96710</ext-link></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Matthew Lorincz as well as all members of the Gilad lab, especially Sebastian Pott, for helpful and insightful discussions, and Amy Mitrano for performing RNA extractions and preparing sequencing libraries.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Christopher Brown (Reviewer #2); Geoffrey Faulkner (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript provides a comparative study of transposable element (TE) silencing in primates, profiling H3K9me3 using ChIP-seq in 17 induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from humans and chimps. The authors compare these profiles across the individuals and species to identify sets of TEs that are consistently and divergently marked between species. The majority of orthologous TEs are consistently marked in both species. The authors interpret this as implying that there are few functional differences in TE silencing between humans and chimps. They further support this conclusion by analyzing RNA-seq data from the same cell lines. They find no association between differential silencing of TEs and the expression levels of nearby genes. They also demonstrate that shorter TEs, older TEs (based on distance to consensus), and TEs closer to gene starts are more likely to be differentially silenced. They further demonstrate that differentially silenced TEs not associated with large differences in gene expression.</p><p>The manuscript is well written, the experiments are well designed, the analyses are well conducted, and the manuscript's conclusions follow logically from the presented analyses. The findings will be of significance to those interested in cis-regulatory evolution, gene expression, and transposable element biology. However, there are aspects of the analyses that would benefit from further clarification. In addition, we all agreed that the work needs a more balanced presentation of conclusions, as well as discussion of experimental caveats and discussion of alternative conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A more balanced presentation of the Results and Discussion sections</p><p>Throughout the manuscript the levels of difference in H3K9me3 at orthologous TEs between humans and chimpanzees are characterized as remarkably conserved. These claims would be much stronger if the authors could provide a sense of how much difference in the H3K9me3 profiles would be required to count as meaningfully diverged. For example, the read count correlations between species are lower than within species (Results section), and 11% (16,238) of tested regions are differentially enriched. From one perspective, that's quite a bit of divergence, even if only a small fraction influences gene regulation. Indeed, 66 genes with species-specific H3K9me3 within 1 kb or the TSS show differential expression. Couldn't 66 such genes be functionally meaningful, especially given the similarity of humans and chimps?</p><p>How much differential methylation/expression is necessary to count as significant? Repeatedly, statistics are presented that could easily be interpreted the other way. For example, in subsection “Majority of orthologous TEs are similarly silenced in human and chimpanzee”: &quot;Indeed, while ultimately most TEs (88%) do not overlap H3K9me3 regions, when TEs do overlap H3K9me3 regions, we are generally (for 82% of TEs) unable to find evidence that these TEs are silenced differently across species.” Equally one could read that as 18% of TEs (1000s of individual elements) being differentially silenced, right? This is a recurrent theme in the manuscript, that one could just as easily interpret this result the other way. Also, in subsection “Orthologous TEs tend to be silenced more often than species-specific TEs”: &quot;We considered the ChIP-seq data in the context of the orthologous TEs, and observed that only 12% of orthologous TEs overlap an orthologous H3K9me3 region with at least 50% of their length&quot; That's 12% of 4,248,188 (~500,000) right? That's a lot. Perhaps the issue here is an exclusive reliance on percentages rather than considering that the absolute number of elements involved is still very high, and that tends to disagree with the main message about TE silencing not being a major driver of regulatory innovation in primates.</p><p>2) Careful framing of the scope of the conclusions in the context of mechanisms which often silence TEs</p><p>The authors demonstrate that longer TEs are preferentially silenced. Why is this indicative of regulatory potential? What about being more likely to contain sequences that recruit silencing machinery? Have they performed a motif analysis or assessment of other genomic features? Are there features besides length, age, and distance to TSS that are associated with silencing of TEs? Open chromatin (available ATAC seq data), active histone mods (available), local TE density? Doesn't the fact that TEs that are further from the TSS are more likely to be silenced argue against the 'regulatory potential' hypothesis?</p><p>There are other means by which TEs are silenced. As the authors note, mutations to TE sequences commonly disrupt their activity and ability to influence transcription. Without accounting for sequence-level differences, it is challenging to interpret differences in the activity of orthologous TEs between species. For example, an orthologous TE may be inactive in both species while only marked in one due to an inactivating mutation in the other. This could account for the lack of correlation between H3K9me3 state and expression. Also, isn't it possible that the regulatory effect of the TE could be repressive, so silencing of the TE would not necessarily only lead to repression. Furthermore, as the authors note, these conclusions may not extend beyond the embryonic stem cell context.</p><p>Finally, the conclusion that TEs do not contribute to the regulatory divergence between species (e.g., in the Discussion section and other areas) is too strong given the data presented. The authors show that differences in H3K9me3 near the TSSes of genes do not strongly correlate with differences in expression between species. There are many other ways TEs could influence expression. In many cases, TEs have enhancer activity and differences in the silencing of enhancer TEs that influence expression would not be detected here given the focus on TSS proximal TEs. The authors could use enhancer maps to perform similar analyses of differentially silenced enhancer TEs or make clear that their analyses do not address this potential regulatory mechanism.</p><p>3) Address and clarify the technical concerns about the methods raised surrounding power, peak calling, TSS focus, and definition of orthologous peaks</p><p>For example, have the authors used their input data as a covariate in their differential silencing analyses? It is unclear as written. As written, it is unclear if peaks called in individuals are merged prior to differential expression analysis. If no merging was performed, are all DESEQ tests independent? The minimum read count threshold seems very low. Have the authors demonstrated that there is not substantial loss in power to detect differential histone modification at this low end?</p><p>Does this approach (Results section): &quot;We defined orthologous H3K9me3 ChIP-seq regions as those where a ChIP-seq peak, contained within orthologous human-chimpanzee genomic regions, was identified in at least one individual, in either species in our study (see Methods).&quot; exclude any regions that are polymorphic within chimp or human (I assume so).</p><p>The authors should note the caveat that using H3K9me3 as a mark of repression, whilst being reasonable, is not uniformly indicative of repression and, if other markers were used instead, some of the discordant TEs in chimp versus human may be concordant for these other markers.</p><p>Re: the use of sequence divergence from consensus scaled by mutation rate as an estimate of TE age. There are many factors that could confound this analysis, including differences in the mutation rate of different TE families and differences in mutation rate over different evolutionary epochs. If this metric is to be called age, I would want to see more benchmarking of its accuracy. How variable in this statistic for members of the same TE family and type? How does this accord with what we know about their periods of activity? Furthermore, Dfam provides estimates of the origin of all TE models based on their presence across different clades. Do the results hold when stratifying by TE origin? Otherwise, I would recommend reporting these results in terms of sequence divergence from consensus rather than age.</p><p>4) Better framing of these results in the context of somewhat contradictory studies</p><p>In the Discussion section, the authors should note more explicitly that their conclusions appear to contradict those made by several other studies in this area in recent years. For example, Wang et al., 2014 finds that LTRs are an essential part of pluripotency regulation in primates. Cordaux and Batzer, 2009 makes similar conclusions about L1. Jacques, Jeyakani and Bourque, 2013 suggests TEs are actually very important for regulatory innovation in primates. Considering how long the manuscript is, the authors should dedicate a section to, in a balanced and fair way, address why their findings are at odds with these other papers. I also do not think that anecdotal examples should be dismissed (e.g. &quot; Overall, while studies have shown the effect of TE derived enhancers on gene expression divergence at single loci (81), or tens of loci (23), genome wide effects on global gene expression divergence have been less clear&quot;), as these single locus examples can be important and instructive.</p><p>5) (Optional) The authors clearly demonstrate that most TEs are not silenced by H3K9me3 and that most silenced TEs are equivalently silenced in both species. I think it would be particularly interesting to ask a complementary set of questions: Are differentially silenced loci enriched for TEs? For species-specific TE insertions?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33084.053</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A more balanced presentation of the Results and Discussion sections</p><p>Throughout the manuscript the levels of difference in H3K9me3 at orthologous TEs between humans and chimpanzees are characterized as remarkably conserved.

It is important for us to note that this is more a matter of perspective than flawed interpretation. Our own perspective is influenced by the fact that in other comparative studies with similar (or often a bit smaller) sample size, 50% of orthologous genes can be classified as differentially expressed, and of those, 15-20% are also associated with epigenetic marker divergence between species (such as methylation and/or chromatin accessibility). Thus, given these numbers, 11% of differentially enriched TEs, and only 66 genes whose inter-species expression divergence can perhaps be explained by TEs, are relatively small numbers. That said, we accept the comment and we have softened the language in the main text.</p><p>Regarding power, we agree – that really becomes the most important topic when the main observation is that we are most often unable to reject the null. The effect sizes of the differences that we do classify are rather small, and studies of other histone modifications with similar sample sizes have identified a much larger fraction of diverged loci. We realize that this is not a direct answer to the question ‘how much difference would be required?’ but it is not obvious how to answer that directly. We discuss power considerations, and more specifically the challenge of studies that are unable to reject the null, in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How much differential methylation/expression is necessary to count as significant?

It may be helpful to understand the perspective from which the study was conceived to get a sense of our prior expectation. This project was inspired by our earlier work that showed that while genes on human chromosome 21 are similarly regulated between humans and a Down syndrome mouse model carrying a copy of human chromosome 21, human-specific TEs become aberrantly activated (marked by H3K4me3) on human chromosome 21 in the mouse (Ward et al., 2013). We speculated that this was due to the fact that the host repressive factors needed to properly silence these elements were absent in the mouse nuclear environment ~60 million years diverged from human. This suggested a rapid evolution of TE silencing mechanisms in line with the evolutionary arms race hypothesis.</p><p>We now explain this perspective more clearly in the Introduction and we present both percentages and actual number of TE instances to put this better into perspective – subsection “Orthologous TEs tend to be silenced more often than species-specific TEs” as well as other instances in the manuscript e.g. subsection “The majority of orthologous TEs are similarly silenced in human and chimpanzee”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Careful framing of the scope of the conclusions in the context of mechanisms which often silence TEs</p><p>The authors demonstrate that longer TEs are preferentially silenced.

Open chromatin (available ATAC seq data), active histone mods (available), local TE density? Doesn't the fact that TEs that are further from the TSS are more likely to be silenced argue against the 'regulatory potential' hypothesis?</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t think that ‘having regulatory potential’ and being ‘more likely to contain sequences that recruit silencing machinery’ are mutually exclusive (we make that explicitly clear in the text now). We reason that if old TEs had regulatory potential the host would have developed mechanisms to silence younger instances of these elements. Indeed, citation 73 shows that within certain TE families, elements bound by multiple KRAB-ZNFs (known TF mediators of TE silencing) are more likely to be longer. There seems to be concordance with our data in terms of the families affected. TEs silenced in both species suggests to us that these elements are robustly silenced and likely to be located within regions of heterochromatin, whereas elements that show species-specific silencing, or no silencing, are closer to the TSS suggesting that these elements may have regulatory potential. We have clarified the rationale behind our perspective in subsection “Silenced TEs tend to have similar functional properties across species”.</p><p>That said, the reviewers raise a good point about actually testing the potential for TEs to act as regulatory sequence and determining whether there are differences between TE silencing categories. We have added three extra pieces of analysis to address this. Firstly, we overlaid our TEs categorized by inter-species silencing status with chromatin states in human embryonic stem cells as defined by ChromHMM and show that (i) the majority of TEs are associated with heterochromatin/low signal and (ii) that TEs that are preferentially silenced in human overlap annotated regulatory regions less frequently compared with TEs that are preferentially silenced in chimpanzee. This analysis is presented in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 5 and is described in subsection “Silenced TEs tend to have similar functional properties across species”.</p><p>To gain further insight into the regulatory landscape associated with TEs in different silencing categories we overlaid our TEs with ChIP-seq and DNase hypersensitivity data in human embryonic stem cells. We found that a relatively small fraction of TEs overlap regions of open chromatin or ChIP-seq peaks: Less than 20% of TEs overlap active histone marks and less than 1% of TEs overlap DHS. We found that TEs that are preferentially silenced in human overlap regions of active gene regulation less often than TEs preferentially silenced in chimpanzee. The active chromatin annotations we considered include marking by H3K27ac, DHS, enhancer elements (marked by H3K4me1, p300) and regions marked by RNA polymerase II occupancy. Notably, there is no significant difference between TEs preferentially silenced in either species with respect to overlap with the active promoter-associated mark, H3K4me3. This analysis is presented in Figure 5—figure supplement 6 and described in subsection “Silenced TEs tend to have similar functional properties across species”.</p><p>As H3K9me3 is not the only repressive histone modification in the genome, we wanted to determine whether there is redundancy in TE silencing mechanisms. To address this, we overlapped our orthologous TEs with genome-wide data from the Polycomb-repressed associated histone modification H3K27me3 in human hESCs. We found that TEs that have less H3K9me3 in human are not more likely to be associated with increased levels of H3K27me3. This is presented in Figure 5—figure supplement 10 and is described in subsection “TE silencing is not a major driver of inter-species gene expression divergence”.</p><p>Finally, we determined the impact of TEs associated with enhancer and promoter histone marks on inter-species gene expression divergence. This analysis measures TEs’ association with gene expression slightly differently to what we did before (closest gene to individual TEs rather than all TEs in a window upstream of genes) and essentially results in the same pattern. We only see an effect of species-specific TE silencing on inter-species gene expression divergence when TEs overlap the promoter-associated mark, H3K4me3, which is in line with our previous analysis that showed that only TEs within 1 kb upstream of the TSS have a marginal effect. We don't see an effect when using TEs associated with the enhancer mark, H3K4me1, or in &gt; 1 kb windows upstream of genes. This is shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 6 and is described in subsection “TE silencing is not a major driver of inter-species gene expression divergence”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are other means by which TEs are silenced. As the authors note, mutations to TE sequences commonly disrupt their activity and ability to influence transcription. Without accounting for sequence-level differences, it is challenging to interpret differences in the activity of orthologous TEs between species. For example, an orthologous TE may be inactive in both species while only marked in one due to an inactivating mutation in the other. This could account for the lack of correlation between H3K9me3 state and expression. Also, isn't it possible that the regulatory effect of the TE could be repressive, so silencing of the TE would not necessarily only lead to repression.

This has been clarified in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Peaks were called in each individual and merged to generate H3K9me3 regions. Each individual of each species was used independently as a replicate in the DESeq2 analysis. This has been clarified in subsection “ChIP-seq”.</p><p>We presented two read filtering cutoffs in the original manuscript (based on a minimum number of individuals within/between species with &gt; 0 counts) as described above. The DESeq2 framework does not require pre-filtering as independent filtering occurs within the model. This is why the total number of tested regions is 141,642 not 150,390. A pre-filtering step increases computational efficiency. However, following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now included an additional analysis based on a minimum threshold of 2 reads in &gt;8 individuals and show that the percentage of differentially enriched regions is similar to less stringent pre-filtering (14% vs 11%).

Otherwise, I would recommend reporting these results in terms of sequence divergence from consensus rather than age.</p></disp-quote><p>While our approach to calculate repeat age by dividing sequence divergence by mutation rate has been used before (Bourque, <italic>et al</italic>., 2010; Ward*/Wilson*, <italic>et al</italic>., 2013), to eliminate the effects of potential mutation rate differences across TEs/TE families we now report our data as ‘divergence from the consensus sequence’ in the text in subsection “Silenced TEs tend to have similar functional properties across species” and in the Discussion section, Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Better framing of these results in the context of somewhat contradictory studies</p><p>In the Discussion section, the authors should note more explicitly that their conclusions appear to contradict those made by several other studies in this area in recent years. For example, Wang et al., 2014 finds that LTRs are an essential part of pluripotency regulation in primates. Cordaux and Batzer, 2009 makes similar conclusions about L1. Jacques, Jeyakani and Bourque, 2013 suggests TEs are actually very important for regulatory innovation in primates. Considering how long the manuscript is, the authors should dedicate a section to, in a balanced and fair way, address why their findings are at odds with these other papers. I also do not think that anecdotal examples should be dismissed (e.g. &quot; Overall, while studies have shown the effect of TE derived enhancers on gene expression divergence at single loci (81), or tens of loci (23), genome wide effects on global gene expression divergence have been less clear&quot;), as these single locus examples can be important and instructive.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-written much of the discussion taking into account all comments. We have elaborated on the particular studies mentioned and discussed how our study fits in. In most cases our study poses a slightly different question to previous studies and as such complements, rather than contradicts, earlier work.</p><p>Briefly, in accordance with Chuong, Elde and Feschotte, 2017 we show that primate-specific HERVH elements are expressed and similarly regulated in both human and chimpanzees, which suggests that this element is important not just in human but in at least two primate species. Marchetto et al., 2013 shows that there is differential L1 regulation between human and chimpanzee iPSCs and that this is due to a piRNA-mediated silencing pathway suggesting that different TE regulatory pathways may have different levels of cross-species conservation. Kazazian, 2004 looks at an active histone modification in primary liver tissue across multiple primate species and shows an enrichment of TEs in newly-evolved CREs. We have looked at a different cell type and histone modification in two closely-related primate species and therefore our findings do not necessarily contradict this study. Trizzino et al., 2017 show that 2% of all LTRs are active (marked by H3K27ac) in liver but a quarter of genes with an LTR insertion affect gene expression divergence between species, and that less than 1% of CREs are differentially active between human and chimpanzee. This suggests that while many TEs, specifically young TEs, are important for influencing inter-species differences in expression, potentially with large effects, the majority of TEs in the genome do not act as regulatory sequence.</p><p>We did not intend to be dismissive of single loci studies – we only meant to emphasize the difference between single loci and genome-wide studies. We have now revised the tone of the text and have recognized the importance of these studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) (Optional) The authors clearly demonstrate that most TEs are not silenced by H3K9me3 and that most silenced TEs are equivalently silenced in both species. I think it would be particularly interesting to ask a complementary set of questions: Are differentially silenced loci enriched for TEs? For species-specific TE insertions?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting complementary analysis. Given that the degree in overall similarity in H3K9me3 between species is similar to the degree of shared TE silencing between species we don’t suspect that this would give vastly different results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
