Surprisingly, conditioning results in new occupancy of <italic>BDNF</italic> chromatin by DNA insulator protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), which is associated with suppression of splicing in conditioning. Knockdown of MeCP2 shows it is instrumental for splicing and inhibits Tet1 and CTCF binding thereby negatively impacting DNA methylation and conditioning-dependent splicing regulation.

Loss of MeCP2 function in RTT leads to progressive neurological dysfunction including severe intellectual disabilities. MeCP2 binds to 5-methylcytosine (5mC) at CG and non-CG dinucleotides, particularly methylated CA, and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mellén et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gabel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kinde et al., 2015</xref>) across the genome. Mutations that give rise to RTT result in widespread misregulation of genes consistent with a role in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lyst and Bird, 2015</xref>). Additional mechanisms of action apart from transcription have also been proposed. Recent evidence indicates that MeCP2 also directly suppresses microRNA processing affecting dendritic growth and possibly neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). However, other functions are less well understood. One example is a role for MeCP2 in regulating alternative splicing.</p><p>Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs of active genes is ubiquitous in the eukaryotic genome. It is estimated that as many as 90% of genes are affected by alternative splicing and its importance in brain has recently received a great deal of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scheckel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). However, details of the molecular mechanisms that generate mRNA splice variants, under what conditions they are expressed in the nervous system, and the potential function of different protein isoforms are not well characterized. With respect to MeCP2 function, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Young et al. (2005)</xref> found that MeCP2 partners with the Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) that binds DNA or RNA and is involved in alternative splicing events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsumoto and Wolffe, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gonzales et al., 2012</xref>). More recently, MeCP2 was found to associate directly with other splice regulatory factors and, importantly, mutations in <italic>MECP2</italic> that occur in RTT disrupt these interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Long et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2016</xref>). These studies suggest that aberrant alternative splicing resulting from a loss of MeCP2 may be an important contributor in RTT. MeCP2 is a highly phosphorylated protein and mutations at phosphorylated sites cause RTT-like behaviors in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ebert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lyst et al., 2013</xref>). However, whether functions of MeCP2, including splicing abnormalities, would be evident at steady state or mainly in response to neuronal activity is, surprisingly, an open question.</p><p>To approach the question of whether MeCP2 may regulate alternative splicing under physiological conditions in an intact neuronal circuit, we exploited a neural correlate of eyeblink classical conditioning using an isolated preparation from the turtle brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keifer and Houk, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). The advantage of the preparation is that behaviorally relevant nerve-specific stimulation is used in a conditioning paradigm rather than non-specific stimuli such as glutamate application to induce a neural correlate of learning. Paired nerve stimulation evokes a behavioral, albeit ‘fictive’, physiological response that mimics features of conditioning in behaving animals. This model system allows the study of rapid learning-dependent epigenetic modifications in neurons that directly generate the learned behavior. We focused on the highly conserved growth factor brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<italic>BDNF</italic>) which is an activity regulated gene required for associative learning. The <italic>BDNF</italic> gene is an established target of MeCP2 in turtle as it is in humans and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amir et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bambah-Mukku et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ambigapathy et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>BDNF</italic> transcripts are alternatively spliced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aid et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pruunsild et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambigapathy et al., 2013</xref>). We previously determined that splicing of the <italic>BDNF</italic> gene in turtle (<italic>tBDNF</italic>) results in a 40 base pair (bp) deletion within the protein coding sequence that generates a novel truncated <italic>BDNF</italic> transcript (<italic>tBDNF2a</italic>) and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambigapathy et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, this intraexonic splicing event is regulated by conditioning such that splicing occurs in the naïve, untrained state and is rapidly and completely suppressed during training. Moreover, suppression is stimulus-specific. Splicing is inhibited by paired, but not unpaired, nerve stimulation and not by general increases in neuronal excitability evoked by application of glutamate or high potassium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambigapathy et al., 2013</xref>). The functional significance of this event in conditioning is, however, unknown.</p><p>The present study examines the role of MeCP2 in this <italic>tBDNF</italic> intraexonic splicing event and its rapid suppression during classical conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambigapathy et al., 2013</xref>). In naïve preparations, MeCP2 binds to methylated sites in DNA upstream of the <italic>tBDNF</italic> splice site to yield truncated <italic>tBDNF2a</italic>. During conditioning, the site undergoes dynamic loss of 5mC and 5hmC, MeCP2 dissociates, and <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> splicing is suppressed. We identify the splicing factor, YB-1, and surprisingly, the methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (Tet1) protein, in complexes with MeCP2 and show binding of all three to the same region of <italic>tBDNF</italic> in the naïve state. Furthermore, knockdown of MeCP2, YB-1 or Tet1 inhibits splicing of <italic>tBDNF2a</italic>. Demethylation and loss of MeCP2 during conditioning are correlated with binding of the DNA insulator protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), leading to the idea that CTCF suppresses splicing. These findings suggest a new perspective for understanding mechanisms underlying RTT; that MeCP2 loss of function generates unexpected secondary deficits in patterns of gene methylation that results both in aberrant binding by DNA regulatory proteins and in alternative splicing. Further, and importantly, we show that the deficits are exposed in a physiological learning-dependent context, conditioning, and not under steady state conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conditioning-dependent alternative splicing of <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> transcript is mediated by MeCP2</title><p>The vertebrate <italic>BDNF</italic> gene consists of a number of unique non-coding 5’ exons each having its own promoter that regulates a common 3’ protein coding exon with a variable 3’ untranslated region (UTR) that codes for expression of a preproBDNF precursor protein.

This deletion produces a frame shift resulting in an early stop codon and unique C-terminal end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Further analysis here using primers that spanned the site of the deletion confirmed that this was an unconventional splicing event within the coding exon.

By comparison, using cDNA as a template, two bands were obtained, one at 225 bp and a band that is 40 bp smaller at 185 bp.

However, after 15 min of conditioning all of the transcripts are significantly downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,C15</xref>) as was reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambigapathy et al., 2013</xref>). The <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> transcript, specifically, is nearly completely suppressed to just 8% of naïve values after conditioning which is shown quantitatively in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> (n = 5/group, p=0.001, N vs. C<sub>15 min</sub>). Since MeCP2 has been strongly implicated in alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Young et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maunakea et al., 2013</xref>), we examined whether an siRNA targeting <italic>MECP2</italic> affected splicing of the <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> transcript. We designed the siRNA based on conserved sequences from turtle DNA that correspond with human exon 4. The siRNA resulted in knockdown of total MeCP2 protein expression to an average of 59% of normal naïve levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, n = 4/group, p&lt;0.001). Significantly, bath application of the MeCP2 siRNA to naïve preparations resulted in substantial inhibition of the <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> transcript as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> (arrow) that was on average about 40% of naïve values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, p=0.001, N vs. MeCP2 siRNA). A scrambled negative control siRNA (Silencer #1, Ambion) showed no reduction in expression of the spliced <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> transcript compared to normal naïve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>, n = 2). Importantly, the other <italic>tBDNF</italic> transcripts, <italic>2b-d</italic>, were not inhibited by application of the MeCP2 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; n = 5/group, p&lt;0.05, N vs. <italic>tBDNF2c</italic>; p=0.43, N vs. <italic>2b</italic> and <italic>2d</italic>) showing that it was selective in reducing <italic>tBDNF2a</italic>. These data support our interpretation that inhibition of the <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> transcript after MeCP2 siRNA is by suppression of a splicing mechanism and not by transcriptional suppression. Together, these data provide strong evidence for MeCP2-mediated intraexonic alternative splicing of the <italic>tBDNF</italic> coding sequence in naïve preparations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Suppression of <italic>tBDNF</italic> splicing during conditioning involves demethylation and release of MeCP2 binding</title><p>Since MeCP2 mediated splicing of the truncated <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> transcript, we used bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) to analyze the conditioning-dependent methylation status of the <italic>tBDNF</italic> protein coding sequence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). A schematic illustration of the protein coding sequence shows the relative position of CG and CA sites whose methylation status is altered by conditioning; the region deleted by splicing is indicated by the green box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, upper panel). In naïve preparations, nearly all of the CG sites are methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, middle panel). After only 15 min of conditioning, they undergo active demethylation (F<sub>(1,82)</sub> = 63.8, p&lt;0.0001, N vs. C<sub>15 min</sub>) that does not occur following pseudoconditioning trials of randomly unpaired stimuli (F<sub>(1,82)</sub> = 0.15, p=0.70, N vs. Ps). We also observed that there are selected CA sites in the coding sequence that are either methylated in naïve and demethylated after conditioning (e.g., site 26, p=0.002) or methylated after conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lower panel, e.g., sites 27, 39, 40, 46, p&lt;0.01). Therefore, in addition to CG dinucleotides, CA sites in the coding region also undergo active conditioning-dependent methylation/demethylation in only 15 min. To evaluate whether demethylation has a causative role in cessation of splicing of the <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> transcript, we chemically induced demethylation by incubating preparations in the DNMT inhibitors zebularine or RG108.

Three sets of primers were used to survey the region, P1-P3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), whose relative coverage is indicated in the schematic diagram of the <italic>tBDNF</italic> coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The CG and CA sites covered by each primer set are also indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. ChIP-qPCR showed strong binding of total MeCP2 protein to <italic>tBDNF</italic> in the naïve state corresponding with splicing of the <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, 2a<sub>ON</sub>). This was observed in the region surveyed by primer set P1 which is, interestingly, upstream of the actual splice site. With conditioning when the coding sequence undergoes rapid demethylation, ChIP indicates a significant reduction in MeCP2 binding to just 4% of naïve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, n = 5/group, p&lt;0.0001, N vs. C<sub>15 min</sub>) that corresponds with cessation of splicing and suppression of the <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> transcript (2a<sub>OFF</sub>). During this time, MeCP2 was also observed to increase binding in the region surveyed by primer set P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, p=0.07) suggesting that it may be translocated to this downstream site rather than vacating genomic DNA entirely. These alterations in binding occurred even though levels of total MeCP2 protein were unchanged during conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; n = 4/group, p=0.50). Finally, ChIP-qPCR verified that MeCP2 binding was significantly reduced in naïve preparations exposed to MeCP2 siRNA to 35% of normal naïve levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, p&lt;0.001, N vs. siRNA) corresponding well with the 40% reduction in the <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> transcript after MeCP2 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These findings indicate that the <italic>tBDNF</italic> protein coding sequence is rapidly demethylated during conditioning resulting in reduced MeCP2 binding upstream of the splice site that corresponds with suppression of the alternatively spliced truncated <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> transcript.<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25384.005</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Primers used for ChIP and MeDIP assays of <italic>tBDNF</italic> coding sequence.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25384.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25384.005</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Target</th><th valign="top">Orientation</th><th valign="top">Sequence (5’→ 3’)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2" valign="top">P1</td><td valign="top">For</td><td valign="top">AGCCTAAGTGGGCCCAACAC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Rev</td><td valign="top">TCCTCAAGCAGAAAGAGCAATG</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" valign="top">P2</td><td valign="top">For</td><td valign="top">GATGCTGCAAATATGTCCATGAG</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Rev</td><td valign="top">TCAGTTGGCCTTTGGGTACTG</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" valign="top">P3</td><td valign="top">For</td><td valign="top">CAAATGCAATCCCAAAGGTTACACAA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Rev</td><td valign="top">TCTTATAAACCGCCAGCCAACT</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>YB-1 and Tet1 partner with MeCP2 and are required for <italic>tBDNF</italic> splicing</title><p>The DNA/RNA binding protein and splice factor YB-1 was previously reported to be a binding partner with MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Young et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gonzales et al., 2012</xref>). To determine if this is also the case in our model system, co-immunoprecipitations (co-IPs) of MeCP2 and YB-1 were performed. The results show a strong interaction of total MeCP2 protein with YB-1 in both naïve and conditioned preparations that was not altered by conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, n = 3/group, p=0.91).

Treatment of samples with DNaseI did not affect the co-IPs whereas treatment with RNase A inhibited it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Therefore, there is a strong interaction between MeCP2 and YB-1 that requires RNA. Evidence in favor of YB-1 involvement in splicing was obtained by using ChIP-qPCR. Since ChIP showed a significant relationship between MeCP2 binding to <italic>tBDNF</italic> and splicing in the coding sequence surveyed by primer set P1, we concentrated on examining this region for splice-related events. Like MeCP2, ChIP indicated that YB-1 was bound to this region in naïve preparations and was significantly reduced after conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, n = 5/group, p=0.02). Importantly, western blot data showed that the overall level of YB-1 protein was not altered after 15 min of conditioning compared to naive (n = 3/group, p=0.82).

Since Tet1 is actively engaged in this process, we examined its role in the regulation of <italic>tBDNF</italic> methylation status during splicing. ChIP-qPCR showed that Tet1 is bound to the coding sequence in naïve and dissociates after conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, p&lt;0.001, N vs. C<sub>15 min</sub>). Taken together, the ChIP data show that MeCP2, YB-1 and Tet1 are bound to a region upstream of the splice site in naïve preparations during splicing of the truncated <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> transcript and all three dissociate during conditioning when splicing stops. Interestingly, release of binding during conditioning corresponds with changes in histone modifications in the same region of the coding sequence that consists of significantly increased levels of H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, p=0.01) and reduced H3K27me3 (p&lt;0.01, N vs. C<sub>15 min</sub>), alterations that would lead to a more permissive, or open, chromatin structure.</p><p>Whether YB-1 has a direct role in splicing of the <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> transcript in naïve preparations was examined using a commercially prepared YB-1 siRNA.

Because MeCP2 also has a transcriptional function, control experiments were performed showing that the MeCP2 siRNA did not alter the overall level of YB-1 protein compared to normal naïve (n = 3/group, p=0.66). Importantly, we also observed that Tet1 ChIP was significantly reduced by application of MeCP2 siRNA to naïve preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, p=0.02, N vs. siRNA). This occurred even though protein levels of Tet1 were also unaffected by the treatment (n = 3/group, p=0.57).

Since BSP fails to distinguish 5mC from 5hmC, and to gain a better understanding of the methylation status of the <italic>tBDNF</italic> coding region during conditioning and after MeCP2 siRNA treatment, we performed methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) using antibodies selective for 5hmC.

These findings suggest that in conditions in which Tet1 function is compromised by MeCP2 siRNA, 5mC predominates in the naïve state in place of 5hmC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

CTCF binding is also modified by DNA methylation such that it is evicted by 5mC to control exon splicing in the lymphocyte <italic>CD45</italic> model gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shukla et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marina et al., 2016</xref>). To assess the possibility that CTCF may be involved in splicing mechanisms in the <italic>tBDNF</italic> coding sequence, a search of CTCF binding site databases was conducted (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.insulatordb.uthsc.edu/">www.insulatordb.uthsc.edu/</ext-link>). Predicted matches of <italic>tBDNF</italic> sequences with known CTCF binding motifs were found for three regions. The first was located within primer set P1 immediately adjacent to CG site 2. The second match was placed within the region surveyed by primer set P2, and the third was centrally located within the splice site itself in the region covered by primer set P3. Since suggestive positive matches were found, we first evaluated whether CTCF protein expression was modulated by conditioning. CTCF is highly conserved across species and migrates as a larger isoform at ~140 kDa in rat while the turtle protein is slightly smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Expression of the CTCF protein was observed to be regulated during conditioning as it was significantly increased to 168% over naïve values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, n = 5/group, p=0.001). To assess a direct role for CTCF in <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> splicing, expression of mRNA transcripts in naive preparations and those treated with a CTCF siRNA was examined. The siRNA was designed against conserved CTCF sequences in the turtle (nt 1187–1212) that resulted in a reduction in protein expression to 27% of normal naïve preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lower left panel, n = 3/group, p=0.001). Application of the siRNA to naïve preparations failed to have any effect on <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> splicing, as shown by the semi-quantitative data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lower right panel, n = 5/group, p=0.91, N vs. N CTCF siRNA). Interestingly, however, when conditioned preparations that normally suppress splicing were treated with CTCF siRNA, the <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> transcript was unmasked and splicing resumed at levels similar to normal naïve preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, p&lt;0.0001, C<sub>15</sub> vs. C<sub>15</sub> CTCF siRNA). These data provide compelling evidence that CTCF insulates DNA sequences from the splicing apparatus during normal conditioning thereby suppressing the truncated <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> transcript. This function was blocked by the CTCF siRNA during conditioning allowing splicing to take place. To provide additional support for our interpretation of splicing insulation, ChIP assays of CTCF binding to the coding region showed significantly increased signals within primer sets P1 and P3 during conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, n = 5/group; P1: p=0.002; P3, p&lt;0.05, N vs. C<sub>15 min</sub>).

The MeCP2 DNA binding region (surveyed by primer set P1) is upstream of the splice site (surveyed by primers P3). We hypothesize they are drawn into close proximity of one another by chromatin looping. In naïve preparations, DNA in the MeCP2 binding region is methylated with high 5hmC content maintained by Tet1 that colocalizes with MeCP2. MeCP2 recruits YB-1 that performs the splicing as the nascent transcript is elongated by RNAPII (Pol2) at the downstream leg of the loop to generate <italic>tBDNF2a</italic>. Upon conditioning, 5hmC is demethylated to unmodified C and Tet1 dissociates along with MeCP2 and YB-1. This is followed by new occupancy by CTCF that insulates DNA from further splicing thereby suppressing <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> during conditioning.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25384.009">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25384.009</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-25384-fig6-v2"/></fig></p><p>Finally, we tested whether MeCP2 siRNA has any effect on CTCF <italic>tBDNF</italic> binding as it did for Tet1 and YB-1.

Splicing donor and acceptor sites are used within the non-coding exons to generate unique <italic>BDNF</italic> transcripts. The functional significance of all of these diverse transcripts is not known. Notably, the human <italic>BDNF</italic> gene also codes for antisense <italic>BDNF</italic> transcripts that may additionally regulate transcript expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pruunsild et al., 2007</xref>) that may not be present in rat or mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aid et al., 2007</xref>), although this is debatable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Modarresi et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the mammalian <italic>BDNF</italic> gene may be regulated in numerous ways to generate multiple transcripts, not all of which are characterized functionally. Although the intraexonic splicing event described here in turtle is an unconventional one, internal splicing, although rare, has been documented in other genes from normal human and patient populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cox et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tran et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Madrigal et al., 2016</xref>) or rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ye et al., 2009</xref>). While the functional significance of the spliced transcript in turtle <italic>BDNF</italic> is unknown, it generates a truncated protein that has a pattern of expression opposite to mature BDNF protein during conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambigapathy et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting it may have a dominant negative function. In the present study, we use the conditioning-related intragenic splicing of the <italic>BDNF</italic> coding exon as a model event to characterize activity-dependent splicing related to MeCP2 function. Our evidence indicates that mechanisms regulating splicing, such as Tet-mediated DNA methylation and control of MeCP2-YB-1 and CTCF binding, are highly conserved and consistent with previous studies in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Young et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shukla et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maunakea et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marina et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>MeCP2 regulates splicing and DNA methylation status indirectly through association with Tet1</title><p>Recent studies have linked DNA methylation to mechanisms of alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shukla et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maunakea et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yearim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marina et al., 2016</xref>) and recruitment of MeCP2 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maunakea et al., 2013</xref>) in non-neuronal cells. A genome-wide analysis reported that gene body methylation and MeCP2 binding are enriched in alternatively spliced exons and that inhibition of methylation disrupts selective targeting of MeCP2 resulting in aberrantly spliced transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maunakea et al., 2013</xref>). Our results are consistent with this observation. One proposed mechanism for MeCP2-mediated splicing is that MeCP2 recruits partner proteins that slow transcriptional elongation permitting more time for recognition of splice sites by the splicing machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shukla et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maunakea et al., 2013</xref>). MeCP2 partners directly with splice factors including YB-1 whose actions directly result in pre-mRNA alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Young et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Long et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gonzales et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, accumulating evidence indicates that DNA binding by MeCP2 has a central role in splicing and is regulated by DNA methylation status. However, details of the underlying mechanisms are somewhat obscure and the activity-dependent interactions of MeCP2 with other DNA regulatory processes are scarcely characterized. During the <italic>tBDNF</italic> splicing event in naïve preparations, the MeCP2-YB-1 complex is bound to methylated DNA as is Tet1, as shown in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Since the MeCP2 binding site (P1 region) is upstream from the splice site (P3 region), we propose that chromatin looping brings the two regions in close enough proximity to functionally interact. In this configuration, as the nascent mRNA transcript is elongated by RNAPII it is spliced by YB-1 to generate <italic>tBDNF2a</italic>. The mechanisms underlying YB-1 recognition of the splice site and how splicing is coordinated along with production of the other full-length exon II transcripts are unknown. Upon conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), the <italic>tBDNF</italic> coding region undergoes demethylation, MeCP2 and partners YB-1 and Tet1 dissociate, and CTCF binds to insulate the splice site from further splicing. The interpretation that suppression of <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> during conditioning is by a splicing mechanism and not a transcriptional one is supported by data showing that the other three full-length transcripts (<italic>2b-d</italic>) are not inhibited by MeCP2 siRNA. Instead, their conditioning-induced downregulation is mediated by enhanced methylation of the exon II promoter and binding by the transcriptional repressor BHLHB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ambigapathy et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our findings further reveal that the interaction between MeCP2 and Tet1 is more complex than expected, and in this regard knockdown studies of each by siRNA are instructive. In the <italic>tBDNF</italic> coding sequence, both MeCP2 and Tet1 are bound at the same time in normal naïve preparations and both dissociate upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). The presence of high levels of 5hmC in naïve could explain why Tet1 ChIP shows strong binding even though DNA is methylated suggesting it may function to maintain the 5hmC mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hahn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kinde et al., 2015</xref>). Loss of MeCP2 in naïve preparations results in a reduction in Tet1 binding and levels of 5hmC in the coding sequence. A reduction in 5hmC with MeCP2 knockdown is corroborated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Szulwach et al. (2011)</xref>, but only for genomic loci in which 5hmC is dynamically regulated during development and not for those stably modified. They argued that stable loci might have redundant mechanisms using multiple methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) proteins that negatively regulate genomic 5hmC content (and presumably Tet binding) while dynamically regulated sites rely more heavily on MeCP2. Application of Tet1 siRNA, on the other hand, results in substantially increased levels of 5hmC, which has been observed by others using Tet1 knockdown in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, and importantly, in conditions of Tet1 loss of function, DNA binding by MeCP2 was significantly reduced even though levels of methylation were high. Therefore, inhibition of either MeCP2 or Tet1 negatively impacts the function of the other leading to the conclusion that, at least for splicing regulation of <italic>tBDNF</italic>, MeCP2 and Tet1 are critical functional partners. Additionally, our data show that Tet3, which is expressed in substantial levels in turtle brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ambigapathy et al., 2015</xref>), binds to <italic>tBDNF</italic> with loss of Tet1 and likely enhances the deposition of 5hmC that was observed. While we confirmed our previous result that MeCP2-Tet1 co-IP in naïve preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ambigapathy et al., 2015</xref>), preliminary findings show no MeCP2-Tet3 interaction (data not shown). Since MeCP2 <italic>tBDNF</italic> binding is reduced when Tet1 is replaced by Tet3, it is tempting to speculate that Tet3 does not recruit MeCP2 or may even repel it. The details of the MeCP2-Tet1 interaction remain to be fully characterized and may be different depending on their presence at gene promoters or coding regions, or stable and dynamically regulated genomic loci.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>CTCF protects DNA from splicing during conditioning</title><p>Our evidence indicates that a primary mechanism for splicing suppression is through conditioning-induced binding of the insulator protein CTCF. DNA binding by CTCF is repelled by the presence of 5mC while, in contrast, it preferentially binds to unmethylated C or possibly oxidized derivatives of 5mC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shukla et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spruijt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marina et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, CTCF colocalizes to DNA domains enriched in active histone marks such as H3K4me3 or H3K36me3 and is generally excluded from regions with elevated repressive marks including H3K27me3 or H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saldaña-Meyer and Recillas-Targa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2016</xref>). We observed significantly elevated ChIP for CTCF in two regions of the <italic>tBDNF</italic> coding sequence after classical conditioning surveyed by primer sets P1 proximally and P3 located more distally (and within the splice site). This enhanced binding was associated with DNA demethylation and a reduction in 5hmC. Significantly, suppression of the spliced <italic>tBDNF2a</italic> transcript that normally occurs during conditioning was blocked by incubation with a CTCF siRNA, returning it to splicing levels similar to naïve preparations. These data provide compelling evidence that CTCF insulates <italic>tBDNF</italic> from the splicing machinery during conditioning thereby suppressing the spliced transcript.</p><p>Although the exact mechanism underlying conditioning-dependent CTCF protection of the <italic>tBDNF</italic> splice site has yet to be characterized, several possibilities can be offered based on previous work of others. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shukla et al. (2011)</xref> provided evidence that <italic>CD45</italic> exon inclusion was related to CTCF binding and RNAPII pausing. They showed that decreased ChIP for RNAPIISer2 and slower rates of transcription corresponded with increased presence of CTCF which was thought to act as a physical barrier to RNAPII and allow more time for splice site recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luco et al., 2011</xref>). Our data showed no changes in <italic>tBDNF</italic> ChIP for RNAPIISer2 associated with CTCF suppression of splicing during conditioning. It is possible that CTCF has dual functions in regulating alternative splicing, through RNAPII pausing to promote it or by its insulator function to inhibit it. CTCF along with binding partner cohesin are also involved in chromatin looping that bends DNA located between paired binding sites of CTCF/cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2016</xref>). In consideration of the chromatin looping model, it is intriguing that two regions in the <italic>tBDNF</italic> coding sequence were observed to show significantly elevated CTCF binding after conditioning, a proximal region (P1) in which MeCP2-YB-1 binding/dissociation is correlated with splicing and a distal region (P3) located within the splice site itself. These may reflect paired CTCF/cohesin interactions required for loop formation that protects the <italic>tBDNF</italic> splice site from splicing. However, there are only 374 bp separating the P1 and P3 CTCF binding sites in the coding sequence and it is uncertain how short DNA loops occurring in nature can be or if short-range loops might be mediated by CTCF/cohesin. While loop or kink formation may be possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pasi and Lavery, 2016</xref>), whether these functionally insulate DNA is unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Impact of MeCP2 loss of function on DNA methylation and chromatin</title><p>MeCP2 protein is proposed to have a widespread impact on gene expression, both as an activator or repressor, chromatin structure, and alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Linhoff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lyst and Bird, 2015</xref>). Aberrant pre-mRNA alternative splicing is thought to be an important factor in generating the suite of abnormalities observed in patients with the neurodevelopmental disorder RTT and implicates MeCP2 in splicing mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Young et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bienvenu and Chelly, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maunakea et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>). MeCP2 was reported to interact with YB-1 and Prpf3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Young et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Long et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gonzales et al., 2012</xref>), and other splicing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2016</xref>), but its exact role and the ubiquity of its actions in splicing are not well characterized. The data here confirm that YB-1 is a partner of MeCP2 and shows that YB-1 participates in the splicing of a truncated <italic>tBDNF</italic> transcript that is regulated during conditioning by modifications in DNA methylation. We also confirmed that the interaction of YB-1 with MeCP2 requires RNA further supporting its role in splicing. Moreover, we observed in ChIP assays that depletion of MeCP2 by siRNA results in deficits in <italic>tBDNF</italic> binding by Tet1 and other proteins involved in splicing including YB-1 and CTCF. This reduction in binding occurred without any changes in levels of protein expression. The loss of Tet1 binding in MeCP2-treated preparations resulted in a functionally significant elevation in 5mC in the <italic>tBDNF</italic> coding sequence that would normally undergo conversion to unmethylated C during conditioning. This change in methylation status was accompanied by inhibition of CTCF binding during conditioning that can be attributed, based on the work of others, to its eviction by abnormally high levels of 5mC. This outcome would be expected to result in reversal of splicing suppression during conditioning similar to the naïve state. Interestingly, in MeCP2 null male mice, dynamically modified, but not stable, 5hmC loci were found to be significantly reduced compared to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Szulwach et al., 2011</xref>), consistent with our findings. Taken together, available evidence suggests that depletion of MeCP2 protein may alter DNA methylation status indirectly by preventing binding of other DNA modifying proteins, including Tet.</p><p>How loss of MeCP2 binding results in a reduction in Tet1 binding to the <italic>tBDNF</italic> gene is unclear. Evidence indicates that MeCP2 and Tet1 are binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cartron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ambigapathy et al., 2015</xref>) but the functional impact of this relationship has been largely unstudied. It is possible that MeCP2 and Tet1 together regulate the overall content of 5mC and 5hmC for dynamically modulated genes. Loss of MeCP2 destabilizes this regulatory process for control of DNA methylation across the genome. An alternative but not mutually exclusive mechanism relates to the view that MeCP2 is a global regulator of chromatin structure and may serve as an integral component of the chromatin architecture itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Skene et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2011</xref>). In our study, we observed that inhibition of MeCP2 severely depleted the <italic>tBDNF</italic> coding sequence of the histone modifications H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 that have a significant role in regulating gene expression. Therefore, loss of MeCP2 may affect learning-related <italic>tBDNF</italic> binding by regulatory proteins, including Tet1, through its action on controlling the accessibility of the surrounding chromatin structure. Along these lines, increased chromatin compaction observed in MeCP2-null neurons in vivo might restrict activity-dependent DNA regulatory mechanisms leading to a disruption in gene methylation and expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Linhoff et al., 2015</xref>). Further work on the activity-dependent regulation of MeCP2, Tet1 and DNA methylation will be required to resolve their interactions and functional consequences on gene expression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conditioning procedures</title><p>Freshwater pond turtles, <italic>Trachemys scripta elegans</italic>, of either sex were purchased from commercial suppliers and anesthetized by hypothermia until torpid and decapitated.

Agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation and the immune complexes were washed once with low salt buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl), high-salt buffer (500 mM NaCl), LiCl wash buffer (0.25 LiCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 1 mM EDTA), and twice with TE buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). Immunoprecipitated chromatin was eluted twice (1% SDS, 100 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) and 250 mM NaCl was added to reverse protein-DNA crosslinks by incubating the sample at 65°C overnight. The samples were further incubated with proteinase K (100 μg/ml) for 1 hr at 50°C. DNA was isolated using phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol followed by precipitation with ethanol, dried and dissolved in water. ChIP and input samples were amplified with <italic>tBDNF</italic> specific primers using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). <italic>tBDNF</italic> primers used for ChIP-qPCR are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. The qPCR was carried out by using SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The fluorescence intensity of each amplicon was measured by the Step-One Plus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Conditions for qPCR were 95°C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, and 60°C for 1 min. Data from ChIP were normalized to input DNA for each sample (△Ct = Ct(sample) – Ct(input)) and then further normalized relative to IgG control IP values (△△Ct = △Ct(experimental sample) – △Ct(IgG control)). The fold difference between the experimental sample and the negative IgG control was calculated by using 2<sup>(-ΔΔ<italic>C</italic>t)</sup> as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mukhopadhyay et al. (2008)</xref>. All reactions were performed in duplicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from brainstem samples using the Qiagen DNeasy mini kit. DNA was sheared by sonication (150–400 bp) and 4 µg of fragmented DNA was used for the assays. DNA samples were denatured in a boiling water bath for 10 min and set in ice for 10 min. DNA was precleared with protein A/G agarose beads for 1 hr at 4°C then the supernatant was immunoprecipated with antibody against 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (Epigentek, A-1018) or normal IgG for 2 hr at 4°C on a rotating platform. Immune complexes were collected by incubating with prewashed protein A/G agarose beads (60 µl) overnight at 4°C with rotation. The immune complexes were washed once with low salt buffer, high-salt buffer, twice with lithium chloride wash buffer and TE buffer. The complexes along with input controls were then digested with proteinase K at 50°C overnight. DNA was isolated using phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol followed by precipitation with ethanol, dried and dissolved in water. MeDIP and input samples were amplified with <italic>tBDNF</italic> coding sequence primers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) using qPCR as described for the ChIP assays.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Coimmunoprecipitation and western blot</title><p>Samples were homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, 5% glycine) with a protease (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitor (Sigma) cocktail. Protein samples were precleared with protein A/G agarose and supernatants were incubated in the primary antibodies or nonspecific rabbit or mouse IgG as a control at 4°C for 2 hr. Protein A/G agarose was added to the protein samples and incubated at 4°C overnight. Immunoprecipitated samples or IgG control samples were washed with ice-cold lysis buffer and dissociated by heating for 5 min in 2x loading buffer (4% SDS, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.004% bromophenol blue, 0.125 M Tris HCl, pH 6.8) and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. For all western blots and coimmunoprecipitation experiments both input protein and IgG controls were loaded at the same time. The same primary antibodies used for ChIP assays were also used for coimmunoprecipitation and/or western blotting. An antibody to β-actin (Millipore, 1501R) was used as a loading control for western blotting. Proteins were detected by the ECL Plus chemiluminescence system (Amersham) or the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences) and quantified by computer-assisted densitometry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>siRNA design and application</title><p>We designed two siRNAs targeting MeCP2 based on conserved regions of human MeCP2 mRNA (GQ896382.1) and the predicted amino acid sequence from the turtle <italic>Chelonia mydas</italic> (XM_007054052.1). The sense sequence for the siRNAs was 5’-UUGAUCAGGUAGACGUCGUACUUUCCC-3’ corresponding to human MeCP2 619–645 nt and 5’-CGUCACCGUGAAGUCGAAAUCGUUGGG-3’ corresponding to 722–748 nt both present in human exon 4. The two duplex MeCP2 siRNAs were synthesized and purified (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). The siRNA to Tet1 was designed to target sequences in turtle corresponding to human exon 4 which is exclusive to the Tet1 isoform and is described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ambigapathy et al., 2015</xref>). The YB-1 siRNA was purchased from a commercial supplier (Cell Signaling, 6206). The siRNA against CTCF was designed using the predicted amino acid sequence for CTCF from the turtle <italic>Chrysemys picta bellii</italic> (XM_005312256.2) targeting 1187–1212 nt and synthesized (IDT). The sense sequence was 5’-CCAGCAGAGAUACUUACAAACUGAA-3’. Finally, a commercially prepared scrambled negative control siRNA was also employed (Ambion, Silencer #1). The siRNAs were mixed with Lipofectamine RNAiMax reagent (Invitrogen) in physiological saline and bath applied to preparations for 24 hr. The final concentrations used were: MeCP2, 200 nM; Tet1, 150 nM; YB-1, 200 nM; CTCF, 250 nM, and Silencer #1, 150 nM. After the elapsed time period, preparations underwent the conditioning procedure and were processed for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed with StatView software using a one-way ANOVA followed by a Fisher’s LSD <italic>post-hoc</italic> test for paired comparisons or a Tukey’s <italic>post-hoc</italic> test for multiple comparisons.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors use an in vitro preparation from turtle to study the molecular mechanisms of BDNF regulation in a physiologically relevant conditioning paradigm. Previously the authors have reported the molecular characterization of BDNF transcription and splicing in this preparation, and here they explore how the methyl-DNA binding protein MeCP2 regulates an intraexonic BDNF splicing event both at rest and following conditioning. The data support a model in which MeCP2 recruits both the splicing factor YB1 and Tet1 to methylated regions of the BDNF coding regions under baseline conditions to promote expression of the truncated splice variant of BDNF. This complex is required for the conditioning-induced demethylation of BDNF, which is associated with induced binding of the insulator CTCF. Binding of CTCF is then subsequently required for loss of the truncated splicing event after conditioning.</p><p>The work is overall very well controlled and the reviewers are in agreement that the potential of the data to support a new model for how MeCP2 could control gene expression via alternative splicing is compelling. However, we had a vigorous debate over the significance of the particular splicing event under study, and some concerns were raised about the correlational nature of the serial knockdown studies. In the end, the reviewers agreed that the conceptual strengths of the manuscript outweigh the specific limitations assuming the following revisions can be made.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript must be rewritten to make the limited significance of the &quot;splicing&quot; event in BDNF more clear. To our knowledge, so far this kind of splicing event of BDNF gene has been described only in turtle and it has failed to be confirmed by RT-PCR in two major studies that examined BDNF splice isoforms in rodent and human. Furthermore, the biological meaning of this truncated protein isoform has not been studied. If the authors have data regarding the function of the truncated turtle BDNF protein it would substantially allay this concern if those data were added or referenced. However, if these experiments have not yet been done, we concur they are beyond the scope of the current study. In this case, substantial rewriting of the manuscript to make it clear that this particular splicing event serves to support the study of MeCP2 while backing off on the potential functional significance of the splicing, would be sufficient. The authors should also add a discussion of the implications that may arise from the species-specific nature of this splicing event. Specifically, what does this mean for the likelihood that the MeCP2 functions uncovered studying this regulatory process will be conserved in other species?</p><p>2) The authors need to clarify the model with respect to the direction of the splicing seen upon Tet siRNA. The authors show by siRNA that Tet1 recruitment is required for demethylation and demethylation presumably is required for CTCF binding. CTCF is required to inhibit the truncated splice variant with conditioning, however the authors also show that loss of Tet1 leads to loss of the truncated splice variant under baseline conditions. These findings do not fit neatly into a single model where methylation promotes the truncated variant by recruiting the MeCP2/YB1 complex. Does methylation of the BDNF gene change in the absence of Tet1? Does binding of YB1 to the BDNF gene change in the absence of Tet1?</p><p>3) Throughout the work, ANOVA with Fisher's (presumably Fisher's least significant difference) post hoc test was used for statistical analysis. The authors should justify the usage of Fisher's post hoc test, as it does not properly correct for multiple comparisons in case of more than 3 groups, and/or change the statistical analysis to correct for multiple comparisons where more than 3 groups are analyzed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;MeCP2 regulates Tet1-catalyzed demethylation, CTCF binding, and learning-dependent alternative splicing of the <italic>BDNF</italic> gene in Turtle&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors should also add a discussion of the implications that may arise from the species-specific nature of this splicing event. Specifically, what does this mean for the likelihood that the MeCP2 functions uncovered studying this regulatory process will be conserved in other species?</italic> </p><p>After careful consideration of these comments, we have added in response a new paragraph to the beginning of the Discussion entitled, “<italic>BDNF</italic> gene structure and splicing across species” addressing these points. First, the reviewers/editors are correct that the biological significance of this splicing event and the resultant truncated BDNF isoform is currently unknown and this has been stated clearly in the paragraph and throughout the paper where referred to. The function of diverse isoforms generated by splicing has, generally, not been well studied and this is particularly true for <italic>BDNF</italic>.</p><p>There was also a concern about species-specificity of the splicing event and underlying mechanisms as they relate to MeCP2. The diversity of the <italic>BDNF</italic> gene among species (humans and rodents) in both its structure and splicing is summarized briefly in the new paragraph. Although intraexonic splicing events are unconventional and uncommon, they are documented to occur in other genes in humans and rodents as we briefly discuss. Regarding the reviewer’s specific comment about failure to confirm intraexonic splicing for the human <italic>BDNF</italic> gene, to my knowledge this was shown by Pruunsild et al. (2007). They showed that coding exon IX was comprised of subregions “a, b, c, and d” that generated transcript variants made up of different combinations of the regions (pg 398 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> of their Results). We cited this information in our new text (subsection “<italic>BDNF</italic> gene structure and splicing across species”). However, if our interpretation of this finding as internal exonic splicing is incorrect, or if these data are unclear, the statement will be removed. The regulatory processes we have uncovered for the splicing event in turtle are, as documented in the paper, highly conserved compared to mammals. That is, Tet-mediated DNA methylation controls binding of MeCP2-YB-1 and CTCF in a highly coordinated manner related to conditioning. We now emphasize the point at the beginning of the Discussion that we are using this <italic>BDNF</italic> splicing event as a model to study mechanisms of activity-dependent splicing related to MeCP2 function.</p><p><italic>2) The authors need to clarify the model with respect to the direction of the splicing seen upon Tet siRNA. The authors show by siRNA that Tet1 recruitment is required for demethylation and demethylation presumably is required for CTCF binding. CTCF is required to inhibit the truncated splice variant with conditioning, however the authors also show that loss of Tet1 leads to loss of the truncated splice variant under baseline conditions. These findings do not fit neatly into a single model where methylation promotes the truncated variant by recruiting the MeCP2/YB1 complex. Does methylation of the BDNF gene change in the absence of Tet1? Does binding of YB1 to the BDNF gene change in the absence of Tet1?</italic> </p><p>To more fully clarify our model of splicing with regard to the Tet1 siRNA data, we performed additional experiments and have included them in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Additionally, in light of these data, a revised discussion of the MeCP2-Tet1 interaction is included.</p><p>New experiments on the mechanisms of splicing inhibition by the Tet1 siRNA are reported in the Results (subsection “Inhibition of Tet1 blocks MeCP2-YB-1 <italic>tBDN</italic>F binding and splicing”) and in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. In the absence of Tet1, methylation as measured by BSP does not change compared to normal naïve preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), but levels of 5hmC examined by MeDIP greatly increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This has been observed in studies of mammals using Tet1 knockdown (e.g., Feng et al. 2015, PMID 25774451). Importantly, we discovered that in conditions of Tet1 siRNA, there is substantial inhibition of MeCP2 and YB-1 <italic>tBDNF</italic> binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), which explains why splicing is blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Correspondingly, we also observed that when Tet1 is absent, Tet3 binds in its place. Therefore, the data indicate that MeCP2-YB-1 is inhibited from binding in the absence of Tet1, even though the DNA is methylated.</p><p>These data further illustrate the highly complex nature of the MeCP2-Tet1 interaction. To discuss this more fully, a new paragraph has been added to the Discussion (subsection “Impact of MeCP2 loss of function on DNA methylation and chromatin”). Here, we note that knockdown of either MeCP2 or Tet1 negatively impacts the function of the other suggesting they are critical functional partners. We conclude that together they may regulate the overall content of 5mC and 5hmC in dynamically modulated genes (subsection “Impact of MeCP2 loss of function on DNA methylation and chromatin”, last paragraph) and, in the case of <italic>tBDNF</italic>, regulate splicing.</p><p><italic>3) Throughout the work, ANOVA with Fisher's (presumably Fisher's least significant difference) post hoc test was used for statistical analysis. The authors should justify the usage of Fisher's post hoc test, as it does not properly correct for multiple comparisons in case of more than 3 groups, and/or change the statistical analysis to correct for multiple comparisons where more than 3 groups are analyzed.</italic> </p><p>All of the multiple comparisons were now corrected using a Tukey’s post-hoc test. Some of the <italic>p</italic> values were changed, but there were no changes in what was previously significant in the original manuscript. Paired comparisons (2 groups) were still made with the Fisher’s test. These changes are stated in the Methods for Statistical Analysis.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>[…] The authors have added a paragraph in the Discussion about splicing of BDNF in different species, including intraexonic splicing of BDNF coding exon in human.

(2007) is internal exonic splicing, it does not occur within the protein coding region. Therefore, in response, we have removed this statement entirely. We also removed the statement regarding the Aid et al. (2007) study since the extended transcription initiation site does not appear to be translated to protein. Additionally, some of the text in that same paragraph was edited for clarity (subsection “<italic>BDN</italic>F gene structure and splicing across species”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
