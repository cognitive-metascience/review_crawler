Basal epidermal progenitor cells divide parallel or perpendicular to the basement membrane to self-renew or produce differentiated stratified layers, but the mechanisms regulating the choice between division orientations are unknown. Using time-lapse imaging to follow divisions and fates of basal progenitors, we find that mouse embryos defective for the planar cell polarity (PCP) gene, <italic>Vangl2</italic>, exhibit increased perpendicular divisions and hyperthickened epidermis. Surprisingly, this is not due to defective Vangl2 function in the epidermis, but to changes in cell geometry and packing that arise from the open neural tube characteristic of PCP mutants.

By controlling the angle of the mitotic spindle, a cell can position its daughters to facilitate tissue expansion, establish multiple cell layers, or generate asymmetric cell fates. Two primary mechanisms direct the orientation of cell division: intrinsic cues that couple the mitotic spindle to cell polarity, and extrinsic factors that guide spindle alignment relative to physical or chemical cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">di Pietro et al., 2016</xref>). Although proper tissue assembly requires hard-wired spindle orienting programs to reproducibly build functional organs, cells also need flexibility to divide according to changing needs of the tissue. The mechanisms that ensure flexibility in spindle orientation during development are poorly understood.</p><p>The murine epidermis is a well-studied model to investigate the regulation of spindle orientation during development. The formation of the skin’s stratified layers, which serve as a barrier to protect the organism from its external environment, relies on oriented cell divisions. Unlike simple epithelia, which divide exclusively within the epithelial plane, cells of the innermost, basal layer of the epidermis divide in both planar and perpendicular orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Poulson and Lechler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smart, 1970</xref>). Perpendicularly oriented cell divisions generate one basal and one suprabasal daughter cell that goes on to differentiate and contribute to stratification of the tissue. Cell divisions that occur parallel to the epithelial plane generate two basal daughters, which facilitates tissue growth and expansion of the basal progenitor pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ray and Lechler, 2011</xref>). The ability of basal epidermal cells to conduct both types of division orientations is imperative for the proper formation and maintenance of the tissue. Too many perpendicular divisions can deplete the progenitor pool while too many symmetric divisions leads to defective barrier formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niessen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). How the balance between symmetric and differentiating divisions is regulated during formation of the epidermis is not understood.</p><p>During embryonic development, the epidermis transforms from a single layer of basal progenitors at E12.5 to a stratified and differentiated epithelium with barrier function by E17.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hardman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kulukian and Fuchs, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Muroyama and Lechler, 2012</xref>). Stratification occurs in at least two stages, an early phase between E13.5-E15.5 where oblique and perpendicular divisions produce the first few stratified layers, and a late phase at E16.5-E17.5 where perpendicular divisions and differentiation drive epidermal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smart, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). Intrinsic polarity cues orient these late stage perpendicular divisions through the spindle anchoring proteins LGN and Inscuetable (mInsc). Apical polarity factors including Par3 recruit the apical localization of mInsc, which induces the localization of GαI, LGN, and NuMA, a conserved protein complex that anchors spindle astral microtubules to the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Poulson and Lechler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). Surprisingly, these factors are not required during the early phase of stratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). What regulates division orientations early in epidermal development remains unknown. Moreover, the cues that direct planar division orientations in the epidermis have not been identified.</p><p>Because apical-basal polarity cues direct perpendicular divisions to drive stratification, we hypothesized that parallel, symmetric cell divisions might be oriented by planar cell polarity (PCP), which controls polarization along an epithelial plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butler and Wallingford, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Devenport, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Segalen and Bellaïche, 2009</xref>). In the epidermis, a conserved set of PCP components including the transmembrane proteins Celsr1, Frizzled-6 (Fz6) and Van Gogh-like 2 (Vangl2), localize to basolateral cell junctions preferentially along anterior-posterior edges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aw et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Devenport and Fuchs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Devenport et al., 2011</xref>). PCP protein asymmetry coincides with the onset of stratification, and we had previously noted that embryos harboring a homozygous point mutation in the <italic>Vangl2</italic> gene (called <italic>Looptail (Lp); Vangl2<sup>Lp/Lp</sup></italic>) display increased epidermal thickness, suggesting a role for PCP in planar division orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Devenport and Fuchs, 2008</xref>). However, the cellular basis of this epidermal thickening and its emergence over time had not previously been investigated.</p><p>Using live imaging to trace the orientation and positional fate of basal cell divisions, we investigate the function of PCP and tissue mechanics early in epidermal stratification. In agreement with the hypothesis that PCP promotes planar basal cell divisions, we find that Vangl2 mutant embryos display an increased proportion of stratifying divisions at the expense of planar divisions. Unexpectedly, this is not a direct result of defective PCP; rather, we show that failure of the epidermis to close over the neural tube in these mutants leads to cell crowding within the basal layer, concomitant with changes in cell width and height and a higher frequency of asymmetric cell divisions. Combining our live imaging approach with tissue-specific genetic perturbations and mechanical tissue manipulations, we show that early in epidermal development, interphase 3D cell geometry and packing, rather than cortical PCP cues, influence mitotic spindle orientation. Although it is well established that cell divisions align with the interphase long axis in two dimensions, our data show that this mechanism can also impact spindle alignment in the third, apical-basal dimension in a stratifying epithelium. We propose that by responding to changes in cell density and shape, basal cell division orientations can adjust to satisfy the needs of the tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Basal progenitor cells in <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp/Lp</sup></italic> embryos undergo fewer planar cell divisions</title><p>The relationship between division orientation and epidermal stratification has been primarily inferred from observations made in fixed tissue sections. This method comes with some key disadvantages: it excludes divisions oriented orthogonal to the plane of sectioning and does not allow one to directly correlate mitotic spindle alignment with the final positions of daughter cells. To overcome these limitations, we performed time-lapse imaging of live, flat mounted skin explants expressing a nuclear marker, K14-H2B-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tumbar et al., 2004</xref>), which allowed us to observe cell divisions dynamically in three-dimensional space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). Z-stacks were captured every 10 min over approximately 8 hours of epidermal development, and division planes were quantified by measuring the angle between the centroids of the two daughter nuclei during telophase. Divisions were categorized as planar (Θ&lt;=20°), oblique (20&lt;Θ&lt;=70°) or perpendicular (70°&gt;Θ&gt;=90°) depending on their orientation relative to the plane of the basal layer. Interestingly, chromatids that were aligned along the metaphase plate continued to rotate prior to separating at anaphase/telophase. Because of this instability in spindle alignment during metaphase, division planes were measured only after chromatid separation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47102.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Basal cell division orientations in wildtype and Vangl2 mutant embryos.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of E14.5 skin depicting several planar cell polarity components and example division orientations.

Consistent with previous reports, we observed a strong bias toward planar division orientations in wildtype embryos at E13.5 when the epithelium is predominantly comprised of a single layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). At E15.5 and E16.5, the proportion of oblique and perpendicular divisions increased, coinciding with the expansion of stratified epidermal layers. However, our data show a much higher proportion of planar and oblique divisions at E16.5 compared to prior reports, which we attribute to differences in observing divisions in whole mount versus sagittal tissue sections, as planar and oblique divisions that align out of the plane of sectioning are likely to go uncounted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asare et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luxenburg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niessen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Poulson and Lechler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, Vangl2 mutant embryos displayed elevated oblique and perpendicular divisions at E13.5 and E14.5 but not at later embryonic stages, suggesting the requirement for PCP function in promoting planar divisions is restricted to an early developmental window of time corresponding to the onset of epidermal stratification.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Division plane is a strong predictor of the positional fate of daughter cells</title><p>After each cell division in the epidermis, the final fates and positions of the two daughter cells influence the stratified architecture of the developing skin. Daughter cells with suprabasal positioning differentiate and contribute to the skin’s upper stratified layers. Daughters with basal positioning retain progenitor fate and continue to divide. Previously, the fates of daughter cells were inferred by their division planes as measured in fixed tissue sections. To directly assess how a basal cell’s division plane relates to its positional fate within the tissue, we employed our live imaging system to track recently divided cells and assign each cell a final positional fate. Fates were defined as symmetric when both daughter cells remained in the basal layer for at least 1.5 hr following division. Asymmetric fates were scored when one daughter cell remained basal while the other cell moved suprabasally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). We found that in wildtype embryos at E14.5 division orientation and cell fate were tightly linked. For example, 94% of cells that divided within 20 degrees of the epithelial plane adopted symmetric fates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, blue points). Similarly, 89% of cells that divided within 70–90 degrees of the plane adopted asymmetric fates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, green points).

These components serve to position the mitotic spindle to promote perpendicular, asymmetric basal cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). We reasoned that PCP factors might recruit these components to the lateral cortex to orient planar divisions, and that a failure of LGN to localize laterally might explain the increased oblique and perpendicular divisions observed in Vangl2 mutants. After confirming prior reports of apical LGN localization in cells with perpendicularly-oriented spindles at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we characterized the localization of this protein in dividing cells at E14.5. At this earlier stage, we observed apical LGN in a subset of cells undergoing oblique and perpendicular divisions. However, in cells undergoing planar divisions, LGN exhibited lateral localization in only 14% of cells, and was most frequently undetectable (61% of planar divisions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). These patterns of LGN localization are consistent with those previously observed in thin tissue sections by Williams et al. together with the observation that LGN knockdown leads to an increase in planar divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams et al., 2014</xref>), these data suggest that this spindle-orienting pathway is not the primary mechanism promoting planar basal cell divisions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47102.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>LGN localization does not determine planar division orientation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Examples from <italic>Vangl2<sup>WT</sup></italic> embryos of cells dividing in a planar orientation with unilateral (left) and absent (right) LGN localization.

Hertwig’s rule, also known as the ‘long axis rule’, states that a cell is most likely to divide along its longest interphase axis, and has been observed in many cell types dividing within a two-dimensional plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosveld et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Théry and Bornens, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Théry et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wyatt et al., 2015</xref>). In the epidermis, where basal cells divide in three-dimensional space, a cell’s longest axis may lie perpendicular to the epithelial plane, which could promote perpendicular spindle alignment and asymmetric division. Indeed, the perpendicular divisions of early <italic>Xenopus</italic> and zebrafish embryos have been shown to divide according to a three-dimensional long-axis rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chalmers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xiong et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, we noted that basal cells appeared taller and narrower in Vangl2 mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which, according to Hertwig’s rule, might account for the observed increase in asymmetric divisions. To test this idea we first quantified basal cell area and height in fixed whole mount explants from E14.5 wildtype and <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp/Lp</sup></italic> embryos. Compared to <italic>Vangl2<sup>WT</sup></italic> embryos, basal cells in <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp/Lp</sup></italic> mutants were significantly smaller in cross-sectional area along the planar axis and taller along the apical-basal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). This increase in height:width ratio was not accompanied by changes in the number of neighbors, as <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp/Lp</sup></italic> and wildtype embryos displayed a similar distribution of cells with 4,5,6,7, and eight edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Basal cells in <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp/Lp</sup></italic> embryos were packed more densely into the basal layer compared to wildtype (average = 258 cells vs 215 cells per 1200 μm<sup>2</sup> field of view) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, we did not detect elevated proliferation in <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp/Lp</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus, the geometrical differences observed in <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp/Lp</sup></italic> mutants are defined not by differences in cell sidedness, but rather by a change in height:width aspect ratio. We observed similar altered cell geometries in Vangl2 mutants at E13.5, when the proportion of oblique and perpendicular divisions is also increased. However, we did not observe such differences at E15.5, when division planes are similar to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), perhaps because elevated asymmetric divisions at earlier stages relieves basal cell crowding. Together these data show that early in epidermal development, <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp/Lp</sup></italic> cells are more crowded and elongated along their apical-basal axes and, according to Hertwig’s rule, may be more likely to divide in an oblique or perpendicular orientation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47102.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cell division orientation correlates with basal cell geometry.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of basal layer labeled with E-Cadherin from E14.5 <italic>Vangl2<sup>WT</sup></italic> and <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp/Lp</sup></italic> embryos.

Confirming what has previously been shown for simple epithelia dividing in a two-dimensional plane, we found that basal cells dividing within the plane of the epidermis do so along their longest XY axis (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). We also observed a modest but significant relationship between division plane and height:width aspect ratio along the apical-basal axis, wherein cells that divided in a planar orientation tended to have smaller height:width ratios (average = 0.8307) compared to cells that divided perpendicularly (average height:width ratios = 1.275) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4I—figure supplement 2</xref>).

We propose that failure of the neural folds to stretch the surface ectoderm over the midline in PCP mutants leads to crowding and narrowing of basal cells in the flanking epidermis, biasing divisions planes toward oblique and perpendicular orientations.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47102.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Cell shape and division orientation defects in Vangl2 mutants are indirect, and likely a consequence of failed neural tube closure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of the basal layer of <italic>Vangl2<sup>WT</sup></italic> and <italic>Vangl2<sup>ΔTm/Lp</sup></italic> embryos with or without <italic>K14-Vangl2-GFP</italic>.

Basal cells dividing with telophase angles greater than 45 degrees of the basement membrane will have asymmetric fates, whereas division angles less than 45 degrees will generate daughters with symmetric fates. Although this has been assumed to be true based on division planes in fixed tissue sections, these data show directly that during early phases of epidermal stratification, the angle between telophase daughter cells is a strong indicator of the final positions and fates of the two daughters. We also found, through investigation of the hyperstratification defect of a well-studied PCP mutant, that during early stratification stages, the orientation of cell division is influenced by cell shape and packing rather than cortical PCP cues or LGN localization. Basal cells that are taller along the apical-basal axis are biased towards perpendicular divisions, while flatter and wider cells tend to divide parallel to the epithelial plane. Crowding within the epithelium, a consequence that is likely due to a failure of the skin to stretch and cover the midline in PCP mutants, is associated with increased asymmetric divisions, while stretching the epithelium promotes planar divisions and expansion of the progenitor layer. These findings show that embryonic basal epidermal cells are flexible to adjust their divisions, at the level of spindle orientation, in response to changes in the tissue environment. We propose that under normal developmental conditions, this mechanism enables expansion of the progenitor layer to accommodate embryo growth while also allowing for the generation of new layers when the basal layer has reached sufficient density.</p><p>Based on these observations, we propose an updated model for epidermal stratification. The epidermis begins as a single layer of progenitor cells that divide almost exclusively within the plane of the tissue, until increases in cell density and height:width ratio promote stratification through oblique/perpendicular divisions. Epithelial stretch or tension, such as that exerted on the skin by embryo growth or morphogenetic changes like neural tube closure, delays stratification, while crowding of the basal layer promotes its occurrence. These cues of stretch and crowding provide an effective way to balance basal cell division orientations and ensure proper tissue structure early in epidermal development. Notably, other studies using Cre recombinase-based lineage tracing or live imaging without a nuclear marker have suggested that stratification at this early stage is driven primarily by delamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miroshnikova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wickström and Niessen, 2018</xref>). By contrast, we did not observe delamination events throughout the analysis of our live imaging data. The reasons for these differences are not entirely clear, but one possibility is that lentiviral delivery of CreER might promote delamination of less fit basal cells into the suprabasal layer. Additionally, we noted that cells undergoing perpendicular divisions can appear as if they are delaminating when the focal plane aligns with the plane of cleavage (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miroshnikova et al., 2018</xref>). Inclusion of a nuclear marker and Z-dimensional reconstructions are required to resolve such ambiguities.</p><p>Late in embryonic development, there is a developmental shift toward generating more skin layers, as forming an effective barrier from the exterior environment becomes imperative. To facilitate this change in tissue architecture, apical mInsc polarization promotes perpendicular spindle orientations and formation of a stratified barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Poulson and Lechler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). During homeostasis of the adult epidermis, yet another shift occurs in the balance between division and stratification. Division angles are once again primarily planar and delamination, rather than asymmetric division, becomes the mechanism by which cells are able to replenish the skin’s stratified layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clayton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mesa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rompolas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smart, 1970</xref>). During adult homeostasis, differentiation triggers neighboring basal stem cells to divide. Thus, similar to what we’ve observed in early epidermal stages, homeostasis is influenced by the needs of the tissue, as sensed through local tissue architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mesa et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The different strategies that basal cells employ to orient divisions as the epidermis develops raises many new questions that warrant further investigation. Firstly, it is unclear what regulates the developmental switches in division modes. For example, the switch to mInsc/LGN/NuMA-mediated perpendicular divisions coincides with an increase in mInsc polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Poulson and Lechler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams et al., 2014</xref>), but how this change in polarization is regulated is unknown. Additionally, we do not know precisely when or how the switch back to planar divisions during homeostasis occurs. Secondly, the cortical cues that orient planar spindle alignment, at any developmental stage, remain to be identified. In single-layered epithelia, such as the <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicular epithelium and the chick neuroepithelium, planar spindle orientation depends on the LGN/Pins-NuMA/Mud complex, which anchors astral microtubules to the lateral cell cortex through the polarity factor Dlg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellaïche et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergstralh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakajima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saadaoui et al., 2014</xref>). Murine epidermal progenitors require LGN-NuMA for perpendicular spindle orientation during the latter phase of stratification, but these proteins are dispensable for planar spindle alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, although core PCP components orient parallel divisions in several other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellaïche et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellaïche et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ciruna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fischer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ségalen et al., 2010</xref>), the core PCP component Vangl2 is not required for parallel, symmetric divisions in the skin. Conditional ablation of β1 integrin or α-catenin leads to randomization of division planes in the basal layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>) suggesting planar spindle alignment requires both basal and lateral adhesion proteins. However, cell polarity might be generally compromised in these mutants. Thus, the cortical cues that pull the spindle in a planar orientation still need to be identified, and it is unclear whether such factors would be localized to the lateral or basal cortex. Finally, the mechanisms that connect spindle orientation to cell geometry in the early stages of stratification remain unknown.</p><p>Although the propensity for a cell to divide along its longest interphase axis, Hertwig’s rule, has been known for over 100 years, it is not entirely intuitive how the mitotic spindle, which assembles and anchors only after the cell has rounded, orients relative to the cell’s geometry when it was in interphase. Evidence that cells retain a ‘cortical memory’ of their interphase shape has been shown in the pupal notum epithelium of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and single cells in culture. In planar divisions of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> notum, NuMA localizes to tricellular junctions, where it captures astral microtubules to dictate division orientation. Because tricellular junction position is preserved from interphase, their position serves as a memory of interphase geometry when the cell rounds up during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosveld et al., 2016</xref>). When HeLa cells are plated on fibronectin micropatterns, retraction fibers left behind during mitotic rounding present spatial cortical cues that can bias the localization of subcortical molecular factors, which in turn influences mitotic spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fink et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Théry et al., 2005</xref>). Ablation of these fibers or adjustment of their distribution through pattern variation affects spindle positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fink et al., 2011</xref>). In the murine epidermis, however, the mechanisms responsible for communicating cell shape and/or tension information to the mitotic spindle are unknown. Whether the same principles by which cell geometry orients divisions in two dimensions apply to the three dimensional division planes of basal cells is also unclear. Because each cell is dividing in the context of the surrounding tissue, perhaps neighboring cells exert tension on the dividing cell as shared junctions are distorted due to cell shape changes that occur during mitosis. For example, cells that are elongated within the plane of the epidermis would have the greatest tension exerted upon them from lateral neighbors as they progress from an elongated to a rounded shape, and thus would be more likely to divide in a planar orientation. Conversely, cells that have more isometric cross-sectional areas and are elongated along their apical-basal axes may lack these planar forces. Alternatively, there may be a cell intrinsic system for interphase shape memory that guides the spindle to align along its interphase 3D long axis. Ultimately, deciphering the processes by which basal epidermal cells connect local tissue mechanics to cell division orientations will illuminate a new method of cell fate control.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M.

E13.5 and E14.5 embryos and embryonic explants were fixed at room temperature for 1 hr, and E15.5 and E16.5 embryos and embryonic explants were fixed at room temperature for 1.5 hr. Skins stained with anti-LGN antibodies were processed as follows: skins were dissected from fixed embryos and blocked overnight at 4°C in 2% fish skin gelatin, 1% bovine serum albumin, 2% normal donkey serum, and/or 2% normal goat serum in PBT (1X PBS with 0.2% or 0.3% Triton X-100). Skins were incubated in primary antibodies diluted in block for 24 hr at 4°C. Skins were washed with 0.2–0.3% PBT overnight, incubated with secondary antibodies for 24 hr at 4°C followed by Hoechst. All other skins were blocked for 1 hr at RT in 1% BSA, 2% NDS and/or 2% NGS then incubated in primary antibodies diluted in block overnight at 4°C. After washing with 0.2–0.3% PBT, skins were incubated in secondary antibodies followed by Hoechst. Samples were mounted in either glycerol-based anti-fade non-curing medium or Vectashield Antifade mounting medium. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-involucrin (1:500, D. Devenport), guinea pig anti-Celsr1 (1:1000, D. Devenport), rat anti-E-Cadherin (1:25, purified in lab from ECCD2 clonal hybridomas, obtained from Masatoshi Takeichi), rat anti-E-Cadherin (1:2000, DECMA-1, Thermo Fisher, Cat: MA1-25160), guinea pig anti-LGN (1:500, gift from Scott Williams), rabbit anti-LGN (1:3000, gift from Scott Williams), rat anti-Vangl2 (1:100, Millipore, Cat: MABN750). Alexa Fluor-488,–555, −647 secondary antibodies were used at 1:2000. Hoechst (Invitrogen, Cat: H1399) was used at 1:1000 (1 mg/mL). Images were acquired on a Nikon Ti-E Spinning Disc or A1 scanning confocal microscope controlled by NIS Elements software using a Plan Fluor 40X/1.3NA, Plan Apo 60X/1.4NA, or Plan Apo 100X/1.45 oil immersion objective. NIS elements software and Photoshop were used for image processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Live imaging</title><p>A portion of live imaging for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> was done as follows: E14.5 flank skin explants were dissected in PBS and mounted on bottom side of Sarstedt 35 mm Lumox membrane dish (Cat# 94.6077.331) and secured in position using 13 mm diameter, 8 mm Nucleopore polycarbonate membrane (Fisher Scientific Cat# 09-300-57) overlaid with matrigel (Fisher Cat# CB-40230A). This dish was then mounted inside a Sarstedt standard TC dish (Cat# 83.3900) filled with F-Media with 10% fetal bovine serum. This setup was necessary to enable imaging from the epidermal side of the explant using an upright microscope. Time-lapse imaging was undertaken using an upright Prairie Ultima multiphoton microscope equipped with 40x plan apochromat, 1.0NA immersion objective with incubation chamber to maintain 37°C and 5% CO2. 1024 × 1024 pixel images were collected in Z-stacks spaced at 1.0 mm apart. 3D Z-stacks were collected at 10 min intervals for 24 hr. Volocity software was used for movie processing.</p><p>For all the other movies: E14.5 dorsal flank skin explants were dissected in PBS and transferred to a 1% agarose gel with F-media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Explants were sandwiched between the gel on the dermal side and a 35 mm Lumox membrane dish (Sarstedt) on the epidermal side. Z-stacks with 0.5 or one micron step sizes were acquired at 10 min intervals for 8–18 hr. Images were acquired using a Nikon Ti-E Spinning Disc with a Plan Fluor 40X/1.3NA oil objective. Explants were cultured in a humid imaging chamber at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> during the course of imaging. In all live imaging experiments, cells close to the edge of the explants were not imaged to avoid differences in division orientations that could be induced by a wound healing response. NIS Elements software was used for movie processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Stretching experiments</title><p>A custom-designed stretch chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aw et al., 2016</xref>) was constructed to culture and uniaxially stretch skin explants on a flexible 7 × 3 cm PDMS membrane (SSP-M823-005, Specialty Silicone Products, Inc). The PDMS membranes were exposed to UV light for 15–20 min then coated with fibronectin. E14.5 or E15.5 dorsal flank skin explants were dissected in PBS and positioned dermis side down on the membranes and submerged in E-media containing 1.5 mM calcium. E14.5 explants were cultured with 10% mouse serum, isolated in the lab. The explants were allowed to rest for 3 hr before stretching. One half of each explant was cultured in a similar chamber with no applied stretch, as a control. Experiments were performed by stretching the membrane 4 mm over the course of 1 hr. Skin explants were kept on the PDMS membranes for 15 min following stretching, then fixed at room temperate for 1 hr, then removed from the PDMS membrane and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium for imaging. Basal cell elongation was quantified using Packing Analyzer V2 software, which determines the direction and magnitude of cell elongation as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aw et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Quantification of division angle, skin thickness, cell height, cell surface area</title><p>Division angle in both live and fixed imaging was determined by drawing a line connecting the two daughter nuclei during telophase or cytokinesis (using either Volocity or NIS Elements software). Skin thickness was quantified using fixed sagittal tissue sections or whole mount skins and by measuring the area of skin in an image, normalized to length. For whole mount images, area and length were measured in YZ views. Cell heights were measured using membrane signal (either E-Cadherin or membrane-tdTomato, held consistent within each experiment) and XZ views of images with either 0.2 μm or 0.5 μm Z-step sizes in NIS Elements software to determine the distance from the apical surface of the cell to the basement membrane. Cell surface area was calculated using Packing Analyzer V2 software. Images were imported into the software and cells were segmented using a membrane signal, with any necessary hand corrections. Surface areas were calculated using the software’s watershed formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aw et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistics</title><p>Circular statistics: to compare rose plots of division angles, p values were calculated from the non-parametric Kuiper’s test to compare distributions along a circle. This test was modified to account for data limited to 0–90° range, and p values were calculated using Matlab. All other statistical analyses were performed in Prism.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Scott Williams for providing LGN antibodies, Benoit Aiguoy for Packing Analyzer, Benjamin Bratton for assistance with circular statistics, and Gary Laevsky and the Nikon Center for Excellence for technical assistance with imaging.

Your article has been reviewed by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Yukiko M Yamashita (Reviewer #1); Yohanns Bellaïche (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study by Box et al., studies the role of PCP protein Vangl2 in division orientation of basal progenitor cells (epidermal stem cells) in mouse. Overall, the conclusions (summarized below) are supported well, and the study represents important description on spindle orientation and tissue morphogenesis, including the descriptions that correct notions that might have been assumed based on previous studies. This study is the first to provide much clear-cut correlation between the spindle orientation and the fate of daughter cells. They also made an important observation that contrasts to the previous studies that suggested delamination of basal progenitor cells as a mechanism of differentiation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>-Comparing Figure 4I and 4J, one interesting analysis may be whether wt vs. Vangl2 mutant cells have similar height-width ratio in deciding which direction they divide. Namely, Vangl2 mutation only affects height-width ratio, and all spindle orientation phenotype is purely explained by changed height-width ratio. Alternatively, Vangl2 might possibly affecting additional aspect(s) of spindle orientation other than height-width ratio? By eye-balling Figure 4I and 4J, it looks like there is differences between wt vs. mutant for the same category of spindle orientation.</p><p>-Can they explain why the previous studies proposed delamination? I am wondering the studies relied on fixed samples? If so, is it possible that maybe some daughter cells are coming back to adhere basal layer? (opposite of delamination?)</p><p>Subsection “Division plane is a strong predictor of the positional fate of daughter cells”: The following statement might be incorrect: &quot;<italic>Vangl2Lp/155 Lp</italic> embryos, however, the relationship between division orientation and final position was shifted toward asymmetric. Only 78% of planar divisions, and 21% of oblique divisions resulted in symmetric positional fates (Figure 2B,C).&quot;. The distribution shown in the Figure 2A seems similar. The distribution difference in the Figure 2B could be due to the binning in planar, oblique, orthogonal divisions. To strengthen this statement, the authors should test whether the angular distributions of the different bins are identical.</p><p>Results section/Discussion section: In the Results section or the Discussion section, it would be relevant to discuss the difference between this study and the ones reporting stratification by delamination.</p><p>Subsection “Division plane is a strong predictor of the positional fate of daughter cells”: The authors should clarify what is novel in the analysis of the epithelium thickness in Vangl2 mutant embryos.</p><p>Figure 3: &quot;LGN Mislocalized&quot; sounds inappropriate. An absence of correlation between LGN localization and a specific orientation does not indicate that LGN is mis-localised.</p><p>Subsection “Early in epidermal development, LGN localization does not correlate with planar spindle positioning”: This sentence: &quot;However, the occurrence of apical LGN (47.7% of divisions) was not sufficiently increased compared to <italic>Vangl2<sup>WT</sup></italic>(41.1% of divisions) to explain the altered division orientations (Figure 3C, D)&quot; is awkward since the frequency is decreased. The subsequent sentence is incorrect, the conclusion should be made on Vangl2 and not LGN.</p><p>Subsection “Cell division orientation is correlated with basal cell geometry”: &quot;but this has been shown mainly in cells dividing within a two-dimensional plane (Bosveld et al., 2016; Thery and Bornens, 2006; Thery et al., 2005; Wyatt et al., 2015).&quot; This is an overstatement. Xiong et al., (2014) have analysed the role of 3D cell shape. This work needs to be cited and discussed.</p><p>Subsection “Cell division orientation is correlated with basal cell geometry”: &quot;Basal cells in <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp/Lp</sup></italic>embryos were packed more densely into the basal layer compared to wildtype (258 cells vs 215 cells per 1200μm2 field of view) (Figure 4E), but this increase in cell density was not due to elevated proliferation (Figure 4F).&quot;. Small difference in the proliferation rate can have a substantial impact on cell numbers at long time scale. Please reformulate.</p><p>Subsection “Cell division orientation is correlated with basal cell geometry”: &quot;We also observed a modest but significant relationship between division plane and height:width aspect ratio along the apical-basal axis, wherein cells that divided in a planar orientation tended to have smaller height:width ratios (average = 0.8307) compared to cells that divided perpendicularly (average height:width ratios = 1.275) (Figure 4I). This relationship was also observed in Vangl2 mutant embryos (Figure 4H, J, Figure 4—video 2), where perpendicular divisions were associated with larger height:width ratios&quot;. The authors need to plot cell division orientation versus height: width ratio to substantiate this conclusion.</p><p>Subsection “Spatial differences in epithelial packing and shape correlate with cell division orientations and the timing of stratification”: Are the orientation distributions statistically different in the lateral, intermediate and midline regions?</p><p>Subsection “Spatial differences in epithelial packing and shape correlate with cell division orientations and the timing of stratification”: &quot;Thus, coverage of the epidermis over the spinal cord induces a gradient of cell density and elongation along the mediolateral axis, which in turn regulates cell division planes and the timing of stratification.&quot; Please weaken this conclusion.</p><p>Subsection “Exogenous stretching of skin explants increases the frequency of planar cell divisions”: The 14.5 control and stretched conditions should be done in wt conditions. Accordingly, the conclusion at the end of the Results section is incorrect. The authors can only make this conclusion in a Vangl2 mutant conditions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47102.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This study by Box et al., studies the role of PCP protein Vangl2 in division orientation of basal progenitor cells (epidermal stem cells) in mouse.

One, two and three cell clones were analyzed in fixed skin samples. 50% of labeled cells were found in the first suprabasal layer with no associated basal cell, and were scored as delamination events. It’s possible that the viral infection itself promotes delamination if it affects basal cell fitness. In Miroshnikova et al., 2018, some live imaging was performed on life-Act expressing embryos lacking a nuclear marker. To our eyes, the example provided resembles what we see when a cell divides in a perpendicular orientation when visualized with a membrane marker (Figure 4-video 2). These differences are discussed in more detail in the Discussion section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Division plane is a strong predictor of the positional fate of daughter cells”: The following statement might be incorrect: &quot;Vangl2Lp/155 Lp embryos, however, the relationship between division orientation and final position was shifted toward asymmetric. Only 78% of planar divisions, and 21% of oblique divisions resulted in symmetric positional fates (Figure 2B,C).&quot;. The distribution shown in the Figure 2A seems similar. The distribution difference in the Figure 2B could be due to the binning in planar, oblique, orthogonal divisions. To strengthen this statement, the authors should test whether the angular distributions of the different bins are identical.</p></disp-quote><p>To test whether the way we binned division categories affected our conclusion (0-20=planar, 21-70=oblique, 71-90=perpendicular), we binned the data in a different way (in 30 degree bins) and found the bias toward asymmetric fates in <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp/Lp</sup></italic>embryos to be even greater, suggesting our results aren’t artifacts of how we binned division planes. We decided to keep the original binning of these data and preserve the original language used in the text. We also provide a comparison of the data binned in different ways in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47102-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results section/Discussion section: In the Results section or the Discussion section, it would be relevant to discuss the difference between this study and the ones reporting stratification by delamination.</p></disp-quote><p>The differences between our study and those reporting delamination are now discussed in more detail in the Discussion section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Division plane is a strong predictor of the positional fate of daughter cells”: The authors should clarify what is novel in the analysis of the epithelium thickness in Vangl2 mutant embryos.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we had previously noted that <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp/Lp</sup></italic> mutants had thicker skin at E18.5, and images where this difference is apparent can be found in Devenport et al., 2008, we never explicitly mentioned the phenotype in prior publications.

This work needs to be cited and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we had cited these two studies, we now discuss Xiong et al., 2014 and Chalmers et al., 2003 more explicitly in the text. “Hertwig’s rule, also known as the ‘long axis rule’, states that a cell is most likely to divide along its longest interphase axis, and has been observed in many cell types dividing within a two-dimensional plane (Bosveld et al., 2016; Thery and Bornens, 2006; Thery et al., 2005; Wyatt et al., 2015). In the epidermis, where basal cells divide in three-dimensional space, a cell’s longest axis may lie perpendicular to the epithelial plane, which could promote perpendicular spindle alignment and asymmetric division. Indeed, the perpendicular divisions of early <italic>Xenopus</italic> and zebrafish embryos have been shown to divide according to a three-dimensional long-axis rule (Chalmers et al., 2003; Xiong et al., 2014).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Cell division orientation is correlated with basal cell geometry”: &quot;Basal cells in Vangl2<sup>Lp/Lp</sup> embryos were packed more densely into the basal layer compared to wildtype (258 cells vs 215 cells per 1200μm2 field of view) (Figure 4E), but this increase in cell density was not due to elevated proliferation (Figure 4F).&quot;. Small difference in the proliferation rate can have a substantial impact on cell numbers at long time scale.

Because wild type division planes are already strongly biased toward planar divisions at E14.5, we reasoned that stretching explants of this stage would be unlikely to have a quantifiable effect, and if anything would shift division planes to a more E13.5-like distribution, which would not have been an appropriate comparison for Vangl2 mutants. We specifically wanted to test whether stretch could rescue the planar division orientations of Vangl2 mutants such that their division planes would now resemble unstretched wild type skins. Thus, the appropriate control in this experiment is unstretched mutant skins. To determine the effect of stretch on wild type skins, we chose to stretch E15.5 when division planes are biased toward oblique and perpendicular orientations and asked whether stretch could shift that bias toward more planar orientations. Our results indicate that division planes are not fixed in either genotype, and that basal cells are able to shift division planes in response to changes in shape/tension.</p><p>We have substantially revised the text accompanying Figure 8 to better explain the experimental rationale, design, and conclusions of this experiment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
