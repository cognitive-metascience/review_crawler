These are the hypothalamus, a structure deep within the brain that controls a number of basic activities including hunger, thirst and sleep; and the brainstem, which connects the brain with the spinal cord.</p><p>Specific neurons within the hypothalamus and brainstem regulate the sleep–wake cycle by signaling to one another using chemicals called neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Throughout the day, some hypothalamic neurons release a neuropeptide called hypocretin, which helps maintain wakefulness. Hypocretin acts on neurons within the brainstem and causes them to release other neurotransmitters that promote wakefulness. However, the identity of these molecules is unclear.</p><p>One candidate is norepinephrine. Drugs that enhance the effects of norepinephrine increase wakefulness, whereas those that block norepinephrine signaling promote sleep. Despite this, mice that have been genetically modified to lack the enzyme that produces norepinephrine exhibit relatively normal sleep. This may be because in mammals, norepinephrine also has important roles outside the brain, thus complicating the effects of this genetic modification on behavior. Alternatively, while zebrafish that lack norepinephrine are healthy, mice containing this modification die early in development. Treating these mice with a specific drug allows them to survive, but might affect their behavior.</p><p>To clarify the role of norepinephrine and its interaction with hypocretin, Singh, Oikonomou and Prober created a new animal model by genetically modifying zebrafish. In contrast to mice, zebrafish that were unable to make norepinephrine slept more than normal fish, although they were also lighter sleepers and were more prone to being startled. A genetic modification that increases hypocretin signaling induces insomnia; Singh, Oikonomou and Prober found that this occurs only in animals with normal levels of norepinephrine. Thus, these experiments indicate that hypocretin does indeed promote wakefulness though norepinephrine.</p><p>The work of Singh, Oikonomou and Prober has clarified the role of norepinephrine in regulating the sleep–wake cycle. These findings could help in the development of drugs that target the neurons that make hypocretin, which may improve treatments for sleep disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07000.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07000.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>hypocretin</kwd><kwd>orexin</kwd><kwd>norepinephrine</kwd><kwd>noradrenaline</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001447</institution-id><institution>Rita Allen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prober</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Mallinckrodt Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prober</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prober</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 NS082010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oikonomou</surname><given-names>Grigorios</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00 NS060996</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prober</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS070911</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prober</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DA031367</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prober</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experiments in genetically modified zebrafish that are unable to produce norepinephrine show that this neurotransmitter promotes wakefulness by mediating the effects of the neuropeptide hypocretin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sleep remains among the most persistent and perplexing mysteries in modern biology. Several studies have shown that neuronal centers that regulate sleep and wakefulness lie predominantly in the hypothalamus and brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pace-Schott and Hobson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saper et al., 2005</xref>), and many of the neurotransmitters and neuropeptides employed by these centers are known. However, it remains unclear how these centers interact with each other, and what specific functions are fulfilled by the neurotransmitters and neuropeptides they employ. Norepinephrine (NE) is one of the most abundant neurotransmitters in the central and peripheral nervous systems, and has been implicated in many aspects of physiology and behavior, including cognition, attention, reward, locomotion and arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berridge and Waterhouse, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weinshenker and Schroeder, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sara, 2009</xref>). Small molecule activators of NE signaling have been shown to increase wakefulness, whereas inhibitors promote sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berridge et al., 2012</xref>). These results suggest that NE plays a significant role in promoting arousal. However, the role of endogenous NE in regulating the sleep/wake cycles of vertebrates remains unclear, with contradicting reports concerning the sleep phenotype of mice that do not synthesize NE due to mutation of <italic>dopamine beta hydroxylase</italic> (<italic>dbh</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hunsley and Palmiter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ouyang et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The locus coeruleus (LC) in the brainstem is a major arousal promoting center and a major source of NE in the brain (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berridge and Waterhouse, 2003</xref>). Optogenetic studies in mice have shown that activation of the LC promotes sleep-to-wake transitions, while inhibition of the LC reduces time spent awake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carter et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2012</xref>). These studies also showed that activation of the LC plays an important role in mediating the arousing effects of <italic>hypocretin</italic> (<italic>hcrt</italic>)-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carter et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2012</xref>), which constitute an important arousal center in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sutcliffe and de Lecea, 2002</xref>). These observations suggest that NE synthesized in the LC could be involved in mediating Hcrt-induced arousal. However, in addition to NE, the LC also produces other neurotransmitters and neuropeptides that affect sleep, including dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dzirasa et al., 2006</xref>), neuropeptide Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dyzma et al., 2010</xref>), neurotensin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Erwin and Radcliffe, 1993</xref>) and vasopressin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Born et al., 1992</xref>). Manipulations of the LC likely affect the synaptic levels of these other neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Therefore, it is unclear whether NE is required to mediate the arousing effects of LC neurons and Hcrt signaling, or if this is accomplished by another factor in LC neurons.</p><p>To address the role of NE in regulating vertebrate sleep/wake states, we generated <italic>dbh</italic> mutant zebrafish that do not produce NE. Contrary to <italic>dbh</italic> null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thomas et al., 1995</xref>), zebrafish <italic>dbh</italic> mutants develop normally and are viable. Importantly, they also exhibit a dramatic increase in sleep. Interestingly, despite increased sleep, these animals display a reduced arousal threshold. Using this mutant, we show that NE is important for arousal that is induced by either genetic overexpression of the Hcrt neuropeptide or optogenetic activation of Hcrt neurons. These results clarify the role of NE in regulating vertebrate sleep and establish a role for NE in mediating Hcrt-induced wakefulness.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pharmacological inhibition of NE signaling increases sleep</title><p>Previous pharmacological studies in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rihel et al., 2010</xref>) suggested that the noradrenergic system is an important regulator of sleep and wakefulness in zebrafish, similar to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berridge et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that the zebrafish model system could provide a new platform for exploring the role of endogenous NE in sleep. Three classes of receptors mediate NE signaling: the activating alpha1-and beta-adrenergic receptors and the inhibitory alpha2 adrenergic receptors. For each class there exist at least 5 paralogs in the zebrafish genome, making pharmacological manipulations more practical than genetic manipulations. We first tested the effects of prazosin, a well-established alpha1-adrenergic receptor inhibitor, on zebrafish behavior. We found that, compared to larvae exposed to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle alone, larvae exposed to 100 µM prazosin showed lower overall activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,D</xref>) and activity when awake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,E</xref>) during both day and night, as well as an increase in sleep during both day (+140%) and night (+60%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This increase in sleep was primarily due to an increase in the number of sleep bouts (+110% during the day and +70% during the night, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), as well as a smaller increase in sleep bout duration (+20% during the day) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).

To this end we used the zinc-finger nuclease approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Foley et al., 2009</xref>), a well established technique in zebrafish that induces targeted mutations with few off-target lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doyon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gupta et al., 2011</xref>), to generate zebrafish containing a mutation in the single zebrafish <italic>dopamine beta-hydroxylase</italic> (<italic>dbh</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2013a</xref>), which encodes the enzyme that converts dopamine to NE. The <italic>dbh</italic> mutant allele that we generated contains a four nucleotide insertion in the third exon, which gives rise to a premature stop codon, resulting in a predicted 178 amino acid peptide lacking the DBH active site, instead of the full length 614 amino acid protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Although the murine <italic>dbh</italic> knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thomas et al., 1995</xref>) displays no overt developmental defects, only 10% of <italic>dbh−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> pups produced by <italic>dbh</italic>+/<italic>−</italic> mothers survive embryonic development and no <italic>dbh−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> pups are born to <italic>dbh−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> mothers.

We verified that <italic>dbh−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> larvae completely lack NE using an ELISA assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Using in situ hybridization (ISH) we also found that the level of <italic>dbh</italic> mRNA in <italic>dbh−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> larvae is much lower than in their <italic>dbh</italic>+/<italic>−</italic> siblings, presumably due to nonsense mediated decay of the mutant transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Isken and Maquat, 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

To this end we delivered mechano-acoustic tapping stimuli of variable intensities to larvae while monitoring their behavior using a videotracking system. We delivered a stimulus once a minute during the night, and determined the fraction of larvae that responded to each stimulus. This dataset allowed us to construct dose–response curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and calculate the tapping intensity at which 50% of larvae responded to the stimulus (effective tap power 50, ETP<sub>50</sub>). Surprisingly, the ETP<sub>50</sub> for <italic>dbh−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> larvae was 2.1 compared to 3.1 for their <italic>dbh</italic>+/+ siblings (32% decrease) (p &lt; 0.0001 by extra sum-of-squares F test), suggesting that although the <italic>dbh</italic> mutants sleep more, they have a reduced arousal threshold.

Interestingly, treatment with the alpha1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin or the alpha2-adrenergic agonist clonidine did not affect the arousal threshold of zebrafish larvae (data not shown).

Hcrt has been proposed to promote wakefulness in part by stimulating the noradrenergic LC based on several lines of evidence. First, the LC is densely innervated by Hcrt neurons in both zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prober et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peyron et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chemelli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Date et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Horvath et al., 1999</xref>) and LC neurons express the Hcrt receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Horvath et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourgin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prober et al., 2006</xref>). It is worth noting, however, that the medulla oblongata is another source of NE in the brain, and it also receives Hcrt projections in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ciriello et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). Second, application of Hcrt peptide depolarizes LC neurons in brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hagan et al., 1999</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourgin et al., 2000</xref>). Third, acute inhibition of LC neurons using halorhodopsin inhibits the arousing effects of stimulating Hcrt neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carter et al., 2012</xref>). However, despite the evidence that the LC mediates Hcrt-induced arousal, it is unknown whether this process requires NE.</p><p>The mammalian genome contains two <italic>hcrt receptor</italic> (<italic>hcrtr</italic>) paralogs, both of which are required for the increase in locomotor activity and decrease in sleep observed after injection of Hcrt peptide (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexandre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sakurai, 2013</xref>). To determine whether the single zebrafish <italic>hcrtr</italic> ortholog is required for the Hcrt overexpression phenotype in zebrafish larvae, we mated <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>hsp:Hcrt)</italic> zebrafish to a previously described <italic>hcrtr</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yokogawa et al., 2007</xref>). We subjected the larval progeny to heat shock (HS) during the sixth day post fertilization (dpf) to induce Hcrt overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prober et al., 2006</xref>). We then compared the amount of sleep on night 6 (post-HS) to night 5 (pre-HS). We previously showed that Hcrt protein levels remain elevated for over 48 hr after HS, with no detectable decrease during the first 24 hr after HS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prober et al., 2006</xref>), so overexpressed Hcrt protein should remain at high levels throughout the night following HS. <italic>hcrtr</italic>+/<italic>−</italic> and <italic>hcrtr−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> larvae reacted similarly to the HS, with no significant difference in the amount of sleep between the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Hcrt overexpression decreased the sleep of <italic>Tg(hsp:Hcrt);hcrtr</italic>+/<italic>−</italic> larvae by 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>), as previously described for <italic>Tg(hsp:Hcrt);hcrtr+/+</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prober et al., 2006</xref>). However, no decrease in sleep was observed in <italic>Tg(hsp:Hcrt);hcrtr−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> larvae following HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). These results indicate that the decrease in sleep following overexpression of Hcrt requires a functional <italic>hcrtr</italic>.</p><p>To test the hypothesis that NE is required for Hcrt-induced wakefulness, we mated <italic>Tg(hsp:Hcrt)</italic>+/−;<italic>dbh</italic>+/<italic>−</italic> fish to <italic>dbh−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> fish and heat-shocked the larval progeny during day 6. We first asked whether the presence or absence of NE affects the response of larvae to HS. Larvae lacking the <italic>hsp:Hcrt</italic> transgene were similarly affected by the HS independently of whether they produced NE or not (no significant difference observed between <italic>dbh</italic>+/<italic>−</italic> and <italic>dbh−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> larvae, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). We therefore conclude that lack of NE does not affect the response of larvae to HS. We next asked whether NE is required for Hcrt overexpression-induced arousal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). As expected, the amount of sleep exhibited by <italic>Tg(hsp:Hcrt)</italic> larvae was reduced following Hcrt overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Specifically, the sleep of <italic>Tg(hsp:Hcrt)</italic>+/−;<italic>dbh</italic>+/<italic>−</italic> larvae was reduced to 40% of the pre-HS value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, the sleep of <italic>Tg(hsp:Hcrt)</italic>+/−;<italic>dbh−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> larvae was reduced to 75% of the pre-HS value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, the majority of Hcrt-induced sleep loss is blocked in the absence of NE. Importantly, treatment of <italic>Tg(hsp:Hcrt)</italic>+/− animals with prazosin similarly inhibits Hcrt overexpression-induced arousal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) suggesting that the <italic>dbh</italic> mutant phenotype is indeed due to the blocking of noradrenergic signaling. We also confirmed that the suppressed effect of Hcrt overexpression on sleep in <italic>dbh</italic> and <italic>hcrtr</italic> mutants is not due to an effect of the mutations on the efficacy of the HS overexpression system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). These results indicate that NE plays an important role in Hcrt-mediated arousal, but suggest that Hcrt also inhibits sleep via NE-independent mechanisms.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07000.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Reduced sleep at night due to Hcrt overexpression is suppressed in <italic>dbh</italic> mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>C</bold>) Sleep traces from a single representative experiment; yellow region indicates time of heat shock (HS) during day 6.

We modified the locomotor activity assay by adding an array of blue and red LEDs that uniformly illuminates the 96-well plate, thus allowing simultaneous light stimulation of 96 freely behaving larvae. Larvae at 5 dpf were transferred to a 96-well plate and kept in the dark for 8 hr in the behavioral chamber, after which they were exposed to either red or blue light for 30 min. The behavior of <italic>Tg(hcrt:ChR2-EYFP)</italic> larvae was compared to their non-transgenic siblings throughout the night with an inter-trial interval of 3 hr. A typical response to blue or red light included a burst of activity at light onset lasting approximately 30 s, followed by a return to near baseline activity levels, a gradual increase in activity that reached a plateau for the remainder of the illumination phase, and a burst of activity when the lights were turned off. The bursts of activity observed at light onset and offset were similar for transgenic and non-transgenic larvae and were excluded from behavioral analysis. <italic>Tg(hcrt:ChR2-EYFP)</italic> larvae and their non-transgenic siblings exhibited similar levels of locomotor activity when illuminated with red light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>), a treatment that does not activate ChR2. In contrast, when illuminated with blue light the total locomotor activity of <italic>Tg(hcrt:ChR2-EYFP)</italic> larvae increased by 46% compared to non-transgenic siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). Activation of Hcrt neurons by ChR2 also altered the dynamics of locomotor activity. Specifically <italic>Tg(hcrt:ChR2-EYFP)</italic> larvae displayed a 25% increase in the maximum activity level reached during stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and reached this maximum activity level 20% faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) than sibling controls.</p><p>We next asked whether the increase in locomotor activity observed upon activation of zebrafish Hcrt neurons using ChR2 requires the <italic>hcrtr</italic>.

Of the <italic>dbh−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> pups that survive embryogenesis, only 40% reach adulthood. Although the basis of the embryonic lethality is unclear, it was hypothesized to be due to abnormal heart development or function, as the hearts of mutant embryos display greater heterogeneity in cell size and orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thomas et al., 1995</xref>). Supplementation of drinking water during gestation with dihydroxyphenylserine (DOPS), which is converted to NE by L-aromatic-amino-acid decarboxylase (AADC), rescues the embryonic lethal phenotype. Following birth, DOPS supplementation is not required for continued survival of <italic>dbh−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> pups. Surprisingly, <italic>dbh−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> mice that reach adulthood were initially reported as having normal sleep/wake cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hunsley and Palmiter, 2003</xref>), although a later study reported a 20% increase in sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ouyang et al., 2004</xref>). These contradictory results could arise from differences in methodology, a relatively subtle and thus poorly reproducible sleep phenotype, or the complication that mice lacking <italic>dbh</italic> also exhibit higher levels of dopamine, the substrate of DBH and a major neurotransmitter in the brain.</p><p>In this study we sought to clarify the role of endogenous NE in regulating vertebrate sleep using pharmacology and genetics in zebrafish. Sleep can be distinguished from inactivity using electrophysiology or three behavioral criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campbell and Tobler, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borbely and Tobler, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allada and Siegel, 2008</xref>). First, sleep primarily occurs during specific periods of the circadian cycle. Second, animals exhibit an increased arousal threshold during sleep, although they can still be aroused by strong stimuli, thus distinguishing sleep from paralysis or coma. Third, sleep is controlled by a homeostatic system, which can be demonstrated as an increased need for sleep following sleep deprivation. Based on these criteria, it has been shown that rest in a variety of organisms, including zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhdanova et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prober et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yokogawa et al., 2007</xref>), meets the behavioral definition of sleep. Several groups have demonstrated behavioral, anatomical, genetic and pharmacological conservation of sleep between zebrafish and mammals, establishing zebrafish as a simple vertebrate model for sleep research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhdanova et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaslin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Faraco et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prober et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Renier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yokogawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rihel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gandhi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To study the function of NE in regulating zebrafish sleep, we generated a predicted null mutation in the single zebrafish <italic>dbh</italic> ortholog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Unlike mice, <italic>dbh−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> zebrafish larvae develop normally yet show reduced activity and strikingly increased sleep (+185% during the day and +57% during the night) compared to sibling controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Importantly, these phenotypes were also observed in larvae treated with the alpha-adrenergic inhibitor prazosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which blocks NE signaling without affecting dopamine levels. This observation suggests that the zebrafish <italic>dbh−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> phenotypes are due to lack of NE and not altered dopamine levels.</p><p>It is important to note that our pharmacological manipulations (blocking of the activating alpha1-adrenergic receptors with the antagonist prazosin; activation of the inhibitory alpha2-adrenergic receptors with the agonist clonidine; blocking of the activating alpha2-adrenergic receptors with the antagonist bopindolol) did not fully recapitulate the activity and sleep phenotypes observed in the <italic>dbh</italic> mutant. This is not surprising considering the inherent limitations of global exposure to a drug and the fact that each receptor type has at least five paralogs in zebrafish that may have different sensitivities to these drugs. Among these drugs, prazosin most faithfully phenocopied the <italic>dbh</italic> sleep/wake phenotype (reduced day and night activity and increased day and night sleep) with differences observed in sleep bout number. Clonidine reduced activity and increased sleep during the day, but had almost no effect at night. Bopindolol increased sleep during the day and night, but only inhibited activity at night. These observations suggest that alpha1-adrenergic receptors could be the main facilitators of noradrenergic modulation of larval zebrafish sleep.</p><p>Why do <italic>dbh</italic> mutant mice fail to exhibit the robust sleep phenotypes observed in NE deficient zebrafish? One possible explanation is that the chronic loss of NE in <italic>dbh</italic> mutant mice may induce compensatory mechanisms during development that do not occur in response to chronic loss of NE in zebrafish. Another possibility is that DOPS treatment during gestation affects developmental processes that ultimately affect behavior. An intriguing third potential explanation involves the role of NE in the mammalian sympathetic nervous system in promoting brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</xref>). BAT thermogenesis has been shown to promote slow wave sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dewasmes et al., 2003</xref>) and to be required for sleep rebound after sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Szentirmai and Kapas, 2014</xref>). Therefore, genetic ablation of <italic>dbh</italic> could induce two competing effects. In the periphery, lack of NE reduces BAT thermogenesis and thus inhibits sleep. In the central nervous system, lack of NE interferes with the normal arousal function of the LC and thus inhibits wakefulness. The combination of these two opposing forces could result in a minor sleep increase in <italic>dbh−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> mice, and the magnitude of this phenotype might be particularly sensitive to experimental conditions. However, zebrafish larvae and flies do not regulate their body temperature and are thus subject only to the sleep promoting effects of NE ablation, resulting in a dramatic increase in sleep. It would be interesting to test whether mice in which <italic>dbh</italic> is deleted only centrally, and thus have normal BAT thermogenesis in the periphery, display a similarly dramatic sleep increase.</p><p>To further characterize the <italic>dbh</italic> phenotype, we used an automated arousal threshold assay using a mechano-acoustic stimulus. We were surprised to find that although <italic>dbh−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> larvae sleep more, they display a lower arousal threshold (i.e. they respond to stimuli of lower intensity), as well as a higher maximal response than sibling controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Genetic ablation of <italic>dbh</italic> is predicted to increase dopamine levels in neurons that normally express <italic>dbh,</italic> since this enzyme converts dopamine to NE. Indeed, dopamine levels are higher in <italic>dbh</italic> mutant mice compared to sibling controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thomas et al., 1995</xref>). However, pharmacological inhibition of adrenergic receptors should not interfere with the conversion of dopamine to NE. Interestingly, we were able to pharmacologically replicate the reduced arousal phenotype seen in <italic>dbh−</italic>/<italic>−</italic> animals by treatment with bopindolol, a beta-adrenergic inhibitor, but not with the alpha1-adrenergic inhibitor prazosin, or the alpha2-adrenergic agonist clonidine. The ability of bopindolol to recapitulate the reduction in arousal threshold seen in the <italic>dbh</italic> mutant suggests that this aspect of the mutant phenotype is a consequence of the silencing of beta-adrenergic receptor signaling. Furthermore, the inability of prazosin (which increases sleep during day and night) or clonidine (which increases sleep during the day) to recapitulate the phenotype suggests that the observed reduction in arousal threshold is not simply a consequence of lighter sleep due to ‘over-sleeping’ in the <italic>dbh</italic> mutant. These observations suggest that lack of beta-adrenergic receptor signaling potentiates responses to sensory stimuli, and are particularly interesting considering that NE reuptake inhibitors such as atomoxetine, which increase NE signaling, are used to treat patients suffering from Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Garnock-Jones and Keating, 2009</xref>). It is important to note that these pharmacological results do not preclude a role of excess dopamine release in the <italic>dbh</italic> mutant by the previously noradrenergic neurons of the LC and/or medulla oblongata in reducing the arousal threshold. This hypothesis is supported by zebrafish studies implicating dopamine in arousal modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgess and Granato, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mu et al., 2012</xref>) as well as work demonstrating that dopaminergic stimulation during anesthesia produces a robust arousal response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, dopamine agonists have been shown to increase locomotion in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rihel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Irons et al., 2013</xref>) and dopamine promotes locomotor development in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41a">Lambert et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The Hcrt neurons of the hypothalamus are a major arousal promoting center. Several lines of evidence suggest that Hcrt promotes arousal, at least in part, via the LC. First, Hcrt neurons send dense projections to the LC in rodents and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peyron et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chemelli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Date et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Horvath et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaslin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prober et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Second, the LC expresses the Hcrt receptor in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Horvath et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourgin et al., 2000</xref>) and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prober et al., 2006</xref>). Third, application of Hcrt peptide depolarizes LC neurons in brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hagan et al., 1999</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourgin et al., 2000</xref>). Fourth, optogenetic activation of Hcrt neurons induces c-Fos expression in the LC of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carter et al., 2012</xref>) and GCaMP6 activation in the LC of zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Fifth, acute inhibition of LC neurons blocks the effect of acute Hcrt neuron activation on sleep to wake transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carter et al., 2012</xref>). While these studies suggest that the LC plays an important role in mediating Hcrt-induced arousal, it was unknown whether NE, a neurotransmitter in the LC, is required for this process. This question is important because the LC produces other neurotransmitters and neuropeptides that have been shown to affect sleep, including dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dzirasa et al., 2006</xref>), neuropeptide Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dyzma et al., 2010</xref>), neurotensin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Erwin and Radcliffe, 1993</xref>) and vasopressin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Born et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>To address this question, we used two independent strategies to drive Hcrt-induced arousal. First, we overexpressed Hcrt using a heat-shock inducible promoter, which was previously shown to decrease sleep in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prober et al., 2006</xref>). We observed that in the absence of NE, sleep reduction was attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Second, we developed a large-scale and non-invasive optogenetic assay and used it to activate Hcrt neurons in freely behaving larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Similar to Hcrt overexpression, activation of Hcrt neurons increased locomotor activity, consistent with the increased sleep-to-wake transitions previously described in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamantidis et al., 2007</xref>). This observation provides evidence of a causal relationship between the activity of Hcrt neurons and locomotor activity in zebrafish, and together with data from the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamantidis et al., 2007</xref>) supports an evolutionarily conserved role of Hcrt neurons in promoting arousal. We found that the arousing effects of Hcrt overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and Hcrt neuron activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) were dramatically reduced in <italic>dbh</italic> mutant larvae, indicating that NE is an important downstream effector of Hcrt-mediated arousal.</p><p>Interestingly, lack of NE did not completely abolish arousal induced by Hcrt overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that Hcrt also promotes arousal via NE-independent pathways. Whether these pathways employ other molecules produced by the LC or are LC-independent remains to be tested. Zebrafish Hcrt neurons also send projections to noradrenergic cells in the medulla oblongata, similar to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ciriello et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that these cells might also mediate Hcrt-induced arousal. Furthermore, in humans, Hcrt neurons are reciprocally connected to other important arousal centers such as the cholinergic basal forebrain, the histaminergic tuberomammillary nucleus, the dopaminergic ventral tegmental area and the serotonergic dorsal raphe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexandre et al., 2013</xref>). Many of these connections are also present in zebrafish, with Hcrt neurons projecting to dopaminergic, histaminergic and serotonergic populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Panula et al., 2010</xref>). Although functional interactions between Hcrt neurons and these populations have yet to be explored in zebrafish, the anatomical and molecular similarities of zebrafish and mammalian brains suggest that at least a portion of Hcrt-induced arousal is likely to be mediated by these centers.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that endogenous NE is required to maintain normal levels of wakefulness in a diurnal vertebrate. This study, together with previous reports in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Crocker and Sehgal, 2008</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ouyang et al., 2004</xref>), support a phylogenetically conserved role for endogenous NE in promoting wakefulness. Furthermore, we showed that NE also plays an important role in mediating arousal induced by either overexpression of the Hcrt peptide or activation of Hcrt neurons. Finally, we established and characterized the zebrafish <italic>dbh</italic> mutant, a useful tool for studying other processes that are thought to involve NE, including the fight-or-flight response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Colwill and Creton, 2011</xref>), congestive heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thomas and Marks, 1978</xref>), cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chalermpalanupap et al., 2013</xref>) and Parkinson's diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rommelfanger et al., 2007</xref>), and neuropsychiatric disorders including depression and ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chamberlain and Robbins, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All experiments followed standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69a">Westerfield, 2000</xref>) in accordance with the California Institute of Technology Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines (animal protocol 1580).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Transgenic and mutant zebrafish</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title><italic>Tg(hcrt:ChR2(H134R)-EYFP</italic></title><p>A 1 kilobase (kb) genomic fragment upstream of zebrafish <italic>hcrt</italic>, described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Faraco et al., 2006</xref>), was amplified using the primers 5′-ATAATAAATAAATCTGATGGGGTTTT-3′ and 5′-GAGTTTAGCTTCTGTCCCCTG-3′, and subcloned 5′ to a transgene encoding the H134R variant of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) fused to EYFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin et al., 2009</xref>), in a plasmid containing Tol2 transposase recognition sequences. This plasmid was co-injected with Tol2 <italic>transposase</italic> mRNA to generate <italic>Tg(hcrt:ChR2-EYFP)</italic> stable transgenic lines. Screening for EYFP expression identified several stable lines, two of which were used for experiments. Both lines expressed EYFP specifically in Hcrt neurons. One line had a single insertion of the transgene and exhibited weak EYFP fluorescence. For the experiment described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, animals heterozygous for the transgene were incrossed to compare sibling larvae exhibiting no EYFP (wild-type) and moderate EYFP (homozygous transgenic) fluorescence. Stimulation of Hcrt neurons using ChR2 had a much stronger effect on locomotor activity in homozygous transgenic animals compared to heterozygotes. We did not use this line in combination with <italic>hcrtr</italic> and <italic>dbh</italic> mutants in the same experiment because the number of larvae of each genotype from a mating was too low to obtain robust data. The second line contained multiple insertions of the transgene and outcrossing these fish produced larvae with EYFP fluorescence intensities ranging from weak to strong. We used this line for experiments that required outcrossing to <italic>hcrtr</italic> or <italic>dbh</italic> mutants in order to obtain larvae with strong ChR2 expression. Adults from this line were mated with <italic>hcrtr or dbh</italic> mutants, and larvae with strong EYFP fluorescence were raised to adulthood. These heterozygous mutants were then incrossed to generate larvae for behavioral experiments. All larvae expressed ChR2-EYFP with varying fluorescent intensities due to multiple insertions of the transgene. At the end of each behavioral experiment, EYFP fluorescence was visualized and only larvae with bright fluorescence were used for analysis.

We outcrossed the <italic>dbh</italic> mutant to the parental TLAB wild type strain three times to reduce the possibility of unlinked mutations, and we did not observe developmental defects that can be indicative of such mutations.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Louis Ptáček, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Singh and colleagues is a nice piece of work that is logical in its progression. One very novel and powerful technical advance is the in vivo optogenetics in a 96 well format. It would be better to not refer to this as “high-throughput” as many think of HTP in the context of biochemical/fluorescent assays that allow easy assessment of many thousand or more of assays. This is clearly HTP for a behavioral analysis though, and the authors could simply tone down the term. This approach takes advantage of the transparency of fish and the ability to excite proteins without surgical implantation that is necessary in mice. This study follows logically from examination of HCRT-&gt;HCRTR-&gt;NE signaling on “wakefulness”. The bottom line is that hypocretin promotes arousal through its receptor in the locus coeruleus (LC) and specifically on NE-expressing cells in the LC. Since the investigators are not technically looking at sleep, more careful language (rest-activity rhythms, “sleep-like behavior”) would be more appropriate. Many of us believe rest activity as described here will be conserved (although not identical) to mammalian sleep. Of course, there will be some periods of inactivity when an animal is awake, thus, the need for greater care with the semantics.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Prazosin is an alpha1 specific antagonist. Its use leads to decreased activity in fish, increased number of bouts of sleep-like behavior, and decreased latency. However, there is no discussion of other receptors, namely alpha2, beta1, and beta2. The <italic>dbh-/-</italic> experiment looks at the effect of decreasing NE which would have effects on all receptors.</p><p>2) Related to #1, the authors don't discuss the discrepancy in Prazosin and <italic>dbh</italic> experiments in panels H of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref>. Prazosin has no effect on bout length at night while it is significantly increased in the <italic>dbh</italic> experiment. How many (if any) paralogous genes exist in zebrafish? Is there redundancy? It is possible that this may relate to alpha1-specific affects vs. global NE affects. One additional experiment is to use clonidine (alpha2 agonist) (or the IV form, Dexmedetomidine), or beta1 antagonists (beta-blockers) to help dissect differential effects on different receptors.</p><p>3) The result that adult <italic>dbh-/-</italic> fish have higher mortality related to normal doses of the anesthetic tricaine is interesting, yet out of place and unsupported by the data provided. You may consider omitting this finding, or explaining better its relevance.</p><p>4) With respect to the prazosin experiments, the investigators overstate the case for the effect not being dopamine-mediated. This would require measuring dopamine levels directly. It would be worthwhile to review (and to reference) the work from Ken Solt's lab showing that DA actions in VTA are important for arousal from anesthesia and to tone down the conclusion to “suggests the affect in not dopamine-mediated”, this may also be useful in the discussion surrounding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>5) The paper claims in several places that “NE is required for Hcrt-induced arousal” (this quote is from the Abstract). This is not true. There is a major quantitative effect in the mutant (and see below) but as the arousal enhancement is not eliminated, this bold statement is incorrect.</p><p>6) It would have been good had they used the drug prazosin in combination with the Hcrt-induced arousal rather than just the mutant fish alone. NE elimination need not be the only effect of the KO, especially as it is systemic and all through development. For example, there could be compensatory changes in the endocrine system. Replication with the drug would increase confidence in the conclusion.</p><p>7) How long was the pretreatment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (how fast-acting is the drug), was a dose-response curve done (where is 100 μM on this curve?), and was the drug used in the <italic>db</italic>h KO fish? Was it without effect as one might predict if it is specific for alpha-adrenergic receptors?</p><p>8) The arousal threshold effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) are rather modest, and enigmatic. First in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, the “increased response rate” (not a response rate, just an enhanced response) is probably just an independent effect as the authors suggest. However, this means that they should replot their data subtracting a fixed value from each mutant response, and then compare with the WT. There may be a relatively small residual effect. Even in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, it is difficult to interpret the magnitude of the effect because it is not clear what the X-axis is (log base 2, base 10?). The fact that the drug and the mutant effects are similar (even if modest) appears to underscore the conclusion but still… And if the drug result (3B) is really more impressive than the mutant (1A), what does this do to the dopamine hypothesis? Perhaps the authors could consider that the excess sleep itself lowers the arousal threshold. (Too much sleep; sleep more lightly?). And the more sleep itself is no surprise. Is this possible?</p><p>9) The role of the LC is also no surprise given what has been done in rodents (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carter et al., 2012</xref>). It is however of value to pinpoint the role of NE within the LC. Given that the effect is far from complete, it means that there are other arousal systems that probably lie downstream of Hcrt – as indicated in the literature. It would be good if the authors discussed some of these and the likelihood that they also play a role in fish.</p><p>10) The authors spend considerable effort emphasizing the controversy in the sleep phenotype of mouse <italic>dbh</italic> knockouts. While it is true that two groups reported different sleep results for those mice, it is unclear whether this fish study truly resolves the controversy – it only provides supporting evidence that NA is wake-promoting in a phylogenetic sense and is consistent with analysis of the role of octopamine in <italic>Drosophila</italic> sleep. The evidence they provide for hypocretin promoting arousal partially via NA is a nice extension of a prior study done in mice by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carter et al. 2012</xref>, which implicated LC neurons in the arousing effects of hypocretin.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07000.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The manuscript by Singh and colleagues is a nice piece of work that is logical in its progression.

We have replaced the term “high-throughput” with “large-scale” because this term is consistent with our ability to assay 96 animals simultaneously, which is a much larger scale behavioral experiment compared to the 5-10 (or fewer) rodents that are typically studied, without evoking the context of high-throughput assays that involve thousands of samples. We also now describe the optogenetic assay as non-invasive, which contrasts with the invasive nature of rodent optogenetic assays, as the reviewers note. Please see the end of our response for a discussion of “sleep” terminology.</p><p><italic>1) Prazosin is an alpha1 specific antagonist.

It is unlikely that all five zebrafish receptors are inhibited by prazosin to the same extent. The differences we observe between the <italic>dbh</italic> mutant and the prazosin treated animals are likely a combination of both imperfect inactivation of all alpha1-adrenergic receptors by prazosin, as well as prazosin having no effect on the alpha2 and beta-adrenergic receptors.</p><p>Zebrafish have five alpha2-adrenergic receptors (<italic>adra2a</italic>, <italic>adra2b</italic>, <italic>adra2c</italic>, <italic>adra2aa</italic>, <italic>adra2ab</italic>) and six beta-adrenergic receptors (<italic>adb1</italic>, <italic>adrbk2</italic>, <italic>adrb2a</italic>, <italic>adrb2b</italic>, <italic>adrb3a</italic>, <italic>adrb3b</italic>). alpha2 receptors are inhibitory and their activation leads to reduction of cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Activation of beta-adrenergic receptors results in increased cAMP levels. As suggested by the reviewer, we have added new experiments in which we used the alpha2 agonist clonidine and the beta1 antagonist bopindolol to investigate the role of these receptors in sleep regulation. The main effect of clonidine treatment is a reduction in day activity and increase in day sleep, with no effect in night activity or sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting a day-specific role for alpha2 receptors in sleep regulation. Bopindolol treatment results in reduction of night activity and increase in both day and night sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>). Similar to prazosin, clonidine and bopindolol may not activate and inhibit the all alpha2 and all beta receptor paralogs, respectively.</p><p>Our pharmacological manipulations do not perfectly recapitulate the <italic>dbh</italic> mutant phenotype. Rather, they serve as an independent set of evidence that noradrenergic signaling regulates sleep in larval zebrafish, as a way to demonstrate that in addition to genetic ablation of <italic>dbh</italic>, acute disruption of noradrenergic signaling also affects sleep, and as a way to investigate which adrenergic receptors mediate different aspects of the <italic>dbh</italic> phenotype. We have updated the manuscript to incorporate the new results, and we are grateful to the reviewers for encouraging us to expand our pharmacological studies.</p><p><italic>3) The result that adult</italic> dbh-/- <italic>fish have higher mortality related to normal doses of the anesthetic tricaine is interesting, yet out of place and unsupported by the data provided. You may consider omitting this finding, or explaining better its relevance.</italic></p><p>We have moved this description to the Methods section. While we agree that this observation is not critical for the paper, this information is nevertheless important for other labs who may wish to use these fish or who may be interested in this phenotype.</p><p><italic>4) With respect to the prazosin experiments, the investigators overstate the case for the effect not being dopamine-mediated. This would require measuring dopamine levels directly. It would be worthwhile to review (and to reference) the work from Ken Solt's lab showing that DA actions in VTA are important for arousal from anesthesia and to tone down the conclusion to “suggests the affect in not dopamine-mediated”, this may also be useful in the discussion surrounding</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref>.</p><p>Please see comment 8.</p><p><italic>5) The paper claims in several places that “NE is required for Hcrt-induced arousal” (this quote is from the Abstract). This is not true. There is a major quantitative effect in the mutant (and see below) but as the arousal enhancement is not eliminated, this bold statement is incorrect</italic>.</p><p>We have modified this statement to emphasize that Hcrt-induced arousal is reduced but not entirely eliminated in <italic>dbh</italic> mutant animals.</p><p><italic>6) It would have been good had they used the drug prazosin in combination with the Hcrt-induced arousal rather than just the mutant fish alone. NE elimination need not be the only effect of the KO, especially as it is systemic and all through development. For example, there could be compensatory changes in the endocrine system</italic>. <italic>Replication with the drug would increase confidence in the conclusion.</italic></p><p>In accordance with the reviewers’ suggestion, we treated <italic>Tg(hsp:Hcrt+/-)</italic> larvae with either vehicle or Prazosin. Hcrt induced arousal following heat shock induced overexpression of Hcrt was inhibited in the presence of prazosin, similarly to what we observed in <italic>dbh</italic> mutants. We have added a new supplementary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>) to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>7) How long was the pretreatment in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>(how fast-acting is the drug), was a dose-response curve done (where is 100 μM on this curve?), and was the drug used in the</italic> dbh <italic>KO fish? Was it without effect as one might predict if it is specific for alpha-adrenergic receptors?</italic></p><p>In our hands prazosin treatment reduces activity and increases sleep within 2 hours of treatment (data not shown). We typically add the drug to the behavioral plate during the 4<sup>th</sup> day of development and record sleep and locomotion starting at the morning of day 5. We have added this information to the manuscript.</p><p>We have tested different concentrations of Prazosin. Although as low as 10 μM of prazosin seems to saturate the sleep response, we noticed that different clutches of larvae showed considerable variability. Thus, in our experiments we raised the concentration we use to 100 μM; at this concentration we see the robust behavioral phenotype described in this manuscript with no lethality. Concentrations above 100 μM were not used, as above this point solubility becomes limiting and we observe formation of precipitate. We have added a new supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>) with the dose response curve (prazosin concentration vs. sleep).</p><p>Also, as suggested by the reviewers we verified that prazosin treatment does not affect the sleep/wake behavior of <italic>dbh</italic> mutants and added this result to the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>8) The arousal threshold effects (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>) are rather modest, and enigmatic. First in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3A</italic></xref><italic>, the “increased response rate” (not a response rate, just an enhanced response) is probably just an independent effect as the authors suggest. However, this means that they should replot their data subtracting a fixed value from each mutant response, and then compare with the WT. There may be a relatively small residual effect. Even in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3B</italic></xref><italic>, it is difficult to interpret the magnitude of the effect because it is not clear what the X-axis is (log base 2, base 10?). The fact that the drug and the mutant effects are similar (even if modest) appears to underscore the conclusion but still… And if the drug result (3B) is really more impressive than the mutant (1A), what does this do to the dopamine hypothesis? Perhaps the authors could consider that the excess sleep itself lowers the arousal threshold</italic>. <italic>(Too much sleep; sleep more lightly?). And the more sleep itself is no surprise. Is this possible?</italic></p><p>Encouraged by the reviewers’ suggestions we made significant improvements to the arousal assay concerning both the mechanical aspects of stimulus delivery and the analysis of collected data. Specifically:</p><p>A) The tapping stimulus is now delivered by two solenoid devices on either side of the 96 well plate which houses the larvae. This ensures more even distribution of the tapping stimulus and allows us to increase its maximum force.</p><p>B) We increased the maximum voltage we can deliver to the solenoids from 12 V to 20 V and thus increased the maximum force the solenoids can deliver to the plate.</p><p>C) We refined the scale of stimuli we can deliver. The initial design allowed for a total of 99 different power settings, whereas the new design allows for over 4000 different settings. This allows us to use in the same experiment very small values that elicit no appreciable response, as well as very strong stimuli.</p><p>D) Finally, in accordance to the suggestion by the reviewers, we now calculate a baseline response ratio by measuring the probability of fish moving 5 seconds prior to the actual stimulus (background movement). This modification makes Figure 3–figure supplement 1 (movement probability in absence of tapping) no longer necessary, so we have removed it.</p><p>These changes to the assay have significantly altered <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The phenotype we observed for <italic>dbh</italic> mutants with the original assay is recapitulated with a more obvious curve shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, we were unable to reproducibly identify any phenotype following prazosin treatment. We presume this is a result of achieving a more accurate stimulus-response curve by employing a wider range of stimuli (changes B and C above) as well as correcting for background movement (change D).</p><p>We also performed the arousal assay using the alpha2 agonist clonidine and the beta antagonist bopindolol. Clonidine did not affect the arousal threshold of treated animals, but bopindolol treatment phenocopied the reduced arousal threshold of <italic>dbh</italic> mutants. These results suggest that acute pharmacological inactivation of beta-adrenergic receptors, but not alpha1 or alpha2 receptors, reduces the arousal threshold of zebrafish larvae.</p><p>Inactivation of dopamine beta hydroxylase is predicted to increase dopamine levels within neurons that normally express <italic>dbh,</italic> since dopamine beta hydroxylase is the enzyme that converts dopamine to norepinephrine. Indeed, dopamine levels have been shown to be higher in <italic>dbh</italic> mice compared to sibling controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thomas et al., 1995</xref>). However, pharmacological inactivation of alpha1 receptors with prazosin, activation of the inhibitory alpha2 receptors with clonidine, or inactivation of the beta receptors with bopindolol do not interfere with the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine. The ability of bopindolol to recapitulate the reduction in arousal threshold seen in the <italic>dbh</italic> mutant suggests that this aspect of the mutant phenotype is a consequence of absence of beta-adrenergic receptor signaling. Furthermore, the inability of prazosin (which increases sleep during day and night) and clonidine (which increases sleep during the day) to recapitulate the arousal threshold phenotype suggests that the observed reduction in arousal threshold in <italic>dbh</italic> mutants is not simply a consequence of excess sleep.</p><p>In the original manuscript we also performed a tap assay in which mutant and drug-treated larvae were exposed to the same stimulus every 5 min. The rationale was to test whether a mutation or a drug treatment differentially affected the behavior of awake larvae (larvae that had moved within the last minute) or asleep larvae (no movement within the last minute). The reason the stimulus was presented every 5 min instead of 1 min was to ensure adequate numbers of asleep fish for each data point. However, this proposition becomes problematic if we expose larvae with very different arousal thresholds to the same stimulus. In other words, even though we present all larvae with a stimulus of the same absolute magnitude, larvae of different genotypes or treated with different drugs can experience a very different subjective stimulus, rendering comparisons among them nonsensical. This limitation became apparent with the improved tapping assay used in the revised manuscript. As a result, we have removed experiments using a 5 minute inter-trial-interval (panels C and D from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that these pharmacological results do not preclude a role of excess dopamine release by the previously noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus and/or medulla oblongata in reducing the arousal threshold. This hypothesis is supported by zebrafish studies implicating dopamine in arousal modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgess and Granato, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mu et al., 2012</xref>) as well as work by the laboratory of Ken Solt demonstrating that dopaminergic stimulation during anesthesia produces a robust arousal response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, dopamine agonists have been shown to increase locomotion in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rihel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Irons et al., 2013</xref>) and dopamine promotes locomotor development in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41a">Lambert et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We have updated the manuscript to reflect the new modifications and results. We have also modified the figure to more clearly highlight the altered response in mutant and drug treated larvae, and to more clearly explain the x-axes.</p><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for the significant improvements this comment, as well as comment #2, brought to the manuscript. We believe that the assay we employ, the way we analyze the data and the way we interpret these data are significantly improved based on the reviewers’ suggestions.</p><p><italic>9) The role of the LC is also no surprise given what has been done in rodents (e.g.,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13"><italic>Carter et al., 2012</italic></xref><italic>). It is however of value to pinpoint the role of NE within the LC. Given that the effect is far from complete, it means that there are other arousal systems that probably lie downstream of Hcrt – as indicated in the literature. It would be good if the authors discussed some of these and the likelihood that they also play a role in fish</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewers pointing out this omission from the Discussion section. We have expanded the discussion of other arousal systems that may lie downstream of Hcrt and the likelihood that they also play a role in fish.</p><p><italic>10) The authors spend considerable effort emphasizing the controversy in the sleep phenotype of mouse</italic> dbh <italic>knockouts. While it is true that two groups reported different sleep results for those mice, it is unclear whether this fish study truly resolves the controversy – it only provides supporting evidence that NA is wake-promoting in a phylogenetic sense and is consistent with analysis of the role of octopamine in</italic> Drosophila <italic>sleep. The evidence they provide for hypocretin promoting arousal partially via NA is a nice extension of a prior study done in mice by</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13"><italic>Carter et al. 2012</italic></xref><italic>, which implicated LC neurons in the arousing effects of hypocretin</italic>.</p><p>We have modified our statements as suggested to emphasize that our results are consistent with the demonstrated role of octopamine in <italic>Drosophila</italic> sleep and with mammalian data suggesting that NA is wake-promoting.</p></body></sub-article></article>
