Production of biofilms by <italic>V. cholerae</italic> requires extracellular matrix components, such as the <italic>Vibrio</italic> exopolysaccharide (VPS) and the matrix proteins RbmA, RbmC, and Bap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yildiz and Schoolnik, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fong and Yildiz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Absalon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berk et al., 2012</xref>). RbmA is thought to capture progeny to the founder cell, thereby enabling cell-cell adhesion and formation of cell clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berk et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, RbmA controls the arrangements of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> cells relative to the substratum during biofilm development, and in turn, governs development of mature biofilm architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drescher et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We previously determined the crystal structure of RbmA, which showed that RbmA is composed of tandem fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giglio et al., 2013</xref>). However, we do not yet understand the molecular mechanisms by which RbmA contributes to biofilm formation. To determine how <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm matrix is built and how biofilms attain their structural integrity, we further characterized RbmA structure and analyzed the RbmA-VPS interaction.

The native RbmA dimer is characterized by two distinct structures at the dimer interface in multiple crystal forms, where residues 91 to 108 of FnIII-1 adopt so-called disordered-loop (D-loop, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top) or ordered-loop (O-loop, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom) conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giglio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maestre-Reyna et al., 2013</xref>). In the O-loop conformation, the βc strand of the FnIII-1 domain is largely unfolded to facilitate a network of interactions between residue D97 and the FnIII-1 and FnIII-2 domains to stabilize the closed dimer interface, whereas these interactions are abolished in the D-loop conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). One key residue interacting with D97 in the O-loop conformation is FnIII-2 residue R234.

We then compared <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H TROSY-HSQC NMR spectra of uniformly <sup>15</sup>N-labeled D97 mutants to wild-type (WT) and R234A RbmA. The overlaid spectra revealed several residues in the FnIII-2 domain, which were distal from any mutation sites that exhibited collinear chemical shifts reporting on a two-state equilibrium in fast exchange, with populations of the two states tuned by different mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The endpoints of this two-state equilibrium are punctuated by the R234A and D97A or D97K mutants, suggesting that they represent discrete structural states of the switch. Each peak for the WT protein was located approximately halfway between the two endpoints, consistent with observations that the protein natively populates both states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giglio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maestre-Reyna et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To identify which of the two endpoints correspond to the O-loop and D-loop states, we also analyzed the truncated, recombinant RbmA* protein, which corresponds to the predicted product of a regulated proteolytic event in vivo that disrupts the FnIII-1 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smith et al., 2015</xref>). Comparing the <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H TROSY-HSQC spectrum of <sup>15</sup>N RbmA* to the full-length variants, we observed a striking similarity of the chemical shifts for the full-length D97 mutants and those of RbmA*, indicating that mutations at D97 lock RbmA into the open, D-loop conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Based on the two states consistently observed in RbmA crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giglio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maestre-Reyna et al., 2013</xref>), this implies that the R234A mutation locks RbmA into the more closed O-loop conformation.</p><p>To determine how changes in this binary switch in the FnIII-1 domain might influence RbmA dimerization state, we performed size exclusion chromatography in-line with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) on our series of purified RbmA variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Consistent with a model where mutations at D97 eliminate O-loop interactions that stabilize the FnIII-1:FnIII-2 dimer interface, both D97A and D97K mutants were predominantly monomeric, while WT and R234A formed stable dimers under these conditions. RbmA* was also found predominantly in its expected monomeric state due to the absence of an intact FnIII-1 domain, although a small fraction (&lt;10%) exhibited higher-order aggregation, likely due to retention of the unfolded FnIII-1 fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These data demonstrate that the O-loop is required to stabilize the FnIII-1:FnIII-2 dimer interface, and that formation of only one O-loop interface in the WT protein is sufficient to stabilize the RbmA dimer.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26163.005</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Size exclusion chromatography in-line with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Construct</th><th>Calculated MW (kDa) (monomer: dimer)</th><th>Observed MW (kDa)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>WT</td><td>26.9: 53.8</td><td>1 peak; 51.8 ± 0.5%</td></tr><tr><td>R234A</td><td>26.9: 53.8</td><td>1 peak; 55.2 ± 0.8%</td></tr><tr><td>D97A</td><td>26.9: 53.8</td><td>1 peaks; 33.8 ± 1.2%, 46.6 ± 8.4%</td></tr><tr><td>D97K</td><td>26.9: 53.8</td><td>1 peak; 30.6 ± 7.9%</td></tr><tr><td>RbmA*</td><td>22.0: 44.0</td><td>2 peaks; 25.7 ± 7.9%, 59.8 ± 20.8%</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>To further explore how the FnIII-1 switch regulates global structural differences in RbmA, we performed limited proteolysis on R234A (O-loop conformation), WT (O-loop and D-loop), and D97A (D-loop conformation) to probe for differential sensitivity to trypsin. We reasoned that the two locked mutants (R234A and D97A) might have signature proteolytic sensitivities that would both be present in the WT protein due to its sampling of the two discrete states. The monomeric D97A mutant was rapidly proteolyzed down to a stable 13 kDa fragment comprising the FnIII-2 domain that was also observed to a lesser degree in the WT protein, but not in the R234A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). The dimeric WT and R234A proteins both remained relatively stable to proteolysis and shared a higher molecular weight tryptic fragment.

We collected <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H HSQC spectra of <sup>15</sup>N RbmA* in the presence and absence of VPS, observing a number of dose-dependent chemical shift perturbations consistent with VPS binding; the same chemical shifts were also found upon titration of VPS into the isolated <sup>15</sup>N FnIII-2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Chemical shift assignment of the isolated FnIII-2 domain allowed us to identify residues throughout the domain with significant VPS-dependent chemical shift perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). When mapped onto the crystal structure of the RbmA dimer, these residues form one contiguous patch on the exposed outer surface of the FnIII-2 domain that likely constitutes the VPS binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This interface is distinct from that used to form the RbmA dimer through interaction with the FnIII-1 domain. The presence of two such motifs on each RbmA dimer therefore suggests the possibility for multivalent binding to VPS. Moreover, solution studies of RbmA have demonstrated that the two halves of the dimer, separated by flexible interdomain linkers, can open to form an extended conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), suggesting that the VPS-binding interface could regulate RbmA function by possibly contributing to the formation of different conformations in solution.</p><p>To determine if R234 plays a direct role in VPS binding, we carried out NMR studies using the isolated <sup>15</sup>N FnIII-2 domain harboring the R234A mutation. Introduction of the mutation induces chemical shift perturbations that are localized primarily at the mutation site on the side of the FnIII-2 domain, which does not overlap with the putative VPS binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Correspondingly, we found minimal effect of the R234A mutation on VPS binding by the full-length proteins in our NMR titration studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>), indicating that R234 does not appear to directly influence VPS binding.</p><p>Because we observed that the FnIII-2 domain interacts directly with VPS, we analyzed the contribution of individual FnIII domains and RbmA* in colony biofilm formation. To this end, we expressed the coding regions of wild-type RbmA, isolated FnIII domains, or RbmA* in trans and examined ability of these proteins to complement a defect in colony biofilm phenotypes of the Δ<italic>rbmA</italic> strain. Δ<italic>rbmA</italic> strains harboring various expression plasmids phenocopied the Δ<italic>rbmA</italic> strain carrying vector when grown in the absence of inducer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Expression of the FnIII-2 domain in any form (p<italic>rbmA</italic>, p<italic>rbmA*</italic>, pFnIII-2) partially complemented the colony biofilm phenotype, indicating that FnIII-2 domain alone can contribute to biofilm architecture. Expression of FnIII-1 domain alone in the Δ<italic>rbmA</italic> strain increased colony compactness when compared to Δ<italic>rbmA</italic> harboring the vector, albeit to smaller extent, suggesting that the FnIII-1 domain alone, at least in part, may also contribute to biofilm development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The importance of matrix proteins for assembly and structural integrity of biofilms is well documented in several microbial species.

In <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, amyloid-like fiber-producing protein TasA, bacterial hydrophobin BslA, and an exopolysaccharide are required for formation of mature biofilm architecture and development of a hydrophobic layer on the surface of biofilms. It is proposed that TasA, BslA, and exopolysaccharide interact to facilitate matrix assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Branda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ostrowski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kobayashi and Iwano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hobley et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, biofilm formation relies on polysaccharides (VPS) and the matrix proteins RbmA, RbmC, and Bap1. The molecular interactions between matrix components and the mechanisms by which bacteria achieve spatial segregation of exopolysaccharides and proteins within the biofilm are poorly understood. This study demonstrates that a patch on the exposed outer surface of the FnIII-2 domain of RbmA binds to VPS and that RbmA has a bistable switch that influences dimerization and the formation of higher-order oligomers of RbmA with VPS. Regulation of RbmA structure by structural dynamics plays a critical role in its ability to modulate biofilm architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26163.021</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Models of various RbmA variants and their involvement in biofilm formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon models representing the various RbmA oligomerization and switch states.

VPS represented in blue and enhanced VPS localization around the biofilm cluster is represented as a thick blue line.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-26163-fig7-v2"/></fig><p>We speculate that during initial stages of biofilm formation, when concentrations of secreted VPS are low, full-length RbmA is best able to capture cell surface-localized VPS with high avidity due to the presence of two FnIII-2 domains in the dimer. Since the binary switch in RbmA is inherently dynamic, the O-loop and D-loop states that are present at FnIII-1:FnIII-2 dimer interfaces therefore have the potential to regulate the formation of distinct higher-order RbmA-VPS structures. We observed that locking both of the FnIII-1:FnIII-2 interfaces into the closed, O-loop state with the R234A mutation enhanced the formation of VPS-dependent higher-order structures, leading to the formation of biofilm with reduced corrugation, increased cell-cell distance, and altered RbmA localization. Additionally, VPS staining in R234A strain is reduced, which could be a result from decreased accessibility of lectin targets due to strong interaction of RbmA-R234A to VPS. By contrast, the D97A/K mutations that open the protein to a monomeric state more closely resemble the native cellular organization in the biofilm. Therefore, it appears that the ability of RbmA to take on an open, D-loop state is apparently critical for governing biofilm architecture.</p><p>Enhanced interaction of RbmA with VPS could affect a network of interactions between VPS and other matrix proteins. Our earlier work showed that sustained incorporation of VPS throughout biofilms requires RbmC and that in the absence of RbmA, distribution of Bap1 and RbmC around the cluster envelope is altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berk et al., 2012</xref>). It is likely that localization of RbmC and VPS is altered in R234A strain, leading to altered biofilm architecture and stability. RbmA has also been shown to bind to glycans found in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> lipopolysaccharide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maestre-Reyna et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, it is also possible that interaction of RbmA with other cell surface polysaccharides or biofilm matrix proteins may be governed by conformational dynamics to regulate cell-spacing and biofilm architecture.</p><p>As biofilm formation progresses, RbmA undergoes a regulated proteolytic event that shifts the entire population of RbmA to the monomeric, open D-loop state that we observed with the RbmA* variant. We determined that RbmA FnIII-2 domain is sufficient for VPS binding in vitro and that expression of FnIII-2 domain or RbmA* alone is able to confer colony corrugation, suggesting that the FnIII-2 domain and RbmA* can cross link VPS polymers. RbmA* might be expected to exhibit reduced affinity for VPS, due to the presence of only one FnIII-2 domain in the monomer. However, at this stage of biofilm formation, increased production and accumulation of VPS in the biofilm could possibly compensate for this reduced affinity. Interestingly, it has been reported that while full-length RbmA only binds VPS-producing cells, RbmA* binds both VPS-producing and non-producing cells suggesting a mechanism by which proteolytic regulation of RbmA may help recruit cells that have not yet initiated VPS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smith et al., 2015</xref>). While we know that RbmA proteolysis occurs when cells are entering early stationary growth phase due to production of HapA, PrtV and IvaP proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smith et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hatzios et al., 2016</xref>), where RbmA proteolysis is taking place within the biofilm during its formation and the complete consequences of proteolytic processing of RbmA remain to be determined.</p><p>Our study revealed how behavior of an individual biofilm matrix component contributes to biofilm architecture. Shifting the structural dynamics of RbmA appears to be an important mechanism regulating biofilm formation and shaping biofilm architecture. A patch on the exposed outer surface of the FnIII-2 domain constitutes the VPS binding site and binding of VPS to the outer surface of the RbmA dimer is a likely key step in mediating cell-cell adhesion in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilms. Future studies will elucidate which components of VPS are important for interactions with RbmA, as well as defining the VPS binding site on the protein at high resolution to provide a complete picture of how RbmA interacts with VPS and contribute to the construction of biofilm matrix.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains, plasmids, and culture conditions</title><p>The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>.

For thin sectioning, the bacterial colonies were imaged using a Keyence VHX 1000 digital microscope before they were covered by an additional 1.5 mm agar layer. Colonies sandwiched between two 1.5 mm agar layers were lifted from the bottom layer and soaked for 4 hr in 50 mM L-lysine in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) at 4°C, then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 50 mM L-lysine, PBS (pH 7.4) for 4 hr at 4°C, then overnight at 37°C. Fixed samples were washed twice in PBS and dehydrated through a series of ethanol washes (25%, 50%, 70%, 95%, 3 × 100%) for 60 min each. Samples were cleared via three 60 min incubations in Histoclear-II (National Diagnostics), and then infiltrated for 4 hr at 55°C with 100% paraffin wax (Paraplast Xtra), which polymerized overnight at 4°C. Trimmed blocks were sectioned (10 μm-thick sections perpendicular to the plane of the bacterial colony spots), floated onto water at 45°C, and collected onto slides. Slides were air-dried overnight, heat-fixed on a hotplate for 1 hr at 52°C, and rehydrated in the reverse order of processing. Rehydrated samples were immediately mounted in TRIS-buffered DAPI:Fluorogel (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Time-lapse and thin section microscopy studies were carried out with three biological replicates.</p><p>For flow-cell biofilm studies, Ibidi μ-Slide VI0.4 (Ibidi 80601, Ibidi LLC, Verona, WI) flow-cell chambers were inoculated with 100 μL of overnight-grown cultures, normalized to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.02. Flow-cell chambers were incubated at room temperature for 1 hr, then flow of diluted LB (0.2 g/L tryptone, 0.1 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L NaCl, pH 7.5) was initiated at a rate of 20 mL/h and continued for up to 24 hr. Confocal images were obtained on a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, Dublin, CA). Images were obtained with a 40 dry objective and were processed using Imaris software (Biplane, South Windsor, CT). Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) were carried out with at least two biological replicates. Colony forming units (CFU) from the effluent of flow-cells in the CLSM experiments were quantified by dilution plating and were repeated with two biological replicates.</p><p>For single-cell resolution microscopy of biofilms, GFP-expression plasmid pNUT542 was introduced into the relevant strains, which conferred a gentamycin resistance. The strains were grown in M9 minimal medium, supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) glucose and 30 μg/mL gentamycin, to mid-exponential growth phase, before introducing into microfluidic channels, which consisted of a trench in a polydimethylsiloxane block that was O<sub>2</sub>-plasma-bonded to a glass coverslip. The resulting flow chambers had a width of 500 μm, height of 100 μm, and length of 7 mm. After the cultures were introduced into the channels, the channels were incubated at 24°C for 1 hr without any flow, to allow cells to attach to the bottom glass surface of the channels. The flow was then set to 1 μL/min, corresponding to an average flow speed of 330 μm/s in the channel, for the remainder of the experiment. While the medium was flown through the channel, the biofilm architecture of the different strains was imaged every 30–60 min for approximately 20 hr. Images were acquired with an Olympus 100x objective with numerical aperture of 1.35, using a Yokogawa spinning disk confocal scanner and laser excitation at 488 nm. Images were acquired at spatial resolution of 63 nm in the <italic>xy</italic> plane and 400 nm along the <italic>z</italic> direction.</p><p>To detect all single cells and measure architectural properties of the biofilms grown in flow chambers, images were analyzed using custom code developed in Matlab, which was significantly improved from previous single-cell imaging methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drescher et al., 2016</xref>). The custom code is available online at GitHub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hartmann, 2017</xref>; a copy is archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/single-cell-analysis">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/single-cell-analysis</ext-link>). Briefly, cells were automatically identified using edge detection algorithms, before clumps were broken up using a watershed algorithm. Cellular orientations were obtained by mapping an ellipsoid onto each cell using principal component analysis. Nematic refers to liquid crystal ‘state’ that some materials can exhibit under certain conditions and such materials assume thread-like formations. Molecules in this state do not exhibit any positional order but they exhibit a certain degree of orientational order. The vectors of the major cell axes were used to determine the value of the local nematic order parameter, defined as, S =&lt;3/2 (<bold>n</bold><italic><sub>i</sub></italic>.<bold>n</bold><italic><sub>j</sub></italic>)<sup>2</sup> −1/2&gt;, where <bold>n</bold><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> is the orientation vector of a particular cell and <bold>n</bold><italic><sub>j</sub></italic> are the orientation vectors of cells in the local vicinity, within a local vicinity defined by a sphere of radius 3 μm around each cell. Vertical alignment of cells was calculated as the angle of each cell with the vertical <italic>z</italic>-axis. The average distance to the nearest neighbor were calculated for each cell based on cell-centroid coordinates. Single-cell resolution microscopy was performed on biofilm colonies with three biological replicates per strain.</p><p>For localization of RbmA and VPS during biofilm growth, cells expressed the red fluorescent protein mRuby from the plasmid pNUT1029, driven by a constitutively active P<sub>tac</sub> promoter. For RbmA localization, biofilms were grown in M9 medium containing 1 μg/mL of c-Myc tag monoclonal antibody (9E10) conjugated to Alexa Flour 488 (Thermo Scientific) and 1 mg/mL of filter-sterilized bovine serum albumin (BSA). For VPS localization, biofilms were grown in M9 medium containing 20 μg/mL wheat-germ agglutinin (WGA) conjugated to FITC and 20 μg/mL Concanavalin A conjugated to FITC (Sigma), and 1 mg/mL of filter-sterilized BSA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy</title><p>All NMR experiments were conducted at 35°C on either a Varian 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N cryoprobe or a Bruker 900 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm CP TCI (<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>2</sup>H) cryoprobe.

VPS titration experiments were performed by collecting <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra at 35°C on either a 600 MHz with 100 μM <sup>15</sup>N FnIII-2 domain (WT or R234A) or <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC or 1D <sup>1</sup>H spectra at 900 MHz on 100 μM <sup>15</sup>N full-length RbmA proteins (WT, R234A, D97A, and RbmA*) in the presence of increasing concentrations of VPS. Samples were brought up to 300 μL with NMR buffer and adjusted with D<sub>2</sub>O to a final concentration of 10% (v/v). All HSQC titration data were visualized and analyzed with NMRViewJ. Chemical shift perturbations defined by the equation Δδ<sub>TOT</sub> = [(Δδ<sup>1</sup>H)<sup>2</sup> + (χ(Δδ<sup>15</sup>N)<sup>2</sup>]<sup>½</sup> and normalized with the scaling factor χ = 0.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson, 2004</xref>). TROSY-HSQC spectra were processed with 48 Hz shifts in both <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>1</sup>H dimensions to align HSQC and TROSY-HSQC spectra. 1D <sup>1</sup>H NMR data were processed and analyzed with MestReNova. A decrease in peak intensity (i.e. broadening) can arise from several different phenomena, including formation of high molecular weight species with poor relaxation properties or chemical exchange between two or more species on an intermediate timescale; these properties and considerations for the interpretation of NMR data are explained in more detail in the reviews on NMR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kleckner and Foster, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kwan et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>SEC-MALS</title><p>All experiments were performed on a Superdex S75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) with a sample injection volume of 250 μL and a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min at 4°C. The volume of the sample loop was 100 μL. Molecular weight markers used to calibrate the column were: albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) from the Low Molecular Weight Gel-filtration Calibration kit (GE Healthcare). Absolute molecular weight calculations were obtained by static light scattering in line with size exclusion chromatography using the Wyatt Optilab T-rEX refractometer and miniDAWN Treos multiangle light scattering system at 4°C. Protein concentrations were monitored by the refractometer and light scattering unit directly after the gel filtration column.

Reactions were quenched with addition of an equal volume of 2X SDS Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) and samples were boiled at 95°C for 5 min. Digested fragments were resolved by 18% SDS-PAGE and detected by Coomassie stain. For mass determination, proteolysis reactions were quenched in parallel by addition of formic acid to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). Samples were desalted and separated by HPLC (Surveyor; Thermo Finnegan) on a Proto 300 C4 reverse-phase column with a 100 mm x 2.1 mm inner diameter and 5 μm particle size (Higgins Analytical, Inc.) using a mobile phase consisting of solvent A (0.1% formic acid in HPLC grade water) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). Samples were then analyzed on an LTQ Orbitrap linear ion mass spectrometer system (Thermo Finnegan). Proteins were detected by full-scan MS mode (over an m/z of 300–2000) in positive mode with the electrospray voltage set to 5 kV. Mass measurements of deconvoluted electrospray ionization mass spectra of the reversed-phase peaks were generated by Magtran software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Total proteins (10 μg) extracted from whole-cell (WC) or precipitated from culture supernatant (CS) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF for Western blot analysis, following previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giglio et al., 2013</xref>).

Anti-RNAP was also used to verify that the culture supernatant samples were not contaminated with whole-cell proteins. For samples harvested from colony biofilms, rabbit anti-OmpU polyclonal antiserum was used as a loading control. Secondary goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Paso Robles, CA) was used at a dilution of 1:2500.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structural dynamics of RbmA governs plasticity of <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> biofilms&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Philip Cole (Senior Editor) and four reviewers, one of whom, Dianne K Newman (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alex Persat (Reviewer #2); Matthew R Parsek (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Consensus Review:</p><p>Your work has been reviewed by three individuals with expertise in the biofilm matrix, biofilm biomechanics, and NMR. We all agree this work represents an exciting step forward for the biofilm field, and look forward to seeing it published in <italic>eLife</italic>. That said, we would like you to pay attention to the following major points when revising the manuscript for publication. Though careful revision might suffice in addressing the first two comments, please consider additional limited experimentation if this would help you respond to these concerns even better:</p><p>1) Connect the molecular to the cellular scale by investigating how dimerization and VPS binding play a role in biofilm structure: explain how RbmA dimerization and binding to VPS modulates biofilm architecture at the larger scale. From Berk et al., we know that the spatial patterning of RbmA and VPS are an important part of biofilm architecture. Given the obvious phenotype of R234A in nearest neighbor distances and its increased affinity to VPS, one could expect a dramatic change in the distribution of both RbmA and VPS, although there might be other hypothesis. To understand this, one possibility would be to use the labeling system the authors described previously (Berk et al) to visualize the spatial distribution of the different matrix components in single cell level visualizations.</p><p>2) Provide more information on the NMR data collection and processing. Information on extent of signal assignment and whether the assignment was deposited in a suitable repository should be included in the manuscript. It appears that 3mm tubes were used to perform the NMR experiments but it should be explicitly stated if the probes and tube were of 3 mm. It is not clear if only the 3D experiments mentioned were used for performing the signal assignment. No indication of whether those data were deposited in an appropriate repository, for example BMRB, degree of completeness of the assignment… the only hint we have is derived indirectly from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Is there an assignment for the region of residue 97? Having the assignment it is possible to measure the dynamics of the residues by T1, T2 and hetero-NOE and this would indeed tell us if we are observing changes in structural dynamics instead of equilibrium shift.</p><p>The authors mention that the two states observed in the X-ray data are in fast exchange in the NMR data but that statement is only marginally supported by the data reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows discreet positions for discreet mutants. Shift changes are collinear, which is compatible with two-state fast exchange but does not prove that there are only two states, nor that they are in any way related with what was observed crystallographically. The authors mention that RbmA samples both O and D loop states. This can be confirmed by collecting data at different temperatures, which would change the equilibrium position and the exchange kinetics.</p><p>3) Clarify more explicitly in the Introduction what the question is that this manuscript seeks to address. Explain clearly what the novelty is. Explain how your study extends the work of Giglio 2013. If this is the first study to show at the molecular level how higher-order structure assemble in the matrix, state that. If not, explain how is it builds on other efforts of this type. In the Discussion, remind the reader of what makes this work particularly significant. Comment on how generalizable the results might be.</p><p>4) Fix figures so they can be read by a color-blind person.

Is there an assignment for the region of residue 97? Having the assignment it is possible to measure the dynamics of the residues by T1, T2 and hetero-NOE and this would indeed tell us if we are observing changes in structural dynamics instead of equilibrium shift.</italic> </p><p>The chemical shift assignments for the isolated FnIII-2 domain of RbmA were deposited in the BMRB database (BMRB 27130) to be released upon publication. We assigned 93% of the total non-proline backbone amides in the protein construct (including 99% of the non-proline residues originating from the FnIII-2 domain itself). We have added more information about data collection (including the 5 mm diameter tube used in our experiments) and clarified the exact spectra used for chemical shift assignment in the Materials and methods section of the manuscript.</p><p>As stated in the manuscript, we were only able to obtain assignments for the isolated FnIII-2 domain. This was largely due to issues with aggregation of the isolated FnIII-1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, black spectrum) and some challenges working with the full-length proteins that limited us to working with relatively low concentrations (100 µM) in order to prevent formation of soluble aggregates that limited signal to noise. Our spectra of the full-length proteins (WT, R234A and D97A/D97K) were all dominated by peaks that appear to originate from the FnIII-2 domain. Moreover, overlays of the isolated FnIII-2 domain (blue) with the spontaneously cleaved version of the full-length protein (orange) or engineered, truncated version RbmA* (magenta) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> also showed that the FnIII-2 domain represents the functionally relevant domain in these cleaved species. Therefore, while we do not have assignments for the region around residue 97 in the FnIII-1 domain loop, we believe that our NMR studies that focus on residues in the FnIII-2 domain faithfully report on changes in the intact RbmA protein. We agree that having complete chemical shift assignments would open up new avenues for experimentation, but we are currently limited by technical challenges with the full-length protein.</p><p>Therefore, without assignments for the FnIII-1 domain loop, we cannot easily address protein dynamics in the full-length protein using T1, T2 and hetero-NOE experiments by NMR spectroscopy. Although this is an interesting idea, it’s not clear that there would be enough change in the flexibility of individual domains between the open and closed states given the very short length of the interdomain linker (only 5 residues) to register with these NMR approaches. However, we provide biochemical data in support of a role for D97 and R234 mutations in fundamentally altering more than just structural dynamics at the FnIII-1 loop. Our SEC-MALS data clearly show that D97A and D97K mutations lead to monomerization of RbmA, similar to that observed by truncating the protein in the native-like RbmA* mutant that lacks the FnIII-1 domain loop. By contrast, the R234A mutant maintains dimer formation similar to WT and is even more resistant to proteolysis, suggesting that it locks the protein down into a more ‘closed’ conformation.</p><p><italic>The authors mention that the two states observed in the X-ray data are in fast exchange in the NMR data but that statement is only marginally supported by the data reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows discreet positions for discreet mutants. Shift changes are collinear, which is compatible with two-state fast exchange but does not prove that there are only two states, nor that they are in any way related with what was observed crystallographically. The authors mention that RbmA samples both O and D loop states. This can be confirmed by collecting data at different temperatures, which would change the equilibrium position and the exchange kinetics.</italic> </p><p>We agree that our conclusion that the collinear chemical shifts we observe with RbmA mutants are indicative of two-state fast exchange is one of a few possible conclusions. However, we believe this is the most parsimonious interpretation of the data, as the NMR data are supported by existing structural data and biochemical assays that probe the two discrete conformational states of the proteins.</p><p>Collectively, we believe that the following data provide strong support for our conclusion:</p><p>First, the loop in question from the FnIII-1 domain exists in one of these two discrete states (open or closed) in all known crystal structures, several of which originated from different space groups (PDBs: 4BE5, 4BE6, 4BEI, 4KKP, 4KKQ, 4KKR). Therefore, the two states of this loop observed in these crystal structures are unlikely to be an artifact of crystal packing.</p><p>Second, the two sets of mutations that we identify in our study appear to recapitulate the two endpoint states of this equilibrium (R234A, closed and D97A/K, open), while the WT protein populates each state approximately equally. We have biochemical data in support of our conclusion that the D97A/K mutants represent the open conformation (i.e., one endpoint of this conformational equilibrium) – namely, we collected NMR spectra on the truncated RbmA* protein that must represent the open state due to truncation of the N-terminal domain – this mutant <italic>cannot</italic> form the closed state because it lacks the required loop in the FnIII-1 domain. <italic>Importantly, spectra of this RbmA* protein directly overlay the D97A/K mutants at each of the sites in the FnIII-2 domain that report on this two-state exchange</italic>, strongly suggesting that the collinear shifts report on fast exchange between an open state and a state defined by the R234A mutant.</p><p>Third, based on the known binary conformations of the FnIII-1 domain loop, we propose that it is reasonable to assume that the R234A mutant represents the closed state. We tested this by limited proteolysis, using our series of mutant proteins to explore differences in their conformational states. Our data clearly demonstrate that the D97A mutant is highly sensitive to proteolysis at the interdomain linker and is rapidly cleaved to the minimal FnIII-2 domain that is similar to RbmA*. This same proteolytic fragment is also observed in the wild-type protein although at much lower abundance, consistent with fast exchange of this open conformation with a more closed and protected conformation. By contrast, the R234A mutant is largely resistant to proteolysis, consistent with a more stable, closed conformation. As the reviewer points out, it is true that the NMR data in “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows discreet positions for discreet mutants”; however, it is quite rare to have three reporter sites, all quite distant from the site of mutation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, panel G), that exhibit collinear shifts that report on the same putative behavior. Therefore, we believe that our biochemical data collectively support our conclusion that the collinear chemical shifts report on a two-state equilibrium in fast exchange between open and closed loops.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to use temperature as a variable to probe exchange kinetics – this is a great idea. However, we have not been able to collect usable NMR data on <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup>N RbmA at significantly different temperatures, as we are limited by the size and stability of the protein. In order to get decent TROSY spectra on the full-length proteins (a ~60 kDa dimer for R234A and WT proteins), we already must collect data at 35°C – in fact, spectra obtained at 25°C exhibit significantly poorer quality (data not shown). However, the protein is not stable at temperatures above 40°C for the prolonged times required for acquire these TROSY spectra (~3 hrs) at the low concentrations of RbmA that we had to work with. Therefore, we have not yet been able to use temperature to probe dynamics in this system.</p><p><italic>3) Clarify more explicitly in the Introduction what the question is that this manuscript seeks to address.
