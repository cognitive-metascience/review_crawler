While the homeostasis of nutrients is highly intertwined, the molecular and genetic mechanisms of these dependencies remain poorly understood. Here, we report a discovery of a molecular pathway that controls phosphate (Pi) accumulation in plants under Zn deficiency. Using genome-wide association studies, we first identified allelic variation of the <italic>Lyso-PhosphatidylCholine (PC) AcylTransferase 1</italic> (<italic>LPCAT1</italic>) gene as the key determinant of shoot Pi accumulation under Zn deficiency. We then show that regulatory variation at the LPCAT1 locus contributes significantly to this natural variation and we further demonstrate that the regulation of <italic>LPCAT1</italic> expression involves bZIP23 TF, for which we identified a new binding site sequence. Finally, we show that in Zn deficient conditions loss of function of <italic>LPCAT1</italic> increases the phospholipid Lyso-PhosphatidylCholine/PhosphatidylCholine ratio, the expression of the Pi transporter PHT1;1, and that this leads to shoot Pi accumulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>natural variation</kwd><kwd>phosphate homeostasis</kwd><kwd>zinc deficiency</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006488</institution-id><institution>Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rouached</surname><given-names>Hatem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Austrian Academy of Sciences through Gregor Mendel Institure</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Busch</surname><given-names>Wolfgang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001826</institution-id><institution>ZonMw</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>no. 40-41009-98-11084</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aarts</surname><given-names>Mark GM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Iraq Government Doctoral Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kisko</surname><given-names>Mushtak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Région Languedoc-Roussillon: Chercheurd'Avenir/Projet Cofinancé par le Fonds Européen de Développement Regional</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rouached</surname><given-names>Hatem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phosphate accumulation in zinc-deficient <italic>Arabidobsis</italic> shoots is regulated by a pathway involving the transcription factor bZIP23, the phospholipid-remodelling enzyme LPCAT1 and the transporter PHT1;1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All living organisms require an adequate supply of nutrients for growth and survival. Nutrient deficiencies lead to decreased plant survival and lower nutritional value of foods, which have a profound impact on human health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Myers et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) deficiencies affect up to 2 billion people worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hilty et al., 2010</xref>). According to the World Health Organization, about 800,000 child deaths per year are attributable to Zn deficiency alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akhtar, 2013</xref>). The widespread occurrence of deficiencies in micronutrients such as Zn and Fe in human populations is due to low dietary intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rouached, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Myers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shahzad et al., 2014</xref>). In the light of crop optimization for yield and nutritional quality, it is therefore an important goal to understand the genetic and molecular basis of plant nutrition. A complicating circumstance is that plant uptake, storage and use of these nutrients are partly dependent of each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rouached and Rhee, 2017</xref>). For instance, physiological Zn deficiency leads to over-accumulation of phosphorus (P) in the shoots (for review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bouain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kisko et al., 2015</xref>). Noteworthy, when the Zn supply is low, increasing P supply causes a reduction of plant height, delayed development and severe leaf symptoms including chlorosis and necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ova et al., 2015</xref>). At high P supplies, Zn deficiency associated with elevated shoot P levels causes P toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marschner, 2012</xref>). Interestingly, this P-Zn interaction is also recognized in a wide variety of other biological systems, including rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wallwork et al., 1983</xref>), human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sandström and Lönnerdal, 1989</xref>), and multiple fungal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Freimoser et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> yeast, the Zn status acts as a major determinant of the ability to store P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Simm et al., 2007</xref>). Much like Zn nutrition, P homeostasis is of global relevance as current agricultural practices require large amounts of P. At the same time, world-wide P reserves are becoming increasingly scarce and a potential P crisis looms for agriculture at the end of this 21 st century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abelson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Neset and Cordell, 2012</xref>). How P and Zn homeostases are coordinated is therefore not only a fundamental biological question but has also serious implications for global agronomic and biotechnological applications.</p><p>P is a critical component of many metabolites and macromolecules, including nucleic acids and phospholipids (PLs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Poirier and Bucher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rouached et al., 2010</xref>). Of equal importance, Zn provides chemical, structural and regulatory functions in biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Christianson, 1991</xref>), for instance as cofactor for hundreds of enzymes, or by binding to PLs to maintain membrane structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Binder et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sinclair and Krämer, 2012</xref>). Plants have evolved the ability to adjust to large fluctuations in external P or Zn supply. P is taken up by the root system in the form of inorganic phosphate (Pi). In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Arabidopsis), this uptake relies on members of the high affinity Pi transporter family (PHT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nussaume et al., 2011</xref>), of which PHT1;1 is the major contributor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ayadi et al., 2015</xref>). Upon P deficiency, the expression of some <italic>PHT1</italic> transporters increases as a result of the activation of the ‘PHR1-miR399-PHO2’ signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bari et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pant et al., 2008</xref>), causing a strong increase in the acquisition of Pi and its subsequent translocation to the shoots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pant et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in sensing and signalling of Pi abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chiou and Lin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), little is known about how plants sense and signal Zn deficiency. A putative working model of Zn deficiency signalling was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Assunção et al. (2013)</xref>, which is centred around two essential members of the bZIP transcription factor (TF) family in Arabidopsis, bZIP19 and bZIP23, without which plants are unable to respond to Zn starvation by inducing the expression of genes involved in Zn uptake and distribution such as the zinc transporter ZIP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Assunção et al., 2010</xref>). Beyond common set of genes targeted by these two TFs, each TF could regulate distinct genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Inaba et al., 2015</xref>), but the identity of distinctive binding site recognized by each remains poorly unknown. Identifying such binding motif is necessary to better understand how plants regulate Zn homeostasis.</p><p>The interaction between Zn and Pi homeostasis in plants is also obvious at the molecular level (for reviews, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bouain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kisko et al., 2015</xref>). For instance, Zn deprivation causes an up-regulation of <italic>PHT1;1</italic> and consequently an over-accumulation of Pi in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jain et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khan et al., 2014</xref>). The expression of Pi uptake transporters is normally tightly controlled in roots in response to the P status of the plant, but it is clear that this tight control is lost under Zn deficiency. Remarkably, although the involvement of PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1 transcription factor (PHR1) in the coordination of Pi-Zn homeostasis has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khan et al., 2014</xref>), the Zn deficiency-induced Pi uptake transporter expression is independent of the aforementioned canonical ‘PHR1-miR399-PHO2’ signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khan et al., 2014</xref>), indicative of room for new discoveries in Pi homeostasis under Zn deficiency in plants.</p><p>In this study, we set out to identify the genes controlling such novel mechanisms to cause Pi accumulation in shoots of Zn-deficient Arabidopsis plants. Genome wide association (GWA) mapping was employed using a subset of 223 Arabidopsis accessions from the RegMap panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horton et al., 2012</xref>), which enabled us to demonstrate that there is heritable natural variation of Pi accumulation in responses to Zn deficiency and that one major locus governing this is the <italic>LysoPhosphatidylCholine AcylTransferase 1</italic> (<italic>LPCAT1</italic>) gene.Under Zn deficiency, <italic>lpcat1</italic> mutants showed an alteration in the phospholipids <italic>Lyso-PhosphatidylCholine/PhosphatidylCholine</italic> (Lyso-PC/PC) ratio, and an up-regulation of the expression of the main high affinity Pi transporter gene <italic>PHT1;1</italic>. Finally, we demonstrate that <italic>LPCAT1</italic> acts downstream of one of the two key Zn starvation signalling TFs, bZIP23, for which we identified a new binding site sequence. Overall, this study uncovered a novel pathway, in which <italic>LPCAT1</italic> plays a key role in the coordination of Pi homeostasis and Zn deficiency response in plants through modulation of phospholipid metabolism and Pi transporter expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GWAS identify two candidate genes involved in the accumulation of Pi in the shoot under zn deficiency</title><p>To identify genes regulating shoot Pi concentration under Zn deficiency, genome wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted. To do so, a diverse set of 223 Arabidopsis accessions, selected from the RegMap panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horton et al., 2012</xref>) was grown on agar medium supplemented with (+Zn) or without Zn (–Zn) for 18 days, before assessing their shoot Pi concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). As expected, Zn deficiency in shoots of Col-0 plants was associated with the induction of the expression of two Zn-deficiency marker genes, <italic>ZIP4</italic> and <italic>ZIP12</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jain et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Under the +Zn condition, shoot Pi concentration varied across the 223 accessions from 3 to 10 μmol of Pi per gram of fresh weight (median ~5.45 μmol.gram<sup>−1</sup> fresh weight of Pi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) while in -Zn, it increased to 4–16 μmol of Pi per gram of fresh weight (median ~8.23 μmol.gram<sup>−1</sup> fresh weight of Pi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). .The broad-sense heritability (H<sup>2</sup>) of the shoot Pi concentrations was 0.63 and 0.47 under +Zn and –Zn conditions, respectively. Using the genotype and the shoot Pi concentration as input, we performed a mixed model (AMM method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Seren et al., 2012</xref>]) GWAS that corrects for population structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Korte et al., 2012</xref>) for both Zn conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>). Using a non-conservative 10% false discovery threshold (FDR), we identified 13 significant SNPs in five distinct genomic loci to be associated with Pi concentration in the shoots, which was specific for the –Zn condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The most significantly associated SNP (p-value=5.86*10<sup>−8</sup>; FDR 1%) was located on Chromosome 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). A haplotype analysis centred on the 50 kb region surrounding the significantly associated SNP revealed one main haplotype (depicted in purple) that was associated with the marker SNP and high Pi concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The significantly associated SNP was located at the upstream and coding regions of two candidate genes, namely <italic>At1g12640</italic> and <italic>At1g12650</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). <italic>At1g12650</italic> encodes an unknown protein likely to be involved in mRNA splicing via the spliceosome, and <italic>At1g12640</italic> encodes a member of the <italic>Membrane Bound O-Acyl Transferase</italic> (<italic>MBOAT)</italic> gene family known as <italic>LysoPhosphatidylCholine AcylTransferase 1</italic> (<italic>LPCAT1,</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2012</xref>]). LPCAT1 is an evolutionarily conserved key enzyme that is involved in phospholipid metabolism and more precisely in the Lands cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lands, 1960</xref>). In Arabidopsis LPCAT1 has been shown to catalyze the conversion of lysophosphatidylcholine (Lyso-PC) to produce phosphatidylcholine (PC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32077.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genome-wide association (GWA) analysis of Arabidopsis shoot Pi concentration.</title><p>223 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions were grown supplemented with zinc (+Zn) or without zinc (-Zn) for 18 days under long day conditions, upon which shoot inorganic phosphate (Pi) concentrations were determined.

An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed, using a 30 bp promoter fragment containing the 10 bp potential ZDRE, which confirmed that both bZIP19 and bZIP23 could bind to this <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), as had already been shown by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Assunção et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Further analysis of the regulatory regions of <italic>LPCAT1</italic> led us to identify a new motif GTGTCGAA (5’ untranslated region of <italic>LPCAT1</italic>), very similar to that of the ZDRE motif (RTGTCGACAY) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Due to the sequence similarity of this newly identified motif to that of ZDRE, we first tested the capacity of bZIP23 or bZIP19 to bind to this motifs.

These findings strongly support the Zn-dependency of <italic>LPCAT1</italic> expression. We therefore determined the transcript abundance of <italic>LPCAT1</italic> in shoots of Arabidopsis wild-type plants (Col-0) grown in -Zn for 6, 12 and 18 days. In response to -Zn, transcript accumulation of <italic>LPCAT1</italic> was changed, showing significant down-regulation compared +Zn conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This result shows that repression of <italic>LPCAT1</italic> upon low –Zn is associated with higher Pi levels and suggests that transcriptional regulation of <italic>LPCAT1</italic> is important for its involvement in Pi homeostasis. We next tested whether these bZIP TFs could be involved in regulating the expression of <italic>LPCAT1</italic> in –Zn.

This indicates that bZIP23, but not bZIP19, is involved in negatively regulating the expression of <italic>LPCAT1</italic> under –Zn. We therefore hypothesized that <italic>bZIP23</italic> but not bZIP19 are necessary for the downregulation of <italic>LPCAT1</italic> in –Zn and subsequent Pi accumulation and there assessed the capacity of the mutants to accumulate Pi when grown with or without Zn for 18 days.

Our study provides a first insight into the genetic and molecular mechanism that controls shoot Pi concentration under –Zn in plants by discovering a pathway which includes the –Zn response TF <italic>bZIP23</italic> that target the <italic>LPCAT1,</italic> and the Pi transporter <italic>PHT1;1</italic>.</p><p>In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, GWAS has been shown to be a powerful approach to detect loci involved in natural variation of complex traits including variation in the accumulation of non-essentials or toxic elements in plants, such as sodium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Baxter et al., 2010</xref>), cadmium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chao et al., 2012</xref>) or arsenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chao et al., 2014</xref>). Here we used GWAS to identify genes involved in the regulation of the essential macronutrient (P) concentration in its anionic form (Pi) in plants grown under control conditions (+Zn) and -Zn. In both conditions, our GWA analysis reveals that there is widespread natural variation in shoot Pi concentration, and supports the existence of genetic factors that affect this trait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The GWAS data support the –Zn specificity of this response, since no association was detected around the <italic>LPCAT1</italic> locus in our control condition (+Zn) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The presence of the Zinc Deficiency Response Element (ZDRE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Assunção et al., 2010</xref>) in the promoter of <italic>LPCAT1</italic> and more particularly the newly identified binding motif specific for bZIP23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) in the 5’ untranslated leader of <italic>LPCAT1</italic> is a strong argument supporting the Zn-dependency of this response.</p><p>A ZDRE is present in the promoter regions of many genes targeted by bZIP19 and bZIP23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Assunção et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to their positive regulatory role by inducing several Zn deficiency related genes, publicly available microarray showed that bZIP19 and bZIP23 may have a negative regulatory role as many genes were induced in the bzip19/bzip23 mutant background compared to WT plants grown in –Zn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Azevedo et al., 2016</xref>). A functional redundancy of these two TFs was proposed based on the oversensitivity of the <italic>bzip19</italic> and <italic>bzip23</italic> double mutant to –Zn, which was not observed with either <italic>bzip19</italic> or <italic>bzip23</italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Assunção et al., 2010</xref>). This redundancy may not be absolute, as recent physiological and genetic evidence indicates that bZIP19 and bZIP23 are not completely redundant and they not only regulate the same, but also separate sets of genes in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Inaba et al., 2015</xref>). Our results support this finding by showing that only bZIP23 is involved in regulating <italic>LPCAT1</italic> in response to -Zn. bZIP23 is likely to do so through two <italic>cis</italic>-elements in the non-coding part of the <italic>LPCAT1</italic> gene. One being the aforementioned ZDRE, which can also be bound by the bZIP19 paralogue of bZIP23, the other a novel binding motif, with versions TGTC<underline>AC</underline>A and TGTC<underline>GA</underline>A, which are specifically bound by bZIP23. Worth noting, in the accessions panel used in our work one other allele can be found, in the Alc-0 accession (TGTC<underline>AA</underline>A) that displayed the lowest Pi accumulation in our panel of accession (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Alc-0 is the only accession among all Arabidopsis accessions for which sequence information is available in the 1001 genome database, with this version of the ZDRE motif.</p><p>The new ZDRE motif resides in the 5’-untranslated leader of <italic>LPCAT1</italic>. Binding of bZIP23 to this element therefore might physically block the transcription of the <italic>LPCAT1</italic> gene under Zn deficient conditions. This is further supported by the repressive role for bZIP23 on the expression of <italic>LPCAT1</italic> under Zn deficiency. Genomic sequence surveys screening for this new TF-binding site promise to further help identifying a complete list of genes potentially regulated by bZIP23 in order to fully understand the involvement of bZIP23 in the -Zn response in a genome-wide manner.</p><p>Based on our results, we propose that the sequence change in the 5’UTR sequence impacts gene(s) expression, and consequently causes variation in the associated traits. It has been proposed that evolution of species complexity from lower organisms to higher organisms is accompanied by an increase in the regulatory complexity of 5’UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, so far little is known about the role of the 5’UTR sequence in the regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional level. The role of 5’UTR in the regulation of gene expression is perhaps best studied in human. Several studies showed that point substitutions in the 5'UTR change the expression of several genes such as <italic>Ankirin Repeat Domain 26</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pippucci et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>Solute Carrier Family 2 Member 4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Malodobra-Mazur et al., 2016</xref>), and <italic>Cyclin D1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Berardi et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, few examples exist on the role of 5’UTR as <italic>cis</italic> regulators in plants. In Arabidopsis, it has been shown that the regulation of <italic>NRP1</italic> gene expression involves WRKY DNA binding proteins, which act on a potential <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory element located within the 5'UTR of <italic>NRP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yu et al., 2001</xref>). More general, a large-scale study of DNA affinity purification sequencing, which is a high-throughput TF -binding site discovery method, has revealed a global preference across TF families for enrichment at promoters and 5’UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O'Malley et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, our study has uncovered a new example for the role of the 5’UTR in gene expression regulation and evolution in plants.</p><p>Of a particular interest is that our study revealed that this novel bZIP23-interacting sequence motif is subject to natural variation in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and its alteration may be associated with changes in the binding capacity of bZIP23. There are several ways that genetic variants can mechanistically contribute to plant adaptation. Many reported examples with regards to nutrient accumulation involve a change in the coding sequence of a gene that then alters the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, thus leading to the disruption of gene function and a phenotypic change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Baxter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chao et al., 2014</xref>). Reports on the role of specific regulatory element polymorphisms in the regulation of complex traits such as nutrient homeostasis crosstalk are less common, also because it is difficult to identify these relevant sequence changes. In our study, we demonstrated that allelic variation (SNPs) in the novel bZIP23 binding motif upstream of the <italic>LPCAT1</italic> gene is associated with variation in <italic>LPCAT1</italic> expression levels, which in turn results in variation in Pi accumulation in –Zn conditions. The <italic>LPCAT1</italic> natural variants such as found in this study offer new inspiration for agronomical and biotechnological applications to optimize Pi use efficiency in plants.</p><p>While mutation of <italic>LPCAT1</italic> results in altered Lyso-PC and PC concentrations; an altered Lyso-PC/PC ratio; the up-regulation of <italic>LPCAT1</italic> in <italic>bzip23</italic> mutant background has no significant effect on this ratio. The simplest explanation for this observation would be that in the <italic>bzip23</italic> mutant background a portion of the synthesized PC is fed into the Kennedy pathway leading to the biosynthesis of different molecules such diacylglycerol or phosphatidic acid, and therefore no changes in Lyso-PC/PC could be detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, an attractive second explanation exists: LPCAT1 could be subjected to a regulation at the protein level as a strategy to optimize phosphatidylcholine specie levels. In animals, it has been proposed that the LPCAT1 primary protein sequence may contain additional motifs, structural features, or interact with second messengers or ligands that can, under certain circumstances, alter its protein half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zou et al., 2011</xref>). The precise mechanism that regulates LPCAT1 protein stability by the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway was already shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zou et al., 2011</xref>). Further studies will be required to verify the presence of such regulation pathway for LPCAT1 in Arabidopsis, and if confirmed, such a mechanism would add another level of our understanding of LPCAT1 activity in plants.</p><p>Mutation of <italic>LPCAT1</italic> results in increased <italic>PHT1;1</italic> expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>); and ultimately an over-accumulation of Pi under Zn deficiency. The induction of the expression of genes encoding P uptake transporters under Zn deficiency has been reported in crop plants such as barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2000</xref>); and the model plant Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jain et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pal et al., 2017</xref>). Our study showed an induction of <italic>PHT1;1</italic> in <italic>lpcat1</italic> plants grown under Zn deficiency. The increase in <italic>PHT1;1</italic> expression levels is likely to explain the increased shoot Pi concentration in <italic>lpcat1</italic> since it is known that CaMV 35S promoter driven overexpression of this Pi transporter significantly increases shoot Pi concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mitsukawa et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Catarecha et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, our finding provides evidence supporting a role for a Lyso-PC/PC-derived signal in regulating Pi homeostasis under –Zn. Until recently our knowledge on PL-derived signals in plants was scarce; however, physiological and molecular studies have shown that some PL classes could serve as precursors for the generation of diverse signalling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Spector and Yorek, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Testerink and Munnik, 2005</xref>). For instance, Lyso-PC was shown to act as a signal for the regulation of the expression of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM)-specific Pi transporter genes in potato, tomato and recently in <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Drissner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vijayakumar et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to the involvement of individual PLs in specific physiological processes in plants (e.g ion transport), a broader importance of changes in Lyso-PC/PC ratio for the regulation of plant development and basic cell biology is emerging. For instance, in Arabidopsis alteration of the Lyso-PC/PC ratio shortens the time to flower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nakamura et al., 2014</xref>). In human cells, the Lyso-PC/PC ratio was also associated with an impairment of cell function, signalling and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mulder et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klavins et al., 2015</xref>). Our data now demonstrate a fundamental link between PL metabolism, particularly Lyso-PC/PC, and Pi accumulation in –Zn condition, and lays the foundation for exploring the role of Lyso-PC/PC-derived signal in controlling ion homeostasis and response to environmental changes not only in plant cells but also in other organisms.</p><p>Overall, our study sheds light on molecular mechanism underlying an old observation made as early as 1970 s, namely P-Zn interaction in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Warnock, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marschner and Schropp, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Loneragan et al., 1979</xref>). By combining GWAS and functional genomics approaches, we discovered a complete pathway involved in the regulation of shoot Pi accumulation in –Zn that can be defined as bZIP23-LPCAT1(Lyso-PC/PC)-PHT1;1. Beyond its fundamental importance, our study could have a direct impact on plant growth in field by improving plant growth while reducing P supply, and will help meeting one of challenges facing agriculture in the 21st century.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>A subset of 223 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> accessions of the RegMap panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horton et al., 2012</xref>) was used for genome-wide association studies (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center accession number CS77400).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Daniel J Kliebenstein (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to frame the key concerns we feel must be addressed before a binding decision may be made on your submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In plants, regulation of phosphate accumulation in shoots is disrupted under conditions of Zn deficiency with the result that plant over-accumulate Pi. Here, the authors provide the first insights the molecular basis of cross-talk between Zn and Pi signaling pathways. Through a GWA study and subsequent analyses of mutants, the authors identify variation in the <italic>LPCAT1</italic> gene expression as the cause of variation in Zn deficiency-induced Pi accumulation. A new zinc deficiency cis-element upstream of the <italic>LPCAT1</italic> coding sequence and the bZIP23 transcription factor are proposed cause the variation in <italic>LPCAT1</italic> expression which in turn alters LPC/PC ratios and expression of phosphate transporter genes. The reviewers felt that these data, if fully substantiated, provide evidence for a causal relationship between cis-regulatory variation and Pi accumulation. The reviewers propose that the PHR data be omitted as currently, there is no evidence for a link between PHR and <italic>LPCAT1</italic>. The reviewers consider the following revisions necessary to fully substantiate the main claims of the manuscript and to improve the overall presentation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Promoter swap experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The statistical analysis in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> does not match the claims in the text. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> shows comparisons only to Col. It is necessary to demonstrate whether there is a difference between the variants and the empty vector complemented <italic>LPCAT1</italic>, not only Col. The best analysis would be to do ANOVA with just the promoter swap lines and to directly test how the promoter or the ORF effects the phenotype. Col-0 is not the proper control given that the lines are in the <italic>lpcat</italic> background. This can be accomplished by making an ANOVA that goes Pi = promoter + ORF + promoter x ORF and then the authors could get direct p-values for the key terms that they wish to report.</p><p>2) Do the complemented lines shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> (<italic>lcpat1</italic> mutant expressing the different <italic>LPCAT1</italic> variants) show changes in LPC and PC content. The claim that the regulatory element is responsible for the alterations in P content and that this occurs by alterations in LPC/PC ratio should be supported with LPC/PC ratio data for these lines.</p><p>3) The promoter swap experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) do not demonstrate that the effect is due to the new ZDRE motif. It could be due to additional allelic variation in other motifs. In the first paragraph of the subsection “Allelic variation of <italic>LPCAT1</italic> determines natural variation of Pi content under zinc deficiency.”, the authors indicate that there is no variation in the common ZDRE but they do not mention whether there is additional variation in other potential motifs within the promoter that might correlate with shoot Pi content in -Zn (it is possible as Col-0 and Sap-0 promoters displayed 97,9% sequence identity. Therefore, there are additional SNPs). To demonstrate that the new ZDRE is responsible for Zn dependent control of <italic>LPCAT1</italic> expression, mutant versions of the ZDRE motif should be included in the promoter swap experiments.</p><p>4) The authors find allelic variation in the sequence of the newly identified Zn-deficiency responsive element (ZDRE) that correlates with variation in the shoot Pi content of contrasting groups of accessions. However, whether other polymorphisms exist in the same motif for other accessions is not mentioned. This information should be provided and if indeed polymorphisms do exist, this must be discussed and the effects on <italic>LPCAT1</italic> gene expression and shoot Pi data should be added.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> (element binding analysis). This analysis is missing a negative control. Also, the important question of differential binding to the ZDRE variants is not addressed. Additional EMSA analyses that evaluate the binding affinity of bZIP23 to the two sequence variants of the new ZDRE in the <italic>LPCAT1</italic> promoter must be included. Given that this new element is considered to be responsible for the differential expression of the <italic>LPCAT1</italic> gene, an assessment of differential binding (through competition assays) is essential.</p><p>It is also possible that bZIP19 binds the ZDRE variant found in accessions accumulating more Pi in the shoot under -Zn (e.g. GTGTCACA). Such a mechanism may help to further repress <italic>LPCAT1</italic> expression under -Zn. Indeed, combinatorial effects between the two ZDRE found in the <italic>LPCAT1</italic> promoter affecting <italic>LPCAT1</italic> gene expression should not be discounted. If necessary, further assessment of bZIP19 binding should be considered.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. <italic>lpcat1</italic> mutants display increased lyso-PC/PC ratio. However, <italic>bzip23</italic> mutation, which results in increased <italic>LPCAT1</italic> expression, has no significant effect on this ratio. Discussion should be provided to explain this difference that affects the proposed model. Related to this, is there any significant difference in lyso-PC/PC ratio between accessions showing contrasting shoot Pi content in -Zn?</p><p>7) With regard to <italic>LPCAT1</italic>, a SNP explaining 11% of shoot Pi variation in -Zn was found. However, details on the contribution of the <italic>PHT1</italic> loci to this trait are not provided. A more detailed description of the GWAS results must be provided for the latter (significant SNPs specific of -Zn in all <italic>PHT1</italic>s?).</p><p>8) How sure are the authors that there are only two causal alleles of <italic>LPCAT1</italic> (Col-0/SAP). This seems to be an implicit claim but rarely are causal genes dimorphic in Arabidopsis and more often they have multiple alleles. This does not take away from the causation they have found but they should definitely be clear that there may be other alleles in the text or they could conduct a phylogenetic analysis of the promoter and ORF to classify their alleles within a broader context.</p><p>9) In several cases the text requires modification to improve accuracy. Please modify the text to address the following points.</p><p>a) The authors should be a bit careful in their claims. For example, in the subsection “GWAS identify two candidate genes involved in the accumulation of Pi in the shoot under Zn deficiency”, this RT-PCR shows that Col-0 is responding to the Zn limitation but doesn't inherently mean that all accessions are responding in the same way or even at all to the Zn limitation. It is a nice control but is only a control for Col-0.</p><p>b) Similarly, in the subsection “GWAS identify two candidate genes involved in the accumulation of Pi in the shoot under Zn deficiency”, yes the heritability is high but the fact that there is a difference in the presence or absence of Zn means that this is really a G X E trait and not largely genetic. To make the largely genetic claim would require a G + E + G x E analysis to partition the variance.</p><p>c) In the subsection “GWAS identify two candidate genes involved in the accumulation of Pi in the shoot under Zn deficiency”, SNP effect estimates are notoriously difficult to make accurate so I would suggest caution in using 11% vs. 49% to say this gene is the main effect. The Manhattan plots suggest that there are likely a number of other loci and if there is trans-LD between these loci as found by Brachi and Bergelson for defense metabolism, then individual SNP estimates are inflated as they capture the causation at other SNPs. This in no way diminishes the fact that they have found a gene involved. It is just better to be accurate in claims than to inflate claims.</p><p>d) Sometimes, the logic of the experimental decisions was hidden in the text. For example, in the first paragraph of the subsection “<italic>LPCAT1</italic> acts downstream of bZIP23 transcription factor”, the authors find a ZDRE in <italic>LPCAT1</italic> which helps to support the GWA association. Yet this section is introduced by saying that the goal was to understand the regulatory context which is a very general goal that implies the section will discuss all the promoter elements. It seems that if the focus is solely on ZDRE, that it would make sense to state that the goal was to provide more molecular causational links between Zn/LPCAT/Pi which hasn't really been well understood.</p><p>10) Some important details are missing from the data and some figures are incorrect and/or the presentation is poor. Please address these points:</p><p>a) The coordinates for the significant SNP associated with Pi concentration in shoots in Zn- conditions must be provided.</p><p>b) The two motifs (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) are on the opposite strand from the ATG, so that figure is incorrect. The figure should be corrected.</p><p>c) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Please plot the data rather than showing histograms.</p><p>d) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>. The legend indicates that expression in both high and low Zn is shown but this is not the case. Please show the relative expression in both conditions.</p><p>e) An additional supplementary table listing the sequence of the newly identified ZDRE in all accessions analyzed should be included to make correlations with their shoot Pi content in +Zn/-Zn.</p><p>11) Please consider the following comment which may help strengthen the PHT analyses:</p><p>For the PHT analyses, it seems odd to rely on a Bonferroni when the authors have direct evidence that this is likely too conservative and causing false negative results as shown from the PHT1 data. There are plenty of papers showing that Bonferroni is overly conservative. I would suggest using a more realistic p-value and then the authors could bring in the PHT transporters as a part of the GWA causal network. Right now it has an artificial spurious argument of saying &quot;they weren't significant but almost were&quot;. An option would be to use the modified Bonferroni approach where you estimate the true number of independent SNPs within a dataset and use that as the denominator rather than the total number of SNPs which is really inflates the correction.</p><p>12) It is surprising that you have not used 1001 Genomes imputed SNPs for your GWAS. Please rerun the analysis and report whether the apparently causal SNP is among the best hits. Consultation of the 1001 Genomes website indicates that this SNP is well represented in the 1001 Genomes data, with ~80% accessions having the standard allele, ~10% the alternative allele, and ~10% missing data. You should also show directly the Pi data for the accessions you analyzed, comparing distribution of Pi levels in all of your accessions with the standard versus all accessions with the alternative allele.</p><p>13) Please give the genome coordinates for all sequences discussed in the paper, especially the putatively causal SNP. Note also that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> has a significant error, as the ATG and the two cis motifs are on opposite strands. Please correct. In addition, please discuss that the apparently causal motif is immediately upstream of the ATG and in the 5' UTR. Briefly discuss what is known about transcription factors binding in the 5' UTR and acting as cis-regulators.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32077.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>In plants, regulation of phosphate accumulation in shoots is disrupted under conditions of Zn deficiency with the result that plant over-accumulate Pi. Here, the authors provide the first insights the molecular basis of cross-talk between Zn and Pi signaling pathways. Through a GWA study and subsequent analyses of mutants, the authors identify variation in the <italic>LPCAT1</italic> gene expression as the cause of variation in Zn deficiency-induced Pi accumulation. A new zinc deficiency cis-element upstream of the <italic>LPCAT1</italic> coding sequence and the bZIP23 transcription factor are proposed cause the variation in <italic>LPCAT1</italic> expression which in turn alters LPC/PC ratios and expression of phosphate transporter genes. The reviewers felt that these data, if fully substantiated, provide evidence for a causal relationship between cis-regulatory variation and Pi accumulation. The reviewers propose that the PHR data be omitted as currently, there is no evidence for a link between PHR and <italic>LPCAT1</italic>. The reviewers consider the following revisions necessary to fully substantiate the main claims of the manuscript and to improve the overall presentation.</p></disp-quote><p>PHR1 was omitted as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Promoter swap experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

It is necessary to demonstrate whether there is a difference between the variants and the empty vector complemented LPCAT1, not only Col. The best analysis would be to do ANOVA with just the promoter swap lines and to directly test how the promoter or the ORF effects the phenotype. Col-0 is not the proper control given that the lines are in the lpcat background. This can be accomplished by making an ANOVA that goes Pi = promoter + ORF + promoter x ORF and then the authors could get direct p-values for the key terms that they wish to report.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we performed two-way ANOVA analysis and results reported as table in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>.

The claim that the regulatory element is responsible for the alterations in P content and that this occurs by alterations in LPC/PC ratio should be supported with LPC/PC ratio data for these lines.</p></disp-quote><p>As recommended by the reviewer we tested whether the polymorphisms in the regulatory region of <italic>LPCAT1</italic> are responsible for the change in LPC/PC ratio that ultimately affect the Pi content in –Zn conditions. We determined the LPC, PC concentrations in the shoots of the plants expressing <italic>LPCAT1</italic> driven by LPCAT1<sup>Col-0</sup> promoter (pLPCAT1<sup>Col-0</sup>::<italic>LPCAT1</italic><sup>Col-0</sup>, pLPCAT1<sup>Col-0</sup>::<italic>LPCAT1</italic><sup>Sap-0</sup>) or LPCAT1<sup>Sap-0</sup> promoter (pLPCAT1<sup>Sap-0</sup> ::<italic>LPCAT1</italic><sup>Col-0</sup>, pLPCAT1<sup>Sap-0</sup>::<italic>LPCAT1</italic><sup>Sap-0</sup>) in the <italic>lpcat1</italic> mutant background, grown in the presence or absence of Zn for 18 days. WT plants of the Col-0, Sap-0 accessions, and <italic>lpcat1</italic> transformed with the empty vector were included in this analysis. In the presence of Zn no difference in PC or LPCA concentrations was observed between all plant lines. However, under –Zn conditions, Sap-0, pLPCAT1<sup>Sap-0</sup>::<italic>LPCAT1</italic><sup>Col-0</sup>, pLPCAT1<sup>Sap-0</sup>::<italic>LPCAT1</italic><sup>Sap-0</sup> or <italic>lpcat1</italic> lines showed a significant decrease of PC and increase of LPC concentrations respectively, leading to an increase of Lyso-PC/PC ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These results further support the association between the increase of LPC/PC ratios and the alterations in P content in the plant shoots under Zn deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These new results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The promoter swap experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) do not demonstrate that the effect is due to the new ZDRE motif.

Therefore, there are additional SNPs). To demonstrate that the new ZDRE is responsible for Zn dependent control of LPCAT1 expression, mutant versions of the ZDRE motif should be included in the promoter swap experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>To assess the effect of the bZIP23 TF on the activity of the native Col-0 <italic>LPACT1</italic> promoter (with « GTGTCGAA » as new ZDRE) and a modified (point mutation) version of the Col-0 <italic>LPCAT1</italic> promoter to only contain the new ZDRE of Sap-0 (« GTGTCACA ») we used a quantitative in planta transactivation assay as described by Bossi et al., 2017. In this assay, each <italic>LPCAT1</italic> promoter version (native or mutated) was fused to a β-glucuronidase (GUS)-encoding reporter gene. 35S:bZIP23 and 35S::C-YFP were used as effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The comparison of the ability of 35S-bZIP23 or 35S-YFP to activate either <italic>LPCAT1</italic> promoter versions was performed by quantifying the GUS activity. Each reporter construct was co-transfected with either the 35S:bZIP23 or 35S::C-YFP construct into tobacco leaves. As a positive control, we tested the effect of 35S:bZIP23 on its known target promoter of At<italic>ZIP4</italic> gene fused to β-GUS-encoding reporter gene (Assunção et al., 2010). As expected, our results showed an induction of the activity of At<italic>ZIP4</italic> promoter by 35S:bZIP23 (positive control). More importantly, our results showed that bZIP23 represses the activity of the <italic>LPCAT1</italic> promoter that contains the new ZDRE of Sap-0 compared to the Col-0 <italic>LPACT1</italic> native promoter. These results are consistent with our qPCR data showing that <italic>LPCAT1</italic> is less expressed in Sap-0 compared to Col-0 background under Zn deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These results are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors find allelic variation in the sequence of the newly identified Zn-deficiency responsive element (ZDRE) that correlates with variation in the shoot Pi content of contrasting groups of accessions.

Only 10 of these accessions have the new ZDRE motif « GTGTCACA » and 152 accessions contain the standard version of this motif « GTGTCGAA » in their promoter. There is only one other allele, found in the Alc-0 accession, that harbours a « GTGTCAAA » motif sequence. In fact, Alc-0 is the only accession among all Arabidopsis accessions for which sequence information is available in the 1001 genome database, with this version of the ZDRE motif. While the mutation in the new ZDRE motif of the Alc-0 <italic>LPCAT1</italic> promoter is potentially interesting, based on the current information it is not possible to determine with any statistical significance if this polymorphism affects gene expression or shoot Pi content.

Taken together, our data provide a compelling evidence that sequence variation in the motif is associated with Pi concentrations in shoots of Arabidopsis grown in different Zn conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Please give the genome coordinates for all sequences discussed in the paper, especially the putatively causal SNP. Note also that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> has a significant error, as the ATG and the two cis motifs are on opposite strands. Please correct. In addition, please discuss that the apparently causal motif is immediately upstream of the ATG and in the 5' UTR. Briefly discuss what is known about transcription factors binding in the 5' UTR and acting as cis-regulators.</p></disp-quote><p>Two new <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> was added to report the genome coordinates of all SNPs.</p><p>The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> was corrected.</p><p>We included a new paragraph on the available knowledge about the importance of 5’UTR on the regulation of gene expression and about transcription factors binding the 5’UTR was added in the Discussion section: “Based on our results we propose that sequence change in 5’UTR sequence impacts gene(s) expression, and consequently causes variation in the gene(s) associated traits.
