Using cell-specific inducible gene recombination in mice we found that, in the postnatal inner ear, Bbnf and Ntf3 are required for the formation and maintenance of hair cell ribbon synapses in the vestibular and cochlear epithelia, respectively. We also show that supporting cells in these epithelia are the key endogenous source of the neurotrophins. Using a new hair cell CreER<sup>T</sup> line with mosaic expression, we also found that Ntf3's effect on cochlear synaptogenesis is highly localized. Moreover, supporting cell-derived Ntf3, but not Bbnf, promoted recovery of cochlear function and ribbon synapse regeneration after acoustic trauma. These results indicate that glial-derived neurotrophins play critical roles in inner ear synapse density and synaptic regeneration after injury.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03564.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03564.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03564.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Noise-induced hearing loss is common, and can result from prolonged exposure to moderate levels of noise that are not perceived as painful or even unpleasant. Some hearing loss can be attributed to the death of hair cells in a part of the inner ear called the cochlea. When sound waves hit the cochlea, they cause the fluid inside it to vibrate: the hair cells detect these vibrations and convert them into electrical signals that are sent along neurons to the brain. However, vibrations that are too strong can destroy hair cells.</p><p>Increasing evidence suggests that hearing loss also results from damage to the synapses that connect the hair cells and the neurons in the cochlea. During development of the inner ear, molecules called growth factors are needed to ensure the survival of these neurons. Wan et al. predicted that these growth factors might also have a role in adult animals, and that producing more of them might help to safeguard hearing from the damaging effects of noise.</p><p>Consistent with this, mice that were genetically modified to lack a growth factor called neurotrophin-3 had cochleae that did not work properly and had fewer synapses between hair cells and neurons compared to control mice. Conversely, mice that produced too much neurotrophin-3 had more synapses than controls and also recovered more quickly from the effects of 2 hr exposure to 100 dB noise (roughly the volume of a pneumatic drill). Studies of the cochlea revealed that the extra neurotrophin-3 had boosted the regeneration of synapses damaged by the noise.</p><p>The beneficial effects of neurotrophin-3 were still seen when overproduction was started shortly <italic>after</italic> noise exposure, suggesting that it could have therapeutic potential. This is particularly significant in the light of recent evidence that the loss of synapses often comes before the death of hair cells in both age-related hearing loss and noise-induced hearing loss.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03564.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03564.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>deafness</kwd><kwd>synaptogenesi</kwd><kwd>hearing loss</kwd><kwd>neuron-glia interaction</kwd><kwd>glial cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC 004820</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corfas</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000071</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30- HD 18655 (Mental Retardation Research Center)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corfas</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002046</institution-id><institution>Hearing Health Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Guoqiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 DC 005209</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liberman</surname><given-names>M Charles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006823</institution-id><institution>Boston Children's Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Department of Otolaryngology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Guoqiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Overexpression of the growth factor neurotrophin-3 helps to repair noise-induced damage in the mouse inner ear by promoting the regeneration of damaged synapses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The trophic factors, neurotrophin-3 (Ntf3) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bbnf) play critical roles in the embryonic inner ear, contributing to the survival of cochlear and vestibular sensory neurons and to the establishment of their projections into the respective sensory epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fritzsch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramekers et al., 2012</xref>). Both Bdnf and Ntf3 continue to be expressed in inner ear sensory epithelia after birth. In the postnatal vestibular epithelia, Bdnf is expressed only by supporting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schecterson and Bothwell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Montcouquiol et al., 1998</xref>), whereas Ntf3 is expressed by both supporting cells and hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farinas et al., 1994</xref>). In the postnatal organ of Corti, Bdnf is expressed by both inner (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs) and supporting cells at early postnatal ages (P1–P6), but is only detected in supporting cells from P10 onwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wiechers et al., 1999</xref>). All cells in the early postnatal organ of Corti appear to express Ntf3, but in the adult, expression is restricted to the IHCs and their surrounding supporting cells, with higher levels in the apical (low-frequency) region than at the base of the cochlear spiral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugawara et al., 2007</xref>). Thus Bdnf and Ntf3 could have significant functions in the postnatal inner ear, and alterations in expression of these neurotrophins may modulate structure and function in the adult inner ear.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the roles of postnatal Ntf3 and Bdnf in both normal and damaged inner ears. Using cell-specific and inducible knockout or overexpression technology, we eliminated or increased neurotrophin expression from supporting cells or hair cells in the postnatal inner ear. We show that these neurotrophins, when expressed by the glia-like supporting cells in these sensory epithelia, are required for the formation and/or maintenance of ribbon synapses, a role distinct from the one they play in embryogenesis. Ntf3 has major effects only in the cochlea, while postnatal Bdnf appears to act only in the vestibular organs. Furthermore, we show that Ntf3 overexpression can elicit regeneration of the synaptic contacts between cochlear nerve terminals and inner hair cells after noise-induced synaptopathy, a type of neural damage which appears to be widespread even in ears exposed at sound levels well below those which cause hair cell damage and permanent threshold shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ntf3, but not Bdnf, expression by postnatal supporting cells regulates cochlear function</title><p>To alter neurotrophin expression by supporting cells, we used a mouse line that expresses the tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (CreER<sup>T</sup>) under the control of the proteolipid protein 1 promoter (<italic>Plp1/CreER</italic><sup><italic>T</italic></sup>).

This is not the case for the embryonic inner ear, where the loss of Ntf3 results in the loss of a subpopulation of vestibular neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ernfors et al., 1995</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Ntf3</italic> knockout from supporting cells resulted in elevated thresholds for auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) at high frequencies, while supporting cell <italic>Ntf3</italic> overexpression resulted in reduced ABR thresholds at the same frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were not affected by the abnormal Ntf3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that the ABR changes were due to dysfunction of the inner hair cells (IHCs), the cochlear nerve fibers, or the synapses that connect them. Correspondingly, the amplitude of ABR peak 1 (P1), the summed activity of the cochlear nerve, was reduced by supporting cell <italic>Ntf3</italic> knockout and increased by overexpression, also at high frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The latency of ABR P1 and the width of ABR wave 1 were not altered by the knockout or overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>), suggesting that altering Ntf3 levels does not affect cochlear nerve myelination.

Immunostaining of pre-synaptic ribbon and post-synaptic receptor patches, using antibodies against CtBP2 and GluA2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), showed that supporting cell <italic>Ntf3</italic> knockout reduced the number of synaptic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; upper panels and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; blue), while overexpression increased synapse number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; lower panels and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; red). Effects on synaptic counts were restricted to basal (high-frequency) cochlear regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), as seen for ABR thresholds and amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Similar results were obtained when separately counting either pre-synaptic ribbons or post-synaptic receptor patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). The strong correlation between the changes in ABR amplitudes and synaptic counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) suggests that levels of supporting cell-derived Ntf3 influence cochlear function by regulating the number of IHC ribbon synapses. Previous studies have suggested that alterations in ribbon synapses affect ABR responses by changing sound-evoked peak discharge rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glowatzki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gomez-Palacio-Schjetnan and Escobar, 2013</xref>). Thus, increases (or decreases) in the number of synapses per fiber in <italic>Ntf3</italic> overexpressors or knockouts could increase (or decrease) the probability of synchronous EPSPs, thereby increasing (or decreasing) onset spike rate in response to tone pips and ultimately altering the amplitude of ABR P1, the summed activity of the cochlear nerve. The observation that Ntf3 overexpression can increase synapse density indicates that Ntf3 is normally expressed in limited amounts, as expected from the neurotrophic hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies, 1996</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03564.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Ntf3 expression by postnatal supporting cells does not affect the organ of Corti morphology, hair cell or axon numbers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Photomicrographs of the basal turn of an <italic>Ntf3</italic><sup><italic>flox</italic></sup><italic>:Plp1/CreER</italic><sup><italic>T</italic></sup> cochlea (∼32 kHz region) showing a cross-section of the organ of Corti (<bold>A</bold>; scale bar = 100 µm) and a tangential section through the osseous spiral lamina showing peripheral axons of cochlear nerve fibers (<bold>B</bold>; scale bar = 10 µm).

In this study, we show that Ntf3 and Bdnf, which are necessary for sensory neuron survival in the developing inner ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fritzsch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramekers et al., 2012</xref>), continue to play important and complementary roles in the postnatal inner ear, specifically by modulating the number of synapses between hair cells and sensory neurons. Our results indicate that supporting cells of the sensory epithelia are the key source of these neurotrophins in the postnatal inner ear. Importantly, we show that increasing the availability of Ntf3, but not Bdnf, promotes the recovery of both cochlear responses and IHC synapses after acoustic trauma, even when Ntf3 expression is induced after noise exposure.</p><p>The specificity of the effects of each neurotrophin on each organ cannot be explained simply by the spatio-temporal expression pattern of the components for these signaling pathways, as both Bdnf and Ntf3, as well as their respective receptors Ntrk2 (TrkB) and Ntrk3 (TrkC), are expressed in the postnatal and adult cochlea and vestibular organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pirvola et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fritzsch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gestwa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wiechers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farinas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stankovic and Corfas, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugawara et al., 2007</xref>). A similar specificity in the biological roles of these neurotrophins has been shown in embryonic development, that is, constitutive knockout of <italic>Bdnf</italic> or <italic>Ntf3</italic> reveals predominant pro-survival roles on vestibular or cochlear neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farinas et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ernfors et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schimmang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bianchi et al., 1996</xref>). However, while genetic replacement of one neurotrophin with the other can almost completely rescue neuronal survival deficits caused by constitutive deletion of either <italic>Bdnf</italic> or <italic>Ntf3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coppola et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agerman et al., 2003</xref>), we observed that Ntf3 and Bdnf have distinct and non-overlapping roles in postnatal synapse formation. Thus, it appears that vestibular and auditory primary sensory neurons can respond equally to endogenous levels of either Bdnf or Ntf3 during development, but this ability is lost after birth.</p><p>In the vestibular system, supporting cell-derived Bdnf is the sole neurotrophin necessary for postnatal formation and maintenance of hair cell synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gomez-Casati et al., 2010b</xref>), and the levels of Bdnf expressed by these non-neuronal cells is not limiting, as Bdnf overexpression does not alter vestibular function. While previous studies of constitutive knockouts showed that Ntf3 is necessary for the survival of a subpopulation of vestibular neurons during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ernfors et al., 1995</xref>), our data indicate that Ntf3, which like Bdnf is expressed primarily by supporting cells in the postnatal vestibular sensory epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugawara et al., 2007</xref>), is dispensable in the vestibular system after birth. In contrast to the vestibular organs, supporting cell-derived Ntf3, but not Bdnf, is necessary for the establishment of normal synapses and auditory function in the cochlear base. The correlation of Ntf3 expression levels with synapse numbers and cochlear sensitivity in both knockout and overexpression models indicates that supporting cell-derived Ntf3 is not only a critical but also a limiting factor in the postnatal cochlea.</p><p>Interestingly, postnatal knockout of supporting cell-derived Ntf3 and Bdnf did not affect the survival of the sensory neurons themselves, in either the vestibular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gomez-Casati et al., 2010b</xref>) or the cochlear (spiral) ganglion, indicating that endogenous Ntf3 and Bdnf become dispensable for neuronal survival after birth. These sensory neurons may become independent of trophic support in the adult, or alternatively, other trophic factors, such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (Igf1) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (Mif), may promote survival after birth. Both Igf1 and Mif are expressed in the postnatal cochlea, and, for both, loss results in ganglion cell death or altered innervation after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camarero et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bank et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf) is also expressed in postnatal inner ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stankovic and Corfas, 2003</xref>), and it has been suggested that vestibular neurons switch trophic sensitivity from Bdnf to Gdnf after target innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hashino et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Although adult inner hair cells also express Ntf3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wheeler et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugawara et al., 2007</xref>), we found no cochlear dysfunction in mice lacking Ntf3 expression in these cells. The lack of phenotype in the hair cell-specific <italic>Ntf3</italic> knockout is unlikely due to the partial recombination in hair cells because (a) recombination in supporting cells and IHCs had similar efficiency (∼60%); (b) cochlear Ntf3 expression was reduced to a similar extent by deletion from either supporting cells or hair cells; and (c) Ntf3 overexpression by hair cells had similar effects on cochlear function and synapse density as that seen in Ntf3 overexpression by supporting cells, indicating that modulation of Ntf3 expression in a subset of hair cells is sufficient to produce phenotypic outcomes. These observations support the conclusion that endogenous Ntf3 expressed by postnatal supporting cells, but not inner hair cells, is necessary for normal cochlear function.</p><p>The mosaic recombination pattern in the <italic>Pou4f3/CreER</italic><sup><italic>T</italic></sup> Ntf3 overexpression revealed that the effects of Ntf3 on hair cell synaptogenesis are precisely localized, that is, synapse density was increased only on hair cells in which the transgene was activated. Thus, it appears that supporting cells create a physical barrier, allowing for local signaling events without cross talk between adjacent hair cells. The lack of effect of postnatal <italic>Ntf3</italic> knockout or overexpression on the total number of myelinated sensory axons in the osseous spiral lamina indicates that the changes in synapses is not due to alterations in the number of sensory neurons, and thus it is consistent with the notion that the effects of Ntf3 are local. Present results suggest that Ntf3 levels may regulate the number of synapses by influencing branching of the unmyelinated terminals of cochlear sensory neurons.</p><p>Regardless of the cellular origin, the effects of <italic>Ntf3</italic> knockout or overexpression on synaptic density and cochlear function are restricted to the high-frequency (basal) half of the cochlea. The pro-survival effects of embryonic Ntf3 have the same tonotopy, that is, the loss of spiral ganglion cells in mice with <italic>Ntf3</italic> or <italic>Ntrk3</italic> knockout are primarily seen at the cochlear base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fritzsch et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tessarollo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coppola et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farinas et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, it appears that Ntf3 is the key endogenous trophic factor for both embryonic development and postnatal function of high-frequency cochlear neurons.</p><p>A previous study showed that Ntf3 promotes axonal growth and synaptogenesis in organ of Corti explants after excitotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44a">Wang and Green, 2011</xref>). Our results indicate that in vivo<italic>,</italic> Ntf3 regulates ribbon synapse numbers without altering cochlear nerve axonal numbers, suggesting a direct effect of Ntf3 on IHC synaptogenesis. Most importantly, overexpression of Ntf3, but not Bdnf, promotes recovery from noise-induced synaptic degeneration and the associated decrements in auditory evoked potentials. Since the Ntf3 receptor Ntrk3 is expressed by cochlear neurons, not IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gestwa et al., 1999</xref>), our results suggest that Ntf3 overexpression acts first by promoting the recovery of post-synaptic terminals, which prevents the progressive loss of pre-synaptic ribbons, and enhances the regeneration of IHC synapses after noise exposure.</p><p>There has been extensive exploration of the use of Bdnf and Ntf3 as therapeutics for sensorineural hearing loss, based on their pro-survival effects on spiral ganglion neurons after hair cell degeneration due to ototoxic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramekers et al., 2012</xref>). It has been suggested that these neurotrophins might promote long-term neuronal survival in cochlear implant users, who typically have few, if any, remaining hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Budenz et al., 2012</xref>). Recent studies in mice have shown that significant synaptic loss precedes hair cell death and spiral ganglion cell degeneration in both noise-induced and age-related hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sergeyenko et al., 2013</xref>), and it has been suggested that this primary neuropathy is a major cause of problems hearing in a noisy environment, the most common complaint of those with sensorineural hearing loss. Therefore, treatment of cochlear synaptopathy presents a novel therapeutic approach for age-related and noise-induced hearing loss. While a number of trophic factors, including Bdnf and Ntf3, can mediate the survival of injured sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roehm and Hansen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramekers et al., 2012</xref>), our findings indicate that specific neurotrophins are required to promote regeneration and to regain function of the synaptic connections in damaged inner ear epithelia.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and tamoxifen treatments</title><p><italic>Plp1/CreER</italic><sup><italic>T</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doerflinger et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>Slc1a3/CreER</italic><sup><italic>T</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup><italic>flox</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rios et al., 2001</xref>), <italic>Ntf3</italic><sup><italic>flox</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 1999</xref>), and <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>tdTomato</italic></sup> reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory.

Analysis of animals without noise exposure was performed on 5- to 6-week old mice. For experiments involving noise exposure, the first recording was performed at 14–15 weeks of age, followed by noise exposure at 16 weeks of age and the additional measurements 1, 3, and 10 days post-exposure. For VsEPs and ABRs, needle electrodes were placed into the skin (a) at the dorsal midline close to the neural crest, (b) behind the left pinna, and (c) at the base of the tail (for a ground electrode). For VsEPs, mice were positioned on their backs, with the head coupled securely to a shaker platform.

The tissues were mounted on microscope slides in Vectashield mounting media (Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA).</p><p>All pieces of each cochlea were imaged at low power to convert cochlear locations into frequency using a custom ImageJ plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.masseyeandear.org/research/otolaryngology/investigators/laboratories/eaton-peabody-laboratories/epl-histology-resources/imagej-plugin-for-cochlear-frequency-mapping-in-whole-mounts">http://www.masseyeandear.org/research/otolaryngology/investigators/laboratories/eaton-peabody-laboratories/epl-histology-resources/imagej-plugin-for-cochlear-frequency-mapping-in-whole-mounts</ext-link>). Confocal <italic>z</italic>-stacks of the 5.6, 8, 11.3, 16, 22.6, and 32 kHz regions from each cochlea were taken using a Zeiss LSM510 microscope equipped with either 40× (1× digital zoom, <italic>Pou4f3/CreER</italic><sup><italic>T</italic></sup> reporter study) or 63× (2× digital zoom, synaptic counts) oil immersion lens. The number of inner hair cells (IHCs) at specific cochlear regions was determined based on the DAPI nuclear counts at the IHC focal plane. For synaptic counts, the <italic>z</italic>-stacks (0.25 µm step size) were set to span the entire length of IHCs so that all the synaptic specializations were imaged. Image stacks were imported to Amira software (Visage Imaging, San Diego, CA), which produced three-dimensional (3D) renderings of each confocal <italic>z</italic>-stack using the ‘connected components’ feature. CtBP2 and GluA2 puncta in each image stacks were then captured and counted automatically. To assess the appositions of CtBP2 with GluA2 puncta (putative synapses) or CtBP2/GluA2 puncta with tdTomato (synaptic puncta on recombined IHCs), the <italic>z</italic>-stacks were re-imaged using custom software (<xref ref-type="other" rid="SD1-data">Source Code 1</xref>) that computed and displayed the <italic>x</italic>-<italic>y</italic> projection of the voxel space within 0.5 µm of the center of each puncta, as identified by Amira analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liberman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). The number of juxtaposed CtBP2 and GluA2 puncta or CtBP2/GluA2 puncta and tdTomato was visualized and counted from these miniature image arrays. Synaptic counts of each <italic>z</italic>-stack were divided by the number of IHC nuclei, which could be visualized by weak staining of CtBP2 antibody. Each image usually contained 8–10 IHCs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported in part by National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders Grants R01 DC 004820 (to GC) and P30 DC 005209 (to MCL), Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Grant P30-HD 18655 (Mental Retardation Research Center) (to GC), the Department of Otolaryngology at Boston Children's Hospital and the Hearing Health Foundation (to GW).</p></ack><sec sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>GW, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>MEG-C, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>ARG, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>MCL, Conception and design, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>GC, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

The Reviewing Editor for your submission, Freda Miller, went over your rebuttal letter and response to the previous reviews, and reviewed the manuscript with the new data. She and the Senior editor felt that you had adequately addressed the only major technical comment from the previous reviews, which had to do with differences in baselines in the different genetic backgrounds. In addition, they both felt that the new data were very interesting. Based upon these new data, the previous excellence and rigor of the study as indicated by all three reviewers, and the thoughtful comments you had made concerning the differences between the current study and previously-published work, we felt that the manuscript now warranted publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>[Editors’ note: this article was originally rejected after discussions between the reviewers, but the authors were invited to resubmit after an appeal against the decision.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled “Neurotrophin-3 regulates ribbon synapse density in the cochlea and induces synapse regeneration after acoustic trauma” for consideration at <italic>eLife.</italic> Your full submission has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. We regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication at this stage.</p><p>In particular, while all of the reviewers appreciated the elegant in vivo approach, and the high quality of the data, they also felt that in light of previously published work (detailed in the reviews), the current manuscript did not represent a substantive enough advance in the field for publication in <italic>eLife.</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>In this manuscript by Wan et al., the authors have addressed a role for the neurotrophins NT-3 and BDNF in the postnatal ear by inducibly deleting or overexpressing NT-3 or BDNF in defined cell populations early in neonatal life. This is a very nicely-performed paper, and the data are largely convincing. Moreover, while there is already a lot known about BDNF and NT-3 during ear development, there are some interesting new conclusions here. The manuscript would, however, be strengthened by considering the following issues: 1) I am concerned about the control baselines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>-D, which show data that are very important to one of the main conclusions of the paper. In particular, the control NT-3flox is very different from the control NT-3stop, and indeed when the floxed NT-3 allele is inducibly deleted, then it looks just like the control NT-3stop. Which baseline is correct? While I realize there could be differences between different backgrounds, this is really a key issue. To clarify this and to make this important conclusion more definitive, it would be important for the authors to provide additional control populations. For example, they could characterize the PLP-creERT mice in the same genetic backgrounds, but without the NT-3flox or stop alleles.</p><p>2) The authors show nice data supporting the idea that NT-3 overexpression enhances synaptic regeneration after acoustic trauma. It would have added to the paper if the authors had asked whether NT-3 expressed by supporting cells was essential for synaptic regeneration by simply performing the same experiment in their NT-3flox mice.</p><p>3) It would be very helpful to prepare a table similar to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> to directly compare the controls and NT-3 overexpressors statistically for the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>This is an elegant and well-designed study on the role of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the postnatal inner ear. Using cell-specific and inducible knockout or overexpression technology, the authors demonstrate that NT-3 and BDNF expressed by supporting cells are required for the maintenance of ribbon synapses, a role distinct from that played during embryogenesis. Their findings show that these neurotrophins have segregated roles, with NT-3 having a major effect on cochlear function, while BDNF acts only in the vestibular organs. The central take-home message of this study is that NT-3 overexpression, but not BDNF, increases ribbon synapse density and elicits regeneration of synaptic contacts between hair cells and sensory neurons after acoustic trauma.</p><p>Recent studies indicate that synaptic loss precedes hair and spiral ganglion cell death in noise-induced and age-related hearing loss. Therefore, the study of signaling factors that regulate inner ear synapse density and synaptic regeneration after acoustic injury is highly significant. Overall, this work has numerous strengths including an extremely well written manuscript and robust data that include appropriate controls. The results are presented in carefully crafted, self-explanatory figures. The use of cell-specific inducible knockout or overexpressing mouse lines together with electrophysiological measurements in a model of acoustic trauma is very strong.</p><p>The overall approach of this study is more comprehensive and sophisticated than previous ones; however, a potential concern is the lack of novelty regarding the role of NT-3 on hair cell synapse regeneration. A previous report demonstrated that exogenous NT-3 increased synapse regeneration by spiral ganglion neurons onto inner hair cells after excitotoxic trauma in vitro (Wang and Green, 2011, J.

For example, this previously published work showed that blocking endogenous NT-3 signaling with TrkC-IgG, but not TrkB-IgG, reduced post-synaptic density regeneration indicating that endogenous NT-3, but not BDNF, is required for synaptogenesis.

They show convincingly that supporting cell-derived BDNF and NT3 are required for the maintenance of ribbon synapses in the vestibular organs and cochlea, respectively, without affecting neuron or axon number. They show that the effects of NT3 on cochlear function and synaptic density and are restricted to the high-frequency, basal region of the cochlea. Furthermore, they show that NT3 overexpression is effective in promoting recovery from noise-induced synaptic degeneration, raising the possibility of developing a novel therapeutic approach for noise-induced hearing loss based on these findings.</p><p>The paper is a technical tour de force, the data are clearly illustrated and the paper is concise and well-written. The findings significantly and usefully extend our understanding of the specific and selective functions of neurotrophins in the mature inner ear, and as such represent an important contribution to the field with potential clinical relevance. I have no major criticisms of this work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03564.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>[…] 1) I am concerned about the control baselines in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic>B</xref><italic>-D, which show data that are very important to one of the main conclusions of the paper. In particular, the control NT-3flox is very different from the control NT-3stop, and indeed when the floxed NT-3 allele is inducibly deleted, then it looks just like the control NT-3stop. Which baseline is correct? While I realize there could be differences between different backgrounds, this is really a key issue. To clarify this and to make this important conclusion more definitive, it would be important for the authors to provide additional control populations. For example, they could characterize the PLP-creERT mice in the same genetic backgrounds, but without the NT-3flox or stop alleles</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer raised a valid point. We have now compared the synapse density in the background strains for both NT -3flox (C57BL/6J) and NT-3stop (FVB/N) lines (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>) and found that C57BL/6J cochleae have higher synaptic density than FVB/N. This explains the different synapse baselines observed between NT-3flox and NT-3stop mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-</xref> D).

A previous report demonstrated that exogenous NT-3 increased synapse regeneration by spiral ganglion neurons onto inner hair cells after excitotoxic trauma</italic> in vitro <italic>(Wang and Green, 2011, J. Neurosci. 31:7938). Although there are several differences between the two studies, the primary finding is similar.

These data are in agreement with the work presented here, but novelty (or lack of) might be an issue</italic>.</p><p>It is true that exogenous NT-3 has been shown to promote afferent reinnervation and synaptic regeneration in cochlear explant cultures. However, we believe that the significance and implications of our study, which focus on the adult and exposure to noise, are vastly different from the Wang and Green paper.</p><p>a) The Wang and Green paper is based on neonatal tissues, a time at which cochlear synapses are immature and even hair cell regeneration occurs spontaneously. Therefore, the conclusions of that paper are relevant to synapse development, not necessarily for synapse regeneration in the adult inner ear.</p><p>b) We show for the first time that the endogenous NT-3 from supporting cells surrounding the IHCs are important for formation/maintenance of the ribbon synapses.</p><p>c) By working in intact animals, we demonstrate that functional relevance of NT-3 on synapse formation and regeneration in the context of hearing in the normal and injured inner ear.</p><p>d) While tissue culture studies can provide important insights into biological process and mechanisms, there are many examples of conclusions reached by in vitro studies that were eventually invalidated by in vivo experiments. We believe that showing that NT-3 can alter the consequences of noise exposure in the adult is novel and has clinical implications for the development of treatments for sensorineural hearing loss that go beyond what the Wang and Green paper provided.</p><p><italic>The use of PSD95 as a post-synaptic marker is more common than GluA2 and might be more appropriate to compare current data with previous work</italic>.</p><p>We have previously shown that pre-synaptic ribbons (labeled by CtBP2) of inner hair cell-spiral ganglion neuron synapses have similar juxtaposition to PSD95 (Yuan Y et al.
