<italic>Biomphalaria</italic> are critical for combating <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>, the predominant cause of human intestinal schistosomiasis. Independently, many of these factors play an important role in, but do not fully define, the compatibility between the model snail <italic>B. glabrata</italic>, and <italic>S. mansoni</italic>. Here, we demonstrate association between four previously characterized humoral immune molecules; <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3, <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1, <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 and Biomphalysin. We also identify unique immune determinants in the plasma of <italic>S. mansoni</italic>-resistant <italic>B. glabrata</italic> that associate with the incompatible phenotype. These factors coordinate to initiate haemocyte-mediated destruction of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocysts via production of reactive oxygen species. The inclusion of <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 in a <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3-initiated complex that also includes <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 almost completely explains resistance to <italic>S. mansoni</italic> in this model. Our study unifies many independent lines of investigation to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the snail immune system in the context of infection by this important human parasite.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic></kwd><kwd>host-parasite compatibility</kwd><kwd>invertebrate immunology</kwd><kwd>humoral immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-05209</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanington</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018- 522661</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanington</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31272682</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Xinzhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004607</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016JJD130059</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Xinzhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A coordinated humoral immune response that includes recognition, effector and cytotoxic factors engages the cell-mediated immune response to defend a snail against infection by schistosome parasites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Schistosomiasis, a disease caused by parasitic trematodes of the genus <italic>Schistosoma</italic>, is second only to malaria as the most socioeconomically devastating parasitic disease, with an estimated 252 million people infected worldwide in 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Disease et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mortality and GBD 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators, 2016</xref>). Larval digenean trematodes share a common feature in the use of snails (gastropod mollusks) as intermediate hosts for transmission to a vertebrate host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Esch et al., 2002</xref>). The snail <italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic> transmits several species of trematode, including <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>, the predominant causal species of intestinal schistosomiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pila et al., 2016a</xref>). The molecular interactions between <italic>B. glabrata</italic> and <italic>S. mansoni</italic> have been studied extensively towards better understanding this essential life cycle stage of an important human parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adema, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Various genetically determined resistance phenotypes exist with respect to <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection in <italic>B. glabrata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Richards, 1975a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Richards, 1975b</xref>). Some <italic>B. glabrata</italic> snails (such as BS-90 strain) naturally resist <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection. Susceptible <italic>B. glabrata</italic> (such as M-line strain) can develop transient levels of acquired resistance following previous exposure to incompatible or radiation-attenuated parasites with modest cross protection to related digenean species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lie and Heyneman, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lie et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sullivan et al., 1982</xref>). Previous research has focused on identifying the mechanisms responsible for determining resistance profiles. Using in vivo and in vitro models of <italic>B. glabrata</italic> snails, it has been demonstrated that the killing of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> larvae is associated with a haemocyte-mediated cytotoxic mechanism, and passive transfer of natural resistance to <italic>S. mansoni</italic> has been successfully accomplished when haemocytes from a susceptible <italic>B. glabrata</italic> strain are incubated in cell-free haemolymph (plasma) from a resistant strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bayne et al., 1980a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bayne et al., 1980b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Granath and Yoshino, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Loker and Bayne, 1982</xref>). Thus, haemocytes from resistant or susceptible <italic>B. glabrata</italic> strains do not appear to differ a priori in their cytotoxic capabilities, but their response requires activation by some humoral factor(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bayne et al., 1980b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Granath and Yoshino, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vasquez and Sullivan, 2001</xref>), for proper recognition of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and enhancing haemocyte cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hahn et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Researchers have long sought immune determinants present in resistant <italic>B. glabrata</italic> plasma that specifically activate haemocytes to encapsulate and destroy <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocysts. Identified in <italic>B. glabrata</italic>, a large family of soluble lectins termed fibrinogen-related proteins (<italic>Bg</italic>FREPs) attracted widespread interest because of their unique structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adema et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gordy et al., 2015</xref>), capacity for somatic diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>), and immune function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hanington et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hanington and Zhang, 2011</xref>). <italic>Bg</italic>FREPs are composed of a C-terminal fibrinogen (FBG) domain and either one or two N-terminal immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) domains linked to the FBG domain by an interceding region (ICR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Léonard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>). Numerous studies have implicated <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 as playing a central role in <italic>B. glabrata</italic> resistance to digenetic trematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hanington et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hanington et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hanington and Zhang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lockyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lockyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pila et al., 2017b</xref>). <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 contains two tandem IgSF domains whereas <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 has one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Léonard et al., 2001</xref>). The expression of <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 in BS-90 snails is dramatically up-regulated (57-fold) after exposure to <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, whereas M-line snails do not feature such a drastic upregulation, thereby suggesting a role for <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 in resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hertel et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, the time course for heightened <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 expression overlaps the interval within which sporocysts are encapsulated and killed, and only occurs in BS-90 haemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dinguirard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hertel et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore it was reported that <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 is reactive with <italic>S. mansoni</italic> polymorphic mucins (<italic>Sm</italic>PoMucs) found on the tegumental surface of larval <italic>S. mansoni</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moné et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In addition to <italic>Bg</italic>FREPs, other soluble immune effector factors which are involved in both the direct killing of sporocysts and preparation of haemocytes to mount a cell-mediated response have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pila et al., 2017a</xref>). These factors include <italic>B. glabrata</italic> thioester-containing proteins (<italic>Bg</italic>TEPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bender et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moné et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Portet et al., 2018</xref>) and Biomphalysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galinier et al., 2013</xref>). TEPs are key components of invertebrate and vertebrate immune responses, aiding in melanization, opsonization, and killing of invading pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baxter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blandin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levashina et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pila et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Portet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Povelones et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yassine and Osta, 2010</xref>). <italic>Bg</italic>TEP was first characterized as an alpha macroglobulin proteinase inhibitor, and has recently re-emerged as a molecule of interest due to its association with <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 and <italic>Sm</italic>PoMucs, and the capacity to bind to various invading pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bender et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moné et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Portet et al., 2018</xref>). Biomphalysin is a cytolytic protein in <italic>B. glabrata</italic> belonging to the β pore-forming toxin (β-PFT) superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galinier et al., 2013</xref>). Biomphalysin binds to the surface of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocysts in the absence of plasma, while its cytolytic activity is drastically increased when plasma is present, suggesting that other factor(s) within the plasma may mediate the conversion of the oligomeric pre-pore to a functional pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galinier et al., 2013</xref>). Although the functional mechanisms of these factors are not thoroughly understood, studies suggest that these factors function as key determinants in the final outcome of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> challenge of <italic>B. glabrata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galinier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moné et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>While studies have implicated <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 in resistance to <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, the underlying mechanism of <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 function; how it binds to <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocyst surfaces, and then how recognition is translated into haemocyte engagement, activation, and ultimately parasite encapsulation, is still unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hanington et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we report an association between <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3, <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1, Biomphalysin (UniProtKB/TrEMBL: A0A182YTN9 and A0A182YTZ4) and <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 (UniProtKB/TrEMBL: A0A2C9L9F5). <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 associates with <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 and Biomphalysin in both M-line and BS-90 strains, but only in BS-90 strain uniquely interacts with <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 and other versions of <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 (a variant of <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3.3), providing us with an important insight into why BS-90 strain is refractory to <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection. In this study, we demonstrate that <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 binds to <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocysts without any other soluble plasma factors, yet binding of <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 relies on <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1. However, <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 still interacts with <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 to form unique immune complexes, which significantly enhance the ability of haemocytes and plasma from <italic>S. mansoni</italic>-susceptible <italic>B. glabrata</italic> (M-line) to kill <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocysts. A more striking finding is that the combination of <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3, <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 and <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 renders M-line haemocytes capable of killing <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocysts at nearly the same level as <italic>S. mansoni</italic>-resistant BS-90 haemocytes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are shown to play an important role during this haemocyte-mediated killing of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocysts. These results provide insight into how the numerous previously characterized immune factors known to be important in the anti-<italic>S. mansoni</italic> immune response to <italic>B. glabrata</italic> are acting in concert to defend the snail host.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 interacts with <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1, Biomphalysin, <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 and other <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 variants in snail plasma</title><p>To identify the factors in snail plasma which interact with <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3, we produced recombinant <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 (r<italic>Bg</italic>FREP3, GenBank: AY028461.1, M-line strain) using an insect expression system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) and performed a series of pull-down experiments. We initiated our investigations with <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 because we observed that the cell-free plasma of BS-90 snails contained more <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 than does M-line snail plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Among the proteins identified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the eluent of these pull-down experiments was <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We performed four replicate r<italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 pull-down experiments, each yielded a band at approximately 200 kDa, which corresponded to the full-length <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1, which was identified from both M-line and BS-90 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In three instances, we excised the bands from SDS-PAGE gels for mass spectrometry identification, this showed twice that <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 was pulled down by r<italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 in M-line plasma, while this was shown once in both M-line and BS-90 plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). From the LC-MS/MS analysis we obtained a total of 17 unique peptides, 16 peptides were detected from M-line strain, four peptides were from BS-90 strain, and three peptides were present in both BS-90 and M-line strains (Table. S2 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). While all peptides mapped to <italic>Bg</italic>TEP, there was uncertainty as to which specific <italic>Bg</italic>TEP proteins are present. Twelve peptides mapped to <italic>Bg</italic>TEP (GenBank: ACL00841.1); 15 peptides mapped to <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1.1 (GenBank: ADE45332.1, from a Brazilian strain of <italic>B. glabrata</italic>), <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1.2 (GenBank: ADE45339.1, from a Brazilian strain of <italic>B. glabrata</italic>), <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1.3 (GenBank: ADE45340.1, from a Brazilian strain of <italic>B. glabrata</italic>), <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1.4 (GenBank: ADE45341.1, from a Brazilian strain of <italic>B. glabrata</italic>) and <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1.5 (GenBank: ADE45333.1, from a Brazilian strain of <italic>B. glabrata</italic>), however, there was overlap between some of these peptides, which mapped to all known <italic>Bg</italic>TEP sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>).

Thus, all of the <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 peptides were identified from bands that were of greater molecular weight than the predicted <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2, which was ~43 kDa.

Of the nine peptides identified by LC-MS/MS, seven specifically matched <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3.3 (Genbank: AEO50747.1), the other two matched other members of <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 family: <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3.3 (GenBank: AAO59915.1), <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3.2 (GenBank: AEO50746.1), <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3.2 (GenBank: AAK28656.1) and <italic>Bg</italic>MFREP3 (GenBank: AAK13548.1), suggesting that this protein was likely a FREP3 variant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata5">Figure 1—source data 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The seven peptides that specifically belonged to <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3.3 (AEO50747.1) covered 15.6% of the amino acid sequence length and mainly concentrated in the ICR (five peptides), and one peptide in each of the IgSF2 domain and FBG domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata5">Figure 1—source data 5</xref>).

Nevertheless, we have little knowledge of the underlying mechanism by which <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 interacts with other snail plasma factors in order to signal and trigger an immune response after recognizing the pathogen. In order to explore this mechanism, we conducted a series of pull-down experiments that allowed us to discover the interaction between <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1, Biomphalysin and <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 with <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Proteomic analysis of <italic>B. glabrata</italic> plasma revealed that <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3, <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 and <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 display affinity for <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocyst tegumental membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Portet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 was previously reported to play a role in <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 recognition of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocyst <italic>Sm</italic>PoMucs, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moné et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Portet et al., 2018</xref>). Our immunofluorescence results illustrate that <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 independently recognizes <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocysts, whereas <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 must be involved with the participation of <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We speculate that this may be due to their structural differences: <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 possesses two IgSF domains, yet <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 has only one; <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 exists as a multimer in its natural state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), whereas <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Alternatively, it is possible that the targets they recognize are different, so the immunoaffinity reactions that occur are also fundamentally different. A recent report suggests that <italic>Bg</italic>FREPs are likely to form multimers through the coiled-coil region of the ICR. However, this has not been supported by experimental evidence and does not completely rule out the possibility that <italic>Bg</italic>FREP multimer formation is mediated by the FBG or IgSF domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gorbushin, 2019</xref>).</p><p><italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 and <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 form a complex without any <italic>S. mansoni</italic> molecules present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We do not yet know exactly how <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 is activated during infection. It is possible that <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 is stabilizing <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 like the leucine-rich repeat immune protein (LRIM)/<italic>Anopheles Plasmodium</italic>-responsive Leucine-rich repeat protein 1 (APL1C) complex that has been found to stabilize TEP in <italic>Anopheles gambiae,</italic> while also guiding it to the sporocyst’s surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fraiture et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, our LC-MS/MS results seem to indicate that <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 interacted with a full-length form of <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1, while previous work has only found the C-terminal portion of <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 associating with <italic>Sm</italic>PoMucs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moné et al., 2010</xref>). This may indicate that once brought in association with the parasite, <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 becomes cleaved/activated. <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 does not require <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 to recognize pathogens, this suggests <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 is more likely to play a role in the downstream immune response initiated by <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3. Following the addition of r<italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 and r<italic>Bg</italic>TEP1, plasma demonstrated an increased capacity to kill sporocysts compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Toxicity of haemoglobin oxidation to <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocysts was ruled out as a possible mechanism underpinning sporocyst killing because the <italic>B. glabrata</italic> plasma used in these tests had haemoglobin removed. These studies also demonstrated that recombinant <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 and <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 alone were not able to increase sporocyst killing, but showed that the addition of cell-free plasma with both recombinants was required, thereby implying the necessity of another factor(s). Based on our pull-down experiments, we suggest that this factor could be a Biomphalysin. Biomphalysin possesses many similarities to members of the β-PFT superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howard and Buckley, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MacKenzie et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilmsen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2014</xref>), and has been shown to have cytolytic activity that is mediated by a plasma factor(s) that remains to be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galinier et al., 2013</xref>). Our results suggest a scenario in which <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 and/or <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 could be the factors associating with Biomphalysin to promote plasma-mediated sporocyst killing. <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 and/or <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 might activate Biomphalysin in an unknown manner, assist in the oligomerization of Biomphalysin while it forms its heptameric channel, or mediate the conversion of the oligomeric pre-pore to a functional pore. Further investigation is warranted to illustrate the role of <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 and <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 in the activation of Biomphalysin.</p><p>Within 2–3 hr of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> entry into <italic>B. glabrata</italic>, haemocytes surround the developing sporocysts forming multi-layered cellular capsules that kill encapsulated larvae within 24–48 hr post-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dinguirard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Loker and Bayne, 1982</xref>). This occurs in both susceptible and resistant snail strains and has been replicated in our in vitro functional studies, where only resistant snails can eventually destroy the sporocysts without external assistance. Dinguirard et al. conducted a comparative proteomic analysis on the responses of haemocytes participating in <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocyst encapsulation reactions from susceptible and resistant <italic>B. glabrata</italic> strains, showing a striking differences in proteins expressed, with susceptible snail haemocytes exhibiting extensive downregulation of protein expression and a lower level of constitutively expressed proteins involved immunity (e.g., <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2) and ROS production compared to resistant snails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dinguirard et al., 2018</xref>).

These dramatic increases in the abundance of immune-relevant transcripts occurring over the first 12–24 hr post exposure to <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocysts in BS-90 snails aligns closely with our results that demonstrate sporocyst killing by BS-90 haemocytes rapidly increases after 12 hr post-exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Numerous studies have demonstrated the production of ROS by haemocytes in <italic>B. glabrata</italic>, especially H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which plays a vital role in anti-schistosome defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galinier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hahn et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hahn et al., 2001</xref>). Haemocytes from <italic>S. mansoni</italic>-resistant snails produce significantly more ROS than susceptible snails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bender et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bender et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goodall et al., 2004</xref>). In our study, ROS was critical in BS-90 haemocyte-mediated <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocyst killing, as this ability was significantly reduced after pre-incubation with the ROS inhibitors NAC and DPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, according to the phenomenon of passively transferred resistance, the cytotoxic potential of susceptible haemocytes may not be fundamentally different from resistant snails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Granath and Yoshino, 1984</xref>). We infer that M-line plasma may lack some factors or may not achieve sufficient thresholds of certain factors to stimulate haemocytes to produce ROS. It is also possible that M-line haemocytes are lacking specific receptors to receive signals that upregulate ROS to effective levels able to kill <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocysts. Previously, our team identified a toll-like receptor (<italic>Bg</italic>TLR) from haemocyte surface of <italic>B. glabrata</italic> snails, which differed in abundance between M-line and BS-90 strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pila et al., 2016b</xref>). It has been repeatedly demonstrated in other organisms that activation of Toll-like receptors is associated with increased intracellular ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asehnoune et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsung et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wong et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our results indicate that the <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3-<italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 complex plays a role in raising ROS levels in M-line haemocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We found that BS-90 haemolymph contains more <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 protein than M-line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, the BS-90 haemocytes significantly increased the expression level of <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 during encapsulating <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocysts compared with susceptible snail haemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dinguirard et al., 2018</xref>). These suggest that <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 and <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 may play a crucial role in inducing haemocytes which take part in encapsulating sporocysts to generate ROS. We suppose that <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 also plays an opsonin role in the <italic>B. glabrata</italic> snail haemolymph, which interacts with molecules on the surface of haemocytes, thereby promoting the phagocytosis of pathogens.</p><p>Our data suggests that there are fundamental differences between the <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3-mediated immune response between BS-90 and M-line <italic>B. glabrata</italic>. Protein Pull-down experiments yielded two obvious and unique protein bands that were present in BS-90 but not M-line pull-downs. We identified the bands to be a variant of <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3.3 and <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), showing different immune factor interactomes between different strains. This suggests that <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 variants and <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 in BS-90 plasma are more prone to r<italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 binding, and the combination of different versions of <italic>Bg</italic>FREPs seems to play an important and unknown role in snail resistance. Both <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 and <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 are characterized by high diversity, our results imply that the versions of <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 and <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 in the two snail strains are different. After exposure to <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, the expression of <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 in resistant snails is superior to that of susceptible snails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dinguirard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gordy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hertel et al., 2005</xref>). This again suggests that <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 is important in determining the outcome of the compatibility of <italic>B. glabrata</italic> against <italic>S. mansoni</italic>. Our study implies that <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 seems to play an ‘all or none’ switching effect in determining <italic>B.glabrata-S. mansoni</italic> compatibility, while <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 seems to play an additive role.</p><p>It has been decades since the discovery and initial characterization of <italic>Bg</italic>FREPs in the <italic>B. glabrata</italic> immune response to <italic>S. mansoni</italic>. While numerous studies since have implicated <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 and <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 along with a suite of other immune factors, as being important elements of the snail immune response to <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, how the response is coordinated has remained elusive. Our study presents a model in which many of the known determinants of snail resistance to <italic>S. mansoni</italic> work in concert to protect the snail host against infection. We map a mechanism for the interaction of <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3, <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1, <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 and Biomphalysin with <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocysts in <italic>B. glabrata</italic> snail haemolymph that ultimately leads to sporocyst killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Central to this response is <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3, which is able to recruit unique representatives of both <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 and <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 in <italic>S. mansoni</italic>-resistant BS-90 <italic>B. glabrata</italic>. With this new-found understanding of the <italic>B. glabrata</italic> immune response comes the ability to now undertake comprehensive assessments of how modifications to both the snail host and the parasite influence the underpinning immunological drivers of compatibility in this important model for studying human schistosomes.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Interaction of <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3, <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2, <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 and Biomphalysin in <italic>B. glabrata</italic> snail haemolymph and possible functional mechanisms against <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection.</title><p>This figure is a schematic drawing based on the results of previous studies and our work. In the absence of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> invasion (blue background area), both M-line and BS-90 <italic>B. glabrata</italic> snail hemolymphs contain <italic>Bg</italic>FREPs, <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 and Biomphalysin and other immune factors. Upon <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection, BS-90 strain (red background area) and M-line (green background area) strains demonstrate different protein interaction repertoires (red dotted frame in BS-90, green dotted frame in M-line). According to our pull-down results, <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 in BS-90 plasma specifically interacts with <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 and other versions of <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 (blue horizontal one-way or two-way arrows). In addition, compared with the M-line strain, the BS-90 strain has more haemocytes (immune effector cells) in the snail haemolymph, and <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3, <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2, and <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 are all up-regulated (red upward arrow). The more complex interactome of immune factors in BS-90 plasma results in higher levels of ROS (with cytotoxic activity) secreted by haemocytes. In conclusion, different coordination of humoral immune factors between BS-90 and M-line strains aids in dictating compatibility to <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51708-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Live material and experimental treatments</title><p>M-line and BS-90 strain <italic>B. glabrata</italic> snails were used in this study.

All RT-PCRs were performed on a QuantStudio 3 PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using the following thermocycling conditions: initial hold at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min, with data collection every cycle. Specificity for the gene specific primers RT-PCR was confirmed by continuous melt curve analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>In vitro S. mansoni sporocyst killing assays</title><p>Haemolymph from 25 M-line or BS-90 strain <italic>B. glabrata,</italic> sterilized as reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hahn et al. (2001)</xref>, was pooled into 1.5 mL tubes and kept on ice. Haemocytes were isolated from plasma by centrifugation at 70 × g for 10 min at 4°C followed by aspiration of the cell free plasma, which was kept for assessment of plasma-mediated killing of sporocysts. Haemocytes were resuspended in modified <italic>Bg</italic>e-cell medium (m<italic>Bg</italic>e) medium [22% Schneider’s <italic>Drosophila</italic> medium (Thermo Scientific), 7 mM D-glucose, 24 mM NaCl, and 20 mg/mL gentamicin at pH 7.4] and washed three times following the same centrifugation protocol. Haemocytes were then resuspended to a final concentration of 50 cells/µL in m<italic>Bg</italic>e medium and 200 µL of this suspension was added to the wells of a 96-well tissue culture plate pre-treated with poly-L-lysine that contained 10 <italic>s. mansoni</italic> sporocysts that were transformed using previously published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hambrook et al., 2018</xref>). Treatment consisted of 200 pM of each recombinant protein (<italic>Bg</italic>FREP3, <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1, <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2). Three anti-<italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 antibodies (anti-IgSF #1 and #3, anti-FBG #1) that were generated to peptides within the IgSF and FBG domains were used as a cocktail (combined concentration of 2.5 mg/mL) were used the antibody blocking assays. Sporocyst viability was assessed using the protocol published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hahn et al. (2001)</xref>. Briefly, Propidium iodide (Millipore Sigma), was added to each well to a final concentration of 10 µg/mL. Sporocyst viability was assessed using a fluorescent inverted microscope (Zeiss) starting at 3 hr post incubation with haemocytes/plasma and then measured again at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hr post incubation. Sporocyst death was determined by propidium iodide-staining of the nuclei of the sporocyst. Any sporocyst deemed dead, was left in the well until the end of the time-course so that the experimental conditions were not disturbed differentially in wells where sporocyst mortality was more frequent.</p><p>Cell-free plasma from M-line and BS-90 snails was ultracentrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 3 hr at 4°C to remove haemoglobin, which is known to have a toxic effect on sporocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bender et al., 2002</xref>). Haemoglobin removal using ultracentrifugation has been shown to lead to no qualitative differences in plasma protein composition other than the depletion of haemoglobin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zelck et al., 1995</xref>). Ultracentrifuged plasma was mixed 50:50 with m<italic>Bg</italic>e medium at room temperature and then incubated with 10 <italic>s. mansoni</italic> sporocysts according to the protocol outlined above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Assessment of reactive oxygen species production by haemocytes in vitro</title><p>To assess the role that ROS had on sporocyst killing by haemocytes the above haemocyte in vitro killing assays were repeated with addition of three well characterized inhibitors of ROS; diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and catalase. All ROS inhibitors (DPI at a final concentration of 150 nM, NAC at a final concentration of 1 mM and a working concentration of 14000 units of catalase/mL) were incubated along with haemocytes (and plasma in the case of catalase) and <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocysts as described above in the haemocyte-based sporocyst killing assay.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Bioinformatic and statistical analysis</title><p>We used Clustal Omega (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/</ext-link>) to align the amino acid sequences for <italic>Bg</italic>TEPs, Biomphalysins and <italic>Bg</italic>FREPs which acquired from GenBank [National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)].

socioeconomically devastating parasitic disease. <italic>Schistosoma</italic> use snails as intermediate hosts for transmission to a vertebrate host. The molecular interactions between the snail (<italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic>) and <italic>Schistosoma (Schistosoma mansoni</italic>) have been studied extensively towards better understanding this essential life cycle stage of an important human parasite. Some B. glabrata snails are naturally resistant to <italic>Schistosoma</italic> infection while other are susceptible. Researchers have long sought immune determinants present in resistant snail that specifically activate haemocytes to encapsulate and destroy <italic>Schistosoma</italic>. This led to the identification of soluble lectins termed fibrinogen-related proteins (<italic>Bg</italic>FREPs). This article describes the underlying mechanism of <italic>Bg</italic>FREP function reporting how it binds to Schistosoma <italic>mansoni</italic> sporocyst surfaces, and then how recognition is translated into haemocyte engagement, activation, and ultimately parasite encapsulation. Collectively, it provides insight into how numerous previously characterized immune factors known to be important in the anti-<italic>Schistosoma</italic> immune response act in concert to defend the snail host. This an important contribution in the fields on invertebrate immunity and parasitology.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Coordination of humoral immune factors dictates compatibility between &lt; <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> and <italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Coen Adema (Reviewer #2); Tim Yoshino (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Although a diversity of soluble hemolymph proteins has been previously associated with immune resistance to larval schistosome infection in inbred strains of the snail <italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic>, the mechanism(s) mediating larval recognition and/or killing in model <italic>B. glabrata/S. mansoni</italic> systems has not been defined. Li et al. present evidence that differing molecular interaction of four of the major immune proteins (Frep3, Tep1, Frep2 and Biomphalysin) can account for or explain the infectivity phenotypes exhibited by susceptible (M-line) and resistant (BS-90) <italic>B. glabrata</italic> strains. This was accomplished by generating recombinant Frep3, Tep1 and Frep2 proteins and specific anti-Frep3 antisera, and incorporating these in plasma pull-down assays, sporocyst binding assays, Western and far-Western blot analyses and in vitro cytotoxicity inhibition assays. All experiments appeared to be well-designed and appropriately controlled, and overall results generally support their conclusion that interactions between Frep3, in association with Tep1 and Frep2, and host hemocytes account for the different compatibility phenotypes exhibited in this model system. However, there are several points that need addressing that could result in altered conclusions or significant clarifications.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Physical evidence that rFrep3 alone, but not rFrep2 or rTep1 alone, can bind to sporocysts is provided by ICC using fixed parasites. Assuming, as stated, that recomb. proteins bind to the outer tegumental of larvae, the localization pattern of Frep3 and Frep2/Tep1 binding do not appear to reflect such a surface binding pattern. This raises the question regarding the specificity of Frep2/3/Tep reactivity with the tegument of living sporocysts, which is at the center of this paper. Performing similar ICC experiments, initially treating live sporocysts to recombinant proteins (suggest shorter exposure times of 4-6 hrs), washing and then fixing, should provide a more accurate representation of Frep/Tep binding interactions with the unaltered sporocyst surface.</p><p>2) Biomphalysin, a pore-forming protein, is speculated as the mechanism responsible for plasma-mediated killing of sporocysts in vitro (Figure 4A). However, an alternative mechanism may be the presence of ROS (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) naturally occurring in the plasma of BS-90 compared to M-line snails. To resolve this question, an experiment in which a ROS scavenger enzyme (e.g., catalase) is added to BS-90 plasma (and M-line plasma treated Frep/Tep) prior to sporocyst exposure in the CMC assay could be performed to eliminate an ROS-mediated mechanism.</p><p>3) &quot;These pull-down results&quot; Also with interaction taking place without involvement of parasite products, is this the same for BS90 and M snails? How is this regulated in absence of pathogen to avoid aspecific continuous immune activation? Does FREP3 transport TEP to recognized parasite antigens, resulting in activation of TEP to facilitate downstream activation?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51708.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Physical evidence that rFrep3 alone, but not rFrep2 or rTep1 alone, can bind to sporocysts is provided by ICC using fixed parasites.

Initially, we did not use confocal microscopy to evaluate tegumental binding. In our revised submission, we confirm tegument binding by clearly demonstrating a ring of recognition around the sporocyst. We approached this study as suggested, incubating live sporocysts with r<italic>Bg</italic>FREP3, r<italic>Bg</italic>FREP2, r<italic>Bg</italic>FREP2+r<italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 and r<italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 along with controls. As is now indicated in the Materials and methods, live primary sporocysts of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> were incubated with recombinant proteins at 26°C, then washed and fixed, and the subsequent steps were consistent with previous immunofluorescence staining experiments. We also replicated the method of our initial study, adding ther<italic>Bg</italic>FREP3+r<italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 treatment to further validate our pull-down results that suggest that FRE3 and TEP associate without immune stimulation, and assessed using a confocal microscope. These repeated studies also yielded clear surface binding. To replace the original images, we chose to use fixed sporocysts because the fluorescence intensity with fixed sporocysts was stronger than that with live sporocysts. We have included the images of the sporocysts that were incubated with the treatments while alive (as was suggested) as Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Biomphalysin, a pore-forming protein, is speculated as the mechanism responsible for plasma-mediated killing of sporocysts in vitro (Figure 4A).

We undertook the recommended study to utilize a ROS scavenger specific to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, added in advance to the BS-90 plasma. A ROS scavenger (catalase) was pre-incubated with cell-free BS-90 plasma and then the rest of the study was performed following the previously established method. With the exclusion of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, BS-90 plasma was still able to kill <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocysts, thereby strengthening the likelihood of a non-ROS mediated mechanism by which humoral killing is mediated. The new results are presented in a revised Figure 4—figure supplement 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) &quot;These pull-down results&quot; Also with interaction taking place without involvement of parasite products, is this the same for BS90 and M snails? How is this regulated in absence of pathogen to avoid aspecific continuous immune activation? Does FREP3 transport TEP to recognized parasite antigens, resulting in activation of TEP to facilitate downstream activation?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the r<italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 pull-down results, we identified <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 in both BS-90 and M-line snails without the involvement of parasite products. Unfortunately, we do not know whether these interactions differ regarding their frequency within the different strains. Given that we have found <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 levels to be similar between strains (Figure 1—figure supplement 3), the noticeable difference in <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 levels, as evidenced by our Western Blots of snail plasma (Figure 1B), may in fact result in higher circulating levels of a <italic>Bg</italic>TEP/<italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 complex.</p><p>The reviewers raise an excellent point in questioning the mechanism of <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 activation. Although <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 appears to interact with <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 in the plasma of both snail strains, as is demonstrated by the r<italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 pull-down results, we also show that r<italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 specifically interacted with <italic>Bg</italic>FREP2 and other versions of r<italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 only in BS-90 snail plasma. These differing results between strains suggests that specific immune complexes that associate with <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 may be differentially activated and/or regulated depending on the specific <italic>Bg</italic>FREPs present. To date, we are not sure of the exact mechanism by which <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 is activated, nor do we know how this activation is regulated in the absence of pathogen. In pursuit of a resolution to this query, we hypothesized that <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 may operate in a similar manner to TEP1 of the <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, in which a pair of Leucine-rich repeat containing molecules stabilize <italic>Ag</italic>TEP, prior to its binding to the surface of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ookinetes (Fraiture et al., 2009). We thought that <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 may function analogously to the LRR molecules LRIM1 and APLC, serving to stabilize <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1, while also guiding it to specific targets recognized by the <italic>Bg</italic>FREP on the parasite surface. Further protein pull-down investigations with a focus on determining whether <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 cleavage products were observed reflected our past results, suggesting that <italic>Bg</italic>FREP3 interacts with a full-length form of <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1. This contrasts the observations from the <italic>Anopheles</italic> model and also those of Mone et al. which suggest that the C-terminal portion of <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 associates with <italic>S. mansoni</italic> polymorphic mucins (<italic>Sm</italic>PoMucs). This suggests that once brought in association with the parasite, <italic>Bg</italic>TEP1 becomes cleaved/activated, but that activation (via cleavage into the N and C-terminal domains) does not occur without some pathogen-related stimulation. We have added clarification of this in the text of our Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
