molecular mechanism(s) involved in this process remain largely enigmatic. Here, using immunopeptidomics in combination with novel cell-based assays that assess TAPBPR-mediated peptide exchange, we reveal a critical role for the K22-D35 loop of TAPBPR in mediating peptide exchange on MHC I. We identify a specific leucine within this loop that enables TAPBPR to facilitate peptide dissociation from MHC I. Moreover, we delineate the molecular features of the MHC I F pocket required for TAPBPR to promote peptide dissociation in a loop-dependent manner. These data reveal that chaperone-mediated peptide editing on MHC I can occur by different mechanisms dependent on the C-terminal residue that the MHC I accommodates in its F pocket and provide novel insights that may inform the therapeutic potential of TAPBPR manipulation to increase tumour immunogenicity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>antigen processing</kwd><kwd>antigen presentation</kwd><kwd>major histocompatibility complex</kwd><kwd>TAPBPR/TAPBPL</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104647/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neerincx</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name><name><surname>Boyle</surname><given-names>Louise H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001322</institution-id><institution>South African Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hermann</surname><given-names>Clemens</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UF100371</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deane</surname><given-names>Janet E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bosch-Forschungsstiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marcu</surname><given-names>Ana</given-names></name><name><surname>Stefvanovic</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>109076/Z/15/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ilca</surname><given-names>Florin Tudor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Immunopeptidomics in combination with novel cell-based assays that assess peptide exchange reveal a critical role for the K22-D35 loop of TAPBPR in mediating peptide dissociation and peptide selection on MHC I.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules play a critical role in immmunosurveillance, particularly in the context of viral infections and cancer, by presenting antigenic peptides to CD8 +T cells. Prior to their cell surface export, MHC I molecules undergo peptide editing, a process that involves the exchange of low-affinity peptides for those of higher affinity. In addition to ensuring that only stable peptide:MHC I complexes are released to the plasma membrane, peptide editing ultimately controls the peptide repertoire that is displayed for immune detection. For over two decades, tapasin was the only known peptide editor for MHC I, facilitating peptide selection within the confines of the peptide loading complex (PLC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Williams et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Howarth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen and Bouvier, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wearsch and Cresswell, 2007</xref>). However, it is now well-recognised that the tapasin-related protein TAPBPR is a second independent peptide editor that performs peptide exchange outside the PLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boyle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hermann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Morozov et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, TAPBPR can work in cooperation with UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1 (UGT1) to reglucosylate MHC I, causing recycling of MHC molecules to the PLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Neerincx et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although TAPBPR usually functions as an intracellular peptide editor, we have recently made the fascinating discovery that when given access to surface expressed MHC I molecules, TAPBPR retains its function as a peptide exchange catalyst and can be utilised to display immunogenic peptides of choice directly onto the surface of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ilca et al., 2018</xref>). We have therefore identified that manipulation of TAPBPR function may be utilised as a potential immunotherapeutic that facilitates the presentation of both neoantigens and viral-derived peptides, thereby overriding the endogenous cellular antigen processing pathway. Moreover, we have also developed two novel functional assays that enable detailed interrogation of TAPBPR-mediated peptide exchange on MHC I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ilca et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Precisely how tapasin and TAPBPR function at the molecular level remains largely enigmatic. The recently reported crystal structures of human TAPBPR in complex with mouse MHC I captured the endpoint of peptide editing, thereby suggesting that TAPBPR facilitates peptide exchange by widening the peptide binding groove of MHC I at the α2–1 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thomas and Tampé, 2017</xref>). However, there remains an incomplete understanding of the step-by-step processes by which the two peptide editors, TAPBPR and tapasin, recognise peptide-loaded MHC I molecules and actively facilitate peptide dissociation to result in the conformations observed in the crystal structures. Indeed, McShan et al. have recently used NMR in an attempt to further delineate the dynamic process of peptide exchange on MHC I by TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McShan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, the structure reported by Thomas and Tampe identified a loop of TAPBPR that was proposed to interact with the peptide binding groove of MHC I, where the C-terminus of bound peptide usually resides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thomas and Tampé, 2017</xref>). While this study demonstrated the localisation of the loop, to date, there is no experimental evidence to support the notion that this loop mediates peptide exchange on MHC I. In contrast, Jiang <italic>et al.</italic> failed to capture the loop in proximity to the peptide-binding groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>), further questioning the relevance and importance of this loop in TAPBPR-mediated peptide exchange. Given the discordance between the data reported for the captured structures and the lack of functional evidence to support any role for this loop, it is vital to reconcile these discrepancies to understand whether the TAPBPR loop is involved in peptide exchange.</p><p>Here, we investigate the functional importance of the K22-D35 loop using two newly developed assays in combination with immunopeptidomic analysis. Our data demonstrates that this loop is critical for peptide dissociation from MHC I. Furthermore, we highlight key molecular features governing TAPBPR:MHC I interaction and provide insight into the mechanism(s) of peptide selection on MHC I molecules.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The TAPBPR K22-D35 loop lies at the interface with the MHC I peptide binding groove</title><p>Prior to the recent determination of the TAPBPR-MHC I crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thomas and Tampé, 2017</xref>), we docked our model of TAPBPR onto a previously determined structure of HLA-A2, using our mutagenesis data that identified critical regions in the TAPBPR-MHC I interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hermann et al., 2013</xref>). Our docking identified a region of TAPBPR that lies close to the peptide binding groove of MHC I, in the proximity of the F pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, dotted circle). This region contained a loop that differs between tapasin and TAPBPR. In tapasin, this loop appears to be rather short and is not sufficiently well ordered in the crystal structure to be visible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dong et al., 2009</xref>), while in TAPBPR this loop is significantly longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The two crystal structures of the TAPBPR-MHC I complex support our prediction regarding the arrangement of TAPBPR relative to MHC I, including this loop region being very near the F pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). However, the position and orientation of the loop in the structures is poorly defined. In the structure from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jiang et al. (2017)</xref>, this loop is not sufficiently well ordered to be modelled. In the structure from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thomas and Tampé (2017)</xref>, the loop has been modelled; however, the electron density into which it was built is not well defined: several side chains and even several of the backbone atoms do not fit the electron density well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). It is likely that alternative orientations of the loop would also satisfy the crystallographic data presented. Therefore, it is critically important to verify whether there is any functional role of this loop in peptide editing.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40126.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TAPBPR loop interactions with MHC I.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Model of TAPBPR (pink) docked onto MHC I (blue) and β2m (cyan) based on interaction studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hermann et al., 2013</xref>). (<bold>b</bold>) Top panel, illustration of the proximity of the TAPBPR loop region to the peptide binding groove (viewed from the top of complex shown in panel <bold>a</bold>).

More subtle mutations of this loop were designed based on the work by Springer and colleagues, who demonstrated that dipeptides carrying long hydrophobic residues are able to bind to the peptide binding groove of recombinant MHC I and enhance peptide dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Saini et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, we explored whether a leucine residue at position 30 of the mature TAPBPR protein, the only long hydrophobic residue within the entire loop, was involved in peptide exchange on MHC I. We created two TAPBPR variants in order to test this. First, we replaced the leucine with glycine in the TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> molecule (TAPBPR<sup>L30G</sup>). Second, we reintroduced leucine 30 into TAPBPR with the dysfunctional loop (TAPBPR<sup>ØG30L</sup>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Upon transduction into TAPBPR-deficient HeLaM cells (HeLaM-TAPBPR<sup>KO</sup>), steady state expression of all the TAPBPR loop mutants was similar to TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> and all variants interacted equally well with both MHC I and UGT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), suggesting the overall protein stability and structure of TAPBPR was not significantly affected by the changes to the loop.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40126.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Panel of TAPBPR loop mutants. </title><p>Residues altered are highlighted in red.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">TAPBPR variant</th><th valign="top">Loop sequence</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">WT</td><td valign="top">KDGAHRGALASSED</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Øloop</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="author-callout-style-a3">AAGGSGGGGSGGAA</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">L30G</td><td valign="top">KDGAHRGA<named-content content-type="author-callout-style-a3">G</named-content>ASSED</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">ØG30L</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="author-callout-style-a3">AAGGSGGG</named-content>L<named-content content-type="author-callout-style-a3">GGGAA</named-content></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The K22-D35 loop is essential for mediating peptide exchange on HLA-A*68:02</title><p>Recently, we have developed two novel assays which can be used to measure TAPBPR-mediated peptide exchange on MHC I molecules. The first assay established takes advantage of the small proportion of TAPBPR that escapes to the cell surface upon its over-expression in cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ilca et al., 2018</xref>). We have demonstrated that plasma membrane expressed wild-type TAPBPR efficiently mediates peptide exchange on cell surface HLA-A*68:02 molecules found on HeLaM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ilca et al., 2018</xref>). We have also previously shown that TAPBPR-mediated peptide exchange in this assay occurs directly on the cell surface, given that it works on cells incubated at 4°C, which inhibits membrane trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ilca et al., 2018</xref>). To initially explore the functional importance of the K22-D35 loop, we tested whether plasma membrane expressed TAPBPR<sup>Øloop</sup> was capable of mediating peptide exchange on HLA-A*68:02 to a similar extent as TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup>. When exploring the ability of TAPBPR to promote peptide association, we found plasma membrane expressed TAPBPR<sup>Øloop</sup> enhanced the binding of an exogenous fluorescent peptide specific for HLA-A*68:02 (YVVPFVAK*V) onto cells to a similar extent as TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). This may be due, in part, to TAPBPR enhancing the trafficking of associated, peptide-receptive MHC I with it through the secretory pathway. However, when we tested the ability of TAPBPR to mediate peptide dissociation (i.e. removal of the bound fluorescent peptide in the presence of an unlabelled competitor peptide) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), in contrast to the efficient exchange observed with TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup>, very little, if any, dissociation of fluorescent peptide was observed with TAPBPR<sup>Øloop</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–2e</xref>).

As observed above with TAPBPR<sup>Øloop</sup>, plasma membrane expressed TAPBPR<sup>L30G</sup> and TAPBPR<sup>ØG30L</sup> were able to promote the association of exogenous fluorescent peptide onto cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). However, when we explored the ability of TAPBPR<sup>L30G</sup> to mediate fluorescent peptide dissociation from HLA-A*68:02, we found that it was incapable of mediating efficient peptide dissociation in the presence of unlabelled competitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–2e</xref>). Strikingly, alteration of this single residue had the same effect on the function of TAPBPR as mutating the entire loop. The crucial role of L30 in mediating peptide dissociation was further supported with our observation that TAPBPR<sup>ØG30L</sup>, in which the leucine residue alone is restored into the dysfunctional TAPBPR<sup>Øloop</sup> molecule, transformed it into a functioning peptide exchange catalyst on HLA-A*68:02, albeit at reduced capability compared to TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–2e</xref>). While TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> efficiently promoted rapid peptide exchange at very low concentrations of competitor peptide, both TAPBPR<sup>Øloop</sup> and TAPBPR<sup>L30G</sup> were extremely inefficient at mediating peptide exchange on HLA-A*68:02 molecules, even in the presence of high concentrations of competitor peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).

Therefore, we can also use soluble TAPBPR as a second means to assay the ability of TAPBPR mutants to mediate efficient peptide exchange on MHC I. Using this approach, the majority of MHC I molecules that TAPBPR will have access to will be folded with bound peptides of relativity high affinity expressed on the surface of cells. The lumenal domains of the TAPBPR variants with C-terminal His-tags were purified using Ni-affinity chromatography from the culture supernatants of transfected 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Differential scanning fluorimetry revealed all TAPBPR loop variants had a similar melting temperature as TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), indicating the alterations made to the loop had not significantly affected protein folding and stability. Comparison of the ability of the soluble TAPBPR variants to mediate peptide exchange on HLA-A*68:02 molecules on HeLaM cells revealed that TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> was most efficient, followed by TAPBPR<sup>ØG30L</sup>, which exhibited ~33% peptide exchange activity relative to TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> (in the presence of 10 nM ETVSK*QSNV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>).

However, TAPBPR<sup>L30G</sup> and TAPBPR<sup>Øloop</sup> were unable to make productive interactions with surface expressed HLA-A*68:02 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).

As this inability of soluble TAPBPR<sup>Øloop</sup> and TAPBPR<sup>L30G</sup> to interact with MHC I contradicted our finding with their membrane-bound counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), we determined whether these soluble TAPBPR variants could bind to the total cellular MHC I from cell lysates in pull-down experiments. All soluble TAPBPR variants (with the exception of TAPBPR<sup>TN5</sup>) were capable of binding significant amounts of MHC I, although less MHC I was detected bound to TAPBPR<sup>L30G</sup> and TAPBPR<sup>Øloop</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). A major difference between surface MHC I on intact cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) and total cellular MHC I in detergent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) is the availability of peptide-receptive molecules. Therefore, we speculated that TAPBPR molecules with alterations to the loop are still able to bind to peptide-receptive MHC I but are unable to physically make MHC I peptide-deficient due to their inability to dissociate peptide. Consistent with this, incubation of cells at 26°C, which increases the expression of peptide-receptive MHC I on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ljunggren et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schumacher et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Garstka et al., 2015</xref>), resulted in the TAPBPR loop variants, but not TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup>, exhibiting increased binding to cells (Compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). While no significant change was observed in the ability of exogenous TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> to bind to cells incubated at the lower temperature, a ~ 7 fold increase in binding of TAPBPR<sup>L30G</sup> and TAPBPR<sup>Øloop</sup> was observed at 26°C compared to 37°C, and the binding of TAPBPR<sup>ØG30L</sup> increased by ~2.5 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).

As the data-points were not normally distributed, the Mann-Whitney test was used to find significant differences between the comparisons. The number of peptides used in the analysis is show below each graph. We feel it is very difficult to draw any definitive conclusions regarding the effect of mutating the loop on the affinity of the peptides bound to MHC I from this particular analysis. Firstly, the peptide numbers corresponding to each HLA is low, especially for the HLA-B15 assigned peptides from cells expressing the TAPBPR loop mutant. This questions whether the significance observed is reliable, particularly for HLA-B15. Secondly, our experimental design was set up to explore whether there was a global change in peptide repertoire upon mutation of the TAPBPR loop. Thus, technical limitations regarding the need to assign peptides to particular MHC I (by applying thresholds or cut-offs to determine which peptide was bound to which MHC I) greatly reduce the ability to detect peptides exhibiting low affinity for a particular MHC I. Other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Garstka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kanaseki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nagarajan et al., 2016</xref>), exploring the affinity of peptides by immunopeptidomics use cells expressing only one MHC I. Therefore, the identified peptides do not need to be assigned to MHC I, thus improving the ability to see reliable changes (including subtle changes) in anchors and affinity. A third consideration is that trypsination of cells may be cause the loss of low-affinity peptide from MHC I molecules. One interesting observation from this analysis was the affinity of HLA-A*68:02 assigned peptides between dataset 1 and dataset two for cells expressing TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> appeared to increase. Thus hinting that surface expressed TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> may dissociate low-affinity peptide from HLA-A*68:02. However, to conclude, from these particular datasets, we are unable to address whether there is any change in affinity of MHC I bound peptides upon mutation of the TAPBPR loop. Improvement in experimental design will address this in the future.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40126-fig5-figsupp4-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>Given the ability of surface expressed TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup>, but not of TAPBPR<sup>Øloop</sup>, to mediate peptide dissociation from surface MHC I molecules, as identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, we performed an additional experiment in which the cells were incubated at 37°C in media after harvesting to permit the surface expressed TAPBPR (~5% of the total TAPBPR pool in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ilca et al., 2018</xref>]) to perform peptide dissociation/exchange on surface expressed MHC I molecules, prior to performing immunopeptidomic analysis. While this experiment confirmed the significant changes in the peptide repertoire presented on MHC I upon mutation of the TAPBPR loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e and f</xref>), it also surprisingly revealed a large effect on the peptides assignable to HLA-A*68:02 between cells expressing TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> and TAPBPR<sup>Øloop</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g and h</xref>). Based on a presence/absence approach, only 29% in TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> were now assignable to HLA-A*68:02, compared to 37% for cell expressing TAPBPR<sup>Øloop</sup>-expressing cells (which was similar to the results found when the immunopeptidomics was performed immediately after cell harvesting [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>]). Similarly, abundance analysis revealed &gt;80% of the up-modulated peptides in TAPBPR<sup>Øloop</sup>-expressing cells belonged to HLA-A*68:02, compared to only ~20% of the up-modulated peptides in TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>). In keeping with this, we observed similar alterations in HLA-A*68:02-assignable peptides when the leucine residue was restored into the dysfunctional loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g and h</xref>), as the ones observed for TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup>. This suggests that TAPBPR with a functional loop is preferentially stripping a proportion of peptides from HLA-A*68:02 molecules, but not from the HLA-B or -C molecules found on HeLaM cells. To explore this further, we compared the ability of soluble TAPBPR to bind to soluble heterotrimeric HLA-A*68:02, -B*15:03 or -C*12:03 molecules coupled to beads. This revealed a strong interaction between TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> and HLA-A*68:02 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). However, soluble TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> failed to bind to heterotrimeric HLA-B*15:03 and –C*12:03 molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). This preferential association of TAPBPR with peptide-loaded HLA-A*68:02 over the other MHC I found in HeLaM cells likely explains why we only observe a loss of HLA-A*68:02 peptides in cells expressing TAPBPR with a functional loop. Interestingly, this analysis of soluble HLA molecules coupled on beads also confirmed the considerable reduction in binding of TAPBPR to HLA-A*68:02 upon mutation of the loop (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Taken together, this data demonstrates that the loop is involved in selecting MHC I peptides within cells and highlights the importance of leucine 30 in the peptide selection process, particularly for HLA-A*68:02 molecules.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>L30 enables TAPBPR to mediate peptide exchange on MHC I molecules that accommodate hydrophobic amino acids in their F pocket</title><p>Given the proximity of the TAPBPR loop to the F pocket of MHC I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and that the L30 residue of TAPBPR was both necessary and sufficient for efficient peptide exchange on HLA-A*68:02 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 and 3</xref>), we hypothesised that the TAPBPR loop facilitates peptide dissociation by binding into the F pocket, thereby competing with the C-terminus of the peptide. If so, this competitive binding would only be possible for MHC I molecules that could accommodate leucine or similar hydrophobic residues in the F pocket. With this in mind, we explored the importance of the TAPBPR K22-D35 loop in mediating peptide exchange on two other MHC I molecules, HLA-A*02:01 and H-2K<sup>b</sup>, which naturally accommodate hydrophobic amino acids in their F pocket like HLA-A*68:02. Compared to HLA-A*68:02, HLA-A*02:01 accommodates very similar anchor residues in both B and F pockets, whereas H-2K<sup>b</sup> has a completely different binding motif, with the exception that it binds a similar anchor residue in the F pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Thus, given that both HLA-A*02:01 and H-2K<sup>b</sup> could potentially accommodate L30 of the TAPBPR loop in their F-pocket, we predicted TAPBPR-mediated peptide editing on these two additional MHC I would also be dependent on L30.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40126.027</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>F pocket specificity for hydrophobic residues influences the ability of TAPBPR to edit peptides in a loop-dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Comparison of the A-F pocket specificities of the HLA-A*68:02, HLA-A*02:01, H-2K<sup>b</sup> and HLA-A*68:01 peptide binding grooves.

For example, the Øloop, L30G, and ØG30L variants exhibited ~23%, 32% and 54% activity relative to TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup>, respectively, when measuring NLVPK*VATV binding onto HLA-A2 introduced into HeLaM-HLA-ABC<sup>KO</sup> cells by transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). We observed similar trends using another HLA-A2 binding peptide, YLLEK*LWRL, on this cell line, as well as when testing peptide binding to HLA-A2 molecules expressed on MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). For SIINKEK*L binding to H-2K<sup>b</sup> expressed on EL4 cells, the Øloop, L30G, and ØG30L variants exhibited ~30%, 31%, 85% activity relative to TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Thus, although TAPBPR can still mediate peptide exchange on HLA-A2 and H-2K<sup>b</sup> in the absence of the loop to some extent, the L30 residue in the K22-D35 loop of human TAPBPR plays a critical role in promoting efficient peptide exchange on HLA-A*68:02, HLA-A2 and H-2K<sup>b</sup>. The shared dependency on L30 to enable TAPBPR to efficiently mediate peptide exchange on both H-2K<sup>b</sup> and HLA-A*68:02 is remarkable, considering the low degree of similarity between these two MHC I, both in their amino acid sequences and in their binding motifs. However, the key shared feature between these MHC I is that both accommodate hydrophobic residues in their F pocket.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>TAPBPR cannot use the loop to efficiently mediate peptide exchange on MHC I molecules with F pocket specificities for non-hydrophobic amino acids</title><p>We next tested the role of the TAPBPR loop in catalysing peptide exchange on an MHC I molecule that does not accommodate a hydrophobic residue in its F pocket. In order to only explore the contributing role of the F pocket, with minimal other polymorphisms, we chose HLA-A*68:01, since it only differs from HLA-A*68:02 by five amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Niu et al., 2013</xref>). Most of the differences between these two HLA are residues dictating the specificity of the F pocket for the C-terminal peptide anchor residue. Hence, while both molecules have a similar anchor residue in their B pocket, the F pocket of HLA-A*68:02 accommodates an aliphatic residue, whereas the F pocket of HLA-A*68:01 accommodates a basic residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Niu et al., 2013</xref>). Strikingly, in contrast to the three MHC I molecules tested previously (which all bind hydrophobic residues in their F pocket), there was a significant impairment in the ability of TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> to load peptides onto HLA-A*68:01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b and c</xref>). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the ability of TAPBPR to exchange peptides on HLA-A*68:01 upon mutation of the loop, with the different loop variants all exhibiting a similar ability as soluble TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> to load the fluorescent peptide KTGGPIYK*R onto HLA-A*68:01 expressed on HeLaM-HLA-ABC<sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b and c</xref>). Thus, in contrast to HLA-A*68:02, which is extremely receptive to TAPBPR-mediated peptide exchange in a loop-dependent manner, HLA-A*68:01 is significantly less responsive to TAPBPR-mediated peptide exchange, which only occurs in a loop-independent manner. Therefore, the five amino acid differences between these two HLA molecules, three of which are around the F pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>), strongly influence the receptivity of these two MHC I molecules to TAPBPR-mediated peptide exchange, the efficiency of which appears to be strongly influenced by the ability of the K22-D35 loop (specifically L30) to interact with the peptide binding groove. These findings support the concept that the L30 residue of TAPBPR is capable of binding into the F pocket of MHC I in order promote the dissociation of the bound peptide in a competitive manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Mutation of residue 116 in the MHC I F pocket alters TAPBPR binding</title><p>Our data thus far is consistent with the L30 residue of the TAPBPR loop binding to the F pocket of MHC I molecules which accommodate hydrophobic residues. One residue that differs between HLA-A*68:02 and -A*68:01 and was reported to be crucial in determining the F pocket specificity of MHC I for peptide residues is the one on position 116 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sidney et al., 2008</xref>). The impact of residue 116 on the F pocket architecture is well highlighted in the crystal structures of peptide-bound HLA-A*68:02 and HLA-A*68:01 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Niu et al., 2013</xref>). Namely, HLA-A*68:02 contains a tyrosine on position 116, whereas HLA-A*68:01 has an aspartate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). As captured in the two structures, D116 of HLA-A*68:01 forms strong dipole interactions with both residue R114 of the groove and with the arginine on position 9 of the peptide, determining a strong preference of the HLA-A*68:01 F pocket for basic anchor residues. In contrast, residue Y116 of HLA-A*68:02 does not form any interaction with H114, keeping the hydrophobic patches of the F pocket in an open conformation, which allows it to accommodate hydrophobic peptide residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). We believe that this is the reason why the L30 residue of the TAPBPR loop has access to the F pocket of HLA-A*68:02, but not to the one of HLA-A*68:01.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40126.029</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Mutation of the MHC I F pocket alters TAPBPR-mediated peptide editing.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) PyMOL images of the binding grooves of HLA-A*68:02 (PDB ID 4HX1) and -A*68:01 (PDB ID 4HWZ), with residues found at position 116 and 114 highlighted. (<bold>b</bold>) Histograms show the surface expression of HLA-A*68:02<sup>WT</sup>, -A*68:02<sup>Y116D</sup>, -A*68:01<sup>WT</sup> and -A*68:01<sup>D116Y</sup>, detected using W6/32, when expressed in HeLa-M-HLA-ABC<sup>KO</sup> cells.

Thus, we interrogated the ability of these molecules to bind both the HLA-A*68:02-specific peptide ETVSK*QSNV, as well as the HLA-A*68:01-specific peptide KTGGPIYK*R, in the presence or absence of soluble TAPBPR.

Nonetheless, it is interesting that although low levels of TAPBPR binding are observed to both HLA-A*68:02<sup>Y116D</sup> and HLA-A*68:01<sup>WT</sup>, TAPBPR is still capable of mediating peptide exchange on these molecule (albeit to a significantly lower extent as compared to their Y116-containing counterparts) and of loading the correct peptide based on their F pocket anchor.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Given the discordance regarding the proximity of the TAPBPR loop in relation to the MHC I peptide binding groove in the recently captured structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thomas and Tampé, 2017</xref>), and the lack of functional evidence to support any role for this loop, it was vital to directly determine whether this loop contributed at all to peptide exchange. Here, we reveal that upon mutation of the K22-D35 loop, TAPBPR retains binding to MHC I but loses its ability to effectively mediate peptide dissociation. Thus, our work provides compelling evidence that this loop region is critical for TAPBPR to mediate efficient peptide exchange and consequently peptide selection on MHC I molecules. We establish that the leucine residue in the loop is both necessary and sufficient for TAPBPR to promote peptide dissociation from both human and mouse MHC I molecules, which all typically accommodate a hydrophobic amino acid in their F pocket. Moreover, our findings also demonstrate that the ability of TAPBPR to exchange peptides is severely impaired on MHC I molecules whose F pockets accommodate charged residues. Furthermore, TAPBPR-mediated peptide editing in such scenarios occurs in a loop-independent manner. The differences identified here in the loop-dependency for TAPBPR-mediated editing amongst the various MHC I molecules are striking, especially when comparing HLA-A*68:02 with HLA-A*68:01, which only differ from each other by five amino acids, three of which are located around the F pocket. The extreme differences between these two HLA-A*68 molecules in regard to their susceptibility to TAPBPR-mediated peptide exchange has a remarkable resemblance to the findings reported for HLA-B44 molecules in regard to their dependency on tapasin for optimal peptide selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Williams et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Garstka et al., 2011</xref>). Particularly striking is that residue 116 of HLA I, which severely impacts both the specificity and architecture of the F pocket, seems to play a key role in allowing efficient binding of TAPBPR to HLA molecules.</p><p>Although mutation of the loop severely impairs the capacity of TAPBPR to dissociate peptides from MHC I, it seems that TAPBPR is still able, though to a considerably lower extent, to perform this function independently of the loop, across MHC I molecules with different binding motifs. This suggests that there are additional mechanisms by which TAPBPR is capable of mediating peptide exchange on MHC I. These may involve other regions of TAPBPR (for example the jack hairpin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thomas and Tampé, 2017</xref>]) and/or could take place according to the recently proposed model of negative allosteric release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McShan et al., 2018</xref>). Chaperone-mediated peptide editing in such loop-independent scenarios may occur in a more generic and less efficient manner as compared to loop-dependent situations, and may be influenced mainly by the relative stability of individual peptide:MHC I complexes. Thus, one can envisage that TAPBPR can associate with MHC I molecules containing peptides that are intrinsically prone to dissociation (i.e. sub-optimally loaded peptide) in a loop-independent manner.</p><p>The functional evidence provided here highlights that the process of peptide editing is complex, multifaceted and is likely to involve dynamic movements of the loop region of TAPBPR as it probes the contents of the MHC I peptide binding groove. Our findings therefore help to explain the ambiguities in the loop conformation identified between the two solved crystal structures. Indeed, our data regarding the critical role of different residues in the MHC I groove to alter peptide exchange efficiency by TAPBPR may implicate an intrinsic difference in the ability of the specific mouse MHC I molecules crystallised with TAPBPR to accommodate hydrophobic residues in their F pocket. This may be of particular importance in the structure where modifications were made to H-2D<sup>d</sup> to help stabilise it in a peptide-receptive form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>), which may have occluded the ability of the loop to insert into the F pocket.</p><p>Our findings are supportive of the following molecular mechanism for peptide exchange by TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). When MHC I enters a state in which the bound peptide partially dissociates (i.e. 'breathes') at the C-terminus from the F pocket, TAPBPR binds to the MHC I groove, at this point in a transient manner, inserting its 22–35 loop into the groove. The leucine 30 residue of the TAPBPR loop binds into the F pocket of the groove, inhibiting the reassociation of the C-terminal anchor residue of the peptide, if hydrophobic, in a competitive manner. The resulting high-free energy intermediate allows TAPBPR to force the MHC I into a conformation to which it can bind more stably, pulling the α2–1 region of the peptide binding groove away from the peptide, as captured in the crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thomas and Tampé, 2017</xref>). This further prevents the rebinding of the peptide to the groove and thus promotes complete peptide dissociation. Given its stable interaction with peptide-receptive MHC I molecules, TAPBPR prevents these empty MHC I molecules from ‘crashing’ and we speculate that this consequently allows binding of incoming peptides with affinities for MHC I above the threshold required to outcompete TAPBPR. This final step may share similar features with the tug-of-war model that was previously proposed for tapasin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fisette et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40126.031</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of the peptide exchange mechanism of TAPBPR on MHC class I.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40126-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Intriguingly, our data suggests that the loop enables TAPBPR to dissociate peptides with a relatively high affinity for MHC I. This ability of TAPBPR to use its loop to lever peptide out of the MHC I binding groove is consistent with TAPBPR performing peptide editing after tapasin. The identification here of the critical importance of the leucine residue in the TAPBPR loop raises interesting questions regarding the different properties of the TAPBPR and tapasin loops and how these mediate step-wise editing to ensure optimal peptide loading of MHC I.</p><p>We have recently shown that both plasma membrane-targeted TAPBPR and exogenous soluble TAPBPR can be used to display immunogenic peptides on cell surface MHC I molecules, and, consequently, induce T-cell-mediated killing of target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ilca et al., 2018</xref>). This observation presents previously unappreciated translational opportunities for utilising TAPBPR as a future immunotherapeutic. For example, TAPBPR could potentially be used to load immunogenic peptides onto tumours to target them from recognition by cytotoxic T cells. Utilising TAPBPR in this manner may promote tumour immunogenicity and increase the clinical efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors when used in combination. Here, we have demonstrated the essential role of the TAPBPR loop in the loading of exogenous peptides onto cell surface MHC I molecules and highlight the critical importance of incorporating this structural motif of TAPBPR into compounds developed with a therapeutic intent. Thus, innovative design of the loop may help tailor TAPBPR to specific MHC I molecules and/or alter the properties of the immunogenic peptides loaded by TAPBPR. For example, insight regarding the loop may allow us to tailor TAPBPR to MHC I molecules on which the naturally occurring loop does not work. Furthermore, we may also be able to improve peptide binding on MHC I molecules on which TAPBPR is already able to work on. Consequently, insight into the functional residues of the loop could expand the range of patients that may be responsive to TAPBPR-based therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Docking of TAPBPR with MHC I</title><p>Dockings of TAPBPR with MHC I were carried out prior to the recent structure determination of the TAPBPR:MHC I complex structures.

In particular, the authors highlight a hydrophobic residue in this loop as being important in peptide exchange for MHC class I proteins with a hydrophobic F pocket.

The authors show that this loop has a major effect on the efficiency of peptide editing. In particular, they implicate a hydrophobic residue (L30) in this loop. Functional data suggest that this hydrophobic residue binds in the F pocket of certain MHC class I proteins and thereby directly competes with the peptide C-terminus.</p><p>1) One of the major conclusions is that residue L30 of the TAPBPR loops binds in the F pocket of MHC class I proteins. While the data are consistent with this conclusion, it is important to directly prove this point.

The opposite result would be expected based on the other functional data. Is this because peptide binding to HLA-B*15:03 and/or HLA-C*12:03 is even more severely affected?</p><p>3) All experiments were performed with cell surfaced expressed MHC class I/peptide complexes. However, the major site of peptide editing by TAPBPR is thought to be the ER. It would therefore be useful to assess the effect of TAPBPR with soluble MHC class I/peptide complexes. Soluble TAPBPR is already available.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Ilca and colleagues provide insights into the molecular mechanism by which TAPBPR mediates exchange of peptides within the MHC I cargo. TAPBPR is a second peptide editor that functions independently of the peptide-loading complex in the endoplasmic reticulum. However the molecular mechanism by which TAPBPR causes exchange of the peptide bound to MHC I is unknown.</p><p>Based upon the crystal structure of TAPBPR (Thomas and Tampe, 2011), the authors here analyzed the potential functional significance of a 14 residue (aa 22-35) loop in this molecule. They first replaced all residues in this loop with either glycine, alanine or serine to generate a &quot;functionless&quot; loop (TAPBPRØloop). Additionally they generated two mutants one of WT TAPBPR with the Leu30Gly mutation and another of the TAPBPRØloop in which the Leu residue was reinserted in position 30 (TAPBPR0G30L). DNA constructs encoding each of these molecules when transfected in HeLa cells (lacking endogenous TAPBPR) were similarly expressed and co-immunoprecipitated with both MHC I and the UGT1.</p><p>Analysis of the MHC associated peptides by mass spectrometry showed large changes in the peptide repertoire generated in cells expressing WT TAPBPR versus the Øloop mutant as well as the 0G30L mutant versus WT TAPBPR. Interestingly, the changes in the peptide repertoire were particularly marked for HLA*A68 relative to other HLA allotypes. This is an interesting result that suggests that TAPBPR could have selective effects on some but not other MHC I isotypes.</p><p>Further, using novel peptide exchange assays developed earlier by this group, the authors showed that the absence of the loop residues (TAPBPRØloop) rendered the molecule non-functional as did the replacement L30G in WT TAPBPR. This loss of peptide exchange activity was substantially although not completely restored by substitution G30L in the TAPBPRØloop mutant.</p><p>Altogether, the authors present a nice story with compelling data to support their conclusions. Their model to explaining how TAPBPR causes weakly bound peptides to be dissociated from the MHC I molecule also looks reasonable. However, how the incoming peptide would get into the MHC I groove remains unexplained.</p><p>The paper is well written and most of the ideas come through clearly. I would however, have liked the authors to elaborate some more on the potential for therapeutic uses of their findings. As such the ending of the Discussion is rather vague.</p><p>The specific sequences identified by mass spectrometry and summarized in Figure 2 should be deposited in a publicly available database.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Ilca and colleagues study the role of a loop extending from the TAPBPR peptide editor into the F pocket of MHC class I molecules. They present clear evidence for a critical and specific role of a Leu in the loop for editing of peptides with hydrophobic C-terminal residues. Globally the data is convincing and represents a significant progress in our understanding of peptide editing by TAPBPR.</p><p>However, I am not convinced with respect to the broad validity of the conclusions. Moreover, some problematic technical issues and data interpretations should be addressed.</p><p>- The immunopeptidomics data are apparently based on a single experiment with 5 technical replicates. Examining Figure 5—figure supplement 1, only about 57% of peptides are found in 4/5 or 5/5 replicates for WT, and about 38% for G30L. Considering this level of reproducibility for technical replicates, biological replicates can be expected to be even less reproducible. Relatively low reproducibility (which I believe is not unusual for MS data) also raises doubt about the data on relative peptide amounts. Showing at least one example of reproducibility for biological replicates would make the immunopeptidomics data more convincing.</p><p>- Together with data shown later in the paper, the peptidomics data are interpreted to indicate a specific effect of TAPBPR on peptides with hydrophobic C-terminals. However, checking the peptide binding motifs of B*15:03 and C*12:03, it turns out that both also bind peptides with hydrophobic C-terminals: Tyr/Phe for B*15:03, Leu/Met/Val/Phe for C*12:03. Is there any evidence, for example from modeling, that TAPBPR acts preferentially on aliphatic not aromatic hydrophobic C-terminals, explaining the opposite effect on B*15:03 (which would exclude many peptides from editing given the high frequency of class I ligands with Tyr/Phe)? Concerning the opposite effect on C*12:03 versus A*68:02, unless the authors have a good explanation for it, I would expect a cautious remark in the Discussion mentioning that the rules remain to be understood and might include other parameters than hydrophobicity.</p><p>- The fact that A*68:02, later shown to be particularly susceptible to editing by TAPBPR, acquires many more ligands in its absence could be seen as a bit counter-intuitive – why does A*68:02 present many peptides in larger amounts in the absence of TAPBPR? One explanation would be that these peptides have low affinity and would therefore be chased in its presence. This should be easy enough to check using the NetMHC algorithm used by the authors.</p><p>- Although the authors might show that in another paper (PNAS in revision?), the assumption that over-expressed membrane bound or exogenously added soluble TAPBPR acts directly on the plasma membrane would require some evidence. Class I molecules are known to recycle in HeLa cells and TAPBPR might well recycle with them, mediating intracellular peptide exchange. Incubations are performed for 15min at 37°C, sufficient time for recycling. Does soluble TAPBPR have an effect at low temperature?</p><p>- The authors conclude that the mutants bind to empty class I, based on an experiment in which they add TAPBPR to Triton lysates of cells. I feel that this conclusion would be more convincing if they used TAP ko cells for this demonstration. TAP ko cells express a majority of poorly loaded or &quot;empty&quot; class I molecules at the surface at 26°C. If the TAPBPR mutants indeed bind only to empty class I, then pre-incubating TAP ko cells at 26°C in the presence of high affinity peptides should abolish their interaction with class I.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40126.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Strengthening of immunopeptidomics data with biological replicates.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included data on two additional biological replicates for TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> TAPBPR<sup>Øloop</sup> and TAPBPR<sup>ØloopG30L</sup>.

Therefore, the apparent preference of TAPBPR to influence the peptide repertoire on HLA-A*68:02, and not the two other HLA molecules expressed in HeLa B*15:03 and C*12:03, seems to be related to the intrinsic ability of TAPBPR to bind to HLA molecule, in addition to the specificity of the F pocket for hydrophobic residues</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Studying whether TAPBPR indeed mediates peptide exchange at the cell surface in their assays or in an intracellular recycling compartment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for raising this important point and apologies for not making this obvious in our first draft of the manuscript. We have already extensively investigated this in our now recently published PNAS paper which demonstrates that surprising TAPBPR can mediate peptide even on cells incubated at 4<sup>o</sup>C, which inhibits intracellular recycling. This demonstrates that TAPBPR-mediated peptide exchange occurs directly on the cell surface. Now that the manuscript demonstrating this is published, we have highlighted this key point in the text in this manuscript. We also include similar data at 4<sup>o</sup>C for both TAPBPR-WT and the loop mutants in this manuscript, which can be found in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Proving that L30 of TAPBPR indeed binds in the F pocket.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now investigated this extensively and the data can be found in a new figure (new Figure 7). To test this, we introduced specific mutations to the F pocket of both HLA-A*68:02 and HLA-A*68:01. The data demonstrate that the residue found at position 116 of HLA I molecules is critical for allowing TAPBPR binding.

To explore this, we have compared the ability of TAPBPR to bind to both WT HLA-A*68:02 and HLA-A*68:01 and to their F pocket mutant counterparts (created by altering residue 116). The mutation of residue 116 changed F pocket specificity of both these MHC I molecules and also significantly altered the ability of TAPBPR to bind to them. More specifically, replacing residue 116 in A*68:02 with the one of A*68:01 reduced the ability of TAPBPR to bind and correspondingly, replacing residue 116 in A*68:01 with the one of A*68:02 increased the ability of TAPBPR to bind. This new data can be found in the new Figure 7. We then confirmed the importance of this residue for TAPBPR binding on a different MHC I molecule, HLA-A2. This can be found in figure 7—figure supplement 1. This new data helps highlight the critical importance of the F pocket in TAPBPR binding and peptide exchange.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the mass spec experiment shown in Figure 2, the representation of HLA-A*68:02 peptides is greatly increased in the most severe loop mutant.

Thus, the increase in HLA-A*68:02 assignable peptide upon mutation of the loop is unlikely to be due to severe effect on HLA-B15:03 and C*12:03. Upon reflection of both yours and reviewer 3’s comment that the increase representation of HLA-A*68:02 is counter intuitive, we examined precisely how the cell were prepared for immunopeptidomic analysis. For the original dataset, we allowed the HeLaM cells to recover from trypsination by incubating them at 37<sup>o</sup>C in media, before freezing them for shipping for Immunopeptidomic analysis. Given that we have established that the small pool of surface TAPBPR is functional, we wondered whether the observed increase in HLA-A*68:02 assignable peptides was actually due to TAPBPR with a functional loop (i.e. TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> and TAPBPR<sup>ØloopG30L</sup>) stripping HLA-A*68:02 peptides from surface expressed MHC I. To explore this, we performed immunopeptidomic analysis on cells immediately after trypsination without the 37<sup>o</sup>C recovery step. While this additional dataset confirmed that mutation of the loop has a significant effect on the peptide repertoire presented, the peptides assignable to HLA-A*68:02 for TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> and TAPBPR<sup>ØloopG30L</sup> were now normalised. Thus, the observed increase in peptides assignable to HLA-A*68:02 for TAPBPR<sup>Øloop</sup> expressing cells is not due a specific influence of this mutation on MHC I. Rather, in the original dataset (and in an additional biological repeat provided) the observed effect is due to TAPBPR with a functional loop stripping peptides from HLA-A*68:02 molecules. The loss in the ability of TAPBPR to dissociate peptides upon mutation of the loop explains the increased number of peptides assigned to HLA-A*68:02 for the Øloop mutant, as compared to both WT TAPBPR and the ØG30L mutant.</p><p>Note: We have rearranged the figure now in our manuscript and the immunopeptidomic data have moved further down the paper and can now be found in Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) All experiments were performed with cell surfaced expressed MHC class I/peptide complexes. However, the major site of peptide editing by TAPBPR is thought to be the ER. It would therefore be useful to assess the effect of TAPBPR with soluble MHC class I/peptide complexes. Soluble TAPBPR is already available.</p></disp-quote><p>In an attempt to address this point in the allocated time frame, we have compared the ability of both TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> and TAPBPR lacking a function loop to bind to soluble peptide-bound HLA-A*68:02, B*15:03 and C*12:03, coupled to beads. This revealed TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> binds strongly to HLA-A*68:02, but not to HLA-B*15:03 or C*12:03. Furthermore, this analysis reveals the decreased ability of TAPBPR to bind to HLA-A*68:02 upon mutation of the loop, which further confirms our other findings in the manuscript.</p><p>We agree that our assays test the ability of TAPBPR to mediate peptide exchange in an atypical location. However, the advantage of our systems, rather than using soluble MHC I, which has been refolded in bacteria, is that the MHC I (and also TAPBPR in one of our two assays) is membrane bound and also glycosylated, which reflects the MHC class I found in the ER more closely than using soluble MHC I. While our systems are not perfect and may not truly reflect what occurs in the ER, we feel these assays are superior to using soluble MHC I expressed in bacteria and refolded with a single peptide.</p><p>The immunopeptidomic analysis included reflects the effect of mutating the TAPBPR loop more widely on the whole cellular pool of MHC I. 95% of the TAPBPR:MHC I interactions in these experiments occurs in the ER.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] All together, the authors present a nice story with compelling data to support their conclusions. Their model to explaining how TAPBPR causes weakly bound peptides to be dissociated from the MHC I molecule also looks reasonable. However, how the incoming peptide would get into the MHC I groove remains unexplained.</p><p>The paper is well written and most of the ideas come through clearly. I would however, have liked the authors to elaborate some more on the potential for therapeutic uses of their findings.

In light of your comments we have included some additional text in the Discussion regarding how we envisage incoming peptide may get into the MHC I groove. Furthermore, we have attempted to strengthen the Discussion section regarding how knowledge of the functional importance of the loop prove insightful for therapeutic use. Finally, the specific sequence of the peptides identified by mass spectrometry have been deposited in a publicly available database.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Ilca and colleagues study the role of a loop extending from the TAPBPR peptide editor into the F pocket of MHC class I molecules. They present clear evidence for a critical and specific role of a Leu in the loop for editing of peptides with hydrophobic C-terminal residues. Globally the data is convincing and represents a significant progress in our understanding of peptide editing by TAPBPR.</p><p>However, I am not convinced with respect to the broad validity of the conclusions. Moreover, some problematic technical issues and data interpretations should be addressed.</p><p>- The immunopeptidomics data are apparently based on a single experiment with 5 technical replicates. Examining Figure 5—figure supplement 1, only about 57% of peptides are found in 4/5 or 5/5 replicates for WT, and about 38% for G30L. Considering this level of reproducibility for technical replicates, biological replicates can be expected to be even less reproducible. Relatively low reproducibility (which I believe is not unusual for MS data) also raises doubt about the data on relative peptide amounts. Showing at least one example of reproducibility for biological replicates would make the immunopeptidomics data more convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included data on two additional biological replicates for TAPBPRWT, TAPBPRØloop and TAPBPRØloopG30L. Furthermore, we have provided data for an additional TAPBPR loop mutant in which residues A29-D35 were mutant. The new data provided confirm that there is a significant change in peptide repertoire upon mutation of the loop.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Together with data shown later in the paper, the peptidomics data are interpreted to indicate a specific effect of TAPBPR on peptides with hydrophobic C-terminals. However, checking the peptide binding motifs of B*15:03 and C*12:03, it turns out that both also bind peptides with hydrophobic C-terminals: Tyr/Phe for B*15:03, Leu/Met/Val/Phe for C*12:03. Is there any evidence, for example from modeling, that TAPBPR acts preferentially on aliphatic not aromatic hydrophobic C-terminals, explaining the opposite effect on B*15:03 (which would exclude many peptides from editing given the high frequency of class I ligands with Tyr/Phe)? Concerning the opposite effect on C*12:03 versus A*68:02, unless the authors have a good explanation for it, I would expect a cautious remark in the Discussion mentioning that the rules remain to be understood and might include other parameters than hydrophobicity.</p></disp-quote><p>Note: we have now rearranged the figures and the immunopeptidomic data can be found in Figure 5. We have included data on the ability of TAPBPR to bind to the individual HLA molecules found in HeLa (Figure 5—source data 1). This reveals TAPBPR binds well to HLA-A*68:02 but does not bind to HLA-B*15:03 or C*12:03. Thus, the reason we observe significant effects on HLA-A*68:02 but not the other HLA in HeLa can be explained by the ability of TAPBPR to bind to these individual HLA I molecules. In other words, we claim that while the F pocket specificity for hydrophobic residues is essential for TAPBPR function on MHC I molecules, not all MHC I molecules carrying a hydrophobic F pocket will interact well with TAPBPR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The fact that A*68:02, later shown to be particularly susceptible to editing by TAPBPR, acquires many more ligands in its absence could be seen as a bit counter-intuitive – why does A*68:02 present many peptides in larger amounts in the absence of TAPBPR? One explanation would be that these peptides have low affinity and would therefore be chased in its presence. This should be easy enough to check using the NetMHC algorithm used by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon reflection of your comment, we agree that this data is counter-intuitive.</p><p>Thus, as mention in our response to reviewer 1, we examined whether incubation of the cells for 30 min at 37<sup>o</sup>C in media after trypsination to allow them to recover was influencing the results for HLA-A*68:02, permitting functional TAPBPR (i.e. TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> and TAPBPR<sup>ØloopG30L</sup>) to strip peptides specifically from surface expressed HLA-A*68:02. When immunopeptidomic analysis was performed on cells immediately after trypsination without the 37<sup>o</sup>C recovery step, the peptides assignable to HLA-A*68:02 for TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> and TAPBPR<sup>ØloopG30L</sup> were now normalised. This data can be found in Figure 5. Thus, the loss in the ability of TAPBPR to dissociate peptides upon mutation of the loop explains the increased number of peptides assigned to HLA-A*68:02 for the Øloop mutant, as compared to both WT TAPBPR and the ØG30L mutant.</p><p>As suggested, we have performed NetMHC analysis on the peptides. This analysis can be found in Figure 5—figure supplement 4. However, we failed to see any reliable change in affinity of peptides. This is most likely due to limitations in our experimental design which was set up to explore whether there was global effects on mutation of the loop on MHC I peptide presentation, rather than to explore peptide affinity. Thus, in our experimental set up we need to assign peptides to one of the three MHC class I molecules found in HeLaM cells, which requires applying thresholds and cut-offs which will exclude low affinity peptides. In the future the effects of mutating the TAPBPR loop on MHC I peptide affinity could be explored by using cells expressing a single MHC I molecule.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Although the authors might show that in another paper (PNAS in revision?), the assumption that over-expressed membrane bound or exogenously added soluble TAPBPR acts directly on the plasma membrane would require some evidence. Class I molecules are known to recycle in HeLa cells and TAPBPR might well recycle with them, mediating intracellular peptide exchange. Incubations are performed for 15min at 37°C, sufficient time for recycling. Does soluble TAPBPR have an effect at low temperature?</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously explored this in our manuscript recently published in PNAS, which unfortunately was not available to you at the time of your review of this manuscript. We have found that TAPBPR can indeed mediate peptide exchange on cells incubated at 4<sup>o</sup>C, which inhibits membrane trafficking.</p><p>We have included some text in the Results to highlight that we have previously shown that TAPBPR edits peptides on cell surface MHC I molecules. Furthermore, we have also included some data to show that we have performed similar experiments at 4<sup>o</sup>C for both TAPBPR-WT as well as the loop mutants. This can be found in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors conclude that the mutants bind to empty class I, based on an experiment in which they add TAPBPR to Triton lysates of cells. I feel that this conclusion would be more convincing if they used TAP ko cells for this demonstration. TAP ko cells express a majority of poorly loaded or &quot;empty&quot; class I molecules at the surface at 26°C. If the TAPBPR mutants indeed bind only to empty class I, then pre-incubating TAP ko cells at 26°C in the presence of high affinity peptides should abolish their interaction with class I.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the variant of requested experiment which we believe helps to address the point you have raised here. We did not use T2 cells, instead we used the HeLaM-HLA-ABC<sup>KO</sup> overexpressing HLA-A*68:02 incubated -/+ high affinity peptide prior to incubation with soluble TAPBPR. Indeed, this revealed that pre-incubation with a high affinity peptide blocked the ability of TAPBPR<sup>ØLoop</sup> to bind to the cells, but had no significant effect on the ability of TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> to bind to cells. This new data can be found in Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
